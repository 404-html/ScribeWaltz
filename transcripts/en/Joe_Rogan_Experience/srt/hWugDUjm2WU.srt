1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,790
I'll send you a link for
four. Here we go. Three dos.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,660
Uno. Yes, and we're live ladies champion.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,340
Brandon shot with the official
Comedy Store Jersey on.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,060
That's a real comedy store Hoodie.
That's the real shit. It's the real deal.

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm like a doormat. I looked
like a doorman. Yeah, I wear
those shits all the time.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,630
I love them. Yeah, me too. I know.

7
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:26,040
It's only got one mother fucking head of
security if you're working in the door.

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,640
You know what I mean? To answer.
I would do a, I'd work though.

9
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,680
I'd be a dorm at the comedy store.
Especially gave me spots. No,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,880
I had 100% sure of that. Yeah.
You get those 1:00 AM spots.

11
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,400
You don't want them spots or
spots or confidence crushers.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,920
He'll make you want to quit those.
Why am I doing those spots are good.

13
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:47,620
If you Dave Chappelle, they're good. If
you've been doing standup forever. Yeah,

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,490
they're good. If you're Dave Chappelle
and then you can walk into anything. Well,

15
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,750
the thing about that is like,

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,950
it's also good for you to be in
front of a tired small crowd.

17
00:00:55,951 --> 00:01:00,120
Like a tired small crowd is good to
test out shit. You know, those are,

18
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,240
those are good. I did a, I did a spot, uh,

19
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:06,090
an unannounced spot the other
night at the comedy store in the,

20
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,280
or it was like half pack and what
time, but no, it was fairly late.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,760
It was fairly late, but it was a, people
were beaten down. It's a different animal.

22
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,440
Their energies. Yeah, it's differently.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,890
They come in after dinner
Hounsell different, you know,

24
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:23,370
you can get fucking real used to
like Louis C k you should say that.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,940
Like he likes to just show up and
even though he was really famous and

26
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,100
everything like that,
when he was doing this still is right.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,150
But when he would show up, what he liked
is that they weren't there to see him.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,230
So then he would get a more
honest response to his material,

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,123
that fake shit

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,940
like that.
Like when you go on,

31
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,280
the guys that go on are the actors
that go on like Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy,

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,590
like anything they say.
They say the crowd is,

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,900
they got that applause sign ready to go.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,690
You know what's really hilarious when
you watch those guys tried to stand up

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,110
when they get in their head that they
can't then you know like, come on,

36
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,820
I can't fail. I'm, everybody loves me.

37
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,170
I was in to go up at the store
but I'll tell you what man,

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,560
Michael Rappaport is getting
pretty fucking sporty.

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,860
I saw him do a couple of minutes the
other day and he seemed like a real comic

40
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,660
and I know he's only been
doing it for like a little bit.

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,040
He did it before and then he got into
acting. I think he tried it before,

42
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,470
but yeah, he's, he's getting,
he's getting good. He's getting,

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,310
I saw him once and it was,
he was struggling a little bit,

44
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,970
but it could've just been the crown. But
then I saw him recently, I'm like, damn,

45
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:39,960
he's a tall motherfucker til I never
realized that he's tall as fuck.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,480
He was tall, pretty tall, taller than you.

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,610
So he's a little shorter than shops to
Andre Fili, Andre Fili and miles jury.

48
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,040
That's a good fucking fight.
Fight. So here we are folks.

49
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:54,120
This is a fight companion. This
is ESPN, its first real card,

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,140
not on ESPN plus this is on ESPN,
ESPN,

51
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,040
which is huge for the sport and
Cain motherfucking Velasquez.

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,140
My vote for the best heavyweight in
the UFC ever. I think that's fair.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,820
Most accomplished is Steve Bay for sure.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,460
So I mean it's hard for breezy over
doing what a fucking record that guys,

55
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,750
you get argument forever.
Minute. He's got it.

56
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:20,260
There's a good argument for a minute for
a [inaudible] being one of the greatest

57
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:24,900
of all time because or the greatest
because he tapped into Tarro tap cane

58
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,530
tapped, uh, tap fade or I mean, who the
fuck is tapped all those guys? Yeah.

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,630
I mean he's a motherfucker.

60
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,220
But as far as what I've seen from like
when he's in his prime, well, you know,

61
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,930
outside of all his injuries,

62
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,780
Kane at one point in time was just
a storm. And you know, I talked to,

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,840
it was really funny,
man.

64
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,430
We were backstage and I was talking
to Bob Cook and he's, and I was like,

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,980
people want to try to ride that storm out.
And they were laughing.

66
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,330
Bob Cuccos a storm, never hands storm,
never ends, does it with his tenacity.

67
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,850
Cardio was insanity.
It didn't even make sense.

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Remember when he beat a jds
when it was j d 36 off of them?

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,600
I haven't been the same. He
was on the First Fox card. Yes,

70
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,450
it lasted 26 seconds. Yeah, Jane, yes. But
he wouldn't, he wasn't good for business.

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
This should not have been fighting.
You know that jds. Sure enough,

72
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,130
no cane had a really fucked
up knee in that fight.

73
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,020
First round miles, jury, Andre Fili.

74
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,470
And then of course Keynes fighting the
scariest motherfucker in the history of

75
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:29,050
the sport, in my opinion. And
glass. She could read your list,

76
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,530
your cardio machine after Steve Bay.
You know,

77
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,600
Steve Bay kind of exposed some
holes in his game, but you know,

78
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,140
the guy's only been fighting for
a few steps. He did explosive.

79
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,870
But the apprentice is credit that,

80
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:43,030
I mean he fucking ate some big shots
but it's steep and he took it unless all

81
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:46,810
five rounds. So he came back and had
a terrible fight with Derek Lewis.

82
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,870
But Derrick Lewis is a beast and
he in that, it was very nervous.

83
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,600
It was a bad fight. But then came back
and stop Curtis blades. Yeah. Clickers.

84
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,200
Curtis Curtis is a mother fucker.
He is a mother's worst fight.

85
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,610
Derrick Lewis Francis,

86
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,200
which we thought there's gonna be
fireworks or Paul Daley Mvp last night.

87
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,810
Um, no. Do Man Fuck you. Well Paul,

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,730
you know what I'm a wrestler now
do it was crazy. It was, it was,

89
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,090
it wasn't good. But it was
better than Francis versus
Derek think. Yes. Yes it was.

90
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:20,970
There was moments of action. Yeah, there
was, there was able to take down. Oh yeah.

91
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,180
Which is not going to be Pete. Take him
down. Yeah. But it's not as a shit show.

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,500
It's not good for MVPs. I imagine
what Tyron Woodley would do to MVP.

93
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,050
Imagine we don't have to worry about it.
She doesn't have to worry about it.

94
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,970
Cause he's employed in Mcdonald's
though his we've another way macdonald,

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,150
but a real renaissance Fitch,
Fitch.

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,910
But well John Fitch though he's
gotta be able to grab a hold of him.

97
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,230
The thing about Paul dailies,

98
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,420
he fucking threatens a shit
out of you with that power.

99
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,900
He's got the scariest lefthand in
the sport that's left ends. But yeah,

100
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,660
100% he scares the shit
out of you with that power.

101
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,460
You got to mind your p's and q's.

102
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:56,200
But what I like about page is that I've
always said that one day we're going to

103
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:59,030
see a guy who's a fighter who
learns how to do other shit.

104
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,950
Cause those guys are impossible to hit
because their whole thing is lunging in

105
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,320
lunging at lunch a little bit,
right? When a boy a little bit,

106
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,230
but he's more of a kickboxing,
a point fighter. Phenomenal.

107
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,950
Kickboxer I mean nominal but,

108
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,150
but what will you see from MVP is like
one of the best fighters that's ever even

109
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:19,670
attempted to fight and it
doesn't get touch. He's so good.

110
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,930
Championships with real
against Raymond Daniels.

111
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,480
You should see the two of them fight
like Raymond Daniels was another one who

112
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:31,340
was a legit worldclass point fighter and
MVPs undefeated in professional boxing.

113
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,210
Yes, but the file is he fighting?
Well, nobody's, but still the re,

114
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:40,010
the first real fight she had was last
night against daily and there was some

115
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,680
holes. There were some holes that were
exposed. It was way too easy for daily.

116
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,350
That's true. He's only certain fights
way too easy for daily to take them down.

117
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,590
Not that daily dozen. His next fight is
going to be tough. What was Chris? Yeah,

118
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,101
really tough.

119
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,790
But what's crazy is it daily was talking
so much shit on John Fitch after John

120
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,980
Fish took him down to daily's,

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,220
all he does is talk shit about guys
wrestling and then he took it down.

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,120
I was like, I literally, I was like, what
is happening right now? I was frustrated.

123
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,300
I was like, what is happening? Right?
We're what's happening right here. Miles.

124
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,780
Jury's already busted up. We're not
even paying attention. God. Well,

125
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
you got to talk about fucking Paul Daley.
It was unbelievable.

126
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,950
And I didn't realize how big MVP was.
I didn't know.

127
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,160
He's six [inaudible] so tall for this,
for that division,

128
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,110
and also like uses it.

129
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,210
Here's his reaches insane.
He does sneaky shit too.

130
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,120
He did this like this sneaky right hand.
Did he hit him with,

131
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,190
he tried to hit him with a
hook kick at one point in time.

132
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,820
He landed that front kick.
Yeah. He's a beast man.

133
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,390
If he gets his wrestling takedown
defense on point, I mean,

134
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,650
he's a phenomenal athlete, but the thing
he tagged gift though it is a big gift,

135
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,460
but the thing that he, but he goes to
London shoot fighters, great God damn gym.

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,380
The thing that he's missing, you know,
I mean, is it just the wrestling,

137
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,330
takedown defense just
to take down defense?

138
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,890
Like if you could take a page out of
style, Benders, book style, been around.

139
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm not too worried about him
fighting. Grappling. Right, right. All,

140
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,870
he's hard to take down.
Very tough take down and you're coming in,

141
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,080
you're going to pay it. Yeah.
He's so God damn technical.

142
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,420
He might be the most technical
striker in the sport.

143
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,190
I watched him in glory
the other day. I was, uh,

144
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,990
working out watching some old
glory fights with style. Ben,

145
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:19,040
when he fought Jason Wellness,
his movement, he's in class.

146
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,750
I mean wellness is a world champion
dude. How about Roy Nelson and Cro?

147
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:27,530
Cop fought last night to cro. Cop look
good. God. What's he, what happened?

148
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,770
Cro. Cop wanted decision, right? Yeah.
When did he take Roy Jones down or,

149
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:37,900
or how Nelson Nelson.
That'd be a safe flight.

150
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,430
It look the same till today.

151
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,420
Once a Croatian with a black guy
talking about Roy Nelson was one of the

152
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,900
greatest boxers of all
time. The, yeah, they both,

153
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,590
they both look like exactly how
they look. They, it was like going,

154
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,340
Nelson Hits harder than
Roy Jones right now.

155
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,500
George has tagged Andre Fili. He just
tagged him with the left hand. Uh,

156
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,210
yeah. I think if you had them on
that power meter, I think, uh,

157
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,800
I think Roy probably hits harder,

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,150
but he also weighs 150 pounds more close.
He's probably Roy.

159
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,240
Roy Jones Jr is probably
about 200 pounds these days.

160
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,860
But when Roy was fighting shape, God, he
was fun. Well when he was at his heaviest,

161
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:24,520
he was about 200 right when he fought.
John Ruiz won the heavyweight title. Yeah,

162
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,090
that was a phenomenal fight. When you
watch that, I mean that was just artistry,

163
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:34,080
speed and precision versus a,
you know, a world champion.

164
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,240
And John Ruiz who's a real good fighter,

165
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,580
he's a real good heavyweight fighter.
But Roy Jones was at that time,

166
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,500
you know the, the big fucker, the big fuck
up. Rather it was going from that fight,

167
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:51,501
dropping down to fight Tarver at one 75
on back down 25 pounds and looking like

168
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,230
shit, looking like dude. And Tarver
is a monster. He's a monster.

169
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,150
And also Tarver and him had gone to a
decision in one fight earlier and Tarver

170
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,680
thought he won.
And you know,

171
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:06,300
Roy Roy apparently had something
to say about, you know,

172
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,620
why he didn't perform at its best.

173
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,830
So when they were faced off tonight and
the referee goes, any questions? He goes,

174
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,330
God,
he excuses tonight Roy.

175
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,410
And then he went and knocked him
out to have Tara. So he was so,

176
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,200
so good. Get back. These guys, forget
about Tom. Are you still doing it?

177
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:27,180
Man Steals it was six people. Know
what you're talking about. No,

178
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,090
Tara and told him the magic man.
You don't know.

179
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,890
Fight companion fans down now
get the fuck total car fans.

180
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,570
Now look at this and Roy Jones,

181
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,140
we get this sharp jab boxing better than
ever right now though. Cause you're,

182
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,110
you got fury. Then you got
wilder rematch coming up in May.

183
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,130
That's happening in Brooklyn. Spoiler
work in Brooklyn. Are you working on that?

184
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,460
Probably work in that. Am I
special? Comes out same way.

185
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,010
I know. Um, how did uh, do
in 12 new minutes? Go. They
don't want good last night.

186
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,460
Nice. Right? I'm new minutes
or scarify super scan.

187
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,910
Also like to when you were
talking beginning of the show,

188
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,380
there was in my crowd they didn't
mark and me beyond none of the,

189
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,600
none of those people are my people.
And wait, good man. I was so nice.

190
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,420
It was weird for me to drive back.
This isn't fucking good fight.

191
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,340
We're missing a good fight.
I know, man. I never,

192
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:23,430
I always have to watch fights
when I get back home. I recorded.

193
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,220
I know we talked so much shit. I know
there's just so we don't see each other,

194
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,420
so we got to catch up and shit.
Is Miles jury still with alliance?

195
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,343
Does anybody know?

196
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,470
I know he has his own gym and I
think in San Diego and San Diego. Oh,

197
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,690
he branched off I think so.

198
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,710
He was a dominant cruises stablemate
right. They trained together.

199
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Oh, feely with a nice right hand
dude. Where did I thought, uh,

200
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,810
the Francis was going to go to a new camp
and I saw he's just training fulltime

201
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,630
in France. I'm like the match wrestling
and France, but we'll figure it out. Hmm.

202
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,750
Maybe just hitting the heavy
bag. I mean, where would he go?

203
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,120
Like you want them to go to two places?
In my opinion,

204
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,450
I'd want them to go to either
att or Aka. Right. Att a log.

205
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,340
They've got enough heavyweights and they
have a phenomenal coaching staff. Right.

206
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,670
But you want,
you want someone big to work with an AK.

207
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,720
They're not really gonna probably take
him or go to elevation fight team where

208
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:20,280
you got Curtis blades and Overeem who
he's fought bolts. Right, right. Yeah.

209
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,090
Great coaching at the altitude there.
Yep. That's pretty striking Krishna.

210
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,190
That altitude training is,
it's really interesting.

211
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:31,300
I was talking to Tj Dillashaw and you
know he used to think that out training

212
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:35,500
was where it's at until he started working
with cal Avida and he thinks that you,

213
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:39,870
you get more work in, I agree with him.
Yeah. Working at sea level. Yeah. Cause I,

214
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,810
my whole career was in Denver and then
when you come to sea level you're like

215
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,930
fuck, I can do work. I can put work. Yeah.

216
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:50,020
So like what they're saying is like the
amount of reps in the amount of work you

217
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:53,410
do, like what he's doing with
Colivida is fucking phenomenal.

218
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,950
The podcast I did with him was one of
the most informative podcasts I've ever

219
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:01,750
done with a fighter in terms of like
how technical his training routine is.

220
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:06,520
His Diet is how everything is broken down
to a science as far as like what to do

221
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,560
when and when to do what is at another
level than anyone else and to see,

222
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,600
unless unless someone's on it
and they're not talking about,

223
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,970
but when TJ talks about it, yeah, there's
no one more in tuned with their body.

224
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,803
Then Tj,

225
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,680
that fucking Aaron Peko and he's getting
on that same level because he trains

226
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:23,050
with them, but I asked as
teacher, I'm like, why isn't,

227
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,850
why didn't you just follow
you around? He's like, dude,

228
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,530
he has all these people kind of pulling
them every which way. I'm like, dude,

229
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:31,300
he should just do what you do. Well,
he looked phenomenal, but he got wild.

230
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,530
That video. Do you ever see the video of
us watching him loose? Yeah, it's crazy.

231
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,670
We jumped up.
We're all fulfilling challenge.

232
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,650
That could have been one of the
most viral videos on Instagram,

233
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:45,130
like in the in that week. A number
of probably, yeah. That was crazy.

234
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,320
That knockout was insane. That was the
craziest reaction. Yeah, that knock.

235
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:53,650
I was insane and Callan's given
the general view. That was a punch.

236
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,060
That was a punch.
He hit him with his knuckle fight.

237
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,870
That's a fight.

238
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,640
That man that was dancing cracks me up.
I was like

239
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,940
such a silly goose. This is
a good fucking fight, man.

240
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,790
These guys are so well. Well
matched. Really good fight.

241
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,410
I did sterling beat Jimmy Rivera.
He must have.

242
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:24,550
He was laughing on the way. There's
a motherfucker. What happened?

243
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,390
Jamie [inaudible] sterling. Anyone
who trains I guess in the train room.

244
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,370
He's a freak. Super Freak. That's just
shows you how good Mala Mariah says.

245
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,690
Correct. He's the motherfucker I want
to see fight for the title. He too.

246
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,690
He's so good, man. When he got against
the sun sound, he finished. The Sun's out.

247
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,830
No one finishes him. 45 35 35 antimony.
Yeah. No one finishes a Sun. Sal.

248
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,880
You beat him with a close
decision if you're lucky.

249
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,350
I asked Tj about and he's
like, yeah, I'd fine,

250
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,760
but the all they care about the pseudo
rematch. Yeah. Unanimous decision. Oh Wow.

251
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,410
That's impressive for stroke story.
Got Caught.

252
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,500
Andre feelies in a bit of
trouble here. Oh, she always
root for mouse jury, do you?

253
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,230
I always do. They're shutting guys at
us. Always root for, do you know him?

254
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,320
Not that well. We did one show together.
That's it. It's getting them out

255
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,000
that
damn

256
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,360
feelies and a bit of trouble
here. Interesting. He's
pushing them to the cage.

257
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,710
Yeah, that is interesting.
That's not a good move because
he could, he could. Yeah.

258
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,840
Push off off the cage with his feet.

259
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,570
Can cause a scramble feeling
with a nice little hip escape

260
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,240
there.
Get to guard.

261
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,340
Um, what were we just saying?
Just before that that happened.

262
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,460
Sterling fight. Oh ow. Oh, more eyes.
Yeah, man. He's like, he's so good.

263
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,990
He Kod Sterling.

264
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,590
I mean bad homerun did Aoj
Jimmy Rivera in 10 seconds.

265
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,040
Yup. Yup. And both with the left
high kick, I believe. Oh Shit.

266
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,950
That's spinning back fist with
their own spinning shit. Now. Hamas,

267
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,630
Nick Diaz, he already said, man,
he said, I want to hurt nobody.

268
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:09,460
I want to party has done really
good for him, man. He has is done.

269
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,790
Yeah.
Because a Anderson,

270
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,320
someone was talking about Anderson
versus nick and Connor said,

271
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:17,650
I'll fight Nate on the same
card. And then Nick said, yeah,

272
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,410
I'm not fighting anybody. I
don't want hurt nobody. He
goes, I just want to party.

273
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,740
That's cool, man. Yeah. He gives
her a fucking amazing career.

274
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,300
You gotta remember Nick Diaz fought,

275
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,450
he was one of the youngest
guys to ever fight in the UFC.

276
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,870
I believe he beat Robbie
Lawler when he was 20. Dude,

277
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:35,520
he's beats you look at his resume. It's
impressive. Yeah. The guy said he's flat.

278
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,090
He's been doing for a hot second. He's
deserved. Yeah. Turning to survive.

279
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,100
Hopefully financially.
He's good too.

280
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,320
What do you think of this
Anthony Smith and John Jones?

281
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,610
What do you think of this? What are you
looking at? Uh, I looked at this guy.

282
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,540
I like Anthony Smith. It's a tough
go. You like them as a human being.

283
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,620
I love you like a person. I don't like
him to win. Does anyone ever do that?

284
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,500
But that's, that's his story,
right? Biggest wins mirror.

285
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,060
Yeah. I was in here was a big win. John
Jones would do those to man. I, it's,

286
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:09,710
but it's, it's, this is an Anthony Smith
thing, the focus on an empty, so it's,

287
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,570
it's a Jon Jones thing. I
don't know anyone in light
heavyweight or heavyweight.

288
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,560
That would be John Jones.

289
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,550
Damn strong words named Sylvia
heavyweight who'd beat him strong words.

290
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,890
You know what I'm saying? Like name
a tough matchup for med heavyweight.

291
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,080
If he just, if he goes, you know what, I'm
a fucking heavyweight now. Right, right.

292
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,400
Good luck. It's up to like
two 40 kilo. Yeah. God,

293
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,360
if he gets up to like Jack modified
like he was when he was powerlifting.

294
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,150
Oh my God. The thing about
that is though, like, you know,

295
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:37,150
I talked to Greg Jackson about that and
Greg was saying that he didn't like him

296
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,220
when he was powerlifting like that.
Um,

297
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,810
he knocked out Mauricio Shogun Hua.
He a knocked out.

298
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:48,490
Rashad lost a Tiago Santos.
I want to say that.

299
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:52,560
Was that middleweight that wasn't his
first fight in the light heavyweight was

300
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,760
Rashad some good wins. He's been fine.

301
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,400
He's not a young kid.
He's been fighting for a hot second.

302
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,300
I mean he knocked out portions
of the x factor for shot 70

303
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,280
it's 74 years ago of Rashad. Rashad
should should've been fighting. You know,

304
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,920
I think we're shot. His heart wasn't in
the game anymore cause he retired now.

305
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,900
Shot show this job retired and now he's a,
we're commentator.

306
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,330
He opened up tonight on the ESPN portion,
which is amazing.

307
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,130
He's shots great when the best guys
in this great guy, one of the best.

308
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:26,600
Have you had him on? No,
I would love to. I left.

309
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,740
Let's do it again.
Let's do it together.

310
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,230
Let's run a train on podcasts and
Trey, we're run a train. I love that.

311
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,640
He's such a sweet person. I've had
some conversations with them that guys,

312
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,600
he's a lot smarter than you might think.
That guy, that guy is, he's very smart.

313
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,490
He reaches out to me out of like when
things are going bad or I'm having an

314
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:51,000
issue, they're like, it's out in
the public who reach out to me.

315
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,100
Then I always give me like words
of wisdom. He's that guy, great,

316
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,000
great guy.
And you know,

317
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:01,290
you go back to his career when he knocked
out chocolate dealt with one punch pub

318
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,800
blasts are doing the hard thing was like,

319
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,660
I will never forget that because he
knocked him out and then he beat Forrest

320
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,770
Griffin. Do you know what he's
dealing with? What he's doing?

321
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,491
What he does the hard thing.

322
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:11,220
Do you know he's doing what he's about
to have a heart attack. Sanford and son,

323
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,200
Fred Sanford. Oh really? Oh No,
it's fun. Funny you remember that?

324
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,020
Oh well no, too young. Yeah, I
know what you're talking about.

325
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,610
But I remember his shot knocked up for
us and he was training with us and came

326
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:27,870
back to the gym and at the time I
wasn't in the UFC and I was like, dude,

327
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,610
got the belt, electric lines. I
was freaking out and he was like,

328
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,510
I feel exactly the same Brendan.
Nothing.

329
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
I thought it would be everything in more
and I want to be exact the same dude.

330
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,880
He's like,
he was almost kind of like,

331
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,610
it's not all that it's meant to be like
you think you get to the top of the

332
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:45,040
mountain and it's everything, but
he's like, I feel like I'm back here.

333
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,370
Dream everyone. He coached against
rampage. I was on that season. Oh,

334
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,960
that's my season was shot with my coach.
How's the second pig on team Rochelle?

335
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,680
Rochelle clothes, clothes dude. And
when they were in front of each other,

336
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,870
you a bitch. You a bitch, bitch.
Bitch is back for those like this.

337
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:08,730
This kid go so intense.
That whole show was like the fucking,

338
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,800
everyone was going to
pop off and then he said,

339
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,810
was he a division one championship and
state champion and not a lot of work? No,

340
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,520
not at all. In the all
American, all American.

341
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:21,590
His roommate was a great
Mannion gray manner. Wow. Hmm.

342
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,140
Meanwhile, we're missing a really
good fight. There's still going,

343
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,810
is this five rounds? No, it's the third
round, Bruh. I know if he done fairly

344
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,660
well,

345
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,660
we should tell people it's at 305130413031
30 to one 31 of the third round in

346
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,270
the first fight.
Sorry.

347
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,370
It's good that we don't
give people expectations.

348
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:48,880
What we're going to do here when we do
fight companions, I zero expectations.

349
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,320
Zero is my favorite podcast we ever do.
I like more,

350
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,640
more forward to this and yeah.

351
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,540
I mean I love doing podcasts
with scientists and geniuses
and to work though in

352
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,010
in a little bit. No, no, it's a different
fee. You got to do some research too.

353
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,440
I liked doing that though, but
it's different feel. This is this.

354
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,180
This is this party. So hang out man.
This is fun. What are you smiling at?

355
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,470
Eddie doesn't believe in science

356
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,900
and he's all your bull
shit and your science.

357
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,480
I believe in science than I can there
you could see what your own eyes.

358
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,550
Yes. I believe the science of this
iPhone. That's real. It's just fear.

359
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,270
It's real as fuck. Dude,
I was watching this.

360
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,990
I was thinking about he did it cause
I don't have cable right now because I

361
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,710
moved. So we're Winfrey Kim. So all I have
is Netflix. I was watching this earth,

362
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,230
planet earth and will Smith
is the narrator on it.

363
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,730
It's all about earth and they're like
scanning up and it's astronauts talking

364
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,270
about what they saw from space the
whole time. I was thinking, God,

365
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:50,020
Eddie must watch this is some bull
shit. These liars, those, this,

366
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,860
watch this, watch this bull shit.
That ain't real. This moon shot.

367
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,380
How many hours they had in space, like 72
hours in space. Eight hours. I was like,

368
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:03,760
I bet Eddie saying fuck these. Meanwhile
we have no idea who won this fight.

369
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,550
Miles. Jury. You think so? Nope. I have no
idea. But that's what counts. Good for it.

370
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,620
Cause he will, he won't listen to us
and he'll watch it in the neck. Miles,

371
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:16,060
jury two rounds to one. You might be
right. That mother fucker's late. Yeah.

372
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:20,440
Well he beat him up. He landed late.
He's in Burbank. Elliot, I don't know.

373
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:24,160
He didn't say just sit as
flatland. The blade. Yeah man.

374
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,630
Then MVP fight was bullshit.

375
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,270
So I was so pissed and I love Scott Coco.

376
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:30,700
I was going to tweet out something like,
you know what,

377
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,190
I'm just gonna let them write.
Everyone's probably piling on daily.

378
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:37,290
I don't want to be that guy.
I'm just going to back out and fight.

379
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,550
Didn't end like two

380
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,590
shows in a row. Yup. Friday,
Saturday. I do that all the time.

381
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:47,440
They have one on paramount and
then they have one on zone.

382
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,830
I watched it on to zone in my phone.
Um,

383
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,360
I got one of those design
accounts and you know, I was,

384
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,040
I was in Vegas for this event my
daughter was doing and so I, I heard it.

385
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,570
I'm like, I'll be right back.
I fuck. I couldn't find it.

386
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,320
My daughter was done with her things.

387
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,790
I had to run to the top of the stairs
and watch that shit. Some bullshit.

388
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,340
I said,
I told my wife what I was doing.

389
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,710
I flew up from the commie strategy
hangout field's going to be there. We,

390
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,790
which was talked some business about the
show. And I literally, I was like, dude,

391
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:20,020
I have to go. He's like, why? Like dude,
MVP and daily or finding say Ku. I'm like,

392
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,370
I'll pay you later. Let's just talk to
mom. I fucking flew home after my set.

393
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,260
I get home and I'm waiting.
I'm like,

394
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:30,230
what the fuck is you have to zone
or did you watch it deserve? Yeah,

395
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,290
they got a lot of good
fights on that there.

396
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,230
I mean I didn't even know what the fuck
it was. Daaz it looks like Dayson. Right?

397
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,570
Terrible name, but it's
a bad name. It's, it's,

398
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,430
it's Dazn is to have cable
to watch the fight. No, no.

399
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:45,860
You can watch it on you.
Yeah.

400
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,940
I just watched,

401
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,660
I watched it on my phone cause paramount
network you'd have to have like you

402
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,640
have to have an account
with direct TV or some shit,

403
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,950
but to zone he covers
whatever paramount fights out.

404
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,180
Did that cause people don't
have TV no more so people don't,

405
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,860
so they got to just have it
just through your goddamn app.

406
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,690
I literally don't make me get it happened.

407
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:07,520
Then I got to order fucking directv zone
as they spent a shit load of money on

408
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,570
Canelo Alvarez. They signed him to some
multiple hundred million dollar deal.

409
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,320
I think it's something like it's like
$300 million and he's the highest paid

410
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,720
athlete in the world. 365 million. Yeah,

411
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:22,370
some insane amount of money over 10 fights
and it's going to be all subscription

412
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:27,160
based. All on does zone. You
got to all, isn't that how it's,

413
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,960
isn't that how it's gone?
The future is no view.

414
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,140
Netflix subscription one pay wall.

415
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,760
What's interesting is if it's no paper
view, it's actually a really good deal.

416
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,990
Right? Because I don't know
what does own costs a month.

417
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,510
I just did the double click on my phone.

418
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:44,930
I didn't pay attention to how much that
should cost. Yeah, but what does it cost?

419
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,360
I don't. I don't know. It's fine
out what it costs for all the bands.

420
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,110
If you 70 bucks a month, it's 90 99 you've
got to think that if you're watching,

421
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,670
if you're watching a paper view,

422
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:56,690
like a big fight like wilder fury to
how much is that going to cost? 60

423
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,460
bucks a month, 10 bucks a month, and
you can watch fights all the time.

424
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:04,910
It's like my, my take on fight
pass. Like if you like fights man,

425
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,650
like in my gym I have, I live off of
fight pass. You swatch old fights.

426
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,430
I watch fights all the
time while I'm working out.

427
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:14,030
It's the best thing that you watch.
Why would look at Gbi I do.

428
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:16,820
I watched the whole, uh, Gordon
Ryan series the other day,

429
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,690
the whole little documentary they had.
I watched that was working out combat.

430
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:24,630
Did you get to fight ninth is
Friday. Oh Shit. La La, right? It has

431
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,910
this Friday on you. A UFC fight
pass 7:00 PM Pacific. Who,

432
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,330
who did you get to fill in for a,
was it Barnett got hurt?

433
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,470
Barnett's out to virgin got hurt.
Verdugo doom didn't get hurt.

434
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,560
It was supposed to be Gordon Ryan
versus [inaudible] Gordon [inaudible],

435
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,480
Gordon Ramsay Manor. So we're going to do,
we're going to do for Doom Gordon Ryan,

436
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,210
uh, later on this year. But, um,
it's a four man combat Jujitsu,

437
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,960
absolute at bracket with um,
a Uri Somos,

438
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,940
who's a arguably one of the,

439
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,750
one of the best Brazilian
Jujitsu practitioners ever.

440
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,540
ADCC medalist, gold medalist,
monster, monster. And then the,

441
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:11,750
the second seed is at John
Thor blank who want Ebi 17.

442
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:16,460
He wanted the finish the first and
only 16 man Combat Jujitsu tournament.

443
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:19,520
He wanted all in regulation,
all every fight within two minutes.

444
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,200
He said he subbed everybody.

445
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,370
So it's Uri and John Doerr
blank are the top two seeds.

446
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,450
And then if they win their first fights,
then they'll fight each other.

447
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,470
And then same night, same
night though, I'm Kevin Casey,

448
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,960
his fighting John Thor blank,
Alan Kevin cases.

449
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,100
He jumped in and as Stephen
Martinez is a local black belt,

450
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:44,220
he's fighting a Uri somos.
So on paper it looks like it'll be Uri

451
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,270
and John Blank on page or
anything can happen in the finals.

452
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,540
Plus we got the best Jujitsu
girl that's ever lived,

453
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,170
only only girl ever to when Abu Dhabi,

454
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,230
Ibj JFG and no gay black belt
and Ebi be a trace mosquito.

455
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,360
She is the baddest chick ever injured.

456
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,310
She's fighting combat Jujitsu against
Kayla Patterson should be slapping.

457
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,040
Awesome. She's going to be, yeah, it's
going to be awesome. I might come nice.

458
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,710
I like it when someone
gets hurt and the tag me,

459
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,680
Brendan Schaub get in there
like you're at your God damn

460
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,000
you fucking crazy.
When,

461
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,700
when you go back and think
about that cyborg fight,

462
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:27,620
would you ever think about doing that
again now man, I'm too busy. What?

463
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,970
Comedy is so hard. I'm so behind
the April. All my energies on this.

464
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,190
What do you think about this? What do you
think about Pettis fighting Wonderboy?

465
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,360
Good for you. Pedes I love, I get great
fighters and it kinda crazy though.

466
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,990
He's to,
it goes from 45 can't make it any more.

467
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,540
All the way up to 70 25 precinct about
it. Fucking this. How much of a beast?

468
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,510
Pegasus fights Tony Ferguson. Amazing
fire, right? Tony wins that. He gets hurt.

469
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,380
Then fucking, he was like, you
know, I've got to get a broke.

470
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:56,820
His hand pedes broke
his hand in that fight,

471
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,250
so it was a tough fight
for him either way.

472
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,460
But then he jumps up and he's fighting
Wonderboy both use me in a dog in both

473
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:08,550
fights. He's an underdog and both fights.
Yeah. Yeah. That, that, that first.

474
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:11,280
And if I was fun Aliya it show.
It shows you what?

475
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:14,430
A survivor Ferguson as he
gets clipped and you know,

476
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,520
he got hurt in that fight
and he just grabbed,

477
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,970
how about Max Holloway and Tony
Ferguson Talking Shit to each other?

478
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,400
The, that's the on the, on the dark
web. That's the room. I liked that,

479
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:29,200
but I don't like that. Why don't you
like it Ferguson versus could be.

480
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,100
I want to see that fight,
but why does he have to bebes out for,

481
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,070
he won't fight in Vegas. He has a
suspension, so he's out for a little bit.

482
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,800
Tony's ready to go that he won't do the,
the,

483
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,010
he won't do that thing that Vegas
is asking them to do commercial.

484
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,590
They're asking me to do a commercial.
It was like, you have prostitution,

485
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,500
you have gambling. Fuck you. What's
the best, so why does it, he's,

486
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:51,510
I guess he's right too. What is
the problem with Connor, Tony?

487
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,440
What's going on with that? How can that,
it's going to be Connor and cowboy.

488
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,070
Connor and cowboys had done deal as
far as I know, two. As far as I know.

489
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,340
As far as that we signed the
contract. It doesn't Connor. Tony,

490
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:06,960
make more sense though. Know what
kind of cowboys? Great. And Connor,

491
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:11,430
Tony's great. They're both great. They're
both great sites. If, if I'm, if I'm Dana,

492
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:15,060
I'm sitting on this. Eddie, you lie.

493
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,360
I want to be careful with Tony
because you love him, your friends.

494
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,310
I'm just saying why not?
Cause we'll need Connor that's been here.

495
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:25,860
Works for like two year. Here it
is. Eddie, Tony, Connor, Connor.

496
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:29,160
Be a slight underdog. I think in that
fight. Tony's a monster for anybody.

497
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:33,940
So I think Tony Max it and cop cars.

498
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,920
Connie's get a win. I'm not saying college
can be a huge favorite over cowboy,

499
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:41,160
but he's more favorable in that fight.
Then he is going, he's a window.

500
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,070
He comes back

501
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,380
and he needs to,
he needs a more favorable fight.

502
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,970
And I'm not saying that's a great Matt
Cowboy's a motherfucker and you know,

503
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,980
fire cowboys on fire right now.
He's just so lucid in the zone right now.

504
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,910
And Cowboy. Yeah, it's a great fight.
That's a perfect stylus screen.

505
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,820
That's a better fight for
cowboy and Connor. Yeah.

506
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,880
Tony's Tony is a great wrestling back
then and he's a motherfucker cardio for

507
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:07,960
days and he's crazy. I liked that fight
a lot. I really liked that fight a lot.

508
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,430
Max Holloway. Tony's Elf motherfucking
fight. I love that fight.

509
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,150
Marvel studios do superheroes.
I think they've run out of superhero.

510
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,580
This shit on my hoodies.
I don't know who is this?

511
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,670
Samuel Jackson is a
different superhero now.

512
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,860
Who is at the end of the Avengers movie?
Hey Samuel L.

513
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,550
Jackson say no to some captain
marvel, but who is, wait a minute.

514
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,940
Captain Marvel's a girl. Yeah, and she
and she brings all of them back to life.

515
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,830
Wait a minute. Who was captain marvel when
we were kids? Uh, dude, wait a minute.

516
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,820
I'll look. I don't know. It's
amazing that it's not a trans woman.

517
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,730
That would be dope. That's what
they're going to be enough trans.

518
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,810
Who's a weightlifting champions.
Yeah.

519
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,720
He comes sit down some cheese and wine
and cheese. No cheese. People get mad.

520
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,700
People get mad. She's chewing on
the microphone. We're pros, man.

521
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,240
You guys a couple of one,
two pros,

522
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
cheesy dude.
If you didn't bring stuff in provolone.

523
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,540
Hey, how about this fight? Uzman Huseman
versus Tyron Woodley. I love that.

524
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,070
That's March 2nd. Come on at. He's now
our secondary watch guys, come, come,

525
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,320
come to Vegas. Okay, here.

526
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,020
Captain Marvel was a guy and a girl
in the capital different. She was hot,

527
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,150
but that's from 2017 men. This is
when it's already been diversified.

528
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,010
Captain Marvel,
dude,

529
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,750
give me type in 1992 Spiderman
that just made captain marvel.

530
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,590
1956 when I was about this,

531
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,550
this spider verse movie that just came
out is that it's like only a four year

532
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,670
old Spiderman story. It's of, it's
not some old thing they brought back.

533
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,520
That's a cartoon. The captain captain.
Marvel's old school. No. Yeah,

534
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,690
but what are those? Spiderman is
like a duck, right? He's a pig, bro.

535
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,350
It's a great movie.
Best movie I've seen in long

536
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,600
term Bruce Lee and a superhero
and give them like powers.

537
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,930
My kids said Nate to the fucking legos
movie and what do you want to see?

538
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,350
The lego movie that

539
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,080
we seen. The other ones, my son loves
the Lego movie. Oh, it's the new one.

540
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,930
Both of them. A new one just came out.
How many have there been to? Only two.

541
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,880
Really? So cool. That Batman's a douchebag

542
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,060
girlfriend. Right? And
then the girlfriend,

543
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,680
because Han Solo pulls up in the
Millennium Falcon or whatever

544
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,570
mistake. Wait a minute. This is the old
captain marvel, but he was a damn shot.

545
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:49,070
Zam Zam Zam Zam also known as
Captain Marvel terms in marvelous.

546
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,840
She's him. Dude. If you held
a gun to my head and asked me,

547
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,550
it's Shazamm DC or marvel out
of cities DC for sure. Yes.

548
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,620
Yes.
That's what I was trying to say.

549
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,520
There was a captain marvel character in
the DC comics universe from back then.

550
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:07,790
I don't know. That's what you're
remembering, but that's one that existed.

551
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:11,280
So that's the confusion that's
Shizam will be looked like.

552
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,410
Is that like someone from Bella
tour fighting someone from the UFC.

553
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,670
Confusing dude.
All I know,

554
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,610
she comes back and you know how
everyone died in the last one. Spoiler,

555
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:22,960
it's been up for now a year or so.
Fuck off. She brings everyone back.

556
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,160
Then how the fuck she do that?
That's the comic books, Dude.

557
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,790
Do you remember and
Lego movie when Batman,

558
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,680
he leaves his girl to jump
in the Millennium Falcon
with Han Solo and Chewbacca,

559
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,620
and he says later he jumped in,

560
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,080
he thought he was gonna
Party like in space,

561
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,430
and then he comes back to what happened.
He goes, turns out that he's a dude

562
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,410
that was fucking hilarious.

563
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,520
There was no chicks because there's no
chicks on the middle of the android too

564
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:58,400
to deed. Okay. [inaudible]
68 1968 but scroll down.

565
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,910
That's the first appearance
was the image of a female girl.

566
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:06,290
68 two this picture,
but here's the deal.

567
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,820
Girls weren't built like that back then.
They're building.

568
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,180
It's a new thing now because those are,
until you scroll down,

569
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:15,560
let me see that image that's not
like a, Oh, a Primo crossfit chick.

570
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,670
That's legit. That's a new version
of her. Oh, and I'm in 2012 yeah,

571
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,890
that's a UFC fighter chick. Right? Okay.
That's what they used to look like. Wow.

572
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,050
There's multiple captains on a marvel,
so captain marvel, sometimes a guy.

573
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:32,450
Sometimes the girl about it goes both
ways. I can relate to it. We're just like,

574
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:34,970
all right, whatever. But
they run a silver surfer.

575
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,900
There's so many superheros that they have
like 10 different ones on Netflix and

576
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,550
Amazon ships.
You guys watch that fuck fucking

577
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,720
wasp girl or some shit. I can't
fuck with that. Or aqua man.

578
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,820
Get that shit out of me. This is a good
fight to Brian Barbarina in vicinity.

579
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,470
Luke K is a good fight if we didn't
watch miles. Jury, let's be real. Oh,

580
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,840
this is a good fight though.
For sure. This is a good
point. Won that fight. Miles.

581
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:04,520
Jury did a few late feel
decision. Yes. To seal it.

582
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,190
Even watching the decision.
Well, we watched the flight.

583
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,890
We were taught the decision. Oh
Shit Brian, but marina, good. Right?

584
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,710
Do I can't wait for the main event. Meet
you. I can't wait to get home. Gracie.

585
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,930
I want to see, I want to hear a
prediction on the main event prediction.

586
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:30,380
Brian Councils need to really just just
got here and we can get that mustache

587
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:34,850
bro. Up the bottle. Do we have
a bottle opener? Mustache?

588
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,000
It looks dark. Yeah. Looks cool. It
looks cool. I'm a good looking guy.

589
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,780
You are a handsome devil. You. Yeah.
Um, what do you think in the main event?

590
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,470
Cain Velasquez. Francis Sugano.
Well, well let me ask you this.

591
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,980
How has Francis going to solve canes,
wrestling or his cardio?

592
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,200
It's been trading in France. So
what's your, I mean it's true,

593
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:58,410
but I speak French been eaten.
Escar go and throw a nuclear weapons.

594
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:01,790
Would his hands true? This may be true.
It's was very dangerous, but he's,

595
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,280
I feel like guys, he's got a
one, a one shop puncher's chance,

596
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,950
but everything else came does,
including boxing. He's better at it.

597
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,260
I'm just for sure.

598
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,400
See what he looks like now after all
this time off injury and all that.

599
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,850
The injuries are the big ones.
You want me to open B?

600
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,160
You can open them all my
friend. It doesn't matter.
All right, let's get crazy.

601
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,390
Crazy. What kind of, what did you bring?
Anything? I went a little California.

602
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,300
I wasn't one Barolo and I
decided to go California. I went,

603
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:31,770
I went old standbys standard. Good. One
more red one. What do you think of that?

604
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:33,770
Menage a trois. I get from, I think what?

605
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,770
I think it's [inaudible] just tag Bob
Barbarina would've left hook Barbarino

606
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,570
never bring up my daughters. No, no, no
different guy. Brian [inaudible] Marina.

607
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,490
If you got,
if I look a little harder,

608
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,010
it's cause I was just at
American top team with my friend,

609
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,720
my good friend Dustin Poray,

610
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,270
Mike Brown and Tiago Alpha didn't
make you cut weight. You look skinny.

611
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:55,100
Took a private, went 10 rounds.
Dude, I don't, that's the sin.

612
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,960
That's cause I can't have any wasted
space when I'm doing striking with shack

613
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,710
with Chaco Elvis. What did he have you
do hit the pads you have. It's great.

614
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:05,240
Kick and head. Low kick. He was
teaching. She does. Yeah. It's great.

615
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,250
They came to my house. Has Dustin's
hip doing, is he all right? He looks,

616
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,950
he looks fantastic. He's
waiting for a fight, man. Yeah,

617
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,040
he was getting some stem
cells or something, wasn't it?

618
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,650
They need to come up with a good fight.
He's so great. He's such a great,

619
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,520
good dude.
Talk mother fucker.

620
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,170
So I was like super impressed with him
against Justin gauging it looks. Yeah.

621
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:26,940
Fuck he's, she's fantastic. Who's getting
paid? He's got a great fight coming up.

622
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:30,840
Who's Kate? You fighting? Katie's
fighting someone really good. Oh,

623
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,440
it's our post
ads.

624
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,930
I hope he wrestles.
Interesting. Saint Peter,

625
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,880
the bar blows is going to go.
You like leg kicks. Oh Man.

626
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,530
Check these out. You can't see
your wrestling thinks he can kick.

627
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,520
Fantastic. Let's play like Django and uh,

628
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,310
that's when we're showing
me like what those,

629
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,710
those low kicks there like the details,

630
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:05,520
the details of where you kick your leg up,
nerves.

631
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,370
Your nerves are so exposed with that.

632
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,010
Get Premus what he did to Michael
Chandler literally cut his fucking leg and

633
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:15,410
again with Dj and so Hutto first
fight or first? First round.

634
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,260
The second fight. Ugh. That's a terrible
kick. I've never been hit by one of those.

635
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,680
I don't know what it feels like. He
said worse than kicking the knee. Yeah.

636
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:25,350
You know the thing about kicking the knee,
it's hard to fuck your knee up.

637
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,410
Like you can hyper extend
the knee with a side kick.

638
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:33,330
You could fuck someone's knee up that
way, but oh, okay. Just got tagged or no,

639
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,980
he's all right.
How dare

640
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,350
you. Oh, oh.

641
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,340
Oh, your kid, dude. If he gets him here.

642
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,430
Oh, that was unbelievable. He's
got to put that leg hook in.

643
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,760
He's got to put it in and
flatten them out. Oh yes. Oh No,

644
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:59,350
no. He's on the chin. But Arizona Chin.
There you go. Oh, he's cranking that neck.

645
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,610
Oh, trying to get choked
up. Body triangle.

646
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,060
Cranky.
So he's now he's

647
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,850
guilty.
That's okay.

648
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:28,690
It's a beast that's over right there. It's
got a hook. The leg that's over right.

649
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,160
Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe weights.

650
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,290
He's probably a check that's
checking to see if he's okay.

651
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,500
Gave him a thumbs up.
Oh

652
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,990
God.
This is the height.

653
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,730
Is that fighting Brian?
That's from a guy who trained to top team.

654
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,660
I can tell you that's a fight.

655
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,540
I mean I can top team in coconut
grove or wherever the fuck it is.

656
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,800
It's such a nice facility.

657
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,040
I wish Amanda Nunez walked in and beat
the shit out now. I was looking for her.

658
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,170
I did see junior desantos walking around
and saw junior and that was pretty cool.

659
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:11,100
I would love to see them as much
bigger than you. Bubba Jr. I was sick.

660
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,230
I took him in. I took him
in. Now he's training a lot,

661
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:18,520
but I took him in this way like with your
eyes or your mouth. Well, with my book,

662
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,470
I outlined in my online with my hands

663
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,860
and I was producing estrogen when
I saw him. But uh, he, he was,

664
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,750
uh, his, he looks, he looks more
menacing. Dang man. What am I,

665
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,380
he looked at me and he
goes, hey, tell shop.

666
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:35,140
I'm not hearing a fucking peep out of him.
No doubt.

667
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,460
I'll be in Miami March 16th to the
18th to standup. So come see it.

668
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,340
Whoa. Yeah. There you go.
What are you at Miami and pro?

669
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,300
Yeah, I can't damn bro. What the fuck?

670
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,860
Evernotes and your club.
It's supposed to be haunted.

671
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,870
It was so bad. It was so bad. I last, last
time I was there, I go, I go, I'm done.

672
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,610
I go, I'm never coming back.
And they were laughing. I go,

673
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,110
you people are too stupid. I go,
I can't come back here anymore.

674
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,980
They were laughing and he never came back.
Never go catch the joke.

675
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:11,000
Never does my answer. No, I
did Miami last year. I did a,

676
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,940
I did a theater when I was, I had a
great time. Just, I'm the only bullshit,

677
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,150
but they're, they're a little crazy.
I was doing right before my special,

678
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,950
I was doing those, a cell phone bag. So
they had to put the thing. That's right.

679
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,770
So to use your phone you
have to leave the theater.

680
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,380
So you would think they would just sit
down and watch your show everywhere else.

681
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:29,410
That's the case. Not in Miami and
Miami. They kept leaving the bar

682
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,080
and having a fucking parties in

683
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,540
like the greenhouse
gases. Yeah. Oh my God.

684
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,250
These going back and forth and back and
forth. Not too flat ass to be found.

685
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,630
Not a flat ass to be found in Miami.

686
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,140
And it's my maybe my favorite place in
many ways. That's where Tiffany had just,

687
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,590
she just had a really bad new year set.
She just didn't prepare, I guess. Right.

688
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,830
[inaudible] trunk.
She's also Doolan movies.

689
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,050
There's a sneaky thing that happens,
man,

690
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,600
when you're doing movies and
then you become a huge star.

691
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:58,460
So you're doing these
big theaters as well,

692
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,420
but you're not really doing enough
standard to do those big things.

693
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:06,860
You kind of fucking do mad reps to do
big places cause you not the same thing.

694
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,130
Are you watching? Yeah. Bang away
at his head. Brian by Marina. Oh,

695
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:14,470
big elbow by Lou k. You don't see a lot
of Mohawks these days. When I do see one,

696
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,680
you know he means business.
We're going to just turn and walk,

697
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:19,760
turning away and getting them back to the
center. So you're going to deep breath.

698
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,100
But when Lucas throwing
elbows like that from enclose,

699
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,490
maybe he's really good at ovals or maybe
heard is a Mohawk. No, none other one.

700
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,300
Okay. I can just sit there and kind of
take those shots off his gloves and he,

701
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,450
Ooh,
nice chance he's not ooh elbow,

702
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,950
but not afraid to just sit there.

703
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,583
Si.

704
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,760
Well, he's also probably really tired from
the choke and tasks and then the Darcy

705
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:48,120
attempt in the first round.
Nice.

706
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,550
He's not one of these guys are worried
about leg kicks. Are they? Oh, nice.

707
00:42:52,551 --> 00:42:53,540
Front kick to the body.

708
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,470
Yeah.

709
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,730
I feel like front kicks. The body is one
of the most underused weapons, you know.

710
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:01,470
That was one of the things
I was so impressed with.

711
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:06,220
Barboza in the hang man fight in
the Dan Hook fight. Oh my God.

712
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Fucking body kit. What's the
fucking, oh Paul, a fight.

713
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,890
Paul Felder said I was stage a cage side
when Paul Felder was taking those kicks

714
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:18,150
to the body from Barbosa. Oh my goodness.
And his skin was so red. And I said,

715
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,460
I was like, you seem like you didn't
even notice. He goes, dude, they hurt.

716
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,700
They hurt so fast tonight. Yeah, it
does change. That guy's a killer.

717
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,250
He's like one, one from fucking, I feel
like being that guy. He's a monster man.

718
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,550
Yeah, but gauging knocked him cold.
Remember the last fight? Yeah.

719
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,240
You didn't get to see how you recommend
we won like 10 before then. Oh yeah.

720
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,080
He's a piece, dude. He's a long,
tall dude too. That's right.

721
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,660
Gauging off the fuck of
knocked the fuck out of him.

722
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,600
I've never seen so many fucking
foul balls being thrown at.

723
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,030
You and Barbara arena have
the same chest. They are true.

724
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,700
You're so rude. What? Know that
it's not a bad thing. I know cars.

725
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,540
Barberino mashed my chest, a big chess,
getting Brian something nonstop. Brian.

726
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:03,670
Barbara is a professional fighter,
but doesn't mean he has a good chance.

727
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,650
Painters and granny that are body.

728
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,770
Then I'll take my shirt off
right now and put it up against,

729
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,530
I'll stand right next to him and you tell
me if I don't have a better Bob. Do it.

730
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:11,364
Bitch,

731
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,040
you got the same chest. Let me see.
Throw some punches. Oh, you look better.

732
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,230
You look very good. Brian's
shredded, but he looked very good.

733
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,403
Very good.

734
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,000
You're very slim around the forums
and the wrists doesn't look what,

735
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,130
you'd have a lot of pop two
shots. I'm relaxed. No. Yeah.
You know, flexing it all

736
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,210
choke you the one hand,
you're very jacked.

737
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,150
You know what's confusing to me is
the hand, the hand to risk ratio.

738
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:54,710
I don't see a lot of power coming
out of those hands. Take your forums.

739
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:58,890
So they're so small. They're so small.
They're like, you could pick locks,

740
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,430
you could pick locks with your wrists.
He does have a better body though.

741
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,750
You do have a better butter camera. Well,
no, not the set it up better than Luke.

742
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,480
I'm going to get on tier two and then
for gay Vicenta Lucchese his name.

743
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,020
Gentlemen, please bodies
better news. Oh, Luke,

744
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,160
better than yours by
Rina give you a rescue.

745
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,290
Was there playing rock 'em
sock 'em robots here, man.

746
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,910
They're just standing right
in front of each other.

747
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,550
You wouldn't you think that Luca would
want to take this fight to the ground?

748
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,090
I mean, you almost fucking choked him out.
Hey, did I get that he's tired. I mean, I,

749
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,680
I really do get that, but I mean, I want
to see it temps like whiskey, Eddie.

750
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,410
It sucks.
It's filled with series.

751
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,560
You know where it comes from?
Thirsty comes from abortion fetuses.

752
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,510
Oh, how that, wow. She's
brought it dish. Oh,

753
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,770
looky with a big left hook.
Oh Jesus. These guys are just,

754
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,820
I rarely see a fight where guys just
standing right in front of each other like

755
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,890
that
pushed him down.

756
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,060
Yep. Did they hate each other?
What's going on? Fighters,
Bro. Professional fighters.

757
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah. True. You don't see a lot
of guys just swing in these days.

758
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,980
Mm pressive Brian Count.
Did you,

759
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,830
did you watch MVP versus Paul daily
lives did not watch it. And I,

760
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:21,270
I only wonder how someone like MVP
will do if he ever goes to the UFC.

761
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:23,440
I want to see him fight guys like me.
I'm not assigned yet.

762
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,720
Tournament though that belt.
It's legitimacy. It is legit
as fuck. He's a killer.

763
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:31,950
He's not ready. He's not Michael
Venom page. You get no it.

764
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,930
And after watching daily take them down,

765
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,400
you got to think what Tyron would do to
him or would Uzman would do to him or

766
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,590
Colby Covington and he was
really the shit wrestler. But,

767
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,550
but the thing about Tyron, Tyron still
legit wrestle with nuclear weapons.

768
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,650
It's not just these going to punch you.

769
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,950
He's going to put your fucking job
all in through the back of your head.

770
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,450
And he's a phenomenal boxer, like
struck fucking Wonderboy rock driveway,

771
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:56,760
which is impossible to do one.
Wonderboy,

772
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,960
how about he sat down and tilt down with
one shot? Correct. One shot in the fight.

773
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,170
Dude. Imagine. Imagine Darren till Mvp.

774
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,890
Tyron is like these most Jack.
It's like the best body competition.

775
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:11,760
It's like first of all,

776
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,240
you got to give it all to the
Cuban heel over Merrill winds,

777
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:20,130
best body competition, parish rock
colds, right behind them please. Bigger,

778
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:25,010
taller. It's a different thing.
He still looks like models. Great.

779
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,130
He's got a beautiful body.

780
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,160
But when Yoel Romero were talking freak
with bikini briefs on you like you're

781
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:34,930
talking to take it. Yeah,
that's fair. What is that?

782
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,490
Oh,
hold my cucumber.

783
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,810
And then Brock Lesnar,
he goes, hold my d bar

784
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,100
and Allister
and there'd be,

785
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,600
nobody had a better body than over him
when he was ubering. Nobody can fail.

786
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,930
But he kept bringing up on it.
Pretty Boring.

787
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,640
No, no, no. [inaudible] was
ridiculous. But you're well, just as a,

788
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,410
as a perfect specimen,

789
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,830
that cute whenever
everyone was 265 pounds.

790
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:17,800
Shradda fortunate jazz.

791
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,380
When he's standing on the
scales and he's flexing,

792
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:23,110
I remember being behind him when he
was waning. Just blink and going,

793
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,810
what in the fuck am I looking at?
What is this?

794
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,280
Even Brock closers like what you see Ya,

795
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,620
I was so pumped for that fight cause
that was his UFC debut and his UFC debut

796
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,740
against Brock Lesnar. I was like,
I was so pumped for that fight.

797
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:37,950
And both of them went on that saucy sauce.

798
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,710
The sauce is like a fucking
grizzly bear as well.

799
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,630
Where's that wine for wine, Bro? Was
that one for you bro? What up, bro?

800
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,710
I'm drinking whiskey. I'm doing that
too. I thought it was Ireland over there.

801
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:53,200
I didn't free. We're free to do whatever
we want. We're, we're Americans.

802
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:56,950
We pay taxes. Can we get,
can we get some more whiskey?

803
00:48:56,951 --> 00:49:00,380
Men Don't want no more or less. You're
good. Oh, right hand by Luke cage.

804
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:08,080
These fights are both all five
minutes. Five rounds today. Gentlemen,

805
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,350
what's, what's more fun? You
can hook them up with more.

806
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,490
You're a bad person. Bad Person. Cheers.

807
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,410
My favorite, my favorite, we were
talking about this before we got here.

808
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:26,520
My favorite, it's the best. It's the best.

809
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,930
I love doing podcasts. I love doing
podcasts with everybody, but man,

810
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:34,450
there's something special about these.
Look that upward elbow,

811
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:38,080
Anderson Silva style dude Anders
and we haven't talked to us.

812
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:39,850
Anderson looked good.
He looked very good.

813
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,570
He looked very good like stopping or
didn't be like an old whether they know or

814
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:46,030
something like that was a good go.
Yeah, I mean Anderson look a little,

815
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,350
I mean he looked a little overmatched
in terms of like technique cause style.

816
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:55,300
Bender is a legitimate world class
world championship caliber kickboxer but

817
00:49:55,301 --> 00:50:00,070
Anderson was hanging in there with them
and answer and also try God look at

818
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:04,390
Ariadne behind like good lower.
That is reduced to Joe Behind on what?

819
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:08,150
In the fuck. That's so stupid.
That's a scares fighter of all time.

820
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,440
How do you score this fight?
How would you ever score this one?

821
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,850
I'm looking at who's going to win this
fight it. It's impossible. It's scoring.

822
00:50:14,851 --> 00:50:15,710
Very good question.

823
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,850
It would suck to be a judge if
you saw us in a movie you back.

824
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:21,130
Nobody punches the one at a
topic about the ties to things.

825
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:23,110
I watched some glory fights
today while I was working out.

826
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,800
Two things that Gloria does better than
U of c. One five judges, not three.

827
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,970
Brilliant to open scoring. Love
it. What do you mean open scoring?

828
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,610
You know who's noting going on, you
know what's going on after every round,

829
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,110
the judges have to put up their scores,

830
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,260
so if you see a fucking domination and
then you see ten nine for the wrong guy,

831
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:46,180
the whole crowd and go, what the fuck? I
love pressure on, I love it. I love it.

832
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,320
Love it. Two, it's the commission

833
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,700
and by the way, you know the best place
to to do that kind of changes right here.

834
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:59,580
Andy foster is like one
of the most proactive, uh,

835
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,650
ahead of the curve intelligent
guys in all. And you know,

836
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:07,010
and Bob Bennett over in Nevada is
just as good. He's excellent to,

837
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,100
they can do this, but if, if
Nevada need to vote on it,

838
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,160
if Nevada does everybody who
was going to do it? Everybody.

839
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,260
So we just need to have that entirely
true because of the new rules.

840
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,530
The new rules are not decide. Yeah,
they're not adopted by everybody.

841
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,980
Adopted by Nevada.
Are they the unified rules in Nevada too?

842
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,630
Nevada, Nevada. And I
say I just say Las Vegas,

843
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,950
Las Vegas,
Nevada.

844
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:37,070
And I say Notradame do you
say to Martin too much on t.

845
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,490
Dot. No, I, I, I've done Chili.

846
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,140
Do you say it?

847
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,700
[inaudible] I say that and
I say quiet and Paraguay.

848
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,460
What it what about Afghanistan?
Afghanistan,

849
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:52,670
of course I always have enough clothes
pull what I say and I say, and I say,

850
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,140
Oh God damn it, this fight,
this fight. This is insane.

851
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,340
These guys are wrong. This is not
the way to file a long term career.

852
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,660
If you want that $50,000 bonus,
you want to play jeopardy when you're 40.

853
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,090
It's a bad move. How tough
are these dudes? Yo, you know
what I saw the other day?

854
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,340
I saw a wolf blitzer play jeopardy.
He Lo,

855
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,220
he ended up at the end
of it with minus 40.

856
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,690
Oh my God. Holy Shit. Cat.

857
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,370
Amazing fight.

858
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Both of them look like not
there because the clock was off.

859
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:34,490
So in less than two seconds to stop,
they stopped.

860
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,810
They stopped. You can't, you can't stand
and bang like that. They stopped it.

861
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,700
That's not good. Sometimes you
can. Wow. Raleigh. They said, Woo.

862
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:48,110
She just looked at his quarter goes,
whew. Wow. Does he Brazilian too?

863
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,640
Did you see fucking, uh, how bad ass
or Brazilians just overall just stop.

864
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:56,550
Just stop and think about how many bad
motherfuckers came out of Brazil coming

865
00:52:56,551 --> 00:53:01,220
out. Europe ain't coming out of Belize.
Belize coming out of Columbia. Hold on.

866
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,860
There's a few.
I'm sure there's a few,

867
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,710
but the majority are all
coming out of pursuit.

868
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:10,340
How about the hose in Brazil as well?
That's just the whole nation hose.

869
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,440
Or the girls need help with their rent.
Take it easy.

870
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:19,580
It's not, usually they'll
have that. It's, it's real.

871
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,810
It's real. Get it straight reos
real nice. Remember the difference?

872
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,840
Cause they're their church is the beach.
Look at it.

873
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:29,870
So everyone got to look good in Rio.
Mm.

874
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,260
Boom. There's the right hand. Boom.

875
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:40,040
There's another neat on the way down. Oh,
the mouthpiece went flying. That's it.

876
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,700
Stopped it. Get this good.
Oh my God. And this is,

877
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,730
they had been playing rock 'em sock.
'Em robots for three fucking rounds.

878
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:52,760
You can't fight him. That's crazy. That's
it. That's it. Stop it. It's like though.

879
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,460
And good for ESPN to the common
fans watching going. Yeah.

880
00:53:56,461 --> 00:54:00,100
Suck each other in the face. She
hit him. Bruce. Head off Bro. Bro.

881
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:01,950
Do you could do that.
Do it for Georgia.

882
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,880
Nevada state athletic commission adopts
new unified rules. Oh, excellent.

883
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,640
When does this, what does this
labeled? Uh, November 13th 20.

884
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:13,750
So 2018 okay. So they finally adopted
it. So they're going to do in this optic.

885
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,950
It's do the grounded fighter
rule. Oh, interesting too.

886
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,990
They took the new rules,

887
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:23,991
but they don't accept
the one point down rule

888
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,510
glory does
that grounded final rule.

889
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,500
It's a Gig. It's too gray. It's
too much of a gray area. Dude.

890
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:36,570
How about that says fucking
Paul Daley protests.

891
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:41,160
MVP loss says bell are rigged it
to protect their investment. Ah,

892
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,970
Paul daily. You're a monster. When
he's, when he's on, he's a monster.

893
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,220
There's no man on the planet who,
I mean,

894
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:49,380
think about what he did to Lorens Larkin,
right?

895
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:53,760
Lorens Larkin is a really tactical
striker and Paul daily time he lands that

896
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:57,090
fucking left hand on you. You, you forget
your child. Childhood has been fighting.

897
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:58,380
He,
he's been disappointed.

898
00:54:58,381 --> 00:55:02,160
He says MMA politics and
Beltour protecting their
investment. I fell in one,

899
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:06,470
three rounds to, to my opinion, I beat
that full, really close fight. I can't,

900
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,430
I can't see how he thinks
he went three rounds.

901
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:12,420
So like if they give to daily Mikaila,
fine. We all lost the fans loss.

902
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:15,810
But if you how he says three, I'm like,
all right, that's fine. I don't know.

903
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,770
It was a bullshit fight all the way
around. It was, it wasn't the best fight.

904
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,830
It wasn't a lot going on. Well, I've
nothing, nothing wasn't the best.

905
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:27,750
Cautious is watching two
blue belts grapple daily,

906
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:30,030
kept trying to gala daily,
took him down,

907
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:33,360
then he lost position once an MVP
got on top of him and beat his ass,

908
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,060
got his back. I thought he was
gonna choke him out. Me Too.

909
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,760
That they had a naked different,
yeah.

910
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,810
I was amazed that Paul Daley was able
to take them down though and we really

911
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:44,760
made some big improvements
in his wrestling. I mean,

912
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,700
I guess maybe felt like after the John
Fitch fight, if you can't beat them,

913
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:51,930
join them. What a great did. This
is a great fight, man. Yeah. Wow.

914
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:56,580
Six seconds left. What? Wait,
was it 70? Uh, yeah, that's 70

915
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,970
sorry. The House 10 at American top
team. Yeah. And when's his hand?

916
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:07,200
He just finished working out. And when you
see them, like when they're off season,

917
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:11,610
they're just, they just, you're like, how
are you bringing to the table? It's ugly.

918
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:15,570
Stay by my God. I was like,
you fund at one 55 he looks,

919
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,860
he's so thick. And I didn't even recognize
him. He should go. I go, I think.

920
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,890
And he goes, yeah, it's dealer.
I was like, why not? Yeah, he,

921
00:56:22,891 --> 00:56:24,910
well he looked huge when
he's weighing one 55 yeah.

922
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,140
He would get on the scale and I was like,
what does that, what do you hollow? Oh,

923
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,650
that's cool. So one of those
chocolate chocolate Easter bunny.

924
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,870
That light. I asked for it. I hate the
fucking hollow ones. I like a solid,

925
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,870
the hollow ones. The ones fucked my
teeth up or asked first years, bro.

926
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:48,700
I go ass. Really? The big girl.

927
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,560
Yeah. I know your skin looks up.
What's going on, Bro? You look good.

928
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,160
You look tight. Oh really?
Shiny. And it looks very well.

929
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,180
I've been worked out over a
week. No, maybe that's it.
That is just stop working.

930
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,670
Healthy body's recovering.
Maybe I was moving. I haven't
been able to work it out.

931
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,100
It's good pizza every day. Maybe that's,
well good. You have a rosy complexion. Oh,

932
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,780
I'll take it, man. Look very healthy.

933
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,960
I'm just saying with the
cold weather you look 23

934
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,990
maybe it's the booze and the rest. I have
been drinking and sit in a hot tub. Eat,

935
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:25,720
eat dough and cheese and tomatoes.
Body likes cheese. Anyway,

936
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,910
nice to interview both of them.

937
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,030
John Anna Cause Interviewing Barbara
but it must be from the truck.

938
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,000
They must be from the truck out of
respect. Who has it? They give you?

939
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,640
Sometimes I'm walking to the cage and
they give me the thing in my ear winner

940
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:40,140
and loser hundred school. Yeah.

Phoenix right now,

945
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,370
although I would want to see those fights
live and I'd love to call those fights

946
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,080
slide. I'm good with 10 a year.
That's what I like. I like 10 a year.

947
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,890
But did they use a lot o chew and they

949
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,800
Once a month. What? Just the paper? Two
months. Two months off. Once a month.

950
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,560
Listen man,
I was thinking that I was on my way out.

951
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,850
I was really thinking I was on my way out,

952
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:16,900
but I still love it and I love it way
more now because I don't have to do it as

953
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:20,650
much and I love it way more now because
we do this because we can do all this

954
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:24,910
shit talking and have fun and be silly.
It's so fun.

955
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,580
What am I doing this for? Some of the
big boxing like to Mikey Garcia. Yes.

956
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,740
That's good Mike.
You got to see if it's Earl Spencer.

957
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,480
Dude, he's got light brown hair. No, get
good. Well, it's a little bit of gray,

958
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,350
handsome son of a bitch. Damn. He looks
good. He pulls off. It's go stash like no,

959
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,810
I want to talk to him on the podcast.

960
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:49,750
I want to reach out to him and get him
on because he had some amazing stories

961
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:52,900
about wrestling back when he
was wrestling and you know,

962
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:54,850
he would go international
wrestling. No, no, no.

963
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:59,530
We're starting to get more current.
I would love to get marker on.

964
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,290
I would love to get him on.
How's he doing now? I don't know.

965
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,810
Here's the in Phoenix because he selling,
he was selling cars.

966
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,390
Last time I heard a Z. I've heard
some classic stories about them too.

967
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:13,210
It's not Jeff Manson at uh, I didn't
say the Russian. Yeah, he's at,

968
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,300
I think he's a Russian citizen,
but I saw him Russian citizen.

969
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,470
He seems Russian songs.

970
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,650
There's a video of him driving around in
a Russian car singing a Russian. Yeah,

971
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:25,240
yeah, yeah. Here's the, I love this
guy. He might be on the, on the list.

972
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:25,771
We then Betty,

973
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:29,930
you remember when he took off all his
clothes and left Abu Dhabi in 2003?

974
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,300
Remember Eddie beat Heuler
we were down in, uh,

975
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,240
in South Paulo and a Monson got robbed.
So Munson to fucking to protest,

976
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,730
took off all his fucking clothes
and threw a shorts and tennis shoes,

977
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:44,300
like a shade polar
bridge. He was so, so big.

978
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:49,610
North south choke, the months choke, you
know, I asked Eddie at the time, I'm like,

979
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:52,280
is that in a legit choke? And he's
like, I think he kinda gooned them.

980
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,800
And it was before Marcello
started tapping guys with that.

981
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:55,843
You remember that shit?

982
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,180
We used to think that the north
south truck was a goon was just,

983
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,870
he just grabbed his hand and
squeeze the shit out of it.

984
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,980
Like Martin mark curb or Mark
Coleman style you have wants,

985
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:07,660
it looks like he's in shape. He
couldn't look thicker. She's a bit,

986
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:11,420
you need to pass a test to oh yeah,
he'll pass the test. He test positive.

987
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,390
That's the test.
Like I will for wheat

988
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:20,000
Novitsky but if they tried
saying like, nope, no, no,
no, no. We just, no, no. Yeah,

989
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,230
he definitely looks like he's, yeah, he's,
yeah, he's, he's probably 45 and he's,

990
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:27,920
he's in very, I saw 82 weekend I
was at it. He's older than that.

991
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,970
I think we're almost 50 yeah, probably
because he just, he fought chocolate.

992
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:33,890
Dell's a light heavyweight
way back in the day.

993
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,370
He remembers old school man who
is in the UFC at all the statutes.

994
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:40,230
You're seeing a picture of him when the
protesters and he's fucking like this

995

and that and he's got that fucking the
capitalism tattoo on the back of the and

996
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,970
the head gun to the head says capitalism.

997
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,950
It's a guy with a holding
a gun to your head.

998
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:52,860
Like he's crazy Marxist like free day.

That's dark dude. Yeah. Well this has
allied with America's crone. Next.

The munchies documentary on crone.

1014
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,110
What crone eats and his training
routine. It's amazing. You know, he's,

1015
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:58,970

1017
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,640

those other things. But yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1018
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,420
Love is fighting, not his
world, right? Yeah. Well,

1019
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:18,030
someone needs to take them up on
fucking hot air balloon. Well,

1020
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,040
that's what I'm saying.

1021
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,630
Anybody who tries to get away
with a crime. For example,

1022
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:24,250
like this Guy Jesse Smollett or whatever,
uh,

1023
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,100
how this is when I had our
notes or I'll fucking call it,

it just sounded Kellen I went hard like,
yeah.

1029
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,390
Some people were saying
online that it was like,

1030
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:53,340
like what happens when you let
actors write a script? Right, right.

1031
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,740
Bridget even worse, getting an actor
to try to get away with a crime.

1032
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,670
There are cops,

1033
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:04,170
Chicago cops because they haven't seen
everything cause they don't cause those

1034
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:06,740
guys don't study crime and you're new to
the game and you come and you're going

1035
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:11,440
to pull the wool over the Chicago police,
all those detectors. It's like me.

1036
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,920
I started fighting a little,
I saw some stuff on youtube.

1037

1046
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,740
Just like a Chinese finger
head tucked it in plain sight.

1047
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:53,310
Have you guys seen that on Netflix? So

You know what I am. I'm a
nice man. Check this out.

1065
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,810
This 12 year old girl drugs her,
she wakes up,

1066
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,920
she's strapped up and she's got the

Okay Dude, it's so interesting
dude. You're gonna,

1069
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,980
you're gonna f if you watch this,
the worst I've

1070
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,120
ever seen him. She, she
gets abducted and this guy,

1071
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,190
this guy makes her think that
she got abducted by aliens. So,

1072
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:30,370
and then the aliens tell her he's got
this on a tape recorder and she's tied up.

1073
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:32,160
She just asked Mr B.
He has names.

1074
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:37,170
Mr The guy who abducted her and the aliens
tell her that she must marry this man

1075
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,310
to save the world. And if anybody finds
out, yeah, well yeah, you have to have,

1076
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,480
she must have,
she must get pregnant by this guy,

1077
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:50,540
that guy that abducted
her and a sociopath. Yes.

1078
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,250
She believes it and falls in love with
the guy and she's in love with them for

1079
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,760
like four years cause she thinks
she has to save the world.

1080
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,910
He got her to think she
got abducted by aliens.

1081
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,870
What do you think is happening when
people say they get abducted by aliens?

1082
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:11,020
I can't get, I think
it's, it's uh, um, some,

1083
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:13,970
um, people, uh,

1084
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,040
high level people doing
experiments and getting them there.

1085
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,180
They're abducted them.
They're not being abducted by aliens.

1086
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:25,181
They're being abducted by people who
make them think they're getting more and

1087
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,380
more interested in more.

1088
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:29,050
Obviously they were just dreaming
because nothing happens to the physical.

1089
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,490
You know the thing about the alien
abductions and no, there's no evidence of,

1090
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,200
you look at lay people that
have been alien abducted,

1091
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,420
like there's no evidence they
actually leave their house.

1092
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,450
There's no like there's no hope,

1093
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:44,560
no alarms go off and see what happens
is we believe that really have a hold on

1094
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,810
when people sleep,
when people sleep,

1095
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:51,040
your brain produces all these
chemicals that make you dream, right?

1096
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:54,670
So all of these alien abductions, almost
all of them, this is a great cheese,

1097
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,370
three Kelvin, those cheeses, alien,

1098
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,580
these alien abductions all take
place while people are sleeping.

1099
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,520
It's real simple.
They're laying in bed at night.

1100
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,530
They have this unbelievable
realistic dream.

1101
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,540
They also have what's
called sleep paralysis.

1102
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,980
Sleep paralysis is something that
afflicts people where their semi awake and

1103
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:13,930
they can't move their
body because your body,

1104
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,920
your body's just like in a half state of
dreaming and awake. We called Rem sleep.

1105
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:21,630
So during this time your brain is
producing dimethyltryptamine. You're,

1106
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,560
you're producing DMT.

1107
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:26,380
So you're tripping your balls off and
you're having these weird fucking visions

1108
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:29,950
and you think your board space ships
and shit. That's a possibility.

1109
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,690
But after watching this documentary,
another possibility is that there, there,

1110
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:39,420
I'm drugging people and making
them think they use day getting.

1111
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,510
It could be anybody, bro. It could
be anybody. There is no, they did.

1112
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,930
Everybody's cool. Bruce
Buffer, grown gray, monochrome.

1113
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:51,980
I'm more excited about this fight
that I am the main. This is a coma.

1114
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,240
No,
tell her

1115
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,580
debut is like almost a Coleman and
this is probably the coal man. No,

1116
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,700
this isn't a Khomeini.
Felder floater.

1117
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:06,720
Vick looks finish and just ready.
He's a beautiful looking human,

1118
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:10,900
handsome, beautiful. Ever
seen his dad and his mom does.

1119
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:15,550
Mom was a as well. She
was, yeah. Wow. Gracie,

1120
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:20,300
level of girl that he would marry.
Think about that. Think about that.

1121
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:27,350
Who's doing Eddie? Are you chewing
on the microphone? Don't do that.

1122
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,260
Don't do that.
People get crazy.

1123
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,670
Good thing I don't read social media
and this kid is, this kid kills it.

1124
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:38,900
This guy's to be, this is a bad
motherfucker. He's a Vegan and Crohn's.

1125
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:42,830
A pescatarian. So this is one for the
people that don't read. I'll take pets.

1126
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:47,570
Please move it over to the fish.
A pescatarian thing I read me hurts me.

1127
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,490
Do pescatarians eat octopus guys,
I'm open to any fish eating a dolphin.

1128
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,550
It is, dude. I, they're too smart.
They can feel are smarter than Dolphin.

1129
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:02,240
So he didn't alien. I don't
need it anymore because I,
after I thought, here we go.

1130
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,930
Here we go. Come on. We'll pull guard.
Pull. Yeah, he'll get his clothes go out.

1131
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:11,960
Chrome Gracie's closed gardens in insane
so he will pull Gumbs submitted me from

1132
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:14,830
close guy. Yeah. He submitted to
believe that he submitted Jimmy.

1133
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,370
He submitted JT tours. He's one of
the best guys out there in Abu Dhabi.

1134
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:23,350
2013 in China from close.
What? I'm surprised he's not,

1135
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,200
he's not taking his dad's approach,
which is that front leg side kick.

1136
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,980
He does that. No, no he, oh shit. He hit
him in the left hand. He heard him Crozer

1137
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:36,170
oh shit. He's throwing some Kung
Fu cause Sarah saw some wild shit.

1138
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,380
He's got so much more experience.
It's so crazy

1139
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,610
fucking hammers.

1140
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,650
I wouldn't mind if he just shot for Gotcha

1141
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:55,630
clincher dude. Fuck yeah. He's
going to have to pull guard here.

1142
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:59,300
He's not going to be an easy take down.
He's got a sense of grace.

1143
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,400
You four minutes to work.
I need that last time.

1144
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:07,420
He's going to take your bag show Benevidez
took a guy down three or four times

1145
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:12,550
in his last fight with legit
move. Different animal though.

1146
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,200
He's a different animal on your back.

1147
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:17,590
This is a real world class
of mission strangled.

1148
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,460
Oh No.

1149
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,170
God is all over the ice cream.

1150
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:28,500
There's no way he's going to survive. He's
fuck you just know. You just hold that,

1151
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,460
hold that on.
Shut your

1152
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,480
eyes. Get full structure and he's
got three and a half minutes.

1153
01:10:36,481 --> 01:10:38,340
Shack and if viewers
corner, man, what'd you,

1154
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,510
you're fine.

1155
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:48,270
Oh Shit. It's over. Right, right.

1156
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,540
Listen, I bet everybody
could call. It's over now.

1157
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:58,530
Now it's 100% job set now it's completely

1158
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,810
fuck Alex.
Is Sarah so hot

1159
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,010
his head like what the fuck dude?
He,

1160
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,030
Alex just shook his head like
what the fuck that is the

1161
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:17,700
kind of sister Khabib phenomenon. Admit
as he touches you, you're, you're done.

1162
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:21,570
No touching on. That's a different
thing. He chose people out like no, no,

1163
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:23,490
it's a different thing.
I mean not like that.

1164
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,870
He just gets you in punches this
25 minutes. This is a certain flow,

1165
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,700
Lemmy sound when people chew
cheese on microphone. That's
really disgusting. Dude.

1166
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:37,440
That's so crazy. How good he is. Look at
this shit. He's so good. Look at this.

1167
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,460
He'll pull guard. Just basically
pulled guard right here to the ground.

1168
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,780
He's world class, man. It's a
different answer. She wouldn't do that.

1169
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,580
You wouldn't take a guy down.
Like if it was a wrestling match,

1170
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,870
it's this slow squeeze header.

1171
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,940
Gracie's doing a breakdown of
it right now guys, check it out.

1172
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:55,470
This is how it would happen.
Right now.

1173
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,020
We're gonna go with the
breakdown breakdown that's so on,

1174
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,670
but he's been graced with
amazing where they read,

1175
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,240
they could choke the shit out guys.
It's a huge win.

1176
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,210
That's a fucking big deal,
man. Sarah's is a good fighter,

1177
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,720
but he just know crazy Jujitsu.
Let's, let's go a step by step.

1178
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:15,390
You break that shit man. Fuck
is a spot. Um, shakes in there.

1179
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:18,830
I'm sure you know he's,
he's maybe not even watching.

1180
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,850
He's like surfing in Rio or some shit.
You might not even know he was there

1181
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,670
and the most beautiful
Brazilian. We know. Dude.

1182
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:29,860
There's no way I want to meet him.
I want us to talk to him,

1183
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:32,880
but there's no way that they wouldn't
show Hickson that you never met.

1184
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:37,200
Hixon we can set it up. My friend,
I love him. I want to meet him.

1185
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:42,270
He had the most interesting description
of how he finishes people. He goes,

1186
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:46,050
we started a neutral point. He goes,
and then we'd go to one and he goes,

1187
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:49,500
when I moved to one, I'm not
going back to zero. He goes,

1188
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:54,240
I'm moving to two and then to
go back on then checkmate. Yeah,

1189
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,830
and just going back,
he's also,

1190
01:12:55,890 --> 01:13:00,810
he's the fucking confidence
that confidence is a blue
cheese. What does it, some,

1191
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,170
some sort of a, he brought a
blue cheese when you're ready.

1192
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,090
Now are we all going to shut our ready
already got this beautiful cream,

1193
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,580
creamy French.
But then the crisis though,

1194
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,500
that's going to be too
much on the podcast.

1195
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:18,870
Don't even eat onions or your best case.
That like a weird thing. I don't need it.

1196
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:23,400
I don't need that onions either.
You and I have a lot in common.

1197
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:27,100
I love him though, right? Oh yeah. Okay.

1198
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,130
Yeah. I mean, I'm not on
John's knows doggy style. The
right just missionary. No,

1199
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,550
I sure do.
I'm an American man.

1200
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:42,110
Why wouldn't you eat ass
dog style American prefer

1201
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:47,280
we preached her legs up under the cheeks

1202
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:53,870
down like Gene Simmons. You touched
the bud a little bit and then that's,

1203
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,840
that's weak side. You go doggy style
eating ass. Let them know you love him.

1204
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,890
Know what's up.
Okay.

1205
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,060
For New Year's Eve, look at,
look at, look at Crohn's hair.

1206
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:08,670
Handsome bastards like his hair.
He just lets it go.

1207
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,800
School to Culver City in the house. Got
Out of grade school, got out of his, uh,

1208
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,250
out of the shower and just shook it.
Shook it out.

1209
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:20,200
You know it's in Culver city. I just want
to let you know that the earth is flat.

1210
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:24,610
Oh No, please don't do that
girl. Oh Dude. He's way down.

1211
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:26,890
He calls me up out of the blue.
He got it by now.

1212
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:29,980
You still feel that flat earth there.
You didn't want you to go for it.

1213
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:34,840
You need to go back, go back, go back
to standard glass pills for Santa Claus.

1214
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:38,200
And then finding doesn't say we're
off of it. Then you go back to Santa,

1215
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:40,030
cause I'm not even trying,
I'm not going to try and make a joke.

1216
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,480
I thought you were off. If some reason
nobody goes off it. What's your flag?

1217
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,990
And he's off spaces.
Santa Claus for adult now Eddie's off it.

1218
01:14:46,991 --> 01:14:50,310
But he has a following now of flat
earthers so he casts not shows.

1219
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,550
That's not true. He called his
bluff. You call his bluff on flat.

1220
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,690
You can't say it out loud.
Give me that. I can't eat.

1221
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,690
You can't eat crackers on here.
Never go to draw the line there.

1222
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:02,950
This is a softer cheese and I'm,
I'm getting this beautiful knife.

1223
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,760
A little bit tarnished. We
are going to have to clean
it. Kron Gracie, a shout out.

1224
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:08,990
You know, I was uh, I was uh,

1225
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:12,610
a little concern with chrome's fighting
career cause when he was on my podcast

1226
01:15:12,611 --> 01:15:16,250
when we were discussing flat earth,
he said that he doesn't know if,

1227
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:20,440
if fighting is for him. There's a
lot of pressure, the family pressure.

1228
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:24,100
And he was basically saying that he
likes living without any pressure and he

1229
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:25,570
doesn't know if he wants to keep fighting.

1230
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,460
But now you know when you listen to the
countdown show and the all that embedded

1231
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,740
stuff, he said no. He said, you know what?

1232
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:37,741
I realized that just teaching is like
every day is like groundhog day and I'm

1233
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:39,490
not at my best when I'm just teaching.

1234
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,040
I'm not my best when I'm
training for something.

1235
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,950
So I always have to be trained for
something. So I didn't realize,

1236
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:48,070
I realized I need to be fighting.
So when I heard her say that,

1237
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,090
know he's evolving and
figuring himself out. So this,

1238
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:56,830
this might be the beginning
of some championship shit
here for the UFC. Listen,

1239
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:00,130
if he gets his striking together and he
did tag because Sarah's with a couple of

1240
01:16:00,131 --> 01:16:03,360
punches. Everybody who goes to the
ground with this kid, it's, fuck,

1241
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,730
what weight class was this one?
40 45 yeah, but guess what?

1242
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:10,150
Good luck would Max Holloway Holla
at your boy? Yeah. Ooh, look,

1243
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:13,180
I would love to see, this
is to my, why do we do this?

1244
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,930
Why are you going to say fucking
Brian Ortega versus chrome?

1245
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:21,610
This was 45 40 45 oh shit.
You know when he was,

1246
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,190
when he lost, when he
was 12 years old. Um,

1247
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,620
he wasn't that into Jujitsu is a little,
he was, he wasn't, he was skateboarding.

1248
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,860
He was skateboarding and I, John, jock.

1249
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,750
We were outside of the
tournament and John Jock,

1250
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:39,550
we were walking and Kron Gracie at 12
came bias and skateboarding started doing

1251
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,770
some tricks and John,
I'll never forget the John Dracos.

1252
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:45,430
That's the one right there. That's the
one that's going to take over. Wow.

1253
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:46,264
I really,

1254
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:51,060
John's rock knew it cause he's really
tight with Hickson and a common sense.

1255
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:55,710
How long is a crime been striking? Do we
know? Well, you know, I mean he's years,

1256
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:00,360
five years, six years. He's been doing MMA
fights. He fought and rising, you know,

1257
01:17:00,361 --> 01:17:03,910
he fought a few fights.
The thing is like his striking his,

1258
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,190
like his father striking,
it's just to understand it.

1259
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,060
It's not really to do it in terms of like,
he's never going be close distance or

1260
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,380
get better to jail. He's never
going to stand in back. Yeah,

1261
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,840
to close distance and then grab you.

1262
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:18,740
And once you went to a year in big truck
even could be these district more than

1263
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:22,640
crone. Crone is just going to get
in and clinch up and like you said,

1264
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:26,450
go from step one, step two, step three,
not go backwards. He's dangerous.

1265
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,570
Can you just, it's gonna be
tough to beat. It's fuck yes.

1266
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:33,670
I wouldn't have been disappointed or
shocked if Alex Caceres escaped a couple

1267
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,650
times on the ground and
maybe stood up again.

1268
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,540
Maybe crone got them in the third round.

1269
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:41,090
I wouldn't have been that
surprised because Alex Concentra's,

1270
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:44,160
he's been fighting for so long. He
squirly on the code. That's not an easy,

1271
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,630
and you only have four or
five gate and some good guys,

1272
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:50,330
you may remember when
he beat Sergio Pettis,

1273
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:54,230
they look at that when Anthony
Smith knocked out shogun. Meanwhile,

1274
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:56,540
how good did it fuck it.
Shogun look in his last fight,

1275
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:01,370
Shogun has made some sort of a crazy
resurgence, man. Seriously? Yeah, man.

1276
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:02,061
His last fight.

1277
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:07,061
He was so savage who was so savage and
so did he pull up who shogun fight?

1278
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:11,270
Fuck someone. Good man. I thought he got
Merk. No, no, no, no, no. His last fight,

1279
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:14,180
he won by stoppage and he
looked like a fucking animal.

1280
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:17,100
He looked like the Shogun of old.
Those old guys who keep doing it. Like,

1281
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:22,150
what's that? I said Pedro Tyson.
Pedro. Oh, that's right. Or the mother.

1282
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,100
He's a motherfucker. Trey.
He beat me in Australia.

1283
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,520
Is this Guy gonna Fight Jon Jones.
That's what we're talking about.

1284
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:32,240
This would be a highlight. Who would
this gentleman be? I don't know. Smith.

1285
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:36,110
He's a beast man. He ends up being knocked
out. Shogun. He's a beast. He knock out.

1286
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:40,040
Shogun owes de Mer. Rashad, he's
a beast. He, he's, he's a very,

1287
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:43,400
very good fighter and I think he's the
type of guy that's going to rise to the

1288
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:46,880
occasion. I mean, I like, I like,
I don't really heads that. Yeah,

1289
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:49,700
I don't know if he's, oh, how
tall are you? How tall is he?

1290
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:51,050
I worked for the organization.
She looks scary.

1291
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:55,130
I don't know if he's a capable of beating
John Because I legitimately feel like

1292
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,650
John is not just the best
light heavyweight of all time.

1293
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:01,790
I think he's absolutely in
the conversation for the
best fighter of all time.

1294
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:05,480
I agree. There's three or four
guys that are in that conversation.

1295
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:08,361
Mighty mouse,

1296
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:11,700
who I think is the best representative of
martial arts I've ever seen. Candidate.

1297
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,520
There's no, no, I mean Keynes, the
best heavyweight have ever seen,

1298
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:19,910
but the best fighters I've ever seen,
I think fate or is in the conversation,

1299
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,820
and I think Anderson Silva,
when he was in his prime,

1300
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:27,710
when he was in his prime but prime, he
was a savage man. He was an assassin.

1301
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,700
Look at this. Cain Velasquez
showing up purple. Look at,

1302
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,860
look at the suite, not purple jacket. Woe.

1303
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:40,670
Lo can look Rockhold and Daniel Cormier,
he said when he was healthy,

1304
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:43,700
he was the baddest man on the planet.
Well, DC said to me, man, he goes,

1305
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,150
I can't beat that guy. Yeah. He goes,
what? Everyone tells me to change.

1306
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,120
I can't beat him. He goes, I
thought about that when I was,

1307
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:53,030
when I was training with him. He goes, I
can't beat him. Look at his corner, man.

1308
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:55,460
He's got his headphones on too. It's
like, fuck it. Whatever he's listening to,

1309
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:58,370
I'm going to something that's, Carmen
came. Slagged does a fantastic,

1310
01:19:58,371 --> 01:20:02,730
he's a fantastic looking past summit.
Here's the specimen of all specimen.

1311
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:05,250
He's great. He really
is, man. All this junk.

1312
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,830
We've got a Gal find Cortney
Casey all up in this bitch.

1313
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:15,020
She's a very good soccer player. NCAA
soccer player. Oh real while ago.

1314
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:18,870
Soccer translates by the way, what
they say, and Cynthia called Vo.

1315
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,220
She's a motherfucker, a little team,
Alpha male beast. She likes to fight to,

1316
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:28,110
that girl looks at scrap. This is good.
She doesn't choose a Diaz mentality.

1317
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,610
Yeah,
let's give these people some credit.

1318
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:32,100
Let's watch this fight and give me
some more wine because I'm drunk.

1319
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:37,170
I don't meet up. Get a little
thing to do after this.

1320
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:39,720
You want to get some steaks?
I can't wait till vision.

1321
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,340
My boyfriend Andy Stumpf is staying with
me, so he's here tomorrow on my podcast.

1322
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,560
He's doing your podcast.
He's a great guy.

1323
01:20:46,561 --> 01:20:49,280
I love having really good conversations
with that guy. He's really good.

1324
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:53,400
He stayed with you boyfriend and why
don't you come with me in the pod customer

1325
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:56,400

that, but I have a Comcast tomorrow.

1326
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,230
What is your podcast?
You son of a bitch was your pot.

1327
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:04,680
We haven't podcasting a long time.
Pug podcasts often you guys do podcasts,

1328
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:05,700
flattering the kid.

1329
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,580
Brendan Schaub and Brian can do a podcast
every Monday and Wednesday without

1330
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:12,390
fail. Damn. Every Monday,
Wednesday. How long are the podcast?

1331
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,820
They are as long as we choose three hours,
two hour nap,

1332
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,840
usually two hour and a
half to two max interest.

1333
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,320
Never longer than two interests that
they can remember that so many to too.

1334
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,910
Usually hour and a half being grew by
33% this year. That I said it out loud.

1335
01:21:23,911 --> 01:21:27,750
I don't care. All right. You and Krista,
Leah doing some standup together.

1336
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,570
You podcasts through by 33% this year.
Wow.

1337
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,330
That's what Brandon are mostly Brendan.
It was all brand.

1338
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,620
He rubbed a business and let's be
honest, I show up now. Here's the thing.

1339
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,720
I tried to get involved with. Watch
this. I got like this. I go, ah,

1340
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,660
you need any help with the business?
He goes, not really your thing. Is it

1341
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:49,280
a, it's why I don't have
to do local press and why.

1342
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:52,830
I basically sold out the West Palm
Beach Improv, which I've never done,

1343
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:56,880
which is the adulation for me. Yeah,
that's huge. And that about 30 years ago.

1344
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,000
I know. I know. I'm missing,
I'm way behind. You're the
canary in the coal mine.

1345
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,100
Thanks for [inaudible] on all that

1346
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,170
bunch of those.
That was a great club called beach.

1347
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:14,280
Well, Paul Beach, if you have five
shows, you got to sell about 45

1348
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:19,740

5,500 tickets,

1349
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,200

Just what?

1350

2,500 tickets to sell up on show so that
we're doing a show in Spokane at four

1351

1356
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:53,340
You'll sell that motherfucker
out when the sun is still out.

1357
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,850
It's a little bit tough for
common for stoners. That's true.

1358
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,450
What are you talking about? Bert?
Kreischer does a morning thing though.

1359
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:02,650
I always did those.
Fucking Doug Benson,

1361
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,640
the afternoon on Sunday spoken is
actually a fun place. I was just there.

1362
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:11,590
Spokane is great.
I've never been in.

1363

I and I drove down to Coraline
Coraline and beautiful. Amazing.

1364
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:18,820
I'm doing Spokane somewhere. I left.
Lane is like God's calling Jude.

1365
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:23,000
I want to move. You're going to buy
a place. Where's the Mexican? Yeah.

1366
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:27,550
Quarter Lane. Next to Kanye. Yeah.
Wait, this is in Washington. Uh,

1367
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:31,800
that would be Idaho. Idaho
is a beautiful dude. Amazing.

1368
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:36,190
Amazing. I want to move there. It's
gorgeous. Let's get a pie in a heartbeat.

1369
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,930
What do we to do? We'd have
to get all the homes, bro.

1370
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,400
Listen, I had a friend of mine who went
there and took a picture of the lake.

1371
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,310
This lake, a hundred foot deep. You
could see the bottom of the wall.

1372
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,580
That's amazing. Great
restaurants. Still clear.

1373
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,160
You could see the bottom of the
water. Yeah, they beat you would love,

1374
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:57,700
it's like a great restaurant shopping I
never heard of because they want to keep

1375
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:01,360
it [inaudible] bro Bro. Yeah. I
already started looking at property.

1376
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,890
There is one issue. It's like a, a
stomping ground for white supremacists.

1377
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,910
Like were quarterly and Idaho.
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1378
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,390
Don't let that scare you.
So, so Friday, Friday,

1379
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:15,100

1382
01:24:22,721 --> 01:24:26,170
March 9th the Spokane Comedy Club. We need
to have that. Yeah, I love that place.

Four 20 in the afternoon. I shouldn't
have said that, but uh, yeah,

1385
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:37,870
we're going to try that shit. I'm at a
table open or more than once in my life.

1386
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:42,850
I'll be at the, nobody starts Thursday.
I'll be at the vogue theater in Vancouver.

1387
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,520
Oh, this Wednesday I'll be
the ice house in Pasadena.

1388
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,860
That's the only show that we just,
we haven't even announced it yet.

1389
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,120
He'd go to the Ice House website because
a Monday night at the comedy store sold

1390
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:56,350
out Tuesday night at the Improv is hold
up. You got a spot on that ice house? Yes.

1391
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:01,770
100% 100% what's going to attempt 100%
you're in the one on one Wednesday night,

1392
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:04,723
10:00 PM

1393
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:11,130
10 like a fight companion show fucking
ice house and it's Wednesday and that

1394
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,500
Wednesday night. Okay, I can do that.
I don't think I'm flying to Vancouver.

1395
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:18,250
Don't be scared.
I know when you're lying bro.

1396
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:22,860
We actually did do a
fight this fall planned.

1397
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:25,460
It just happened on one of the Sam show.
You want a sandwich?

1398
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,170
I'm my fucking do it.

1399
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:33,520
A bright flash like a motherfucker.
You know what?

1400
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,050
I don't believe in anything you believe
in, but like I like to keep it on down.

1401
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,680
We live on a ball and all that shit.

1402
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,580
You really don't believe
you're not serious and

1403
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:51,040
he's kind of a meant to be meant to
compliment. I get drunk. I get confused.

1404
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,320
I just, I just want to
cause any, I mean any of it.

1405
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:58,230
Some serious conversation and there's
some stuff I do agree with Eddie on just

1406
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:01,990
certain stuff but can talk. I can talk
about the soap. I don't wanna die.

1407
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:06,590
So with certain ones with like the flat
earth is right there in the middle. Man,

1408
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:09,590
I'm a middle anymore than anybody thinks.
Oh, Brandon's right fucking there.

1409
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:13,550
But what my point was, we don't,
when it comes to our beliefs,

1410
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,530
we're on opposite ends
of the fucking spectrum.

1411
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:17,240
But you guys said that he fucks with you.

1412
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:20,480
But that doesn't mean that I'm not
going to compliment you when I,

1413
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:23,540
when I see you live, dude,
you fucking smash dude.

1414
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,650
Fucking crush as serious.

1415
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,140
Believe we live on a ball and all that
shit. But I didn't wait until every,

1416
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,030
I think politically we're pretty far off.
I am.

1417
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:39,090
I think you're a socialist.
Socialist.

1418
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:47,930
They got them wrong.
Socialist.

1419
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:52,340
I thought you are. You out of your
fucking give that vibe off. Fuck

1420
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:57,290
both of you. Stop. Stop. No one
talks. He's fucking with both.

1421
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:03,090
Okay.
Spill

1422
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:08,840
table up bro. Listen to me right now.
Look at me right now. I'm an American.

1423
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:12,930
I don't. I believe in, in
in the constitution. Yes.

1424
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,320
You believe in gun rights.
Okay.

1425
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,630
I'm, I'm a very, I'm not, I don't
believe now that he's free speech.

1426
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:29,400
Yeah, Bro. A coffee. El
Cortez. You like her?

1427
01:27:29,401 --> 01:27:33,160
I don't like her. I love you. But
was 28 which has not about the,

1428
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:37,670
I know I was really into her until she
had this clause. No, listen, listen.

1429
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:38,623
This is what I meant.

1430
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:42,380
Young people that are interested in
helping people and changing the world.

1431
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,420
I don't agree with a lot of her ideology,

1432
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:48,290
but she had this one clause that was
people who were unwilling to work.

1433
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:51,540
She wanted to give money to
people who are unwilling to,

1434
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,790
we want this knife. I mean, how about,

1435
01:27:55,910 --> 01:28:00,560
how about like passing legislation
anymore? Late term abortions.

1436
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,700
The fuck is going on in New York.

1437
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,710
There's a reading late late
term abortions. I celebrate.

1438
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:12,950
We'll have a party. It's dude, it's, yeah,
they're partying. They're doing coke.

1439
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:17,660
They're doing all that shit for late
term abortions. And how bout this?

1440
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,440
Walls don't work. What the
fuck is going on? I let Eddie,

1441
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:28,490
you like the wall. Eddie try going to
Canada. You can't even get into Canada.

1442
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:32,420
If you had a fucking Dui,
hold up. Stop, stop, stop.

1443
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,460
Do you know there's no wall?
There's no wall.

1444
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,740
There's no wall between us and Canada.
You could walk right through the woods.

1445
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,600
People do it all the time with your mom.

1446
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:44,160
Not know that cause they know literally
hundreds of miles opens woods.

1447
01:28:46,881 --> 01:28:50,770
We just walk right through. Well,
the problem that we have, uh,

1448
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:54,590
with against say well don't give,
don't head.

1449
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:56,930
He's Mexican so he's good and he just,

1450
01:28:56,931 --> 01:29:01,550
because I'm a capitalist and free market
guy and because his father secretary,

1451
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,240
I'm a Trump guy.
I didn't say what I don't want to train.

1452
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:11,040
We're all going to be fine. Cynthia got
vo. Everyone's on the same team. Yeah.

1453
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,860
When it comes to the
ground, what? America.

1454
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:17,170
Now that he's got to hear you
more than that. You look here,

1455
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,480
you're a fucking what? Cheese.
You're a problem. Bring the Trump.

1456
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:26,160
You're a Goddamn prankster.
Yeah. We got two more bottles

1457
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:31,880
by the way Brian Callen you're fucking
wine choices. Excellent. Actually.

1458
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:35,830
Cheese man. Cheese selection, mom.
And I know, I know. What's up.

1459
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:39,270
The youtube comments will be
filled with hate for the smacking.

1460
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:42,010
Sometimes she got to say fuck them.
You know all comments.

1461
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,420
How about all the time I never read it.
How about stop correcting boys?

1462
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:49,170
If you want to make it have a better life,
stop commenting on any youtube.

1463
01:29:49,171 --> 01:29:52,260
I don't know anyone who stopped who
goes on Youtube and you think Michael

1464
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:56,820
Jordan's up on youtube comment thing.
No these guys that,

1465
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:01,850
that you know when you can comment and
video and the whole world's going to see

1466
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:04,650
it, it gives them power. Well you
know what it also is, it's like, um,

1467
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,570
it's like a message board
that doesn't get censored.

1468
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,960
It's a very rare form of message cause
the only one that doesn't get censored,

1469
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:11,400
right? Cause like Instagram, Twitter,

1470
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:13,890
you do shit what people
think it gets censored.

1471
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:17,500
But what happens is people like say
you're spamming and they mark your shit of

1472
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:20,190
spam. And if enough people do it, it
gets voted down. And it's hard to see.

1473
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,990
But you can find it ultimately.

1474
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:27,500
But the point is basically everyone can
post what chewing into Mike who's doing

1475
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:29,920
it. That was Maddie. Jesus. My,

1476
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,070
my thing about a negative comments
is that I've had red salmon.

1477
01:30:33,071 --> 01:30:36,390
I'm of the thing is I'm like, well, I
kind of agree with you. Uh, you know,

1478
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:38,280
I'm not my own biggest fan,
so fuck off.

1479
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:41,730
You're not going to say anything that
I don't, you know, kind of like, yeah,

1480
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:44,670
I'm not a big fan of myself either.
Right. I was going to say like, whoa. No.

1481
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:45,900
What are you saying about,
I'm amazed.

1482
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,620
I'm amazed I've gotten as far as I've
gotten with how little I feel about my

1483
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:52,560
work.
I think you become,

1484
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:57,860
I think I've known you for 25 years and
I believe you become not only incredibly

1485
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:02,910
thoughtful and you probably have made
the biggest transformation of any friend

1486
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:07,710
I've ever had, and you've become somebody
who listens and podcasts so well.

1487
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,300
I listen to a podcast all the time.
Thank you know,

1488
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,580
I made a mistake of listening to one of
my early ones here the day I was like,

1489
01:31:14,581 --> 01:31:19,500
oh my God. Listen to one from like
eight years ago hits and says,

1490
01:31:19,501 --> 01:31:24,120
don't go back listening to you now.
Listen to how you like, listen,

1491
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:28,110
and don't take a position and just are
so open about everything that that POC

1492
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:29,670
debate. Um, it was just unbelievable. Man.

1493
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:33,360
You know what the pot to
Beit was important to me
because I legitimately think

1494
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:35,400
that there are people
who should not smoke pot.

1495
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:37,560
And this is coming from someone
who smokes a lot of pot.

1496
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:41,190
You're a reasonable human being. I
see it and I'm not a zealot. I see it.

1497
01:31:41,191 --> 01:31:44,340
I see it in people. I see. There's
people that shouldn't fucking do it.

1498
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,490
And there's people that it
does make them lazy there.

1499
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,720
Everybody's brain reacts differently
to caffeine, to nicotine, right.

1500
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:53,760
To fucking all the drugs.
Yeah.

1501
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:58,200
And there's some people
that I legitimately feel
like have a really hard time

1502
01:31:58,201 --> 01:32:03,190
with THC weather, especially in
edible form. I think edible form is,

1503
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,870
I think it's legitimately one of the most
potent psychedelic drugs that's freely

1504
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:11,260
available. I called the poison control
center after I had a Brownie. Okay.

1505
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:14,720
She's that fucked up. But
with the seat. I called him,

1506
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:19,750
I called the red band, called the
cops on himself. Garden rang up.

1507
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:23,590
I woke him up cause already is a seasoned
drug addict and back then I had eaten

1508
01:32:23,591 --> 01:32:26,320
a Brownie and I didn't know what was
going on with me and I said, dude, I,

1509
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:28,510
I think I'm dying. And he goes,
you're not tying contract.

1510
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:31,390
I can't feel myself breathing.
I can't hear my heart.

1511
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:36,660
How old were you at 23030301030
I would understand that.

1512
01:32:37,131 --> 01:32:40,530
Wouldn't like make a sign
and free choice illegal.

1513
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:45,240
Like I don't think guns should
be illegal and legal is the CBD.

1514
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,350
My education,

1515
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:50,470
I believe in education and I think it's
one of the things that I'm trying to do

1516
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:53,560
and it's one of the things I was trying
to do with that pot debate podcasts is

1517
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:54,460
let people know,
hey,

1518
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:58,420
I've taken some pretty zealot like pull
positions in the past where I was like

1519
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:01,600
everybody should smoke pot. Don't listen
to me from three years ago. Right.

1520
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:04,600
Listen to me from right now
everybody should not smoke pot.

1521
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,470
And if you're thinking about smoking pot,
smoke a little tiny bit,

1522
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:12,780
but that's what this looks like.
Alcohol don't finish a whole one shot.

1523
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:16,390
Don't be one. I've always said cause I'm
influenced a lot of people to smoke pot,

1524
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:17,770
but the one thing including me,

1525
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:21,560
we said for the for the
last 20 years is I've,

1526
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:22,870
I've always said this,

1527
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:26,890
that I don't think you should
start smoking weed until
you're at least 28 it's a

1528
01:33:26,891 --> 01:33:30,560
good, that's a good, that's
great. That's great advice. Oh,

1529
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,470
I never said 2115 I feel
that fully developed.

1530
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,340
Know who you are,
become who you are and then smoke weed.

1531
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:43,300
That way you can tell the difference
between what the pod is doing to you and

1532
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:46,390
what you are without the plot. Well
not only that, your frontal lobe,

1533
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:51,420
your frontal lobe does not fully
formed until you're 25 28 is perfect.

1534
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:54,840
To that point, they say you shouldn't
play football or fight or sparring,

1535
01:33:54,841 --> 01:33:58,060
if you know what I'm saying. You
shouldn't play football. Period.

1536
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,710
You know there was people fight.

1537
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:04,650
Joey Diaz sent me this a link or
he told me about rather this, uh,

1538
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:09,070
Hbo Real Sports that they did on. That's
enough. I don't want some more cheese,

1539
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:11,703
more cheese.

1540
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:16,180
Real sports on football with
his kid was 10 years old.

1541
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:19,870
This 10 year old kid had a double
concussion, he had a concussion,

1542
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:24,070
then another one right afterwards, and
he committed suicide at 12 Jesus Christ.

1543
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:26,290
Here's my thing with this though,
and football,

1544
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,600
99% of people aren't like that though.

1545
01:34:28,601 --> 01:34:30,130
Like that kid probably was
going to have problems with,

1546
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,350
they had that concussion or not
down the road, let's say football,

1547
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:33,980
just exaggerated.
It might be an ally.

1548
01:34:33,981 --> 01:34:35,970
You know where you see the
proof though isn't the, the,

1549
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:40,630
the retired NFL players that get
into commentating, you would see,

1550
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:44,770
you would hear it in their speech,
but like Troy Aikman for instance,

1551
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,030
he's had like a hundred concussions,
but he's one of the best commentators out.

1552
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:53,270
Tony Roma's had a level
guys like junior sal,

1553
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,610
but hold on Rhonda.

1554
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:59,240
Patrick actually detailed this in length
is actual scientific evidence about apo

1555
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:02,210
for, there's a type of, there's
a Genova Jeanette. Yeah, yeah.

1556
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:06,560
This is a genetic thing and if you have
that, yeah. Did you, do you not have that?

1557
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:11,380
Uh, I'm on the good side of
it. Good, perfect. Beautiful.
You're all right. You know,

1558
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:14,300
so you still get damaged,
but it's not the same kind of damage.

1559
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:17,120
The CTE risk is less CTE is

1560
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:21,710
this cheese will knock your dick
in the dirt. No, this is a new one.

1561
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:25,080
I just opened up. Yeah, that's
fucking, that's a daddy smell good.

1562
01:35:25,081 --> 01:35:29,850
Or I don't fuck around a
Cypress g midnight moon. Yeah.

1563
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:33,610
What do you coach or how quick it goes?
Don't worry about whether a fluff,

1564
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,360
like what are you wearing
when you walk into the door?

1565
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:39,890
I always wear a robe and I go
into a dark cave. All right.

1566
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:42,950
That cave where it smells like
hang out where they're hanging out.

1567
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,950
You know where I want to take
you inspect, you know, tend,

1568
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,130
I want to take you for Apl, APL
restaurant, Adam Perry Lang,

1569
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:54,310
he has a steakhouse where
I ate a 380 day dry age,

1570
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,430
New York strip. Pleat the fuck out of
that. It's amazing. We had an 80 day,

1571
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,530
180 days more than he gets rotten
is, fuck huh? That's weird.

1572
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,180
It's not because it's all like 35% right?
Dry Age beef,

1573
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,900
disgusting or no, he brought it. He
brought out the photos of the meat.

1574
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:14,100
It looked delicious.
Yeah. I mean it was red.

1575
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:17,630
Just you don't like it and he
doesn't like onions. Did this.

1576
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:21,740
No let needs in the city. There's no
onions and cheese. It's garbage. Right?

1577
01:36:21,741 --> 01:36:26,270
It's delicious, man. I didn't do any. It's
nutty and sweet. What's the problem? Well,

1578
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,490
you know how this jeans for brain damage,

1579
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:33,600
there's also genes for flat earth
belief and bad cheese tastes really bad.

1580
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:37,880
He's in flat earth got
go. Oh, just delicious.

1581
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:40,400
How could you not like this?
That's a good fucking try it again.

1582
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,780
I think you got it. I'm not bringing
you to APL because I'm all over that.

1583
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,550
I want to take you on vine in Hollywood.
It's Adam Perry Lang his place.

1584
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:53,000
It's fucking amazing, dude, don't we?
I and I got something to say. Well,

1585
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,060
we don't do dinners enough. We don't. We
don't. We're let's wait till we're old.

1586
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:01,710
Shit in this fucking guy goes home and
sits there eating your little snacky

1587
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:06,470
pizza. Yeah. Pizza. And we and I believe
that never mentors are very important.

1588
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,910
I agree. I have somebody come here to
go to cook. I know. Wow. That's waiver.

1589
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,650
Never shy you cause you won't come over
cause you're like man, I'm too busy.

1590
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:18,200
You have a chef come over and cook or just
some guy you know he's that good chef.

1591
01:37:18,201 --> 01:37:19,330
I have a chef come out,

1592
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:24,340
comes over and just 12 tubes and
we get our dicks out and Wa hard.

1593
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:28,070
Do you know where we need
go? Goes crossroads. When
you go to crossroads tribes.

1594
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:32,660
Parker's Vegan place down. So John Joseph
invited me this, what is it, Wednesday?

1595
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:36,800
Fuck. It might be Wednesday once a
year going up fucking Pasadena asshole.

1596
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:40,230
You've worked, you've committed to the
fans upon taking office barker. Wow,

1597
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,550
I'm going to do that when we're
going to Pasadena. Eat, eat.

1598
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:46,630
It's already sold out by the time
we mentioned on this podcast.

1599
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:49,790
Can't back out for a dinner.
Hey, I'll be in Salt Lake Marsh.

1600
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:54,740
One you want to do eat some
cucumber Bautista. I know March one,

1601
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:56,260
March one and two wise guys,

1602
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,280
guys, I know Bryan County.
Shout out to Keith the owner.

1603
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:02,850
How great is he is my favorite owner.
I love know why Keith. No sports.

1604
01:38:02,851 --> 01:38:03,960
We can talk sports in the back.

1605
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:07,610
His brother was the offense coordinator
for the Alabama Crimson tide. Wow. I know.

1606
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,240
Me and him talk deep sports.

1607
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:11,740
She's say appreciate the fuck
out of the comedy I plays too.

1608
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,920
That's one of the most underrated
clubs in the country. Live.

1609
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:20,340
They have this weird thought about Salt
Lake. My parents live in deer valley,

1610
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:25,050
so they come to my show, bring on their
friends. There's a place next to keys, uh,

1611
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:29,940
wiseguys called Red Iguana Mexican
food, Bro. My girls Mexican. Fuck.

1612
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,690
This place is so good. Ready? Guana
Red Iguana. She can handle it.

1613
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:38,610
She hasn't been there. She's
Mexican. I thought your wife,

1614
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:43,010
is she so Mexican bro? She was
Miss Mexico, wasn't she? Yeah.

1615
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:48,540
Look at this. Cynthia Kavio trying to
get that strangle on Cortney. Casey,

1616
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:52,140
one thing I was talking about,
I was talking to test Santiago.

1617
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:56,820
I was talking about how your
lifetime is not enough to learn MMA.

1618
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,290
Everything. Yeah. And you're always
having to keep up and always having to,

1619
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:05,130
to exhausted. It's exhausting.
Hates me. I saw you, I saw your boy,

1620
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,900
the guy who needs that guy
and that had the child,

1621
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:13,050
that Guy Chai and pro ball or black
guy. Oh you told Greg Hardy? Yeah.

1622
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,060
Did you punch him in the
face? No, he's giant.

1623
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:16,890
And I remember we had
kind of bad mouth them.

1624
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:20,280
I don't know anything about him so
I didn't want to be, but I was like,

1625
01:39:20,281 --> 01:39:24,600
you were saying stuff and I was like,
yeah, can I go bad on me in front of Greg?

1626
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:27,750
Oh I would've though.
Cause I said I'm a coward shit.

1627
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:32,580
I saw him and I knew that that we'd
gotten kind of bad at it on the podcast.

1628
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:33,601
I go hard in the paint.

1629
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,880
So I saw him and I was at
American top team and I was like,

1630
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,760
and I said to Jimmy Burke, Jimmy
Burke was one the, I go, Jimmy, Jimmy,

1631
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:41,280
I go with that guy. I think I bad
mouth him or I was at least didn't,

1632
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:45,330
I was kind of like,
yeah I called you so trying to go,

1633
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,520
I gotta take a shower but I
just got to sneak over it.

1634
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:49,500
Cause when I went in there a
bunch of guys were like, Hey,

1635
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:50,850
cause they all want
listened to the podcast.

1636
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:53,340
I was like a celebrity and I
thought he was there and I was just,

1637
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,820
I legitimately was to
love no, but I just, yeah,

1638
01:39:56,821 --> 01:40:01,620
I would just to slow down and
choked them out there as I'm dying.

1639
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,180
Bread is gonna get you for this.

1640
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,230
He is impossibly large.

1641
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,820
Well it played for the Dallas cowboys.

1642
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:16,410
Well novel athlete, phenomenal athletes
just hits women. So I can't fuck with it.

1643
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:21,510
That's kind of my thing. Legit allegedly,
well no, he did get convicted of it,

1644
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:26,590
but maybe he's re kind of, you know,
let's be found. You hold on a second.

1645
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:30,480
Oj Simpson got acquitted so let's
settle the fuck down on convicted. Well,

1646
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:34,720
but he got it. He, but he did charge
guilty in civil court. Civil. Yeah.

1647
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:40,110
We all glove does not fit.
You must've, let's be the bad.

1648
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,510
I know nothing.
I know.

1649
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:44,520
I'm not saying that's the reason
why looking at it that way,

1650
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:48,430
he might be a great guy. Me and might
get along. It might start puking.

1651
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:52,080
He seemed like he was very well liked
because the guys around him were just all,

1652
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:54,130
I mean I put out a tech,
should

1653
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:57,880
I have oh and my podcast, Yay or
Nah. I said, hell yeah, you should.

1654
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:02,110
Why wouldn't you? He's not going to
open up. It's not going to open up.

1655
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:06,350
It would be one interview
where he was like, no,

1656
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:10,060
this is what I did. Remember that
book you wrote a book. If I did it,

1657
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,890
if I could talk to him
and he just needed one.

1658
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:14,410
Life is like now that talked
about one of those interviews.

1659
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:18,780
Can we do like if I did
it? Part two is yeah.

1660
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:21,400
Yeah. These are all
lies. These are all lies.

1661
01:41:21,401 --> 01:41:25,420
Just want to let the audience know this
is not real and just let them go off.

1662
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:29,530
Come on man. Fuck silly
getting there, dude.

1663
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:32,240
52 but hit.
Um,

1664
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:35,860
did you guys ever see when Oj did a
music video after he got acquitted,

1665
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:41,050
he was doing like rap. That's why
we're friends, dude. Have you seen it?

1666
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,480
It's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah.
He's hanging out with all his heart.

1667
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:49,450
He was like dancing and yeah. Jamie,
pull up the Oj Simpson music video.

1668
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:55,720
It's going to make sure you guys get
juice and he's fucking, when we play it,

1669
01:41:55,721 --> 01:41:57,150
are we going to get with
his girlfriend in the video?

1670
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,420
How crazy is it that he beats that rap
and then it gets thrown in jail for some

1671
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:05,290
stupid shit. The stupidest of stick
with kidnapping. We can't listen to it,

1672
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:09,250
but look at watch the cat, but he's
got a crown on. Just think about it.

1673
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:12,220
He cut his fucking ex wife's head off.
You went to Miami,

1674
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:15,850
got weird kitchen knife and look at him
in there dancing and this is right when

1675
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:20,290
he gets out of, they all got titties
out. Get juiced. It's uncensored.

1676
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,460
Look at this. A porn
channel, uncensored video.

1677
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:28,980
Look at Oj Simpson and wearing a wig
dressed up like Elvis after he murdering

1678
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,050
people. This is our two years after he
got to quit it. Just think about that.

1679
01:42:32,051 --> 01:42:35,590
He murdered two people less than 10
years before he made this video and he's

1680
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:40,510
dancing around with these hoes.
That is bizarre. Some hosts,

1681
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:41,590
when he got to Miami,

1682
01:42:41,591 --> 01:42:45,850
they said he fucked all the girls
lined up to fuck Oj Simpson three got

1683
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:50,170
acquitted after how creek
while dark Ted Bundy.

1684
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:54,370
They want to fuck murderers, Bang
and bitch. And you think that, let's,

1685
01:42:54,371 --> 01:42:56,800
let's talk about that. What do
you think that is? I have an idea.

1686
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:02,140
Not all the girls. It's a, it's a small
percentage of girls. What does that,

1687
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:05,140
what does that,
I think that it's probably primordial.

1688
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:10,141
I think it goes back to the Alpha male
who kills and rules with ruthlessly and I

1689
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:13,540
think that there seems to be there,

1690
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,560
there's probably a feeling of safety
if you can align with that with the

1691
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:20,980
biggest, baddest male. But yeah, but he's,

1692
01:43:20,981 --> 01:43:24,190
he's killing women with that
power lifters with half that.

1693
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:27,580
So I think that is also the
idea that if I can tame him,

1694
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:32,080
that there's a challenge to that there.
There's a, I knew certain fuck that,

1695
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:32,660
you know.
Right.

1696
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:37,660
Have been with many women
who are drawn to bad ass.

1697
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:44,470
I don't know. That's exactly what
I was going to, because I have,

1698
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,410
I had to jump to the gun.

1699
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:54,310
I know my wife is I think said like dot.

1700
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,670
Tony Soprano is sexy as fuck.

1701
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:58,400
Even though he had belly and everything
and he was choking everybody with a wire.

1702
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:01,190
It's just not saying when you were
watching Narcos to Pablo Escobar,

1703
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:04,850
even dude's are like rooting for him.
He's a fucking murderer.

1704
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:07,890
Like Tony Montana for instance.
Yeah.

1705
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,830
You were rooting for him
when he died at the end.

1706
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,310
Every time where you watched Scarface at
the end, you're like, what are you doing?

1707
01:44:13,311 --> 01:44:16,010
And get the fuck out of the house too
is you're the mouse can you're giving us

1708
01:44:16,011 --> 01:44:19,340
all that you're the mouse came today.
I'm rarely give me no more.

1709
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:21,750
That shit I don't trust. You
know, he's just drinking.

1710
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,290
Does that don't cheat
too in front of the mic?

1711
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,460
The whole key to making people happy as
well as doing a good show is don't shoot

1712
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:30,920
you on the mic. You're correct.
You're doing it right now.

1713
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:35,660
I can't get over soon enough. Oh, how
dare he is and good scrap. That's great.

1714
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:39,230
Fight amendment. Cortney Casey
and fleets Herrig they literally,

1715
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:41,660
one of the things we were talking about
during the commentary was like they

1716
01:44:41,661 --> 01:44:45,350
never moved from the same spot.
They literally stayed in the same spot.

1717
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:49,210
Like Courtney stayed in one spot.
Felice bit stayed in the same spot. No,

1718
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:49,941
it was weird.

1719
01:44:49,941 --> 01:44:53,060
They were just standing in front of
each other and Courtney's a Felice spit

1720
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:54,580
blood on her.
Jesus Christ.

1721
01:44:55,890 --> 01:45:00,040
You spit her brow got dealt
with her name's Luke Sanders,

1722
01:45:00,041 --> 01:45:02,290
the bad motherfucker. He
came out with a chip. Yeah,

1723
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:08,330
White Guy Dreads Nashville board and Ruth,
he's a beast.

1724
01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:11,360
Cool Hand Luke Snow motherfucker.
I mean he's no one to fuck with Dell.

1725
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:15,340
Bad for Hennen Browne. Yeah.
Well he used to be so god,

1726
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,560
TJ ruined Tim.

1727
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:22,190
Are we going to see Tj say Hutto at 35
I would like to see it again at 20 Tj

1728
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:25,090
wants it at 25 that five or
stopped too soon. I think he gives,

1729
01:45:25,091 --> 01:45:29,750
he wants at 35 well it would be good
for pseudo, it would be good for Tj.

1730
01:45:29,751 --> 01:45:30,650
If it's at 25.

1731
01:45:30,651 --> 01:45:34,670
I really believe that it'd be better for
so Hutto because it would give him the

1732
01:45:34,671 --> 01:45:35,720
chance to be champ champ.

1733
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:40,370
What do you do with the flyweight
division stolen there? Well, you could,

1734
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,760
you could have one more big fight.
There's a few guys.

1735
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:48,470
What's the plan with joy do they're about
to cut. Better be to have to cut it.

1736
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,920
They're thinking about it,
but they hadn't made the phone.

1737
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:53,510
Dana could do whatever the fuck he wants.

1738
01:45:53,511 --> 01:45:57,620
He could have cm punk one
23 could have cm punk off.

1739
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,250
They could in and fight
that they should have a,

1740
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:02,730
if they do keep one 25 have joy Benevides,
fight him.

1741
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:07,010
He said Udo for a championship. Who
stands for side? We're very close fight.

1742
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:11,240
Who's next for a Cyborg? Cyborg. Oh, the
female female. Hey, who won that fight?

1743
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:15,350
So who door or um, Benevidez when they're
pseudo by split decision. That's right.

1744
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:19,240
So who'd only lost one fight?
Yup. Yeah, just TJ. Yeah,

1745
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:21,840
but that was just what you're
saying about Cyborg. Was that,

1746
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:26,870
would you say it'll last to DJ?
Yes. Oh, I thought you said Tj. No,

1747
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:31,020
Dj. Um, I might've said Tj.
I met Dj up if I did what?

1748
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:33,800
What did you say about Cyborg?
What's next for her?

1749
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:36,680
Amanda Nunez put her on another planet.

1750
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:41,150
Amanda Nunes and then she's out.
Why not?

1751
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:43,490
She's going to retire. Yeah,
she's done. She's done.

1752
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,300
She's talking with all mad at us. What
else is there? Yeah, she's just going to,

1753
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:52,250
she's like, what am I going
to stick around naked? Make
Miami? No, no. She's not on,

1754
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:56,250
she has money to me suck and she's going
to be naked with a pink fur coat on

1755
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:59,360
sucking titties. Yeah. All that shit.

1756
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,480
I don't think she's made enough money
to be talking about retiring millions.

1757
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,360
Millions. Yeah. She's my
biggest women in history.

1758
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:08,090
Who ever sideboard did
you made a lot of money.

1759
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:14,220
What about boxers by mass and all
those guys? They all come back.

1760
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:19,030
They retire and then they think they get
used to that money. That was, oh my God,

1761
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:22,770
I have 3 million. Then in two years they
go, oh my God, I only have 2 million.

1762
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:27,550
Cris Cyborg explains why she's a
WWE performance center. Oh my God.

1763
01:47:27,551 --> 01:47:31,020
She's going to go to WWE and challenge
Ronda Rousey's. Oh shoot. Magic.

1764
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:35,380
Her and Rhonda Rousey have a
Goddamn WWE type match. A kid kid.

1765
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:39,980
That's probably how that ends.
You think that's how men's number,

1766
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:42,720
we didn't watch 30 seconds.
I'll dude is a good one though.

1767
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,460
Based on throw those comics.

1768
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:48,480
My favorite

1769

welcome to that 19 so my neck. Look Jack,

goes when you're like talking about duty.

1771
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:03,110
I think I have extra meat
on my Mac and Brendan Kinda.

1772
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:07,170
There's a pause and many goes. Do you
really need a thicker neck or, I do.

1773
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:10,920
I got real problems. I was thinking
about this, trying to get bigger.

1774
01:48:10,921 --> 01:48:13,230
I'm trying to get fit. Guy
Choked out that mountain. Mine.

1775
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:18,360
I always think of that 85 pounds. So
you son of a bitch. Shut the fuck up.

1776
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:21,270
I know this. This guidelines like, Hey,

1777
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:26,400
I know everything that was in 85
pounds. Listen to me, mother fucker.

1778
01:48:26,401 --> 01:48:29,260
I know everything about this
kitchen to me, mother fucker.

1779
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:34,150
The cat was half eaten by another cat by
the time the Rangers got, no, no, no, no,

1780
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:39,020
no, no, no, no. Know
the frame of the cattle.

1781
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:43,110
We know there's a juvenile cat.
It was 85 pounds is huge. Big Cat.

1782
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:46,650
That's a police dog. No, no,
no. It's big for a police dog.

1783
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:49,890
It's not big for your
juvenile or Kathy pounds.

1784
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,910
I know everything about this case. What
we want to get that guy, whoever you are.

1785
01:48:52,911 --> 01:48:56,160
Gentlemen, sir, what's fine. This
man's name, I want to get you in here.

1786
01:48:56,161 --> 01:49:00,840

1787
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:03,480
Travis Kaufman. You bad motherfucker.
I'll pay your medical bills.

1788
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:06,510
I want to know how he did it.
Tell me everything stopped on his nut.

1789
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:12,060
Bake him from behind. He sent something
was there. It jumped him from behind.

1790
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:15,990
He got a wild scramble a bit. His face.
He's got his giant Gash on his face.

1791
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:16,651
They scraped.

1792
01:49:16,651 --> 01:49:19,830
It was a wrestling match and he got
his fucking foot on this things neck.

1793
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:23,490
Let me see. The picture was
skeptical. Hipaa lies. No, no.

1794
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,060
He killed his fucking cat with his
goddamn bare hand and there was a stick.

1795
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:32,040
Right glace Babs, Bro. There's
sticks in the woods and he's like,

1796
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:35,540
hey, he's like the world's not round
but sticks aren't Sir sir, sir.

1797
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:38,640
Ticks aren't real sir. According
to Colorado, parks and wildlife,

1798
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:43,860
wait 35 to 40 pounds so you know. No, no,
no, no. I'm that cat was when it was dead.

1799
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:47,780
That's a cat when he was baby face.
Easy fast.

1800
01:49:49,110 --> 01:49:53,320
Find another one. Yeah.
There was one today.

1801
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:57,970
There was no fighting
news, Bro. I another one,

1802
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:00,640

cardiologist and I can tell you right,

1803
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,540
it's an expert on cat's
fine. Another one, Google,

1804
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:09,670
Google may as a scratch on his face,
man gets attack starving.

1805
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,273
Fake news

1806
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:22,420
can find another one that's

1807
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,670
lessening to Steve or Nell's podcast today
and he said it was 85 pounds as well.

1808
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:31,390
Steve Call those fish stories.
What do they call them?

1809
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:33,490
Fish stories.
That's the call.

1810
01:50:33,491 --> 01:50:36,440
That's a way that thing was sleeping
in a den and he stopped at two up.

1811
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,810
He murdered getting murdered

1812
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:50,240
and eaten by another one. Hold on.

1813
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:54,860
You were just fucking with you.
Turns out there some real legit shit.

1814
01:50:56,610 --> 01:51:00,140
Fucking I do. I just typed in
85 pounds and see what comes up.

1815
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:01,700
There's a three articles.

1816
01:51:01,701 --> 01:51:06,050
Once those 41 says 85 once this
one says 110 to 180 pounds,

1817
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:07,560
well that one's bullshit.

1818
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,640
That article man's a murderer and fucking

1819
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:18,020
chill. You're not going to
kill and a 180 pound cat,

1820
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:23,230
but you might kill an 80 pound cat
for sure.

1821
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,093
He came across

1822
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:29,520
the thing was already eaten and he
took the nails. Any scratches on

1823
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:38,310
85 pounds, eight Joe, he
doesn't know. What did you see?

1824
01:51:38,311 --> 01:51:41,820
His face got a little scratch.
Got a couple of strobe off. Well,

1825
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:45,360
that was a month ago, Bro. You
know what dude? This fire guy.

1826
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:53,660
Yes, he's implanted that mountain.
Okay. How does, let's, let's ask,

1827
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:57,200
let's ask this question. How does
the Empire Guy Recover? He does, man.

1828
01:51:57,580 --> 01:51:59,870
He's done working Hollywood.
Dude. He's done. How do you,

1829
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:01,640
how do you recover the pride?
You someone like logo,

1830
01:52:01,641 --> 01:52:06,641
TV or the black communities
like ridiculing him now and
he's done because he's a

1831
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:12,230
liar and he asked her all the support
too, like that the director of uh, empire.

1832
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:15,200
Like when I was like, I can't believe
that he goes like this. He goes,

1833
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:18,440
I fucked back the
sisters hot as fuck dude.

1834
01:52:18,441 --> 01:52:22,190
Did you see his interview with Robyn
from fucking Good Morning America?

1835
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:26,000
He's like in the people that seek,

1836
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,820
like full, like full blown and
performed. Wow. What a scumbag.

1837
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:36,410
I don't call it a bad guy. Comment 85
pounds thing. I can't find one. Yeah,

1838
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:40,150
I know it's a 20 pound. It's a 20
pound cat is a 10 pound medicine.

1839
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:43,100
Fucking a house cat. Jamie, how dare
you. You know what? Even if it was

1840
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:46,340
on a mountain,
so

1841
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:46,970
there's some,

1842
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:51,970
at least he killed the measure and trivia
murder of what did Paul Felder major

1843
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:56,540
in in college? Theater theater.
Come on, Bro. How about that?

1844
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,450
There's a hilarious
picture. Hold on. Jam. Jon.

1845
01:52:59,451 --> 01:53:03,810
Anik was doing research today or
yesterday and he put up on Instagram.

1846
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:07,790
What are the picks of Paul Felder
from his, uh, theater days?

1847
01:53:07,791 --> 01:53:12,380
It's hilarious. It's
hilarious. He looks like,

1848
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:16,800
like a Geisha look at
that. Oh Wow. He looks like

1849
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:25,050
a complete bad ass. No, he looks
like Stephen King and drag at,

1850
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,030
I'm not prepared to make fun
of them cause he's, he's not,

1851
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:31,740
he looks very similar to Stephen King. He
to me, it looks like Stephen King's son.

1852
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:36,710
See that young Stephen King. But
he's saying really? Oh my gosh.

1853
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:39,800
Amazing. Jamie, what's
going on with that screen?

1854
01:53:39,801 --> 01:53:43,750
Why does it keep blinking in and out?
HDI still fucking up. No, it's just,

1855
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:48,050
what a great picture.
I'm trying to think of what it looks like.

1856
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:52,610
Who's the filter is as bad as they
haven't. How about John Onc goes,

1857
01:53:52,611 --> 01:53:57,530
please don't let me in the face for shit.
Maybe that's a Halloween pick, you know.

1858
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:01,220
No, no, he was, he was in
a play. He was playing.

1859
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:05,900
There hasn't been a couple times. There
is all handsome. He's looking rugged.

1860
01:54:05,901 --> 01:54:09,380
He's a man, Bro. Man. Manly man. A man.

1861
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:14,600
Felder. I think Felder, I mean he, he's,

1862
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:18,620
he can beat anybody in the world at the
right time. I mean, I don't think anybody,

1863
01:54:18,621 --> 01:54:22,280
he's not a cake walk for anyone. He's
definitely tough to tough as shit. I mean,

1864
01:54:22,281 --> 01:54:26,090
he went the full three rounds
with Barboza and took some,

1865
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:30,980
came in the row shots. He's an amazing
commentator to really very, very good.

1866
01:54:30,981 --> 01:54:35,840
I really enjoyed doing commentary
with him. Damn Danny Castillo.

1867
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:38,000
Should we vape?
Zabbix wheels of cheese.

1868
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:41,270
What's that quick correction?

1869
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:45,470
Something you guys were just a five
pound mountain lion. Oh, suit. Also lost.

1870
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:47,413
Oh.

Nicest one of the his
wife Megan will Libby.

1875
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:07,520
I'm also using the two of them together.
I root for them with everything they do.

1876
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:09,920
Every time I see him I go have
kids. Yeah, you need to have

1877
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:15,950
four foot 11 babies. Oh, how dare
you. I'm flattered with apple bottoms.

1878
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:20,450
They're going to be in the
circus. Very adorable. No circus.

1879
01:55:20,451 --> 01:55:25,100
By the time those kids get older or their
sales circuses in fucking weird places

1880
01:55:25,970 --> 01:55:29,550
like, you know, weird fucking middle
of the country, John and stuff. No,

1881
01:55:29,551 --> 01:55:31,660
I'm talking about America or
England. We were, it's during lunch.

1882
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:34,600
It's done because you can't have
elephants anymore. I'm out. Yeah.

1883
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:37,550
You want to talk about tough people
like Izer by Shawn? We don't,

1884
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,950
there are a lot of fighters there
that are waiting to get visas.

1885
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:45,150
Just like with dog Estann there's all
for MMA and wrestling and Azerbaijan is

1886
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:46,610
their national.
There's that one.

1887
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:49,920
My buddies there and now he's working
there and he said his son is in a

1888
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:50,580
wrestling club.

1889
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:53,940
There's a wrestling club everywhere
and he said they the all the kids from

1890
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:56,250
literally from eight to 16 years old,

1891
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:59,880
they're all wrestling guy comes out
with mouthpieces and boxing gloves,

1892
01:55:59,881 --> 01:56:03,600

they start cheering, put on their gloves,

1893
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,310
putting the mouthpieces and start banging.

1894
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,970
Well the need nuclear physicist so they
can compete with us in the global world.

1895
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:13,410
War is the next country to
little thing is that shit.

1896
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,730
That's great. If you want
cage fighters. Yeah. You know,

1897
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,540
Oppenheimer flip the switch on all
that shit. He's just very cute.

1898
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:27,220
You can't do a Mongol style anymore. You
know, this is a bunch of old masculine,

1899
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:30,220
the powers. Oh Man. Oh Shit.

1900
01:56:32,990 --> 01:56:35,760
Taylor boss. Fuck it's guy.
He did a great job, man.

1901
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:39,630
He painted for me and I looked at it
and the first time when I saw it in the

1902
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:41,520
flash I was like,
that needs to be in the fucking studio.

1903
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:43,980
Kids good looking over us.
He does a great look at her eyes.

1904
01:56:43,981 --> 01:56:46,410
That's a good artist right
there. Yeah, no, Tim is amazing.

1905
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:48,180
Hunted Hendricks out in the hallway too.

1906
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,840
He's painted and that's really
hard to have a Hendrix problem.

1907
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:53,370
How many fucking Hendra Patriots,
Huh?

1908
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:57,390
The reason why this show's called
the Joe Rogan experience is Hendrix.

1909
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,800
Jimi Hendrix experience.

1910
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:01,590
I probably listen to Hendrix more than
I'm listening to any human being on the

1911
01:57:01,591 --> 01:57:06,260
planet earth. You love him.
Love. I'm feeling about it.

1912
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:11,700
It's about the size of that to me is my
number one who dumb he's saying from me.

1913
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,490
But I think I've listened to Hendrix more.
You know,

1914
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:19,380
it's just like he was so pure who was
so free with, what did he die from?

1915
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:23,910
20 zero seven drug. This one dies,
knows what am drugs. There was a story.

1916
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:27,780
Stories truck. Yeah. The official stories
do me, what is Joe turns into conspiracy.

1917
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:34,250
His manager,
his manager was a gangster in it.

1918
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:36,510
There was a guy who was one of
the henchmen for his manager.

1919
01:57:36,511 --> 01:57:38,580
They said the manager killed him
cause Hendricks was leaving up.

1920
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:42,960
The one thing that supports that is that
it was weird that he died like choking

1921
01:57:42,961 --> 01:57:47,200
on his own vomit and he didn't have
heroin in his system or like there's like

1922
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:50,010
some weirdness to it, but then the
other part of it is that the girlfriend,

1923
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:54,120
Hendricks girlfriend was allegedly
committed suicide by jumping off a roof.

1924
01:57:54,121 --> 01:57:58,380
But the henchman says they threw her
off a row. Yeah, white chick, which she,

1925
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,550
she knew that without. The other thing
that's disappointing about Hendrix,

1926
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:05,040
if you hear that Hendrix used to beat
his girlfriend, but that might've been,

1927
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:09,210
she was smear campaign prior to,
we talked about how he hit his wife.

1928
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:14,200
She did a lot of coke and fucked everyone.
Richard Presto hit hitters.

1929
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:18,060
There's also rumors he suck
Dick. Not Rumors. No, his wife,

1930
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:21,540
his ex wife confirmed it like he
fucked Marilyn. Marlon Brando.

1931
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:26,220
Richard Pryor. Yeah. I don't believe it.
Not shut the fuck up. You don't believe.

1932
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,680
Have you seen it been the day man,
back in the day,

1933
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:33,350
parents white came out with a whole thing
in the 60s she was smearing. No, no, no,

1934
01:58:33,351 --> 01:58:35,830
no, no, no. It was okay back then

1935
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:41,750
everybody. But the story, the Bachelor,

1936
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,330
I've never done coke,

1937
01:58:43,331 --> 01:58:46,660
but when you do coke and you were in the
sixties and seventies apparently those

1938
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:51,530
guys are just fucking whatever was in
Jackson. I'm David Bowie did that shit.

1939
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:54,070
Well she was saying
Pryor's wife was saying,

1940
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:57,490
her exact quote I think was you'll fuck
a radiator if you get enough coke in

1941
01:58:57,491 --> 01:58:59,710
front of you. You guys, you guys
are trying to deal with you guys.

1942
01:58:59,711 --> 01:59:04,620
You guys want to do some
code? Know what? Maybe a no,

1943
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:09,550
no, no. Marlin broke. Maybe David Bowie,
maybe Mick Jagger, maybe David Bowie.

1944
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:13,510
Did they get their stomach pumped
or something like that? Rod Stewart.

1945
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:16,600
But that's all I, that's all your
Dear Journal myth to Keith Urban.

1946
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:18,190
The Telegraph for this might be real,

1947
01:59:18,191 --> 01:59:19,950
but we know we didn't think
about Richard Gere, Juno.

1948
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:23,470
It was thinking about the Richard Girls.
He's gay. Straight. No, no, no, no.

1949
01:59:23,471 --> 01:59:24,170
But here's the thing.

1950
01:59:24,170 --> 01:59:27,850
The Richard Gere durable thing apparently
came right after he left Scientology.

1951
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:32,570
That's the real, Oh yes. Okay.
That's a smear underwear,

1952
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:36,720
but it's such a good smear campaign.
When I like lemon,

1953
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:40,990
when I first met Eddie, Eddie and I talked
about this because he grew up in La.

1954
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:42,010
I grew up in Boston.

1955
01:59:42,011 --> 01:59:45,160
We both heard the Richard Gere
story at the same time that exactly,

1956
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:48,540
because motherfuckers spread across
the country who was a healer as a huge,

1957
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:49,060
they were getting,
no,

1958
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:53,950
he just had a baby and he's 85,000
years old still doing it. By the way.

1959
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:56,870
I ain't got Jamie Brett Young,
Richard Gere looking at a sexy,

1960
01:59:56,871 --> 01:59:57,880
a little with his shirt off.
Hey,

1961
01:59:57,881 --> 02:00:02,590
how about officer and a gentlemen going
nowhere else. I'm all that movie, Dude.

1962
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,850
I love that movie and I love
that scene. Oh, it was amazing.

1963
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:10,570
How good as Louis Gossett
Jr. Oh Damn. He was good.

1964
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:13,180
He won an Oscar for that or was it
nominated? He was incredible to watch.

1965
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:16,330
That movie didn't win the world.
Fucking terrible back.

1966
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:19,270
Do you ever watch them an unfaithful
and you watch it with your share?

1967
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,020
Like cheating on her show outward?

1968
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,473
Huh?

1969
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:29,960
What are your truck? Rough?
No, that's the old movies.

1970
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:35,560
That's like his tenure three movie get.
I'm looking at him. Look at him, dude.

1971
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:40,250
Fuck Dude. He was, he was the shit
when he was younger, man. Yeah,

1972
02:00:40,251 --> 02:00:44,940
but he didn't have any kids until his low
to be fucking like 380 [inaudible] New

1973
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:48,680
York strip right there. Beautiful.
He steals your girl all day long.

1974
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:53,210
That's an I beat that guy to death
in front of his mom. Doesn't matter.

1975
02:00:53,211 --> 02:00:54,560
It doesn't matter.
He's vulnerable.

1976
02:00:54,561 --> 02:00:58,160
He cries and you're doing a young
Clint Eastwood beats that lesson.

1977
02:00:58,161 --> 02:01:01,430
I was a handsome boy when I was young.
You were cute too, but gear picture,

1978
02:01:01,431 --> 02:01:06,140
you and I in the nineties I know.
Going to fucking know you had some swag.

1979
02:01:06,141 --> 02:01:09,500
He dressed like shit. Yeah, no, I
was just ridiculous. No, your show.

1980
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:12,990
It was cool that he kept the sweaters in.
We were both in disaster.

1981
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:18,140
My sweaters while we may as
well. He's a, here we go.

1982
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:22,670
James Vick, Duke. Can we watch? We
do that. We're going to watch this.

1983
02:01:22,671 --> 02:01:23,300
It's a good fight.

1984
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:25,310
We're gonna Watch this would definitely
have watched the main event fell.

1985
02:01:25,311 --> 02:01:28,010
There's such a competitor, man. Little,
they're all competitors, right? Yeah.

1986
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:31,400
Well they're competing for living Brian.
Jesus calls, but he's just telling me,

1987
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:36,290
look how big Vic is so long, but you got
to think he cuts the shit out of weight.

1988
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:40,030
He is a giant. How much does
he cut? He's like struve.

1989
02:01:40,030 --> 02:01:44,210
Is that Stefan struve is this, this
is 55 right dude. Great references.

1990
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:47,640
D five yes it is this 55 Oh fucking one

1991
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:53,900
six three six six three
55 that's a big advantage.

1992
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,250
Cuts so much weight when he
gets hit. It's true. Hey, fuck,

1993
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:02,240
Felder and I were in the fucking locker
room last time we were working together

1994
02:02:02,241 --> 02:02:04,340
and we're getting changed,
getting ready for UFC. I go, dude,

1995
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:08,270
what the fuck do you weigh? And he
goes, whoa. One night I go, bitch,

1996
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,000
you 200 pounds and we're laughing about,

1997
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:13,670
always lie about their weight and he goes,
what about you?

1998
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:16,370
And I go pitch him on TRT.
I'm 50 years old.

1999
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:21,860
Not all the juice I need to
get on that stuff. You should.

2000
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:24,950
I've been telling you for
about eight years, Brian went,

2001
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,890
his mind has so much energy. You
look good. You look good. My Cock,

2002
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:32,060
I just injected in your little
skinny neck. Dawn could cut a dye,

2003
02:02:32,061 --> 02:02:34,700
should shoot it right into the
tip of your heart. I don't have

2004
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:39,120
a cat would blunt its claws on my friend.

2005
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:45,050
Come on. Ooh. Fell to just connected
with it. I'm still fighting

2006
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:51,950
that hard issue to knee lost.
Still fighting though.

2007
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:52,701
I think he's still fine.

2008
02:02:52,701 --> 02:02:55,950
I don't think he's officially
retired and on the top last funny,

2009
02:02:56,060 --> 02:03:00,180
he might've retired. I don't know why he
doesn't use his jab more struve. Yeah.

2010
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:04,010
Oh good. He's seven foot tall
and the nicest guy in the planet.

2011
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:08,690
Hard for the size of an elephant. It's
a problem. When I interviewed him,

2012
02:03:08,691 --> 02:03:11,870
I feel so awkward. I'm
like, well dad, what zoo?

2013
02:03:11,871 --> 02:03:16,490
Or we go into or whatever, dude,
I wouldn't got coffee with him.

2014
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:19,400
Like get your dick out of my face.
And he's just so tired.

2015
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:24,140
That's me. Do you remember
when we meet? I met him.

2016
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:27,050
We were all hanging out cause you guys
had the same manager and we were hanging

2017
02:03:27,051 --> 02:03:29,660
out and he's sitting down,
he's as tall as I am standing and I,

2018
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:32,270
and I said to Brendan
and I go, I go, dude,

2019
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:35,000
what would you do if you had to fight him?
And Brandon was still fighting.

2020
02:03:35,001 --> 02:03:38,270
Can you know him and brought him down
to that to him because Brendan Goes, Oh,

2021
02:03:38,271 --> 02:03:43,250
I'd knock him the fuck out. That's what
I took it. You took it personally, Cyrus,

2022
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:46,730
we were supposed to fight like twice.
You were looking at this fight right here.

2023
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:50,420
Let's watch this fight. Yeah. Let's
watch two fights tonight. Paul Felder,

2024
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:53,780
Double Jab, Double Jab. What

2025
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:57,230
did you,

2026
02:03:57,230 --> 02:04:00,650
do you ever think about doing actual
commentary because I know you played me in

2027
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:04,880
a movie, but you're willing to do
actual commentary, Bafta, Bafta,

2028
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:09,440
Joe Rogan, warrior. I
had an offer and I said,

2029
02:04:09,441 --> 02:04:11,850
I don't know enough about to do to fight.
I think.

2030
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:15,380
I think everyone should pick you
up or rice and beans. Epstein

2031
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:20,720
and Dennis Miller do commentary.
Hold on.

2032
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:25,010
That was the issue. When I started
working for the UFC, I was concerned.

2033
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:28,400
I was legitimately concerned because
this was before UFC 37 and a half when I

2034
02:04:28,401 --> 02:04:29,510
started working for the UFC.

2035
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:32,360
Dennis Miller was doing Monday
night football and I was like,

2036
02:04:32,361 --> 02:04:36,050
I don't want to fuck this up. So I
decided like I made a conscious effort.

2037
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:39,540
I'm not even going to remotely try
to be funny. No, I'm, I'm like,

2038
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:42,930
I'm funny actually you shouldn't
have to write. It meant a lot to me.

2039
02:04:42,931 --> 02:04:45,830
Like martial arts means a lot martial
artist and seller didn't ever play

2040
02:04:45,831 --> 02:04:49,440
football. He couldn't relate to any
of you. Please put in Jackson, junior,

2041
02:04:49,441 --> 02:04:50,090
all American.

2042
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:54,360
Does it change when George Washington
was coming across to Delaware?

2043
02:04:55,610 --> 02:04:59,030
We have a black, he was
hard. He was horrible.

2044
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:03,360
I feel bad for him because he
wasn't set up for success in that.

2045
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,253
That's not a good place.

2046
02:05:04,570 --> 02:05:07,680
Well he was trying to throw those jokes
around like he had written out like he

2047
02:05:07,681 --> 02:05:08,670
was getting to like spite.

2048
02:05:08,671 --> 02:05:10,650
I think they probably brought
him in to do that though.

2049
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:14,310
But then thinking about it for his jokes,
they have to, okay. All of his shit.

2050
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:16,080
So prewrite that was a nightmare.

2051
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:19,470
He really thinks so hundred percent
they didn't give him the free reign.

2052
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:22,560
Crazy seeing about the UFC as that.
They don't tell me what to do.

2053
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:26,700
You've never said anything outrage
on here. You've said some shit,

2054
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:29,030
really ridiculous things, but you're
also the best at what you do. So,

2055
02:05:29,031 --> 02:05:32,400
but the fact that they have this billion
dollar multibillion dollar organization

2056
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:36,100
and let me talk is fucking insane.
Never.

2057
02:05:36,650 --> 02:05:40,530
I never fought MMA.
You're on black book,

2058
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:45,940
Joe Buck number play baseball
and he's one of the best color.

2059
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:50,700
Yeah. It was a play by play
of color. Different play by
play. Guy Doesn't have to,

2060
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:53,310
he doesn't have to be a professional.
Don't put it be

2061
02:05:55,170 --> 02:05:59,400
generally has to be. What I'm
saying is Joe, so goddamn good.

2062
02:05:59,401 --> 02:06:02,400
Some of them they said, fuck it. We don't
care about that shit. Well, the thing is,

2063
02:06:02,401 --> 02:06:05,940
I wasn't good when I first just
have been doing some day one.

2064
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:11,560
Day One,
it's over.

2065
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,710
We tagged them. Fell there is,
he's clinching is a beast. Well,

2066
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:21,330
vix trying to hold out. He's so nasty.
He says, I feel sick for so much cheese.

2067
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:22,823
Cheese.

2068
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,940
I had my cholesterol just shot up to 3000
I don't think it works like that. Nope.

2069
02:06:27,030 --> 02:06:31,420
No it doesn't. No, it doesn't have any
effect on the skin. Is that tree? Yeah.

2070
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,700
Dietary cholesterol is almost zero effect
on blood lipids. Mostly it's genetic.

2071
02:06:36,230 --> 02:06:37,890
There's a lot of different,
various issues,

2072
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:40,800
but people that have certain genes
really shouldn't fuck with a lot of high

2073
02:06:40,801 --> 02:06:42,990
cholesterol foods.
But for the most part,

2074
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:46,400
dietary cholesterol has
been scientifically proven,

2075
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:50,370
have almost zero effect on blood,
high cholesterol. So I have to, well,

2076
02:06:50,371 --> 02:06:52,980
some people do well,
the thing is about what is it,

2077
02:06:52,981 --> 02:06:56,310
LDL or HDL and w w if they're
balanced out together,

2078
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:59,670
the real thing is like checking for um,
artery.

2079
02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:03,480
I can slack like Che checking
to see if you're okay.

2080
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:06,900
Can you do that with a sonic? No. You need
to go to a real doctor, mother fucker.

2081
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:09,720
No, no, no, no. I'm saying, can you do
that when I do it? I can't do it for you.

2082
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:14,770
Can you check my arterial branch? I can
check your aura. Check my was that same.

2083
02:07:14,771 --> 02:07:16,920
He saw a doctor,
but he was such a for your psoriasis.

2084
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:21,870
I can't tell you how to finger in your
butt. Uh, about two, three fingers,

2085
02:07:21,871 --> 02:07:25,800
deep fingers or size of bratwurst. And
should I do that? Did he grow over,

2086
02:07:25,801 --> 02:07:26,634
done that

2087
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,530
colonoscopy when he gets
all three of [inaudible] 15.

2088
02:07:31,531 --> 02:07:34,500
When you're 50 you got to
get a colonoscopy. A doctor
gets all three and he goes,

2089
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:38,680
you gotta go get a colonoscopy. Did you
get a call on that? Yeah, me too. Yeah,

2090
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:42,210
I was getting my butthole
looks amazing to put you out.

2091
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,640
I'm still happy. Request
a female. Like I say,

2092
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:51,430
I gotta say that I'm so happy
that the UFC is on ESPN. I really,

2093
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,640
I think it's so good for the sport. It's
so much better than Fox. Cause so many.

2094
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:54,911
Yeah.

2095
02:07:54,911 --> 02:07:59,350
It's so good because so many people
that are just sports fans just watch the

2096
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:04,270
ESPN all day long to bars have ESPN
on all the time. Just on a loop.

2097
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:07,630
On a loop. I'd leave ESPN then. Yeah,
if I'm just at home, that's my default.

2098
02:08:07,631 --> 02:08:09,910
He used to be that. Yeah. And I
don't give a fuck about sports,

2099
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:14,410
but I understand it. I know it. It's
such a big move for the UFC. It's huge.

2100
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,940
I think it's so tone for that perfect
home. I agree. I'm so happy when, when I,

2101
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:22,540
when I heard it was happening and then
the streaming service because you know,

2102
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:25,140
because I spent so much time,
oh look at this James Vick,

2103
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:31,510
I spent so much time doing online stuff.
I was really happy about that.

2104
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:35,440
I was like, good streaming is where
the future lies. What is filters? Rank?

2105
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:37,420
He's not right. He's a, you know,

2106
02:08:37,421 --> 02:08:41,110
it's probably a top 25 that they don't
really rank you until your top 15 though.

2107
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:43,150
He's aiming at the top 15 I feel like,

2108
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:46,960
well that was why he didn't get that
Khabib fight and al I acquainted did,

2109
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:52,410
but in retrospect that was actually really
huge because al fought a great fight,

2110
02:08:53,030 --> 02:08:54,850
went five full rounds with could be,

2111
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:59,670
which Connor couldn't do and then beat
Kevin Lee's ass and his next fight and I

2112
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:02,590
was ranked number four in the
world and should be and should be.

2113
02:09:02,591 --> 02:09:06,640
Ally acquainted when he's focused is a
fucking gangster. He's the one restaurant,

2114
02:09:06,641 --> 02:09:08,460
right? He, I don't know what his name is.

2115
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:12,400
D One wrestled at Juco is not
going to Dustin and, and shadow.

2116
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:15,220
Somebody asked him and Mike Brown,
I think Jimmy said,

2117
02:09:15,221 --> 02:09:19,640
what's the one discipline that you think
is the best thing to have in wrestling?

2118
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:24,620
Have them, I don't know. Wow.

2119
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:27,340
I know wrestling,

2120
02:09:27,341 --> 02:09:29,850
that's why you shouldn't do commentary
except in the movie stripes.

2121
02:09:29,870 --> 02:09:34,690
Being smart around gets
a conversation going.

2122
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:38,870
Wrestling's everything man.
It's the ability to dictate them to fight.

2123
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:42,280
That takes place. I wrestled in high
school did, that's why I do the champions.

2124
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:45,450
All the champions hit me that night.
I remember what Brian Callahan,

2125
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,490
I remember when I brought Brian to Carlson
Gracie school back from Carlson was

2126
02:09:48,491 --> 02:09:51,520
still alive and the Carlson
School in Hollywood off Hawthorne,

2127
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:56,110
right when Vito was making his UFC debut
and Brian and I became friends and he

2128
02:09:56,111 --> 02:09:59,370
was wrestling with Sergio Cohen and
Sergio got mad at him and headbutted

2129
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:01,900
remember that Brian,
cause I was taking,

2130
02:10:01,901 --> 02:10:04,720
I was taking a lot of those guys down
cause they didn't back then they didn't

2131
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:07,320
know how to take that. So I was doing,
she wasn't there. I remember watching,

2132
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:10,720
I was rolling and I was looking, I was
a white belt town cause look it over.

2133
02:10:10,721 --> 02:10:12,730
And Brian and Brian was
going hard with Sergio.

2134
02:10:12,731 --> 02:10:16,480
Can you go too hard and she'll
just like this? Yeah, he took it.

2135
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:21,040
He talked him cause we are going take
downs and I had my elbow and he just

2136
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:23,840
pulled it out and like boom,
knocked you out. He broke my nose.

2137
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:27,940
Nose did you had to get my septum.
What you're saying? I was young.

2138
02:10:27,941 --> 02:10:30,640
I didn't just kept going. He goes,
I think that got broke my nose.

2139
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:33,860
I saw that shit for two years. I was
not doing, we were like little kids.

2140
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:34,970
Well I can't believe we're here.

2141
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:38,660
We're a little boost of Monte
Carlos buttheads all was there.

2142
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:43,760
[inaudible] California, Mario
[inaudible]. I tapped him a couple times.

2143
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:48,470
No we did not. Mario Sperry was teaching
the class. Mario Sperry was hilarious.

2144
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:50,240
One of the things Biros Barry said,
he goes,

2145
02:10:50,241 --> 02:10:54,110
I got so good at my triangle because I
get my girl in my guard and I get her in

2146
02:10:54,111 --> 02:10:54,944
my garden

2147
02:10:57,770 --> 02:11:01,520
and she says, no, I don't want to do no
more is it? Fuck you. You stay there.

2148
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:07,100
Did I ever tell you that story about
his girlfriend?

2149
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:14,840
I taught, I taught an old
girlfriend of mine, the triangle.

2150
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:17,060
So she gets really into
it. She's like, oh my gosh.

2151
02:11:17,061 --> 02:11:20,210
She was a stripper back when I worked
as a DJ, as a stripper in a strip club.

2152
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:23,210
So I showed her a triangle and she,
cause I wanted,

2153
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:27,500
I want her her to do it on her next
boyfriend and then have him ask her,

2154
02:11:27,501 --> 02:11:30,680
where the Hell you learned that from? I
got pissed on her. You know what I mean?

2155
02:11:30,681 --> 02:11:33,430
Chess.
So she was obsessed with you triangle.

2156
02:11:34,930 --> 02:11:37,130
He's marked her.
She's obsessed with triangles.

2157
02:11:37,131 --> 02:11:39,590
So I'm trying to watch Howard Stern,
right?

2158
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:42,410
And she's trying to put me in a
triangle and I keep telling him to stop.

2159
02:11:42,630 --> 02:11:44,390
I'm like really into this
Howard Stern episode.

2160
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:47,090
She's probably trying to
put me in a triangle. You
fucking stop. She's laughing.

2161
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:49,820
She's putting him in a triangle
that's like, you got to stop.

2162
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:52,200
You've got to fucking stop.
And I got really pissed. I go,

2163
02:11:52,201 --> 02:11:54,250
you're going to fucking
start crying right now. Stop.

2164
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:57,170
I'm watching this fucking stop.
And she wouldn't. She's laughing.

2165
02:11:57,290 --> 02:12:01,240
So she put me in a triangle and
I fucking quitting web page.

2166
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:04,220
Ricardo Arona at her on the bed
though I wasn't trying to hurt.

2167
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,860
So I picked her up and I tried
to get him to start crying.

2168
02:12:06,861 --> 02:12:11,060
She has me in a triangle. I picked
her up and slammed her on the bed.

2169
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:15,740
It was the salt that when I slammed
her on the bed, she lets go,

2170
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:20,900
bounces off the bed and goes flying and
lands on the ground and lands on her

2171
02:12:20,901 --> 02:12:22,160
wrist and she starts fucking quiet.

2172
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:28,760
So she runs to the bathroom and I walk
into the bathroom and she's got the hot

2173
02:12:28,761 --> 02:12:33,500
water running over her wrist and she's
crying. She said, I said, get dressed.

2174
02:12:33,501 --> 02:12:36,350
We're going to the emergency
room. She goes, what? I go
get dressed, we're going to

2175
02:12:39,210 --> 02:12:42,650
go, let's go. Let's go. Let's go to
the emergency room. Your Shit's broken.

2176
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:46,430
I just the her and I just want her to get
her to stop crying. And she stopped. And

2177
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:50,380
that was what round? Is
this a second? Oh yeah.

2178
02:12:50,381 --> 02:12:54,040
The second Paul Felder lifts his hands up.
Feels like you won that round.

2179
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:56,920
I have no idea what happened in a
good story. It was a great story.

2180
02:12:57,810 --> 02:13:01,180
You're going to jail.
I'm like,

2181
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:06,420
when you started about two hurt,
you never signed me girl.

2182
02:13:06,790 --> 02:13:10,030
She never got tickets for a show.
Your girlfriend how to do a triangle

2183
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:15,130
and she'll get obsessed with them.
You try to watch fucking [inaudible] now,

2184
02:13:15,131 --> 02:13:18,030
but you're fine. I'll to take
a swing at you. Uh, yeah.

2185
02:13:18,790 --> 02:13:21,670
I had a girl take a swing at me
halfway into the punch. I was like,

2186
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:26,290
I can't believe this is happening. I
know. I saw her fucking haul off. I go,

2187
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:30,730
this is why he's not going to fall through
it. This. I was like, oh my God, shoot.

2188
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,120
What did

2189
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:36,150
you do? Need this? And I grabbed her
like, what are you doing? Don't hit.

2190
02:13:36,151 --> 02:13:40,560
You just got to grab them. Mom and dad
used to beat the shit out of each other.

2191
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:44,870
Ah, they did enough crazy
girl when she, when I,

2192
02:13:44,990 --> 02:13:48,720
when I held onto her afterwards and
she admitted it to me like he was like,

2193
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:52,280
it was just a real ad. It tells
me when it was really, Oh God,

2194
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:57,560
Oh shit.
Vic was landed some shots thereby felt,

2195
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:03,490
oh, I cannot wait for us.
Made a fag, man. Hey Boys,

2196
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:06,600
we're talking about domestic
violent moment. Dude,

2197
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:11,300
we should enjoy this fun live in the
moment than I have been beaten by.

2198
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:12,600
That's a weird thing,
man.

2199
02:14:12,601 --> 02:14:15,540
When someone expresses some shit that
they saw from their mom and their dad,

2200
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:19,980
I had a real, I really lucky
that my step mom and my dad,

2201
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,780
my Stepdad,

2202
02:14:21,781 --> 02:14:26,010
and my mom rather had a
really good relationship and
my mom and my dad had a bad

2203
02:14:26,011 --> 02:14:30,090
relationship, so he saw. So I get to
see both. I get to see like what people,

2204
02:14:30,091 --> 02:14:32,200
when they love each other and
just real friendly. I just had,

2205
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:35,030
how well do you remember
your dad, your Stepdad, and

2206
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:40,800
your dad and your step dad were
shitheads fuck yeah. I was like, yeah.

2207
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:45,360
Did they hit you Eddie? My stepdaughter,
spinning back kick to the body.

2208
02:14:45,361 --> 02:14:46,700
Their Stepdad was

2209
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:50,760
Paul Felder looking good,

2210
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:55,170
but I'm glad he was because it made me
the man I am tonight and I'll put my

2211
02:14:55,171 --> 02:14:58,980
parents loved the shit out
of me. Hello, left Toe,

2212
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:02,190
your biological dad.
I even talked to him since I was seven.

2213
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:05,460
Do you remember him at all or nope. Does
he hit you up now for money and Teslas?

2214
02:15:07,530 --> 02:15:12,530
Put me on the [inaudible] podcast.

2215
02:15:12,811 --> 02:15:16,230
I got some great stories. C'Mon Bro.
We're talking about how I left your mom.

2216
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:20,900
Talk about how your mom
couldn't take a shot to kill.

2217
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:24,270
Imagine if he bugged you. Go.
That's the worst shit ever.

2218
02:15:24,271 --> 02:15:26,970
It's like when dudes bugging
you to be on your podcast and

2219
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:36,860
one of those things, how many people
contact you to get on the pocket?

2220
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:42,200
I got people that contact friends that
I know that contact me to contact you.

2221
02:15:42,281 --> 02:15:43,890
It's a nightmare and I always tell him,
I go,

2222
02:15:43,891 --> 02:15:46,190
it's never going to work all the time.
It's never going to work.

2223
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:50,380
I get that all day long. Let's see
coffee today. The guy goes, do it.

2224
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:53,610
Fight campaign tonight, right? Went, Yup,
sure. I'm with my son and make sure I met.

2225
02:15:53,611 --> 02:15:56,340
He's a cool tell Joe Gary from,
I'm like,

2226
02:15:58,230 --> 02:16:01,950
yeah, I'm moving in Montana and he's
crushing those. When I have enough money,

2227
02:16:01,951 --> 02:16:04,410
I'm going to move to Montana and get
off the internet. Quarter lane, Bro.

2228
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:09,180
We're all going to go to correlate. I
liked Montana. No quarter better. Okay.

2229
02:16:09,181 --> 02:16:13,640
Why do you like quarter Phil? Dude,
it's fucking, what does that mean?

2230
02:16:14,630 --> 02:16:19,040
Everything's perfect.
Beautiful. Gorgeous man. Eddie,

2231
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:22,070
if you go online, Jamie Vernon,
pull up pictures of your own spoken.

2232
02:16:22,610 --> 02:16:25,870
It's like 30 minutes rather
just drive the opposite.

2233
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:29,380
That's what I did every day and
spoken out. Drive Uber, Spokane, like

2234
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,210
full time property. Just hurt man.

2235
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:37,780
Oh, fell. Fell. He's got
them hurt. He's lipid.

2236
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:42,600
He's slipping by into your
headquarter and Felder. No,

2237
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:45,730
just switched guys. I'm
gonna Shit my pants. Why?

2238
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:50,710
I ain't seen shit bro. You have a toilet
shits. Waterworld it feels wonderful.

2239
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:55,070
That thing confused me, man. Shoot the
water before I could just shut it down.

2240
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:56,950
You can do both whatever you want.

2241
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:00,970
If you shoot it up there before it will
make you shit harder. He like shoots out.

2242
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:02,783
It's a primer.

2243
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:06,790
The problem with that is when you take
one of those shifts where you got just

2244
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:10,690
shit all over your ass and spray
something on, it gets messy.

2245
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:13,960
Shit goes everywhere. So we're going
to, do you want to use a quarter?

2246
02:17:13,961 --> 02:17:17,170
Like totally. Come on
Bro. That's beautiful. Wow

2247
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:21,730
Lake. No, it's gorgeous.
They're like, no dude,

2248
02:17:21,870 --> 02:17:26,230
I'm telling you this gorgeous big bear.
There's less white trash up there.

2249
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:28,810
The families get the other people
that are going to hate me for it.

2250
02:17:28,811 --> 02:17:31,950
They hate when I bring it up cause
I get so fucking sacred. Like,

2251
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:36,360
well they don't want it to be like
Nas Kanye restaurant. How share,

2252
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:39,920
how's it a secret of Kanye West
has a ski town or what? No.

2253
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:42,910
When is he going to be on your podcast?
What's happening? Oh Man. What's hard.

2254
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:47,560
Is that happening? No, it'll
probably happen. It's just Kanye is,

2255
02:17:47,590 --> 02:17:52,210
you know, he's a complicated artist and
I'm sure there's a bunch of other issues.

2256
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,160
First of all,
he wants to get to know me.

2257
02:17:54,161 --> 02:17:56,090
We got to get to hang out together and go,

2258
02:17:56,360 --> 02:18:00,470
oh James Felder with time that shit,
we'll do it.

2259
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:06,880
We'll do it to bring him.
He's a really nice guy, man.

2260
02:18:06,910 --> 02:18:09,250
When I talked to him on the
phone, he's a very, very nice guy.

2261
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:13,330
You already talked to him? Yeah, I
talked to him on the phone, so nice guy.

2262
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:18,580
We'll do it, but I'm not
in a rush, you know? Hey,

2263
02:18:18,581 --> 02:18:21,910
I told you guys I really liked doing
these. As much as I like doing anything.

2264
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:24,340
Like when someone says like,
what's a,

2265
02:18:24,341 --> 02:18:27,680
what's your favorite guest or a zero
one guests. You've never had aunt.

2266
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:32,770
It doesn't exist. They don't
exist. There's no one I
like. I like doing podcasts.

2267
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:38,310
I like doing podcasts with everyone
watching flights to than a future that,

2268
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:41,890
that guy who's working on longevity
drugs. That was fascinating. Yeah.

2269
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:46,060
John Sinclair. Where do I get resurveyed
or all? I need some of that resveratrol.

2270
02:18:46,061 --> 02:18:50,350
You can buy it online. Really shouldn't
learn how to spell it first. Oh Shit.

2271
02:18:50,351 --> 02:18:54,430
You drink it all day.
It's in wine or really low doses.

2272
02:18:54,431 --> 02:18:57,790
You really want to know more
fan industrial grade. Oh Shit.

2273
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:01,010
Felder's spinning like a motherfucker.
Ooh, leg kicked by Vic. Oh,

2274
02:19:01,011 --> 02:19:04,810
Vik with the jumping knee.
That's it. That's a wrap. Okay.

2275
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:09,760
55 okay, that's fair.
I know he's Vic soaps,

2276
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:14,020
so he got being cater.
Francis Kane of course Eddie.

2277
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:20,500
Um,
he's a great fight.

2278
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:25,060
I should be going for king because
he's Mexican. Take that out of it.

2279
02:19:25,090 --> 02:19:25,661
When it comes off,

2280
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:30,661
the best vaccine is titled go a fuck about
Mexicans when we inbox only in boxes.

2281
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:35,920
But I'm going with Kane.
I'm going to ask you,

2282
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:39,970
just scared me when throw any punches
against Derek Lewis. That's scared.

2283
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:43,610
But his last fight though, he fucking
starch Curtis blades. Yeah, he did.

2284
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:47,980
Here's my house. Here's my, I
don't know, like I use up wrestler,

2285
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:50,900
who's a fucking row,
a national champion.

2286
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:53,840
Juco risk snatch him.

2287
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:56,470
So he's back and that's the
second fight they've had. Okay.

2288
02:19:56,480 --> 02:20:01,180
So he's bet was he throwing a large amount
of punches and it was the first like

2289
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:05,630
30 seconds talk man, here's,

2290
02:20:05,631 --> 02:20:06,464
here's my take on it.

2291
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:11,500
Francis is a fucking specimen and his
story literally is like right at a corner

2292
02:20:11,501 --> 02:20:14,700
and the barbarian or the
heat or lower heart. No,

2293
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:19,040
he worked in a fucking sand mill,
digging sand,

2294
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:23,690
making sandbags all day. That's how
he, his body got strong. I mean,

2295
02:20:23,691 --> 02:20:28,250
he lived in this incredibly poor country
in Africa. He called my room. Yeah.

2296
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:31,310
He went and moved to France.
It was homeless.

2297
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:34,370
He learned how to fight and they
wanted to be a boxer and they said,

2298
02:20:34,371 --> 02:20:36,950
you should do MMA.
Four years later,

2299
02:20:36,951 --> 02:20:40,310
the guy is like at the pinnacle of MMA,

2300
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:44,870
fighting in the UFC against worldclass
competition and fucking people up.

2301
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:45,651
Do you understand that?

2302
02:20:45,651 --> 02:20:49,280
When he knocked out Alistair Overeem
with that vicious like shovel,

2303
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:51,810
that'd be the hardest upper
cut I've ever seen. It's,

2304
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:56,060
it's insane that he beat a guy
who's not just a worldclass fighter,

2305
02:20:56,061 --> 02:20:59,810
but a k one grand Prix
champion. A Guy, 20 years.

2306
02:21:00,010 --> 02:21:04,430
Find any Mexicans. He's older though. I
don't know. That's an older Allister star.

2307
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:07,160
We got heart. Well, it's an Alice
to weigh out the secret sauce.

2308
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:12,010
He didn't get that when Jamie goes,
you never seen Jay relief.

2309
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:14,150
That all fell to one is fine.
Felder one,

2310
02:21:14,151 --> 02:21:17,450
this one is fight Vic
Vic shaking his head.

2311
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:20,270
Felder,
Paul Felder.

2312
02:21:20,271 --> 02:21:23,360
I'm gonna text him right now
cause I'm friends with them
to turn it up. No, no, no.

2313
02:21:23,361 --> 02:21:25,340
That's okay.
He gave it his all.

2314
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:30,080
He's in Moses to get all fancy
texts like certain people. Yes.

2315
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:34,610
Still in the sky. This rapper
that I'm a huge fan of shaving.

2316
02:21:34,610 --> 02:21:39,260
Well shake. Well, oh man. Conspiracy
Rapper. No Dude, he's just, there's a,

2317
02:21:39,261 --> 02:21:43,160
there's a video called leg lock
on Youtube shake. Well it's,

2318
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:47,000
it's like a Tim and Eric. Awesome
show. Great job type video.

2319
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:50,720
It's fucking brilliant.
Watch that shit.

2320
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:54,420
And now we're texting now and I'm like,
we're going to make a song together. It's,

2321
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:57,590
I'm like, I'll Gideon fast.
And a lot of music unity.

2322
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:01,790
It's the same like I've always done.
I've never stopped. I never stopped.

2323
02:22:01,791 --> 02:22:05,380
I've always made music always. It's always
been doing the podcast for a second.

2324
02:22:05,381 --> 02:22:08,650
Stop doing podcasts. Right. Period.
You're not doing that anymore.

2325
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:13,430
You just started repeating myself all
the time. I'm like, you know what,

2326
02:22:13,431 --> 02:22:18,431
that's so annoying to deal with the
things off triply tinfoil hat podcast.

2327
02:22:18,890 --> 02:22:21,960
No. When did you see same? So I'll
Tripoli I haven't heard from days ago.

2328
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:25,410
Really good. Yeah, I see him at the
store. I see my right. You know what?

2329
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,470
On this podcast,

2330
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:30,950
that guy, I do my best. Sam's the
reason why it's also a great comp,

2331
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:34,320
Tripoli. He's fucking killing
it now. He's killing it.

2332
02:22:34,321 --> 02:22:36,390
He's literally one of the
reasons why started to cheat.

2333
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:40,590
Every time we go on the road some, you
know, sometimes I have shitty ass nights.

2334
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:45,860
I thank God that Sam triply goes
after me and saves the guy we went to.

2335
02:22:47,690 --> 02:22:49,410
I spent two weeks in
Afghanistan with that guy.

2336
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:52,740
That guy would get up and he would open
for us because he was the only one who

2337
02:22:52,741 --> 02:22:55,470
could soldiers just sitting there.
We'd be in the middle of nowhere.

2338
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:58,450
He would get up with a
shitty mic and destroyed.

2339
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:03,010
Now he's got 10 years under his belt.
Scheller he said,

2340
02:23:04,090 --> 02:23:05,720
I called him.
I've been doing standup.

2341
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:07,910
What's Tripoli for 20 plus
years and you know what?

2342
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:11,220
I'm straight up love tripling his fuckers.
Look at him.

2343
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:14,340
Sam Tripoli's podcast,
tinfoil. That's a Comcast.

2344
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:19,320
That's where I go off. Don't
hold. Don't hold John hostage

2345
02:23:20,890 --> 02:23:24,960
like subdued myself here.
Conspiracy theories, but if
you want to hear, we go off,

2346
02:23:24,961 --> 02:23:27,690
go to tin foil hat podcast. That's
what he goes. A good chance.

2347
02:23:27,691 --> 02:23:31,110
I wreck that new raptor after
out tonight. I love that. Raptor

2348
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:34,800
was nothing.
Brendan,

2349
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,890
I love that you bought that Elon
Musk took a bigger hit than that

2350
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:44,730
you have MOUs losses. This is legal,
right? He didn't lose his job.

2351
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:45,810
Come on,
dammit.

2352
02:23:45,810 --> 02:23:48,900
That had to be one of the most iconic
moments in the history of the Internet.

2353
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:49,471
First of all,

2354
02:23:49,471 --> 02:23:53,950
it's the small one in podcasts and it
was a a completely on the fly moment.

2355
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:57,470
Is that your biggest podcast? No. Biggest
one. What's the biggest one? Ship.

2356
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:02,380
You don't know who's number one?
Number one down most views.

2357
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:07,800
I only go by what you see on the,
first of all,

2358
02:24:07,801 --> 02:24:11,400
that'd be the biggest one in podcast
history. It also made me like Elon Musk.

2359
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:15,660
He's a good decision. Before I've
saw him around his kids go to a gym.

2360
02:24:15,661 --> 02:24:18,420
I just go to, I didn't dislike it,
but that may. I'm like, oh, he's cool.

2361
02:24:18,570 --> 02:24:22,480
I had to buy his car because I told them
I would buy his car when I did the part.

2362
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:26,430
I don't like him anymore.
That's right. I'm so happy. I
wish you did it. No, no, no.

2363
02:24:26,431 --> 02:24:29,440
I have eight other cars. It's just see
if my rap, you can run over your time.

2364
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:32,700
I love your raptor. But um, listen man,

2365
02:24:32,730 --> 02:24:37,530
I'm telling you that God damn Tesla is
the future. I think other cars are stupid.

2366
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:41,310
You know how many cars are their cars are
stupid. You know how many cars I have,

2367
02:24:41,311 --> 02:24:43,650
right? Yeah, I do. What
am I driving here today?

2368
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:47,700
I know it's harder to drive your title
Joel on cars. I drive here today.

2369
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:51,880
You drove the Tesla,
the Tesla.

2370
02:24:52,030 --> 02:24:56,290
I cause cause I know cause you're like,
cause I drove cause you're like dude,

2371
02:24:56,310 --> 02:25:00,520
if you drive my I do like dudes. I don't
like to fuck them all. I thought you did.

2372
02:25:01,590 --> 02:25:04,860
Oh cool. Joe Likes to fuck dude.
Brendan, you can't go there.

2373
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:08,310
You can't go there because look
her podcast, Bob cool with it.

2374
02:25:08,311 --> 02:25:09,001
We're still friends.

2375
02:25:09,001 --> 02:25:11,970
I like to think that if I was scared to
tell you all you really think test the

2376
02:25:11,971 --> 02:25:15,930
cars are gay. They're just not. I just
don't like, why don't you just drive mine?

2377
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:20,260
That's what I need to do. When you drive
on high and drunk right now, listen,

2378
02:25:21,150 --> 02:25:23,860
I get another one. If Shit goes
wrong, what about that Tesla did.

2379
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:25,870
He pretended to launch into space.
What about that one?

2380
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:28,090
That one's coming out in two years.
It's not out yet.

2381
02:25:28,091 --> 02:25:32,560
That one goes zero to 60 in 1.9
seconds. Good. That's trouble.

2382
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:33,161
Let me tell you.

2383
02:25:33,161 --> 02:25:36,700
Mine is 2.4 mine is the fastest fucking
thing I've ever driven in my life.

2384
02:25:36,701 --> 02:25:40,120
I have a Goddamn race car.
I have a Porsche gt,

2385
02:25:40,121 --> 02:25:41,770
three Rs from shark works.

2386
02:25:41,771 --> 02:25:46,630
I have a real goal that
Tesla as well made.

2387
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:49,570
It's feels like it.
It's different.

2388
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:52,400
Look at the fucking doesn't feel
the same because the same. This,

2389
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:56,020
she'll say you write mad
mad because now Joe can,

2390
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:59,130
Brian can bond on their
Teslas and now you're not

2391
02:26:01,150 --> 02:26:05,560
F-150 shit. You know what I mean? I
love all of you. I love all of you.

2392
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:08,560
You've got to listen to me.
The future or their cars are bullshit.

2393
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:09,370
I'm going to write it.

2394
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:13,870
I'm going to write a an article for like
cars are bullshit. No, no. Better yet.

2395
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:14,790
Other cars was dumb.

2396
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:20,440
I don't really started going to
his barbecue on the weed, Bro.

2397
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:24,970
Best car. No, no, no. Elan
told. He told me that, but he
did the podcast. I was like,

2398
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:29,800
get the fuck out of here because I had
an m five at the time and the m BMW m

2399
02:26:29,801 --> 02:26:32,740
five is a phenomenal car. The new
one's even better than the one I had,

2400
02:26:32,890 --> 02:26:35,620
but I was like, come on man.
I got a four door sedan.

2401
02:26:35,621 --> 02:26:38,650
It goes zero to 60 in three seconds
is shut your pie hole. I was like,

2402
02:26:38,651 --> 02:26:43,480
this is a nonsense coding through
Brendan. He hits. Oh my God. Listen,

2403
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:48,610
300 300 fucking miles. How
are you supposed to go to
Vegas? Last minute, whim,

2404
02:26:48,611 --> 02:26:52,750
trick. Anyway. Can you get someone else to
drive? It's good for a married man. Yeah.

2405
02:26:52,790 --> 02:26:56,760
Tests for sure.
Trying to get a test.

2406
02:26:56,770 --> 02:26:58,810
You're telling me you feel
alive when you draw me a test.

2407
02:26:58,811 --> 02:27:02,590
So compared to your gt three,
I feel like I'm living in the future.

2408
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:07,720
Tesla,
do you

2409
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:13,270
remember the switch was?
I do remember.

2410
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:15,290
I remember when they went to Vegas.

2411
02:27:23,690 --> 02:27:26,740
We can talk over each other. Do you
guys leach when you get sick to you?

2412
02:27:26,741 --> 02:27:30,010
Fucking old timers. Fuck you with general
electrician. What are you driving?

2413
02:27:30,011 --> 02:27:34,740
A Golf Cart

Japanese at a wonderful car.

2445
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:37,760
he is such a bad ass,
but his body is not

2446
02:29:39,430 --> 02:29:43,100
just the double decker tacos. He
doesn't have, when you look at his body,

2447
02:29:43,101 --> 02:29:45,350
you'd be like, that just
doesn't look like, okay,

2448
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:50,351
but I'm gonna save all that look shit
because he's got the best body ever for

2449
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:55,000
the MMAS heavyweight division. When he
was in his prime, well that body body,

2450
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:57,620
he knocked out,
make it tomorrow.

2451
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:02,200
He took giant bombs from Czech
Congo and I see what you're saying,

2452
02:30:02,201 --> 02:30:07,201
but not that that was the same body mass
that's not flapping around like a ball

2453
02:30:08,830 --> 02:30:12,440
cap the biceps or lose number one
heavyweight for me, Jon Jones.

2454
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:16,700
Hey guys, let's not talk over each
other. This has gotta be ruthless

2455
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:19,970
in his prime when he was at his best,

2456
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:23,570
like when he knocked out man Notaro you
know when he beat up rather as an error

2457
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:26,240
look at fate or his body.
Yeah, exactly. It's true.

2458
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:31,070
It's the body that the way it looks,
I was talking about flat earth.

2459
02:30:31,390 --> 02:30:35,360
It means nothing. It doesn't matter. Well
guess what fucks we'll find out tonight.

2460
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:38,850
Cause Francis has the best
bodies body and k looks like a a,

2461
02:30:39,330 --> 02:30:42,950
they were talking about like the,
the female UFC bodies.

2462
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:51,380
Louise, do you guys never
do? I always do. Never here.

2463
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:56,390
My favorite is volunteers. It's always
about with, I think she's so hot.

2464
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:59,440
Cody. Garbrandt it's
always the same shit. No,

2465
02:30:59,441 --> 02:31:03,750
you take the stage. Oh no sort
of itch. I'm going to show us.

2466
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:10,240
She's better looking than the ring cargo
van Zandt dime piece Rose Nama Juniors.

2467
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:17,180
Oh, switch has preposterous
genetics. Oh rose.

2468
02:31:17,181 --> 02:31:18,710
Nama Jealous.
They're just

2469
02:31:20,570 --> 02:31:24,030
to me so much money stripping in
wigs like long wigs. She come,

2470
02:31:24,031 --> 02:31:26,630
makes a ring walk and she's got
this long as it takes it off.

2471
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:32,340
And that becomes your thing I think.
I think for me,

2472
02:31:32,341 --> 02:31:34,650
I don't know what it is so hot.
You know,

2473
02:31:34,651 --> 02:31:38,400
rose is one of the most beautiful women
in the history of the sport and she's

2474
02:31:38,401 --> 02:31:40,410
the one who emphasizes it.
Almost the least.

2475
02:31:40,570 --> 02:31:45,060
Who naturally beautiful magazines,
Beautiful Bald,

2476
02:31:45,630 --> 02:31:50,460
Bald Rose Rama, Julia. She's stunning
looking. She's stunning. Looking amazing.

2477
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:53,850
She's cool.
She's a great fighter.

2478
02:31:53,851 --> 02:31:57,320
She's also like super
fucking like Keith Carradine.

2479
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:01,080
She's into her own life,
her own way, you know.

2480
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:05,270
Definitely hasn't gotten Hollywood with
the Nah, man. She's like, she's like when?

2481
02:32:05,271 --> 02:32:09,090
When she wins the fight and knocks
out nominee Eunice, y'all, you know,

2482
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:11,580
y'all just be nice to each
other. It's like, why?

2483
02:32:11,581 --> 02:32:15,900
She's great movie right there
at that fight with Joanna. John,

2484
02:32:15,901 --> 02:32:16,810
John to bitch.

2485
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:26,040
Tell her name right now and I can say it.
Spell it

2486
02:32:27,610 --> 02:32:32,550
again. Genji yeah, but we can
say it. You had to write it down.

2487
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:35,940
It wouldn't be right. What does it,
Jay can't spell. What do you think?

2488
02:32:35,941 --> 02:32:39,030
What percentage don't fans of hers?
It's a hard name.

2489
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:45,120
Brian. Stan just started calling her.
You want a champion? He just gave up.

2490
02:32:45,140 --> 02:32:49,620
That's just lazy. Bryan Wright
at house, while he's respectful,

2491
02:32:49,890 --> 02:32:53,370
he's a Goddamn all American who's more
all American than Brian's kind of hard

2492
02:32:53,371 --> 02:32:57,590
enough thought. He can't be crazy
names. As an American, it's tough.

2493
02:32:57,620 --> 02:33:01,390
No level of hard. It's that. It's
that that tie level, you know,

2494
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:04,060
cause some of them tie names.
Song Tong,

2495
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:10,250
jeopardy champion level. Yeah.
That's a hard one. Those show me be,

2496
02:33:10,251 --> 02:33:15,030
I'm right there with the
brushes and money. Me and
Wolf Blitzer was on jeopardy.

2497
02:33:15,031 --> 02:33:19,170
I'd lose five pounds,
something like that.

2498
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:22,830
Can anybody here spell,
does the beats last name?

2499
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:29,160
He's the one I might be able to
get online.

2500
02:33:29,370 --> 02:33:33,900
Why would we want to spell that?
Normal. No one spells really anymore.

2501
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:36,180
What I'm saying Jamie could do it.

2502
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:39,750
Those whose names are hard to remember
because to this day right now I still

2503
02:33:39,751 --> 02:33:44,500
don't know is the beats lashkars
hormone monster Sherif part.

2504
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:48,750
But here's the thing about these
nerves and worked for the FC Bro.

2505
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:50,340
But did you have to be

2506
02:33:52,350 --> 02:33:54,090
practiced it over and over again?

2507
02:33:54,091 --> 02:33:57,000
Because I had a really hard time with
it to the point where his coaches were

2508
02:33:57,001 --> 02:34:01,470
saying just calm rooms that beat and that
felt that was disrespectful. But yeah,

2509
02:34:01,471 --> 02:34:05,430
but it felt like this, this is the
gentleman's name, he's excellent.

2510
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:09,550
I don't see the difference.
I never thought like,

2511
02:34:09,551 --> 02:34:13,710
cause Dave's last name I
just gave up on it. And said,

2512
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,800
there's no way I could do this. You know,
we have to respect the phallic say this,

2513
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:21,160
but we have to respect the fact that
they have a totally different language in

2514
02:34:21,161 --> 02:34:22,830
terms of like their letters,
letters,

2515
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:25,420
they can respect the fact that they
have complete different language.

2516
02:34:25,430 --> 02:34:28,640
Makes a fucking tough. It's
very hard. It's difficult to,

2517
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:31,030
I don't know what the fuck's
going to happen right here.

2518
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:34,120
I do not know what the phone
can we hear them discount,

2519
02:34:34,121 --> 02:34:36,850
get his head in his chest.
He kicked off of Youtube or some shit.

2520
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:42,580
We just need to watch this on her own. Um,
I'm, in my opinion, this is what it is.

2521
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:47,530
The greatest as it in terms of best I've
ever seen performances. He's the most,

2522
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:49,210
one of the most stunning
athletes I've ever seen.

2523
02:34:49,210 --> 02:34:52,420
Cain Velasquez like one of the most
amazing heavyweights of all time,

2524
02:34:52,421 --> 02:34:55,090
if not the best of all time.
He, he, he might be the best.

2525
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:59,350
And then Francis at all the guys I've
ever seen fight is the scariest of all

2526
02:34:59,351 --> 02:35:03,850
time. He has the most of all in.
Sure. Yup. Yup, Yup. Most potential.

2527
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:04,481
He,

2528
02:35:04,481 --> 02:35:09,481
he's only been fighting a small amount
of time and he's already in like world

2529
02:35:09,611 --> 02:35:10,810
class competition.

2530
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:13,840
You have to understand to knock out a
guy like Alistair Overeem literally like

2531
02:35:13,841 --> 02:35:16,480
five years in a training that's insane.

2532
02:35:17,050 --> 02:35:21,670
He something uniquely special
in terms of his like, like the,

2533
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:22,181
the what,

2534
02:35:22,181 --> 02:35:27,040
the shit that he had to endure working
in a fucking sand mine digging bags of

2535
02:35:27,041 --> 02:35:29,860
sand,
the kind of power that he possesses.

2536
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:32,810
If he just gets all those
other pieces in place. He like,

2537
02:35:32,830 --> 02:35:35,440
in terms of like an
overall physical specimen,

2538
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:39,550
he's one of the scariest of all time.
So this is, this is an amazing fight.

2539
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:44,530
I mean this is like as good as it
gets if you're an MMA fan. Holy Shit.

2540
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,800
This is literally as good as it gets.
It just,

2541
02:35:46,801 --> 02:35:48,730
just depends on what
version of gain we get.

2542
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:52,490
It's not uncommon in this sport for uh,
you know,

2543
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:57,530
fast rising stars that are
a rising because of their
beastliness and their knock

2544
02:35:57,531 --> 02:36:01,420
out power. It's not uncommon for
them to not train Jujitsu. Right.

2545
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:04,390
We've seen plenty of them.
You know what I mean?

2546
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:09,400
How crazy would it be if Zingano
actually trained Jujitsu, right.

2547
02:36:09,401 --> 02:36:11,340
And fell. No, we got time for
that. You know what I mean?

2548
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:15,310
We don't know what he does.
Right. We don't know if he
does not over there. Well,

2549
02:36:15,311 --> 02:36:19,240
I know when he got in for Steve Bay,
they show you just hit [inaudible] center.

2550
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:22,590
But how loud, if he say he just,

2551
02:36:22,690 --> 02:36:27,010
he just went to Danaher's just
fell in love with John Danner.

2552
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:28,300
They just became best friends.

2553
02:36:28,330 --> 02:36:32,350
That would be the jumped in I imagine
how good he is. 36 so that would be,

2554
02:36:32,351 --> 02:36:36,430
you know what I mean? Up with Jujitsu.
He's how old is, you could only survive,

2555
02:36:36,910 --> 02:36:39,160
knock out power for solar.
You know what I mean?

2556
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:41,790
After a while you're going
to be getting clips easily.

2557
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:46,050
Tail Hook guys were killing this show by
talking over each other like this. Yeah,

2558
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:49,640
you're, you're 100% right. You know what
I'm saying is eventually no matter, no.

2559
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:50,890
We see over and over again.

2560
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:55,540
No matter how Beasley you are and how
powerful you are with those punches,

2561
02:36:55,810 --> 02:36:58,630
eventually you're going to get clipped.
Right. You're going to go down.

2562
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:03,370
So eventually you might have to switch
your strategy to instead of going out

2563
02:37:03,371 --> 02:37:06,250
there and just trying to knock a dude
out to going out there and try to take it

2564
02:37:06,251 --> 02:37:10,390
to the town and submit this month where
we go, well, and he's so powerful.

2565
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:13,230
If he had good wrestling skills,
holy shit,

2566
02:37:13,231 --> 02:37:17,210
you're gonna find out right is
the thing is like with wrestlers,

2567
02:37:17,211 --> 02:37:19,910
don't you think that you have to
learn it at a really young age? Well,

2568
02:37:19,911 --> 02:37:24,580
George Saint Pierre
didn't, right? Oh shoot,

2569
02:37:24,980 --> 02:37:28,580
ain't got clip on the left
hand right there. Good Damn.

2570
02:37:30,190 --> 02:37:34,070
Damn. Look how giant he loves.
So shit dude, he's so big.

2571
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:36,950
He's so big and so dangerous.

2572
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:44,510
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

2573
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:51,160
Come on man.
He's incredible.

2574
02:37:51,650 --> 02:37:54,440
Did he blew his ACL, MCL, LCL.

2575
02:37:54,530 --> 02:37:57,440
Something's wrong with
his leg or maybe not dude.

2576
02:37:57,470 --> 02:38:01,580
And Cain is one of the best of all time.
That's how good in Ghana was.

2577
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:06,050
Damn. He got through that block. Fuck.

2578
02:38:06,830 --> 02:38:10,040
He got through it and a
big

2579
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:13,160
guy I've ever seen,

2580
02:38:13,190 --> 02:38:17,660
and it wouldn't have been a surprise
if in Ghana was super cautious.

2581
02:38:17,661 --> 02:38:21,410
Maybe two rounds of being super cautious.
We wouldn't be that surprised, aimless,

2582
02:38:21,411 --> 02:38:24,380
the aggressor. Chill out, Bro.

2583
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:28,180
But the fact that he fucking threw
down like this, boom, he went, oh,

2584
02:38:29,570 --> 02:38:33,530
you almost like forearm. He got
forearmed in the first. The first

2585
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:39,820
to
admit,

2586
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:45,320
no, let's see. This again.
Never got hit anywhere.

2587
02:38:46,130 --> 02:38:50,540
Oh Jesus.
Oh Shit.

2588
02:38:50,541 --> 02:38:52,590
We saw the fight differently.
Oh Wow.

2589
02:38:54,650 --> 02:38:58,970
Everybody missed it. We all missed
this Friday. Then for Caina,

2590
02:38:59,230 --> 02:39:01,160
let's be real damn

2591
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:08,480
back injury, and I said this, that
the Lcl, MCL blog gets MCL. Right?

2592
02:39:08,481 --> 02:39:11,180
Then when it's bent this way, when
it comes to this, that's all of them.

2593
02:39:11,210 --> 02:39:16,010
That's MCO. How old is he
now? I don't know, but he's
a weathered, whatever it is.

2594
02:39:17,060 --> 02:39:18,920
There's 37 37

2595
02:39:22,850 --> 02:39:26,750
now. I wouldn't even fight. You
could only take so many wars.

2596
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:29,240
Each war is significant in your life.

2597
02:39:29,241 --> 02:39:34,241
Like each one took some of your
life and eventually that's it.

2598
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:38,810
You can't, you already, you went to
five crazy wars. That's not that.

2599
02:39:38,811 --> 02:39:41,540
That's what Tom or that ended that
way. Well, you know what it is, man.

2600
02:39:41,541 --> 02:39:44,720
I think guys that are that
championship caliber like cane,

2601
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:49,110
their mind is so ferocious that their
body is almost like a space ship

2602
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:53,500
reentering. It's missing tiles and
it starts fuck a chicken apart.

2603
02:39:53,510 --> 02:39:58,430
There's so powerful in terms of their
ability to keep driving, keep driving,

2604
02:39:58,431 --> 02:39:59,600
and then the knees go in,

2605
02:39:59,601 --> 02:40:03,620
the neck goes tobaccos and then you deal
with these physical realities of the

2606
02:40:03,621 --> 02:40:07,090
body that you're giving. Still
there. [inaudible] still there,

2607
02:40:07,091 --> 02:40:10,910
but I know that when I was
saying in the middle of that,

2608
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:14,280
I'm in the middle of trying to come
back. Yeah. You know what I mean?

2609
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:17,460
Right now since my shoulder,
it's been six months in my,

2610
02:40:17,610 --> 02:40:21,030
since my shoulder surgery had my
bicep reattached to my shoulder,

2611
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:26,130
had knee surgery about 10 months ago.
That's still not 100% like it's still,

2612
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:29,130
they're not red.
They're still rolling with,

2613
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:32,160
I'm rolling with 130
pound blue belts and shit,

2614
02:40:32,180 --> 02:40:36,210
but he read my shit the last three weeks
I've been rolling with some little blue

2615
02:40:36,211 --> 02:40:41,040
belts that I gotta be able to have like
50 pounds on them and have total control.

2616
02:40:41,530 --> 02:40:43,110
You know at this point,
you know what I mean?

2617
02:40:43,111 --> 02:40:47,010
I'm little for Francis and
blown ACL for Kate. Well,

2618
02:40:47,011 --> 02:40:51,150
I mean it definitely is a blown knee for
cane, but Francis, when's your fight?

2619
02:40:51,160 --> 02:40:54,270
Because like when Francis was
coming after him and he clipped him,

2620
02:40:54,271 --> 02:40:56,620
he definitely clipped him with
that forearm behind the neck.

2621
02:40:56,650 --> 02:41:01,050
80 or hundred percent. That's a
nightmare. That's a nightmare outcome.

2622
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:05,940
100% cause Francis
just clipped and knocked down.

2623
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:09,360
Do you want to hear about, they say,
yeah. What do they have to say? Yeah,

2624
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:12,540
give me some volume.
I look at the teeth on them.

2625
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:14,773
I don't hear anything.

2626
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:18,310
Good job, Jamie. There it goes.

2627
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:22,543
Okay.

2628
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:46,770
I mean he believes date now.

2629
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:55,840
He did, but I liked it the way
he was moving in on them, man.

2630
02:41:55,841 --> 02:41:57,150
I mean he really did look

2631
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:03,630
on that Land Rover at that forum. Did
that forum later in the back of his neck.

2632
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:10,200
You know what man, I'm going to rethink
what I said. I'm going to rethink it.

2633
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:14,730
I know.
I thought I saw his forearm clip.

2634
02:42:14,731 --> 02:42:17,550
His neck. He blows it. Wait,
no, no, no, no trouble.

2635
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:20,400
What do you think you did
hit him with that? No,

2636
02:42:20,490 --> 02:42:24,820
he kind of felt though before that
he'll Jaynie goes, that's what it is.

2637
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:29,640
That's what it is. And he gets
out just a shit. The thing is,

2638
02:42:29,641 --> 02:42:33,570
he's so heavy handed.
I think you might be correct,

2639
02:42:33,571 --> 02:42:38,280
but I do think that he connected with
his neck or the guys this heavy handed

2640
02:42:39,460 --> 02:42:43,920
that? Nope. Nope. Nothing here.
Nothing. Nothing there though.

2641
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:48,480
Nothing Nigos out. Oh, because
you're right. You're right.

2642
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:51,600
You're right. I was wrong. I thought
it was, I thought it hit his neck.

2643
02:42:51,601 --> 02:42:56,180
It did not hit his neck. It hit
his back. Right shoulder. No. Yeah,

2644
02:42:56,190 --> 02:43:01,080
here we go. It was clear. There is
that. Here we go. Yeah. Holy Shit Dude.

2645
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:04,880
He was throwing him around.
He's a freak for it to saint gotta.

2646
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:07,273
Yeah,

2647
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:14,980
that's a lineman right there.
A middle linebacker, right?

2648
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:18,760
Well, he's not done. See
the thing about this guys,

2649
02:43:18,790 --> 02:43:21,910
he hasn't been fighting for very long
though. Even though he loses to steep.

2650
02:43:21,911 --> 02:43:26,230
Bain has that. The timid
performance against Lewis. He says,

2651
02:43:26,231 --> 02:43:29,470
so little mileage. What does
it say about his name? Hold on.

2652
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:37,580
Is that that's how it happened. I know
it wasn't the result you're looking for.

2653
02:43:37,581 --> 02:43:42,490
It will take some time, but how soon
might we see you back in and you know

2654
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:48,050
they're more calm and relaxed,

2655
02:43:51,470 --> 02:43:53,230
so breaking everyone was going to happen

2656
02:43:53,630 --> 02:43:58,280
or it's the worst. Very classy.
Yeah. Came very classy. You know,

2657
02:43:58,410 --> 02:44:03,140
never bitter.
How weird is it?

2658
02:44:03,141 --> 02:44:07,960
The Fox and this one, he's not
even talking about his knee thing.

2659
02:44:07,970 --> 02:44:10,520
He's going to retire things.
You're more tired.

2660
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:14,720
No need to apologize. I know I
speak for UFC fans around the world.

2661
02:44:15,210 --> 02:44:19,120
That's Cy way, by the way. How good
is, how good is Jon Anik? He's a bass.

2662
02:44:19,130 --> 02:44:23,310
That's the best. It's such a
bummer to lose. Wonderful that Jon.

2663
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:27,160
Anik is so good. I love John.
I'm so impressed with him.
Like when I work with him,

2664
02:44:27,161 --> 02:44:31,540
he's, he's, he's so like,
he's such a good commentator.

2665
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:36,230
He had the first thing, I'm
going to make sure it ESPN,
MMA, like can I, let me, let,

2666
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:39,040
let, let's look at this was
the shoulders was the, was

2667
02:44:40,650 --> 02:44:44,940
maybe an upper cut. Might've landed right
there. Ooh, my right there. Right there.

2668
02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:48,430
I'm going to lay in that
upper cut. Might've sat them
down the Opera Cup. Mighty

2669
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:54,580
God. Here we go. It's hard to
tell right way to go again.

2670
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:57,110
Here we go. So nothing, nothing

2671
02:44:59,370 --> 02:45:04,200
so far, nothing. Watch this right
here. Right here. Right here.

2672
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:07,470
Oh,
oh,

2673
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:12,220
upper cut yourself.
Can I redeem myself?

2674
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:15,380
Okay, let's see. You are
correct. You're right.

2675
02:45:16,150 --> 02:45:20,680
Different anger missed
it. That was a legit, when

2676
02:45:23,660 --> 02:45:26,840
I was getting too close,
I was just, cause he,

2677
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:29,770
I forgot he blew his knee out
for sure because the upper cut

2678
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:36,420
down that sat him down.
He knows this is what's important.

2679
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:39,270
This is what's important.
And Matt, Matt Tie,

2680
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:44,280
he has a fantastic article out right now
about one of the problems with society

2681
02:45:44,380 --> 02:45:47,830
today is that people look at the
news like they look at sports.

2682
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:51,340
Like someone asks me write about things.
You have to know everything.

2683
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:54,520
But it's a great article.
Matt Taibbi,

2684
02:45:54,730 --> 02:45:59,650
this is a perfect example of four guys
who are lifelong martial artists and we

2685
02:45:59,651 --> 02:46:03,520
both went both ways. I was like, you're
right. And then we saw it again. Like,

2686
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:07,970
you're right, you're right. That's how
you're supposed to look at Shit. Yeah.

2687
02:46:08,140 --> 02:46:09,830
That's how you're supposed look at once.
It

2688
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:16,910
can't be attached to certain fight.
Certain fights, it gets stopped early.

2689
02:46:16,911 --> 02:46:19,970
Okay. Tj Answer Huda. I thought
it was stopped early. Don't,

2690
02:46:19,990 --> 02:46:22,820
I've talked to people that say they
didn't think it was stopped early and I'm

2691
02:46:22,821 --> 02:46:27,300
like, all right, Oh hey, I'll
listen to me. He clipped him. Right.

2692
02:46:27,390 --> 02:46:31,070
But I felt like when I watched it that
you got to give a guy a chance to fight

2693
02:46:31,071 --> 02:46:32,450
more.
But especially on the,

2694
02:46:32,510 --> 02:46:37,510
I'll hear you out in the NFL when they
review plays they review them and one of

2695
02:46:38,601 --> 02:46:42,470
the most important things about reviewing
a play is that you have multiple

2696
02:46:42,471 --> 02:46:47,120
angles. Yeah, it's all good.
The all, all three angles,

2697
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:50,160
they keep going back to the
first angle we didn't get,

2698
02:46:50,210 --> 02:46:53,570
we didn't get a good enough angle
because that right hand was like a ghost

2699
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:56,000
writer. I didn't see it. You
guys saw it. I didn't see it.

2700
02:46:56,100 --> 02:46:57,430
Well you know what I say we need them.

2701
02:46:57,500 --> 02:47:01,640
So exciting was shit like that is going
on and the UFC truck has the best in the

2702
02:47:01,641 --> 02:47:04,460
world. Like mark till the grotto
and all those dudes back there.

2703
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:07,310
Anthony Giordano and the whole crew.
They're always moving.

2704
02:47:07,311 --> 02:47:10,880
Mark [inaudible] Mark Tog
Rodney motherfucker. He works,

2705
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:15,860
he figures out what the replacement. I
love him. He's like, he didn't know that.

2706
02:47:15,861 --> 02:47:19,760
Take it from the best. I didn't
know that. I fucking love that dude.

2707
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:22,610
He's the shit he's,
he does like,

2708
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:24,950
he'll like pick the play by play angles.

2709
02:47:25,130 --> 02:47:29,060
He'll pick like shit and cause
fights because he knows. Yeah.

2710
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:33,850
Todd Feldman Raid Bank off a fucking
Francis by the way. He did big bank. Damn.

2711
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:38,320
I'm telling you dude, if that guy keeps
learning and it seems like he got out,

2712
02:47:38,330 --> 02:47:39,500
he had a weird spot.

2713
02:47:39,501 --> 02:47:42,530
But you know what I really like about
that weird spot that he got into?

2714
02:47:43,490 --> 02:47:45,020
He was honest about it.
He said,

2715
02:47:45,021 --> 02:47:50,021
I carried over fear from my last fight
guy who can look at himself that honestly

2716
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:54,110
ego plus his ego got out of control
because he was not going to dude's out and

2717
02:47:54,111 --> 02:47:55,620
then that's a good thing.

2718
02:47:58,110 --> 02:48:01,070
He said that in an interview like
even as his ego's his coaches,

2719
02:48:01,071 --> 02:48:02,570
like he just thought he
was bigger than the game.

2720
02:48:03,270 --> 02:48:07,880
Got humbled and now he fucking just
knocked out Cain Velasquez before that he

2721
02:48:07,881 --> 02:48:12,230
murked fucking homeboy.
Yup. Chris Blades. Hi.

2722
02:48:12,231 --> 02:48:13,700
Can't remember the name.
He looked,

2723
02:48:13,701 --> 02:48:16,130
he looked like he was in a
different weight category.

2724
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:20,290
I can't remember the Alaska. He's
the based on your strength, you know,

2725
02:48:20,310 --> 02:48:24,860
it is like the future is an
athlete that really at 265 pounds,

2726
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:27,440
it doesn't have to gain any weight.
It doesn't have to lose anyway. Oh,

2727
02:48:27,441 --> 02:48:31,350
they're going to show it to us again.
The the future is until we've talked how,

2728
02:48:31,351 --> 02:48:35,390
who is this? Her debut a Fox.
Cain gets knocked up by G jds.

2729
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:38,940
Jesus Christ. You have ESPN.
He gets knocked up by Francis.

2730
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:43,070
He took that jab right there to Frances.
Frances clipped him with a Hard Jab.

2731
02:48:44,150 --> 02:48:47,580
Yeah. He's so fun. Understand
what you're saying. Okay.

2732
02:48:49,070 --> 02:48:51,200
That's a legit point. I
just wanted to be like, oh,

2733
02:48:52,970 --> 02:48:56,330
100% some quick fast and gum.
I want to say that again.

2734
02:48:56,331 --> 02:49:01,010
I want to look at how fast he is. Back
up just a wee bit. Yes. Out of the play.

2735
02:49:01,011 --> 02:49:04,730
This over and over. Let's look. Let's
look at this. The kitchen. We're sweet.

2736
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:05,720
See he hits him.

2737
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:10,680
Nothing fucking right hand shovel.
It's

2738
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:17,210
can we get slow mo is that he hits
him with a right going into the faith.

2739
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:22,080
Pursue, pursue. He said, see you try
one more time. I think his knees. Okay.

2740
02:49:22,081 --> 02:49:26,580
Right now. Nah. Hell
No. Ooh. Wait a minute.

2741
02:49:26,610 --> 02:49:30,450
That's why I came to him and he goes,
I can't really keep close to sue.

2742
02:49:30,700 --> 02:49:35,480
He's so powerful. Watch
this. Watch this. Play,

2743
02:49:36,390 --> 02:49:39,790
play, pause, play, pause, play,
pause, play pucks, directv guy.

2744
02:49:40,370 --> 02:49:43,380
He gets a VCR in the nineties this angle,

2745
02:49:43,381 --> 02:49:47,820
it looks like we're trying to get a TV
in the nineties for sure is a good angle

2746
02:49:47,821 --> 02:49:50,530
for in Ghana right here.
Oh right.

2747
02:49:52,470 --> 02:49:57,020
Watch this. Watch his head move. Ooh. And
then he got clipped and that's what I,

2748
02:49:57,021 --> 02:50:00,090
that's why I came. Did it, address that
and he goes, I got to close too soon.

2749
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:02,450
He's too,
when you,

2750
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:06,870
when you think about a person that might
be like for period the cocaine party

2751
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:09,960
where you're saying you think about
a person like he, you know he's,

2752
02:50:09,961 --> 02:50:14,250
he's essentially like optimize
it to 65 or he's optimized.

2753
02:50:14,370 --> 02:50:15,090
He's like a fish,

2754
02:50:15,090 --> 02:50:19,460
a real to 65 for five
rounds of July is optimize.

2755
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:21,030
Well here's the thing though,

2756
02:50:21,470 --> 02:50:25,710
he all he has to do is get better at that
first round and do you really think a

2757
02:50:25,711 --> 02:50:27,970
lot of guys are going to make it
into their second or third now?

2758
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:31,560
Just play it in slow motion.
Fuck, I missed this angle.

2759
02:50:31,561 --> 02:50:34,880
It looks like you missed this and I don't
really know. He shoveled. Who Know us.

2760
02:50:34,950 --> 02:50:38,080
Can we hold on, hold
on, hold on. Slow motion

2761
02:50:41,510 --> 02:50:42,180
kind of percent.

2762
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:46,380
That's clips of the hundred percent
says that you see his head move.

2763
02:50:46,530 --> 02:50:49,980
That's why I came to throws a single
leg on the ref cause he's concussed.

2764
02:50:50,580 --> 02:50:54,900
He went for the single Francis is the
scariest of all time of all time over

2765
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:59,250
ubering. Dude. The thing
about Francis speed, he's,

2766
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:02,730
he's learning at this
like really rapid rate.

2767
02:51:02,731 --> 02:51:05,460
When you look at a guy that's only
been doing it for how many years now?

2768
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,160
A hundred percent train has
been fighting for two weeks.

2769
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,820
He's been fighting for
like maybe five years,

2770
02:51:11,510 --> 02:51:13,950
I think five years from the
time he learns martial arts.

2771
02:51:14,430 --> 02:51:18,600
His Dad was some legendary fights.
He was doing this with saying, dude,

2772
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:22,740
he's a movie character. If he can
just get over the hump that he got,

2773
02:51:22,741 --> 02:51:25,710
look the steep pay me. Oh, chicks
fight. That's what's up man.

2774
02:51:25,711 --> 02:51:29,140
I mean he got to the top of
the mount dude. He's fun.

2775
02:51:29,450 --> 02:51:32,010
DC now bend your boy k.

2776
02:51:33,950 --> 02:51:38,600
Alright. Alright. Michael Jai White Guy.

2777
02:51:38,601 --> 02:51:43,601
Like terrified right now
how Francis Michael just to

2778
02:51:45,250 --> 02:51:49,650
spawn is huge.
But Francis is a giant.

2779
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:50,970
Francis has giant.

2780
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:57,340
The giant. No, I've trained with him.

2781
02:51:57,370 --> 02:52:01,170
He's nowhere near as big short and he's
still played rock. You train with Hoop,

2782
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:06,250
right? Michael Jai white came into a box
somewhere. Maybe he's not as tall spawn

2783
02:52:06,300 --> 02:52:08,920
and John knew.
Maybe he's not as tall as him,

2784
02:52:09,070 --> 02:52:11,540
but in the movies you could
make them taller. Oh for sure.

2785
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:15,550
Be The permanent jet fighter.
Oh 100% I was kid.

2786
02:52:15,551 --> 02:52:20,551
I watch Michael Jai white do a hopping
sidekick on a bag at legends and snap the

2787
02:52:20,741 --> 02:52:24,550
chain. The chain broke. You remember
that? He has, he has he ever had? Nope.

2788
02:52:24,930 --> 02:52:29,820
He fought. Fought some cute
boy Joey lights in the spawn.

2789
02:52:29,950 --> 02:52:33,760
He's legit.
Blackbelt and Cook Shin Flexing nobody.

2790
02:52:33,761 --> 02:52:38,380
Nobody is more critical judge of kicking
technique than me. The kicks. Perfect.

2791
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:41,740
He does everything. He's a
monk. 100% legit black belt.

2792
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:45,230
So I'm telling Michael Shy why about
how he's a black male for sure.

2793
02:52:45,390 --> 02:52:48,090
This is a real quick, there's a good
story. Let me finish this while he's here.

2794
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:51,490
Michael, I'm telling Michael
Jai white over and over.

2795
02:52:51,491 --> 02:52:55,880
I'm trying to explain to him how bad
of a motherfucker Joe is with that turn

2796
02:52:55,881 --> 02:52:57,580
inside sidekick. I go, dude,

2797
02:52:57,910 --> 02:53:02,910
I'm telling Michael Shy why
all the stories that there's
so many stories of Joe

2798
02:53:02,921 --> 02:53:06,310
hitting the bag in front of
traditional martial artists. You know,

2799
02:53:08,830 --> 02:53:11,880
nobody can kick the bag.
Like fucking show. Yeah.

2800
02:53:12,190 --> 02:53:15,370
Everybody knows that now cause
it's all over youtube at fifth.

2801
02:53:15,371 --> 02:53:18,910
But before that I was the one trying
to fucking tell everybody because I'm

2802
02:53:18,911 --> 02:53:20,530
hanging out with Joe.
He's kicking the fucker.

2803
02:53:20,540 --> 02:53:23,290
That della grout there when he's holding
that thing you were kicking out and

2804
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:27,670
everybody, GSP freaks out when he
GSP freaks out. When Joe Rogan kicks,

2805
02:53:28,240 --> 02:53:31,570
I and I knew I had a film this year. So
weird, flexible. You can do the splits.

2806
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:35,740
Let me finish. Let me finish the
story real quick. Let me just finish.

2807
02:53:35,790 --> 02:53:40,320
It just seems really crazy. So I'm sitting
there and listen, let me just fuck.

2808
02:53:41,830 --> 02:53:45,940
I'm telling Michael's I white all
about Joe Rogan's turning sidekick.

2809
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:47,560
I'm blowing them the fuck up.

2810
02:53:47,620 --> 02:53:51,190
Telling him the GSP story that's
on youtube that has a million,

2811
02:53:51,820 --> 02:53:55,480
gazillion views. All this shit
everybody knows about us now.

2812
02:53:55,481 --> 02:53:59,200
The old taekwondo footage just coming
out when he's fucking, there's a,

2813
02:53:59,470 --> 02:54:02,800
there's a a clip with Joe do an attorney
inside sidekick hitting the dude and

2814
02:54:02,801 --> 02:54:05,970
the guy drops. You know what I mean? And
George's walks away like he's seen him,

2815
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:08,710
like he's done it a million
times. He's just, you know,

2816
02:54:08,711 --> 02:54:12,310
so he's become like this legend. So
I'm telling Michael, shy Hawaiian,

2817
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:16,660
all this at legends and then we walk
up to the fucking the bag. He goes,

2818
02:54:16,661 --> 02:54:19,930
I got a pretty good turn inside
kicked too. Oh, she's Atlanta.

2819
02:54:19,990 --> 02:54:24,010
This was a real story. He fucking does
this. This was like eight years ago.

2820
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:27,070
He fucking just asked.
Mogens does a turn inside.

2821
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:31,870
Kik blows the bag off the shit.
Hold on a second.

2822
02:54:31,871 --> 02:54:36,020
I've done 30 minutes talking
shit about you. I think you are.

2823
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,920
I think I was there for the
a hundred percent of it,

2824
02:54:39,220 --> 02:54:43,750
but I'm pretty sure he did a hopping
sidekick. He just attorney tech. Nope.

2825
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:48,470
It's all about the attorney was
100% whatever it is. His Texas deal.

2826
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:50,210
His techniques and people,
Bro.

2827
02:54:50,680 --> 02:54:55,330
Did he ever do team martial arts or
shitty about deep doing like high level

2828
02:54:55,780 --> 02:54:57,850
martial arts?
Like he fought Kilkee shit.

2829
02:54:57,880 --> 02:55:02,530
I know he fired like real kill Kachin
fights and not only was I embarrassed

2830
02:55:02,531 --> 02:55:03,550
because I just,
and

2831
02:55:04,150 --> 02:55:06,090
he just fucking broke precedent.

2832
02:55:08,700 --> 02:55:13,310
The first thing I thought was
like, Oh shit. Chris Riley
owned the gym. My, Oh shit.

2833
02:55:13,311 --> 02:55:14,390
We got to hide the chain.

2834
02:55:16,070 --> 02:55:19,910
We turned it into one of those grappling
bags that you fucking mountain and beat

2835
02:55:19,911 --> 02:55:20,720
the shit out of him.

2836
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:24,680
But we had to get rid of the chain and
he looks like a legit athlete. He's

2837
02:55:27,150 --> 02:55:31,580
seen in a movie that's Michael Eddy is
talking about kicking bags and shit.

2838
02:55:31,750 --> 02:55:33,560
My Hook DIY blocks up to this bag.

2839
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:39,110
Literally chain breaks and it goes flying.

2840
02:55:39,111 --> 02:55:42,530
Did you ever see Miss Bondo and
someone said to me afterwards, yeah,

2841
02:55:42,531 --> 02:55:44,960
we're having a problem with that chain.
Like shut the fuck up.

2842
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:47,000
It's like you wouldn't have
any problem with that chain.

2843
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:52,240
Can you imagine if I would've just
said, well anyways, chose kick.

2844
02:55:52,770 --> 02:55:56,330
Amazing.
I shut the fuck up about you.

2845
02:55:56,331 --> 02:55:57,930
I never brought you up ever again.

2846
02:56:00,090 --> 02:56:05,060
You went ham on that bag though. Huh?
You some fucking, that's a real story.

2847
02:56:13,160 --> 02:56:17,000
People would get up and walk out of
the Goddamn movie if you put that in a

2848
02:56:17,001 --> 02:56:20,170
goddamn move. Yeah, I saw
him flying spot. Brian Cowen,

2849
02:56:20,180 --> 02:56:22,160
we're talking about one
thing at a time for, no,

2850
02:56:22,161 --> 02:56:25,640
I'm just saying like basketball
and nobody is watching this.

2851
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:30,380
Most people have a high teen
went. You know what? Let me,

2852
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:32,540
let me try and hit the Mitts.
He'd beat up everybody.

2853
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:36,530
There's certain athletes and this is
what I'm thinking about Cain and want to

2854
02:56:36,531 --> 02:56:37,730
thinking about Francis tonight.

2855
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:42,910
There's certain athletes that if they
can get the mental game into a place,

2856
02:56:43,041 --> 02:56:46,910
a lot of Warlick Cain was when he was
at its peak. Yeah. It's all it's about.

2857
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:50,570
It's all about like
how easy is it for you?

2858
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:52,120
How much do you have to work for it?

2859
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:55,610
How much of the reason why you're
successful is because you've built up this

2860
02:56:55,611 --> 02:57:00,611
insane work ethic so you have phenomenal
cardio and an ability to push and can

2861
02:57:01,131 --> 02:57:05,660
you get a guy who has that
but spectacular genetics,

2862
02:57:05,661 --> 02:57:08,430
like how do you get to Michael Jordan?
How do you get a Brock Lesnar heart?

2863
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:08,990
How'd you get,

2864
02:57:08,990 --> 02:57:13,990
how'd he get out freak and can you get
that freak to train the way like the best

2865
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:19,940
train Coby Bryant,
can you get that freak,

2866
02:57:19,941 --> 02:57:24,200
a genetic freak who has advanced and not
have to say there's a big difference.

2867
02:57:24,201 --> 02:57:27,380
Like you might be a great athlete, you
might be a great athlete, but can you,

2868
02:57:27,381 --> 02:57:30,440
when you get hit in the face,
when you get knocked out,

2869
02:57:30,980 --> 02:57:35,150
what are you like when you, what are
you like the next day at practice?

2870
02:57:35,480 --> 02:57:36,800
How much does that get in your head?

2871
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:42,100
I think certain sliders 100% and people
that doesn't deter them and some people

2872
02:57:42,381 --> 02:57:45,110
it would know. Talking
to her sparkly, I said,

2873
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:48,440
did you ever want to do play football?
He goes, hey, he goes, he's so big.

2874
02:57:48,441 --> 02:57:51,230
And he goes, ha, those guy I
played for one day and I was like,

2875
02:57:51,231 --> 02:57:53,350
these guys are crazy. They Bang
into each other. You're just,

2876
02:57:53,380 --> 02:57:57,650
I want to cure 100 pounds.
So it happened with Saab costus.

2877
02:57:58,100 --> 02:58:01,980
Yes. Where he's like, football's bad.
There's should be Ct. They went, cool,

2878
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,810
why don't you sit the
Superbowl out? Yup. His,

2879
02:58:03,811 --> 02:58:07,530
his exact words were someone told
him that he crossed a line. Yeah.

2880
02:58:08,100 --> 02:58:10,710
Well he is on their
platform and network shit.

2881
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:15,390
That's like you shitting on the UFC.
The UFC would go cool.

2882
02:58:15,391 --> 02:58:17,070
That's your belief and
you're probably right,

2883
02:58:17,071 --> 02:58:19,080
but we can't have you on our airwaves.
Well,

2884
02:58:19,081 --> 02:58:22,770
there's gotta be a way to say that on
your show and you're like talking shit on

2885
02:58:22,771 --> 02:58:24,820
them. Well, listen, let me
tell you something. These dean,

2886
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:27,960
Dana White is one of the first
guys to tell people to stop.

2887
02:58:28,410 --> 02:58:31,020
He's one of the first guys to tell
people to stop. He told chuck to stop.

2888
02:58:31,050 --> 02:58:35,130
He was paying chocolate's not
fight. Don't fight. It goes,

2889
02:58:35,131 --> 02:58:39,270
I'll pay you to not fight. I do not
want you to fight. Yeah, I killed.

2890
02:58:39,271 --> 02:58:43,380
Tell guys that he can make millions
of dollars off. No, don't fight. Wow.

2891
02:58:43,710 --> 02:58:47,310
They make plenty of money. I mean, there's
people that want to fight and there's,

2892
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:50,910
this is where the real philosophical
debate comes in. Like if you think, Gosh,

2893
02:58:50,930 --> 02:58:52,680
you're retired,
but he doesn't think he should retire,

2894
02:58:52,681 --> 02:58:55,520
but he's going to die some
day and so are you who said,

2895
02:58:55,530 --> 02:58:59,520
tell you to say fighters you can and
can't do if you have to say fighters.

2896
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:03,090
You're right, you're right.
And he's right. Everybody's
right. That's the problem.

2897
02:59:03,300 --> 02:59:06,150
It's like one of those really
complicated debates where it's like,

2898
02:59:06,151 --> 02:59:09,390
what does that mean to
do that? To Brendan? Yes,

2899
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:12,030
but I love him and I knew
he was on his way out.

2900
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:13,860
I knew he was on his way out and I,

2901
02:59:13,861 --> 02:59:18,861
I would hope that if I was fighting and
someone was close to me and knew when I,

2902
02:59:18,990 --> 02:59:22,830
when I was like really good when
I was doing taekwondo tournament,

2903
02:59:22,831 --> 02:59:26,460
who got to a point when I was somewhere
around like 20 or 21 when I realized it

2904
02:59:26,461 --> 02:59:29,850
was no future in that and I started
dropping off and one of the things was

2905
02:59:29,851 --> 02:59:31,890
because I started training
with other young guys,

2906
02:59:32,150 --> 02:59:35,010
they'll like a lot of guys who are doing
kickboxing and boxing and I realized,

2907
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:37,170
oh,
they're doing it the way I used to do it,

2908
02:59:37,530 --> 02:59:38,880
but I'm not doing it that way anymore.

2909
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:44,730
It's that they're obsessed really in
the gym all day. They're living it.

2910
02:59:44,731 --> 02:59:49,140
And I realized, I was like, you know, I
had met some, some young guys, one kid,

2911
02:59:49,141 --> 02:59:52,290
this Guy Dana Rosenblatt and want to
be in New England middle weight boxing

2912
02:59:52,291 --> 02:59:54,540
champion had we did a
lot of training together.

2913
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:58,170
He was a really tough kitchen and
find on Tuesday night fights. Yeah,

2914
02:59:58,171 --> 02:59:59,760
he fought Vinnie.
Patsy enza twice.

2915
03:00:00,390 --> 03:00:04,480
This is rob mutherfucker knocked out Terry
Norris who was obsessed with it. Yeah.

2916
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:08,370
Not Excuse me. Yes he did knock out turn
yours. Um, he was a legit knocked out.

2917
03:00:08,371 --> 03:00:11,100
Howard Davis Jr too.
He was legit.

2918
03:00:11,130 --> 03:00:13,950
He was the the boxing coach
from American top team.

2919
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:16,920
And you sparred with them a
little bit, right? Yes, a lot.

2920
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,760
He beat the shit out of me too.
Did he clipped them though once?

2921
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:24,060
I definitely did that but I hit him.
But the thing is like,

2922
03:00:24,090 --> 03:00:28,350
he let me know from sparring
with him that he was,

2923
03:00:28,440 --> 03:00:32,580
he was way more focused on fighting
than I was and I used to think I was as

2924
03:00:32,581 --> 03:00:36,000
focused as I used to be and then I
realize, oh, I'm not anymore here.

2925
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:37,950
I'm a 20 year old guy
with a bunch of jobs,

2926
03:00:37,951 --> 03:00:40,710
so a 21 year old guy with a bunch
of jobs and here's this kid who was,

2927
03:00:40,711 --> 03:00:45,540
I think at the time he was 18 he was
kickboxing and boxing and he and I talked

2928
03:00:45,541 --> 03:00:48,420
about it. I was like, dude, you just
box. He's like, you think I go, yeah,

2929
03:00:48,421 --> 03:00:50,700
you're boxing is fucking
awesome because when we at spar,

2930
03:00:50,701 --> 03:00:54,120
that's where he would fuck me up. He would
fuck me up with boxing. I'm like, dude,

2931
03:00:54,121 --> 03:00:57,480
there's no money in kickboxing.
There was no money back then. Zero,

2932
03:00:58,070 --> 03:01:00,340
but there's some glory pays.

2933
03:01:00,340 --> 03:01:04,810
Bella tour pays. You can make money. Lion
fight pays this. There's plenty guys.

2934
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:07,790
It's hard bop computer,
the sports,

2935
03:01:07,950 --> 03:01:11,030
but the PKA PKA,

2936
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:12,960
but what I'm saying is that's gen

2937
03:01:15,130 --> 03:01:18,000
zero money. You're saying that
kid was super passionate about it.

2938
03:01:18,110 --> 03:01:20,500
That's 100% and I was like,
I've got to get out of this.

2939
03:01:20,650 --> 03:01:22,350
I'm going to get brain damage.
I'm like,

2940
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:25,630
these young guys are going to fuck me
and spar with them. With kicks. Yeah,

2941
03:01:25,631 --> 03:01:29,410
we split. We did Botox, we
kick boxed and we boxed, boxed.

2942
03:01:29,470 --> 03:01:33,670
You ever land side kicks on his ass?
Um, we sparred, man. I don't remember.

2943
03:01:33,671 --> 03:01:37,120
It was like we were 21 years old.
I'm sure I hit him,

2944
03:01:37,130 --> 03:01:40,840
but my take from it wasn't,
you know,

2945
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:44,710
my take from it 100% was oh this guy's
way more focused than I am. Yeah.

2946
03:01:44,980 --> 03:01:49,060
I had my foot out the door and so when I
saw that you had your foot out the door,

2947
03:01:49,061 --> 03:01:52,100
I was like, shit, he's got his foot
out the door. Thank God you did. Oh,

2948
03:01:52,130 --> 03:01:54,730
cause I saw it and was like,
life is so good, right? Yeah.

2949
03:01:54,731 --> 03:01:59,080
But I saw it and I was like,
dude, come on. Have a real chance.

2950
03:01:59,950 --> 03:02:04,060
A real chance. You have struck
while the iron was hot. Boom.

2951
03:02:05,930 --> 03:02:10,750
You had a giant golden opening.
I was like, Dude, you're
funny guy. Like you're a,

2952
03:02:10,840 --> 03:02:13,720
you're a fun guy to listen to.
I like hanging around with you.

2953
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:16,690
Other people don't like you too. They're
going to like you on podcasts and do it.

2954
03:02:16,691 --> 03:02:18,700
Stand up.
You don't have to get punched in the face.

2955
03:02:18,701 --> 03:02:20,200
And he misses fighting every day.
Look at him,

2956
03:02:21,960 --> 03:02:26,500
but you can't give that
advice to everybody and a
lot of people got mad at me

2957
03:02:26,501 --> 03:02:31,420
for giving that advice. I'm
like, I wouldn't not anybody.
Family members, we love.

2958
03:02:31,421 --> 03:02:34,560
Joe saw it and I was like,
oh, this is like fuck.

2959
03:02:34,590 --> 03:02:38,060
I'd like a part of your past. You know
what I mean? Like you got some other shit.

2960
03:02:38,061 --> 03:02:39,670
I can't believe I did that dude.
I was like,

2961
03:02:39,671 --> 03:02:42,220
this is the hill I'm willing to die on.
I know you don't want to be doing this.

2962
03:02:42,230 --> 03:02:44,770
No one wants to tell you don't want to
be doing this. No thank you. I love it.

2963
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:46,870
Thank you brother.
Thank you for listening.

2964
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:49,990
Thank you for listening because
instead of like losing a friend,

2965
03:02:50,080 --> 03:02:52,570
you know what the noise, I have
a friend grow. It is weird.

2966
03:02:52,571 --> 03:02:55,570
I did that for a site like the competitor
came out. I was like, Fuck Joe, man.

2967
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:59,960
Two Oh five and I was dieting training
and I was like, what the fuck am I doing?

2968
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:05,200
I Sunday night shut my
first comedy special.

2969
03:03:05,380 --> 03:03:10,150
I knew it was you open. We've got
a good life is great. Perfect.

2970
03:03:10,370 --> 03:03:13,350
Lenny's pictures of us,
all three of us. No,

2971
03:03:13,390 --> 03:03:17,890
I've never told anybody to do that before,
but I didn't cry,

2972
03:03:17,891 --> 03:03:21,040
so let's move up for man.
It's like we love you, man.

2973
03:03:21,041 --> 03:03:23,740
You almost started crying when you were
going out there because I'm about to cry.

2974
03:03:24,570 --> 03:03:26,570
I fuck this.

2975
03:03:29,070 --> 03:03:32,230
I don't know if you miss
fighting or whatever. Just
know. Just like, Oh God. Okay.

2976
03:03:32,740 --> 03:03:33,730
What's crazy is I did,

2977
03:03:33,731 --> 03:03:38,731
I did stand up comedy people hang out
with Joe back then once Roy Nelson Cro,

2978
03:03:40,180 --> 03:03:45,040
Cro, cop fight that. How crazy is
this? Amazing. Amazing. I knew it.

2979
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:50,050
I knew you could do it because you have
a pro athletes work ethic applied to

2980
03:03:50,051 --> 03:03:51,660
something that you really enjoy.

2981
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:55,410
You might be doing comedy
comedian 100% I'm like,

2982
03:03:56,300 --> 03:03:57,133
no,

2983
03:03:58,150 --> 03:04:00,110
you know what? If you,
I'm going to be honest,

2984
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:05,190
I'd go Brett and got a lot of size on
I love,

2985
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:10,240
I wouldn't be the Joe Rogan Latin fucking
turning sidekick. Look at me right

2986
03:04:12,320 --> 03:04:15,310
then and decided to fight Joe.
It hit me.

2987
03:04:15,650 --> 03:04:19,340
He kills both of us if it
ended up on the ground.

2988
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:22,980
No ways Brennan going to be able
to finish. Joe. No one. Really.

2989
03:04:23,690 --> 03:04:26,900
You don't think so impossible.
Let me, can I just say one thing?

2990
03:04:26,901 --> 03:04:30,980
Joe got to be what you got to worry
about. Joe, Eddie, Eddie, Joe.

2991
03:04:30,981 --> 03:04:35,330
Is anyone else? Samara talks
about himself and the Joel. Fuck.

2992
03:04:35,380 --> 03:04:37,940
Excuse me sir.
Can I just have to say one thing?

2993
03:04:37,970 --> 03:04:41,930
I know I have seen brand new
shop with the, some of the best.

2994
03:04:41,970 --> 03:04:44,000
He's just two guys in the world

2995
03:04:45,590 --> 03:04:49,100
and I've watched him tap them every
12 seconds and I'll tell you the names

2996
03:04:49,101 --> 03:04:52,160
afterwards, some money, and
you're going to go like, listen,

2997
03:04:52,161 --> 03:04:56,870
I saw Brendan a hundred percent stall
out with Cyborg and getting his guard and

2998
03:04:56,871 --> 03:05:01,160
go to the ground with him
purposefully called the
[inaudible]. This is no way. No,

2999
03:05:01,161 --> 03:05:05,000
listen, I'm not dogging
your to stop it. If not,

3000
03:05:05,150 --> 03:05:10,060
he would crush me like a bus
stop. Got Moist towns, big team.

3001
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:14,030
I, I gave him his black. Here's what,
here's where I'm at at. He know what?

3002
03:05:14,031 --> 03:05:18,740
He's joking. Tap me out right now. If
we're debtors, I wouldn't give a fuck.

3003
03:05:18,741 --> 03:05:21,300
Good for you and working on new material.
I don't give a

3004
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:26,720
fantasy world to that.
Let me be honest.

3005
03:05:26,721 --> 03:05:30,000
I've never tapped anybody who was any
good anywhere near as big as he was

3006
03:05:30,001 --> 03:05:32,840
spreading shop. Take the best in
the world. It wouldn't happen.

3007
03:05:32,990 --> 03:05:37,280
This physical advantages that people
have that are so, they're so stunning.

3008
03:05:37,490 --> 03:05:42,440
They're so stunning that it's
creepy. Brendon has the reach I, I'll

3009
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:45,830
give you a name when I tell you the name.

3010
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:52,960
He's a giant. Yes. People that
they get ahold of you. It's,

3011
03:05:53,010 --> 03:05:57,110
it's confusing. I watched
Roy. I'm going to be honest,

3012
03:05:57,290 --> 03:05:58,490
he ain't got no cardio.

3013
03:06:02,350 --> 03:06:05,960
Any shops in the 600 pounds for rags.
You can't talk over each other.

3014
03:06:07,010 --> 03:06:09,590
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm trying to give you props.

3015
03:06:09,770 --> 03:06:12,920
I'm saying I'm going back to Brennan Cause
I know Brendan's and fucking Colorado.

3016
03:06:12,921 --> 03:06:15,710
He's in the fucking mountains.
I will listen to me.

3017
03:06:18,150 --> 03:06:21,240
Listen to me. He tried new material
about being a backstreet boy,

3018
03:06:21,260 --> 03:06:22,430
puts it really well.

3019
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:27,010
He puts those yoga mats on his hips and
does like 500 pound fuck thrusts. Yeah,

3020
03:06:27,011 --> 03:06:29,860
I'll just settle down bro.
He's a different kind of person.

3021
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:31,820
It's a different kind of humor.
That's what I'm saying.

3022
03:06:31,850 --> 03:06:35,450
I know the difference between,
you always got no chance, man.

3023
03:06:35,451 --> 03:06:39,620
You know how many times I saw him get
through around and I want her to give him

3024
03:06:39,621 --> 03:06:43,430
advice on what he did wrong. He was like,
shut up. And I'm like, I can't breathe.

3025
03:06:44,750 --> 03:06:45,920
Breathe right down to it.

3026
03:06:49,550 --> 03:06:52,070
That's an interesting thing.
I've never done more cardio in my life.

3027
03:06:52,460 --> 03:06:56,010
I do cardio like super record cause
those fills you run or no joke. Your boys

3028
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:59,040
had aerosol. Helped me out. Them get
there. My car. Did you finally get one?

3029
03:07:00,410 --> 03:07:02,280
Microsoft? I love, no, my cardio was,

3030
03:07:02,460 --> 03:07:06,500
my cardio was always the worst part
of my Jujitsu game. When you got,

3031
03:07:07,110 --> 03:07:12,110
when you got somebody in a fuck in the
truck and you put a crotch rep or on Joe

3032
03:07:12,121 --> 03:07:16,630
would just read through people's legs.
It's a crotch ripper. It's uh, it's a,

3033
03:07:16,740 --> 03:07:20,910
it's like a banana split
and and rescue team. Yeah.

3034
03:07:20,970 --> 03:07:25,070
But it's a little different than legs are
spread differently. Uh, Joe, her bucket,

3035
03:07:25,071 --> 03:07:28,380
the master of that motherfucker crushed.
He scratched me.

3036
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:32,970
But it's awful submission because it gets,
it goes against your hips.

3037
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:36,240
Are there any other comedians who like
wrestled or anything like that? I'm on.

3038
03:07:36,340 --> 03:07:39,000
It's just a really good wrestler.
He's really good. He teaches.

3039
03:07:39,990 --> 03:07:43,070
We wrestled the same houses there at the
company more and Jay. Mark can wrestle.

3040
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:47,490
No, no, no. Jay Moore can
wrestle around with Jay a little,

3041
03:07:47,491 --> 03:07:50,580
but people tell me that Jay Moore
actually has coach wrestling. Well,

3042
03:07:50,610 --> 03:07:55,440
Jay Morris not. I know he's not. He's
all right. But he's never coast it. Look,

3043
03:07:55,441 --> 03:07:58,330
coach Jay wasn't a real wrestling.
Jade.

3044
03:07:58,640 --> 03:08:03,490
Jade heard cook can. I'm just being, oh my
God. Look at this. Crash on TV. Holy Shit.

3045
03:08:03,491 --> 03:08:08,490
Oh my God. Look at all
these cars. I, oh my God.

3046
03:08:08,590 --> 03:08:11,880
I thought walls at the moon.
It's round Eddie. That's fake.

3047
03:08:11,940 --> 03:08:15,480
This whole thing is fake.
The crash. Fake look.

3048
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:19,570
They know the laws don't
work. Oh man, this shit. Oh,

3049
03:08:19,590 --> 03:08:22,560
look at this pile up to look at this.
This is insane.

3050
03:08:22,770 --> 03:08:26,550
These guys calling you think, uh,
202 miles an hour. So true. Yeah.

3051
03:08:28,620 --> 03:08:32,400
She was great on the podcast. I like
this. A really, really, really nice guy.

3052
03:08:32,401 --> 03:08:37,170
And talk about a guy who's
had some problems with
concussions. 1000 concussion.

3053
03:08:37,710 --> 03:08:42,630
Dale Earnhardt, man, he had to go to
rehab for this fucking crash. Man.

3054
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:48,120
You're all different crashes
flat in the same day. Oh my God.

3055
03:08:48,220 --> 03:08:51,240
In the same day.
That's what the fuck is

3056
03:08:54,770 --> 03:08:59,260
a really,
they sharpen up 100% watch.

3057
03:08:59,370 --> 03:09:00,203
Do you watch it?

3058
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:06,710
Take the family to the raceway at good
night. Three, four crashes. Let's take it.

3059
03:09:07,290 --> 03:09:11,970
Let's take a guess. Let's Google it.
Eddie, what's your guesses? What's that?

3060
03:09:12,390 --> 03:09:15,600
Do you think there's a crash? No, no, no.

3061
03:09:16,170 --> 03:09:20,780
I believe Jamie cause he's from Ohio.
Daniel Watch. I'm going to go with James.

3062
03:09:21,030 --> 03:09:26,030
I think Jamie's correct watches now I
will say most and in some kind of a crash,

3063
03:09:26,791 --> 03:09:31,350
Colorado, all that shit. It's all the
same guys. All the same dude who won it.

3064
03:09:31,410 --> 03:09:34,110
Cause I could give two fucks.
Racing is a weird thing.

3065
03:09:34,111 --> 03:09:37,890
Imagine taking your family to spending
200 bucks on the race and there's no

3066
03:09:37,891 --> 03:09:41,710
crash and average of 220 crashes per year.
It's through how sheets.

3067
03:09:42,570 --> 03:09:47,430
Maybe show the race every day.
If they raced every weekend,

3068
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:52,050
that's a shit load of crap.
I'm going to close.

3069
03:09:52,051 --> 03:09:55,280
Don't worry us every weekend. So,
but to the, to the main guys, coffee,

3070
03:09:55,300 --> 03:09:56,980
counting all the amateur races,

3071
03:09:57,100 --> 03:10:00,150
Jesus talking about the
assholes in the back burner.

3072
03:10:00,610 --> 03:10:04,300
That scars the top demolition.
Then boys make bank though. Huh?

3073
03:10:04,340 --> 03:10:06,430
Just left turns all day.
A lot of money.

3074
03:10:08,350 --> 03:10:12,340
Is there racing that goes the other way?
Do they ever say a good question?

3075
03:10:12,370 --> 03:10:17,230
Is there, is that piece so
hard? Probably in, in uh, some,

3076
03:10:17,260 --> 03:10:21,750
well, the real racing is Formula
One, correct? My boy. Yeah.

3077
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:26,170
Well that's a different thing. You know,
I was watching the, there's a, on youtube,

3078
03:10:26,171 --> 03:10:31,120
there's a video of an overlap
between a gt three car,

3079
03:10:31,390 --> 03:10:35,650
which is like a Porsche like Brendan
has and a Formula One car. It's like,

3080
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:40,060
Geez, strikes, there's so much faster. You
watch the GT three car, you're like, oh,

3081
03:10:40,061 --> 03:10:44,170
that guy's flying. And then you see
the Formula One car. I see that.

3082
03:10:45,030 --> 03:10:46,660
Do you have a video? Yeah,
there's a video of it.

3083
03:10:46,661 --> 03:10:51,550
See if you got online comparison between
Formula One and gt three t three it's

3084
03:10:51,650 --> 03:10:56,650
like a Porsche. Do you know how big
Talladega nights the sequel would be?

3085
03:10:57,310 --> 03:11:01,840
Oh, motherfuck. Right. Especially if
they can get bore out to jump on board.

3086
03:11:02,060 --> 03:11:06,780
Are you kidding me, Bobby? He was
amazing. Who's better than John C.

3087
03:11:06,780 --> 03:11:09,450
Reilly and and remains a feral
when they're together. She,

3088
03:11:09,610 --> 03:11:13,150
I know it's fucking magic. Yeah,
it might be it. Look at that.

3089
03:11:13,180 --> 03:11:13,701
Look at the difference.

3090
03:11:13,701 --> 03:11:16,300
So get this si the one in the left and
one of the right leads and one on the

3091
03:11:16,301 --> 03:11:19,570
right. The one of the rights
flowing. Your one left, his GD three.

3092
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:23,890
It's fucking crazy. The difference
here, that car and then watch it. Look,

3093
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:28,920
it was faster. Oh Shit. Oh my God.

3094
03:11:28,930 --> 03:11:33,920
Is real racing. That's why Europeans
think Americans are goofy. Fuck.

3095
03:11:34,530 --> 03:11:38,290
Nd you're marsh. That's
Formula One. Formula One.

3096
03:11:39,020 --> 03:11:43,150
Basically you're like sitting on a
missile. Well, they're also honest.

3097
03:11:43,151 --> 03:11:45,040
If you see it's a changing course,

3098
03:11:45,070 --> 03:11:48,670
like the course to Formula One course
has a lot of turns, right? I mean, what,

3099
03:11:48,671 --> 03:11:51,470
give me see if you could get a a,
a map of,

3100
03:11:52,420 --> 03:11:57,420
it's like an like a crazy track
when a NASCAR's just a circle.

3101
03:11:58,240 --> 03:12:02,450
Exactly. Exactly. Nascar's look or
an oval. Right? When people say, I,

3102
03:12:02,460 --> 03:12:06,420
I do have street courses. I don't
usually do it though. What is a,

3103
03:12:06,430 --> 03:12:10,300
what's an average formula? Like
pull up a famous, what's a,

3104
03:12:10,301 --> 03:12:14,620
what's a famous formula? One
race. They have a bunch, right?

3105
03:12:15,010 --> 03:12:16,700
Sure. Uh, I know there's a

3106
03:12:18,850 --> 03:12:23,470
famous formula one race, Mario
Andretti. Famous Formula One race.

3107
03:12:23,530 --> 03:12:27,850
Race her, right? No race. A
race isn't the one in Monaco.

3108
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:29,800
Isn't that one?
Do you know what that one's called?

3109
03:12:29,900 --> 03:12:34,900
Grand Prix de Monaco
turns in it. Yeah. Okay.

3110
03:12:35,020 --> 03:12:37,870
Let me see what that looks like. Let's
see what that looks like, Jamie. Hey,

3111
03:12:37,880 --> 03:12:42,850
this grateful man. That shit.
Look at all those turns.

3112
03:12:42,851 --> 03:12:45,850
God Damn. Those are crazy. Look
at the upper right hand corner.

3113
03:12:45,851 --> 03:12:49,090
Like a fish's mouth.
Look at that crazy turn like an eel face.

3114
03:12:50,030 --> 03:12:54,740
Like the Nascar thing is why
don't they want all that shit?

3115
03:12:54,980 --> 03:12:58,610
Cause they want to be able to see
the whole race from whether city.

3116
03:12:58,660 --> 03:13:01,310
I think it's because
here you can't see shit.

3117
03:13:01,400 --> 03:13:06,140
You're sitting formula for the
cars to pass by. Like this sucks.

3118
03:13:06,350 --> 03:13:07,760
That's why there's nobody there.

3119
03:13:08,890 --> 03:13:11,710
There's like four people standing there.

3120
03:13:12,610 --> 03:13:15,020
You wonder what the car just race.
I get it.

3121
03:13:15,240 --> 03:13:18,690
Those fucking country
guys think you're right.

3122
03:13:21,320 --> 03:13:24,280
You're right to get to see. It's like, aw,

3123
03:13:27,380 --> 03:13:32,090
he's right. Are you listening to and
fucking tense and shit may have barbecues.

3124
03:13:32,530 --> 03:13:35,720
Yeah,
to get see 30 seconds of car.

3125
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:40,100
Meanwhile, the country, they're
the ones that are geniuses.

3126
03:13:40,101 --> 03:13:43,500
This wreck happened this
year and the girl fucks up.

3127
03:13:44,550 --> 03:13:49,020
I had someone die. I don't want
to say no. She broke her neck.

3128
03:13:49,430 --> 03:13:53,390
She's back though. She's pretty hot
too. She's still racing shell. Yeah,

3129
03:13:53,391 --> 03:13:56,410
she's back right now.
Broke man. That she just,

3130
03:13:56,510 --> 03:13:58,670
maybe there was just bone spurs in there.
Oh my God.

3131
03:13:59,150 --> 03:14:03,020
She's wearing flies into the wall.
Flew into the wall. She's young too.

3132
03:14:03,021 --> 03:14:07,730
She's all right though. She's only 17
she races formula one. He's not legal.

3133
03:14:07,760 --> 03:14:10,130
Fuck Dude.
How crazy is that?

3134
03:14:12,710 --> 03:14:15,860
Her parents got assigned sign for
that Shit for sure. Go to school

3135
03:14:17,430 --> 03:14:22,010
for the other one is so expensive, like
just to have more expensive. Does it?

3136
03:14:25,100 --> 03:14:28,220
Wow.
How come so much fucking European pricing?

3137
03:14:29,290 --> 03:14:34,250
Some tellers in the Rothschilds? Is
that what they do? It's like it is

3138
03:14:36,310 --> 03:14:40,010
even Nati dude.

3139
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:49,580
How couldn't it be? It would be,
what if it was, I know it is.

3140
03:14:49,610 --> 03:14:51,890
What if it was would it is?

3141
03:14:52,180 --> 03:14:57,180
It's just a quick Google search price to
run it or not a for me the one racist.

3142
03:14:59,260 --> 03:15:01,970
What the fuck are you saying Jamie?
Hold on.

3143
03:15:02,030 --> 03:15:03,410
Listen to Jamie here for a moment please.

3144
03:15:03,470 --> 03:15:08,150
I just quickly Google search to an average
team costs anywhere between 20 to 60

3145
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:09,070
million for Nascar.
Yeah,

3146
03:15:09,380 --> 03:15:12,800
for f one it's anywhere between
200 and it's around 250 million.

3147
03:15:12,801 --> 03:15:15,490
It says first expensive.
Yeah,

3148
03:15:16,840 --> 03:15:20,210
and those like red bull,
Mercedes, Ferrari, Porsche.

3149
03:15:20,630 --> 03:15:23,510
Those boys make bank to you.
Hey Buddy.

3150
03:15:23,511 --> 03:15:28,400
Daniel Lewis Hamilton.
How it Lewis Hamilton was a mixed family.

3151
03:15:28,401 --> 03:15:32,750
His Dad would fucking work like three
jobs just because it's so expensive as kid

3152
03:15:32,751 --> 03:15:36,600
to do it. He's like, I'll pay for it, but
he got a, when he got a fucking winning,

3153
03:15:36,601 --> 03:15:41,330
if I'm going to do this, knows about it,
but it's fuck, there's so much money.

3154
03:15:41,540 --> 03:15:44,340
America,
America doesn't know about it.

3155
03:15:44,840 --> 03:15:48,180
My brother does guys,
we've got to stop talking about,

3156
03:15:50,940 --> 03:15:55,220
no, go ahead. No Buddy.

3157
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:59,400
There's no like nope.
Kids aren't into formula one racing.

3158
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:05,040
You're born into like the Vanderbilt, the
fucking airman's. You know what I mean?

3159
03:16:05,140 --> 03:16:08,160
They don't,
there's the masses are not into this shit.

3160
03:16:08,190 --> 03:16:10,960
You and I are not getting a chance,
but is that a newer one?

3161
03:16:10,980 --> 03:16:13,350
That's only in America, right?
In Europe. It's very funny.

3162
03:16:13,800 --> 03:16:18,130
The kids don't give a fuck about
that shit in Europe. Fuck up.

3163
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:22,370
The two kids, they love
it. They love it. I think

3164
03:16:23,960 --> 03:16:26,660
that's incorrect. I think, oh
you're the Rockefellers are into it.

3165
03:16:27,180 --> 03:16:29,370
I think that's incorrect.
They like it in Australia as well.

3166
03:16:29,460 --> 03:16:33,720
As somebody who grew up overseas, I can
promise you they kits in the Middle East.

3167
03:16:33,790 --> 03:16:38,180
Express your rich dad and my,
my father is a Vanderbilt. Damn,

3168
03:16:41,530 --> 03:16:45,630
it's so popular area at Santa. So
Senate, let's look at centers. Funeral,

3169
03:16:45,631 --> 03:16:50,280
bring up areas, funeral in
Brazil. He died. He was the best.

3170
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:51,173
He was the best.

3171
03:16:51,420 --> 03:16:53,970
And take a look at how many people
showed up for his funeral in Brazil.

3172
03:16:54,090 --> 03:16:58,190
Take a look at this place. Oh
yeah, it's inquiry. Jackson eraser.

3173
03:16:58,450 --> 03:17:00,410
Yeah he was,
he was on TV.

3174
03:17:00,490 --> 03:17:03,540
Like he got his son who
races now I believe.

3175
03:17:03,541 --> 03:17:05,940
So he was the greatest
and he was such a monk.

3176
03:17:05,941 --> 03:17:08,520
He wouldn't even hang it in the near
West. We would, he was like a matador.

3177
03:17:08,521 --> 03:17:12,810
He only, he only thought about
racing and he's a beast dude.

3178
03:17:13,290 --> 03:17:17,520
And I think a thing went through his,
look at that. Look at that funeral.

3179
03:17:17,550 --> 03:17:21,300
Everybody came out. Hold on
buddy. Boy. Amazing documentary.

3180
03:17:21,301 --> 03:17:25,530
Cause it's called Santa. You can get
it on iTunes. Netflix maybe. I Dunno,

3181
03:17:25,531 --> 03:17:29,130
maybe it's on that. Why is
everything Netflix with you?
It might not. I'm not sure.

3182
03:17:29,160 --> 03:17:32,340
I'm not sure. But I got it off of
iTunes. It's fucking incredible, man.

3183
03:17:32,341 --> 03:17:36,810
We see the footage. It's nice guys,
man. It's, it's just like, I mean,

3184
03:17:36,811 --> 03:17:40,650
you're living your life on these split
second decisions and controlling some

3185
03:17:41,070 --> 03:17:43,870
impossibly powerful vehicle
when you're going around.

3186
03:17:43,880 --> 03:17:46,320
He's fucking turns and
everything's happening so fast.

3187
03:17:46,321 --> 03:17:51,030
And this guy just had this lightning
precision ability to make decisions.

3188
03:17:51,031 --> 03:17:55,080
He was a hero. Well, it's
like Dale Earnhardt jr when
his, when his pappy died,

3189
03:17:55,260 --> 03:17:59,130
then they fix the car. So no one's really
died. What's his dad died? They're like,

3190
03:17:59,131 --> 03:18:02,880
we need to fix this shit. And now there's
all sorts of safety stuff in it. It's,

3191
03:18:02,881 --> 03:18:03,210
um,

3192
03:18:03,210 --> 03:18:08,210
that was a fascinating conversation
about how many concussions that guys had

3193
03:18:08,251 --> 03:18:11,430
because I never would've thought of
that. How many did he have? A ton.

3194
03:18:11,490 --> 03:18:15,670
He had to forget to do rehab for a bunch
of Rehab and he had like moments where

3195
03:18:15,671 --> 03:18:20,280
we're like, for six months he was just
a mess. Andy Stone, uh, like he, he,

3196
03:18:20,281 --> 03:18:24,420
he's had so many concussions because they
would blast doors and he would be the

3197
03:18:24,421 --> 03:18:27,690
one to set the charge. Now,
all his friends are hanging
Haydn and he'd be like,

3198
03:18:27,691 --> 03:18:28,770
where the fuck am I going to go?

3199
03:18:28,810 --> 03:18:33,690
[inaudible] he's had over like 201 that
Kevin will got shot in the hip. Can't,

3200
03:18:33,691 --> 03:18:38,220
can't feel his, his foot from the
why is he staying with you right now?

3201
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:41,370
Because he had no, he had place to
stay but I go stay with me. What the,

3202
03:18:41,371 --> 03:18:44,600
what are you doing? I got, you
know, to have a fucking bad day.

3203
03:18:45,910 --> 03:18:48,370
When we were on the man
show we had a sketch

3204
03:18:48,370 --> 03:18:52,900
that got declined. It was about an
Asian Nascar driver. Oh that's right.

3205
03:18:52,901 --> 03:18:56,590
It was blowing up because he was just
always racking and tolerance drove the

3206
03:18:56,591 --> 03:19:00,990
ratings up so they, everybody wanted
out cause he would just sketch.

3207
03:19:01,240 --> 03:19:05,290
It would have to have an Asian guy.
Right? Like if Bobby Lee wrote that,

3208
03:19:05,291 --> 03:19:10,060
it would be cool. But the most
epic rallies, people loved him.

3209
03:19:11,090 --> 03:19:15,370
What do we got here? We're
watching golf. How dare us.

3210
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:20,130
She never played the shit.
Played it. I played a lot,

3211
03:19:20,890 --> 03:19:25,780
a lot. Big happy plays right
once a year and a cheer camp,

3212
03:19:25,790 --> 03:19:28,890
but they can't wire tap you out. And
the fact that golf course, you know,

3213
03:19:28,930 --> 03:19:32,630
that's why that's what all those
rich people, they're out there going.

3214
03:19:33,370 --> 03:19:36,130
I'm glad you guys agreed that you
have the same view on politics.

3215
03:19:36,131 --> 03:19:39,850
How we control shit. Yeah,
that's just an excuse.

3216
03:19:40,060 --> 03:19:45,060
Is there a one game that symbolizes more
like really super rich dudes out there

3217
03:19:45,110 --> 03:19:47,740
making deals playing a game like golf?

3218
03:19:48,910 --> 03:19:53,230
They literally tell you if you want to
succeed in business that people tell you

3219
03:19:53,290 --> 03:19:55,420
what it should learn how to play golf.
Tell us how it happens.

3220
03:19:56,920 --> 03:19:58,450
He doesn't go out there
playing golf up business.

3221
03:19:58,460 --> 03:20:01,210
Just the magic theoretically like,
oh Jay,

3222
03:20:01,500 --> 03:20:05,400
if I'll tell you I'll make all the stores.
How does it go down?

3223
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:09,460
A good story for you. Tell me about
it. So my mother and my father,

3224
03:20:09,970 --> 03:20:13,990
this guy comes out to play golf with my
father who was a big investment guy and

3225
03:20:13,991 --> 03:20:16,330
he wanted my father who
invest in his company

3226
03:20:17,880 --> 03:20:19,830
in this investment from whatever thing is,

3227
03:20:21,190 --> 03:20:26,140
this is 19 2090 1990 Yup. Yup,

3228
03:20:26,170 --> 03:20:30,820
Yup. 1990 and my he, they got to
play golf in Greenwich, Connecticut.

3229
03:20:32,110 --> 03:20:34,690
My mother watches him.
Everybody cheats at golf,

3230
03:20:35,260 --> 03:20:40,260
but my mother sees him kick the ball just
a little bit into a better lie because

3231
03:20:40,601 --> 03:20:44,260
it he, he was in a taller grass, kicked
the ball on to like shorter grass.

3232
03:20:44,261 --> 03:20:48,230
We'd get a better swing. Here's the
difference. When I do that, I go,

3233
03:20:48,231 --> 03:20:50,530
I'm kicking the ball and he did it,

3234
03:20:51,010 --> 03:20:53,770
but he looked around and make sure
nobody was watching. My mother,

3235
03:20:54,130 --> 03:20:57,010
Sicilian girl from New
York City just went,

3236
03:20:59,410 --> 03:21:03,400
snake, she's a fucking snitch, bro.

3237
03:21:05,840 --> 03:21:09,400
Mother goes, wow. That guy just cheated
secretly and it's a bullshit games.

3238
03:21:10,090 --> 03:21:13,850
She goes, bad guy. She says, my father got
the hatch. She goes, she goes, watch it.

3239
03:21:13,851 --> 03:21:16,790
She goes, what did they say in this thing?
That guy's a crook and my father goes,

3240
03:21:16,880 --> 03:21:20,440
bullshit. She goes, if you do, I'm
going to divorce. My father goes, Jesus,

3241
03:21:20,441 --> 03:21:22,750
you're really serious. She was
all divorce. You. Well, Hey,

3242
03:21:22,751 --> 03:21:26,330
what if you were playing chicken
guy, went to jail, guy went to jail.

3243
03:21:26,370 --> 03:21:28,720
I 15 years like I was.
Donald Trump was a huge deal.

3244
03:21:28,721 --> 03:21:30,280
I'll tell you his name afterwards,
but it's a huge,

3245
03:21:30,550 --> 03:21:34,480
he was a huge fucking scam artists.
He was one of those guys in the news.

3246
03:21:34,481 --> 03:21:36,740
Everything else, that whole thing.
Everybody who invests, who went broke,

3247
03:21:36,741 --> 03:21:40,870
he don't do shit. Her
Mama talents a snitch.

3248
03:21:42,220 --> 03:21:45,310
You know that guy? You
know that guy. Gosh.

3249
03:21:46,540 --> 03:21:51,520
Okay. So, okay, so what, use the little
things in life you can pick up here.

3250
03:21:51,740 --> 03:21:53,200
Perfect example,
Eddie.

3251
03:21:53,230 --> 03:21:57,800
Remember there was one time where Eddie
met this guy and the guy just started

3252
03:21:57,801 --> 03:21:58,634
doing Jujitsu,

3253
03:21:58,790 --> 03:22:01,430
like he was a white belt and he called
Eddie up and he told that he, yeah,

3254
03:22:01,431 --> 03:22:04,730
I got a bunch of guys, I'm like triangle
today. Armbar guy. And he was like,

3255
03:22:04,731 --> 03:22:08,360
what the fuck are you talking about?
And like, you knew like right away,

3256
03:22:08,570 --> 03:22:10,010
like this is this guy's full of shit.

3257
03:22:10,110 --> 03:22:14,660
Like triangle a bunch of people and
arm bar people. It's your first day.

3258
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:18,130
You don't even know how to do
those things. I didn't hear,

3259
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:21,830
but he knew right away like Eddie and
talking to him, he was like, what?

3260
03:22:22,130 --> 03:22:27,040
Because the only reason he started
doing Jujitsu is because we were,

3261
03:22:27,800 --> 03:22:30,580
he wanted us to cope,

3262
03:22:30,760 --> 03:22:34,420
promote some kind of martial arts event.
And I didn't know,

3263
03:22:35,220 --> 03:22:37,910
I didn't know if he was a legit
promoter nod. He seemed really cool.

3264
03:22:37,911 --> 03:22:40,670
He knew some cool, he knew some
people that I knew and he was, he had,

3265
03:22:40,730 --> 03:22:44,620
he wanted to do this show and he was going
to involve me in it and it, you know,

3266
03:22:44,870 --> 03:22:47,000
then he came down to my school and,
uh,

3267
03:22:47,390 --> 03:22:51,020
and after one class he's telling me the
next day, oh, I fucking loved it man.

3268
03:22:51,021 --> 03:22:54,040
I triangle the couple of guys fucking
arm bar. I'm like, wait a minute,

3269
03:22:54,220 --> 03:22:59,180
first day ever. He goes, yeah. So crazy
just comes natural to me. And I thought,

3270
03:22:59,181 --> 03:23:02,630
shit, maybe I shouldn't go into
business with this. Exactly.

3271
03:23:02,690 --> 03:23:05,070
So right there I was like,
I got to back out now.

3272
03:23:05,090 --> 03:23:08,600
This is my fucking line about Gigi.
He'll lie about everything else. And so,

3273
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:13,550
um, that came a time where I
had to sit him down, you know,

3274
03:23:13,551 --> 03:23:16,300
but it was ugly and kick
him out of the Joe and I,

3275
03:23:16,310 --> 03:23:19,340
Joe and I are there ever since we were
like we'd known each other through a 28

3276
03:23:19,610 --> 03:23:24,050
and we just be talking and then like I'd
say something I like, yeah. I was like,

3277
03:23:24,070 --> 03:23:27,620
I don't know. I, I do. Yeah. I,
uh, thought whatever it might be.

3278
03:23:27,621 --> 03:23:32,050
Like I tapped him out. Now I'm like,
not really, you know, whatever we'd say,

3279
03:23:32,920 --> 03:23:35,480
are you telling a little white lie?
Cause you're just, you're just,

3280
03:23:35,540 --> 03:23:40,210
it's convenient and you have to walk
in. You're like, math didn't happen.

3281
03:23:40,250 --> 03:23:42,430
But it's a weird thing when
people make shit up though. Yeah.

3282
03:23:42,440 --> 03:23:43,640
He was a Kung Fu champion.

3283
03:23:43,880 --> 03:23:47,100
Travel Okinawan fun everyone
bare knuckle where it was a fun,

3284
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:50,480
that was a lot of those guys.
When I first opened up 10th planet,

3285
03:23:50,481 --> 03:23:52,400
this was 2004,

3286
03:23:53,030 --> 03:23:55,880
there was a girl that trained there and
she just started turning their shoes or

3287
03:23:55,881 --> 03:23:58,940
like a crossfit type chick.
She was like buff and she just started,

3288
03:23:58,941 --> 03:24:03,941
she's like six months into it and she
starts telling me that she tapped uh,

3289
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:07,880
one of my purple belts and she's
105 pounds. I'm like, damn,

3290
03:24:07,881 --> 03:24:12,881
I know what you tell we tab Cade say that.

3291
03:24:14,280 --> 03:24:15,051
And I said,
okay,

3292
03:24:15,051 --> 03:24:19,020
cause I don't want people to have like
a false sense of security in Jujitsu.

3293
03:24:19,070 --> 03:24:22,970
You got to know it was, you
can't, if someone, if you,

3294
03:24:23,060 --> 03:24:26,210
sometimes when you go with the kid,
you let them take an arm bar.

3295
03:24:26,250 --> 03:24:30,410
You know what I mean? You let them when
their kids, but when they're adults,

3296
03:24:30,530 --> 03:24:34,040
if you do that to them, they're going to
actually think they really tapped you.

3297
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:37,520
They're not going to know. Some of them.
Southern mom will say, oh he let me,

3298
03:24:37,521 --> 03:24:41,810
he's being, he's gone. Like he let me,
he's going like some will go, fuck,

3299
03:24:41,811 --> 03:24:44,370
I'm tapping these motherfuckers
out and I'm a bad motherfucker.

3300
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:47,160
Yeah.
And this girl totally thought that.

3301
03:24:47,520 --> 03:24:51,360
Well I remember when I first learned to
man, I was a little confused. I was like,

3302
03:24:51,361 --> 03:24:53,460
what's happening here?
My actually tapping this person.

3303
03:24:53,461 --> 03:24:54,390
This doesn't make any sense.

3304
03:24:56,940 --> 03:24:59,130
I figured it out pretty
quick and the girl called me,

3305
03:24:59,400 --> 03:25:01,800
the girl called me and said,
hey listen, I'm excited.

3306
03:25:02,370 --> 03:25:07,370
I just won first place in my division
and second place in absolute call back on

3307
03:25:09,310 --> 03:25:11,670
an Italian up calm.
She was so excited.

3308
03:25:11,910 --> 03:25:16,890
She won first place in her division
and second place in absolutes.

3309
03:25:16,980 --> 03:25:21,270
How many matches do you think she won?
Two zero.

3310
03:25:22,460 --> 03:25:27,180
Oh well did everybody forfeit
division?

3311
03:25:27,181 --> 03:25:28,080
Cause no one showed up.

3312
03:25:29,570 --> 03:25:34,520
Know she had one match in
absolute and she lost. I'll see

3313
03:25:36,810 --> 03:25:41,810
wonder division and she got the second
and the lesson she was acting like she

3314
03:25:42,511 --> 03:25:47,220
wanted a lottery. There
was a girl crying and shit.

3315
03:25:47,221 --> 03:25:51,060
There was a guy when I date
like it's insane. American idol.

3316
03:25:54,360 --> 03:25:56,620
Weird. I tell people do that. Like I said,

3317
03:25:56,740 --> 03:26:00,060
I went on a date with a girl and she
was weird. We want on a, and I was like,

3318
03:26:00,061 --> 03:26:03,600
this is weird. Just did Cynthia. She
was just weird, just a little zany.

3319
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:07,860
And then I get a call from
her a year later and she
goes, um, make sure you watch.

3320
03:26:07,861 --> 03:26:10,460
It was like a show. Like the practice
was, I make sure you worked prior to that.

3321
03:26:10,470 --> 03:26:15,000
Why? She goes, um, because my
hands are in it and I put like,

3322
03:26:15,080 --> 03:26:19,170
I push a door, I'm not
kidding. And I go, I go,

3323
03:26:19,470 --> 03:26:24,440
I started laughing. I mean, yeah, right.
I go, well my hands are, my hands are,

3324
03:26:24,441 --> 03:26:25,680
you'll see my hands.
And I pushed her.

3325
03:26:25,681 --> 03:26:30,000
I'm just calling my friends Tom Cause
that's like my first team. I go, I go,

3326
03:26:30,270 --> 03:26:33,840
you got to get out more or their hand
after you got to get out. More goes,

3327
03:26:34,050 --> 03:26:36,670
why don't I go?
You can't go.

3328
03:26:37,260 --> 03:26:40,740
You can't tell people that you
can't call people. She goes,

3329
03:26:40,741 --> 03:26:42,830
I have my whole family. Watch it when
he's talking about is my first time.

3330
03:26:42,831 --> 03:26:44,940
And to be, I guess it's
not, it's your hands.

3331
03:26:45,030 --> 03:26:47,310
Cause I guess Glenn close to somebody
who was going to push the door,

3332
03:26:47,311 --> 03:26:51,270
but they used her hands instead. Well,
she's not going to do a cleanse. And I go,

3333
03:26:51,310 --> 03:26:54,260
I go, you can't. You can't
tell me. It was true.

3334
03:26:54,261 --> 03:26:56,340
I was so excited and she's a good person,
but I was in her name.

3335
03:26:56,341 --> 03:26:57,840
And you can't tell people that.

3336
03:26:57,870 --> 03:27:00,540
You can't tell them because
they're going to think it's weird.

3337
03:27:00,810 --> 03:27:02,190
And some people just don't have a gauge.

3338
03:27:02,191 --> 03:27:05,640
Maybe for how weird might be a big
deal to them. The you don't like.

3339
03:27:05,641 --> 03:27:08,730
You're on all these big Josh and
know that that's not a big deal.

3340
03:27:08,731 --> 03:27:12,350
She comes from a small town. She's like,
look, those are my huge part of it.

3341
03:27:12,351 --> 03:27:16,140
A huge part of success is knowing
when you suck and when you're good.

3342
03:27:16,470 --> 03:27:19,860
That's not a matter of sucking your
goodies and matter of not being that

3343
03:27:19,861 --> 03:27:23,520
important a moment,
but for likes you.

3344
03:27:23,521 --> 03:27:27,370
She thinks maybe you'd want to see her.
Oh, that's my friend Alice. His hands. No,

3345
03:27:28,350 --> 03:27:31,450
we hadn't come.
[inaudible]

3346
03:27:31,990 --> 03:27:36,170
everybody may be or warm. Maybe
she's trying to reconnect. You

3347
03:27:37,930 --> 03:27:41,860
know I was number 78 I wish that was true.
Maybe she was Tracy

3348
03:27:42,470 --> 03:27:46,840
being stupid. It's too, she wasn't enemy.

3349
03:27:46,900 --> 03:27:48,550
I'm promising a well-read,

3350
03:27:48,610 --> 03:27:52,500
handsome gentleman with a real six pack
without either real career and she just

3351
03:27:52,501 --> 03:27:53,334
trying to fuck.

3352
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:58,060
She likes strange widdled
down wrists and hey man,

3353
03:27:58,061 --> 03:28:00,250
don't say anything on my wrist,
but I'm sensitive about that shit.

3354
03:28:00,251 --> 03:28:04,750
Protein pokey risks as
you took your shirt.

3355
03:28:07,800 --> 03:28:12,640
I'm an idiot. I'm an
idiot. How ridiculous.

3356
03:28:12,890 --> 03:28:15,850
And I took my shirt off and I was throwing
punches and see your friends, man.

3357
03:28:15,851 --> 03:28:18,700
The only difference is you're better at
being a person than you were when you

3358
03:28:18,701 --> 03:28:22,410
were 32 or 22 or it's all
just stuck in your ways. No,

3359
03:28:22,420 --> 03:28:24,040
you're better at being a person.

3360
03:28:24,070 --> 03:28:27,880
You're better at doing it with like
the least amount of fucking stress.

3361
03:28:28,330 --> 03:28:31,200
More friendly in life.
You better at life,

3362
03:28:31,420 --> 03:28:34,840
but at the end of the day you're just a
person. It's all the same shit. Shred.

3363
03:28:37,510 --> 03:28:39,220
Did he have, what? Does the obliques,

3364
03:28:39,860 --> 03:28:44,260
a six back route or route not even
show it. Take Root. Yeah, he wouldn't.

3365
03:28:44,480 --> 03:28:47,680
It just when guys pulled
their sweat pants down too. I

3366
03:28:51,340 --> 03:28:53,090
know Dan has a couple
of pictures like that.

3367
03:28:56,350 --> 03:29:01,300
Comedians do that
take it as a totally normal.

3368
03:29:01,840 --> 03:29:04,480
It's a weird thing that you know,
it's kind of grown.

3369
03:29:04,720 --> 03:29:07,720
I think it's going to go the way of the
bell bottom. Personally. It doesn't make,

3370
03:29:09,130 --> 03:29:12,790
no one shows it. Now this guys are
still slinging it. There's this

3371
03:29:14,410 --> 03:29:18,640
game. They're still wearing fucking
affliction and the game his dick, I can't,

3372
03:29:18,680 --> 03:29:20,710
I don't have to show his dick.
He's at fat day.

3373
03:29:20,740 --> 03:29:24,580
I want to let you guys know that I
coopt I'm, that's my term Dick Route.

3374
03:29:24,670 --> 03:29:27,870
I invented that shit until the lexicon.

3375
03:29:28,110 --> 03:29:31,480
You know my boy Brett aren't
says that guy's got a good root.

3376
03:29:31,630 --> 03:29:33,970
It's aggressive route, but that's a
different thing. That's different.

3377
03:29:33,980 --> 03:29:35,730
He's talking about the fiscal tick itself.

3378
03:29:35,800 --> 03:29:39,310
He's talking about the root is the
base like the bottom of the treat bro.

3379
03:29:39,640 --> 03:29:42,250
Like where the League is. Good thing
in DC are clear in that picture.

3380
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:48,520
He's got a Mac book or being
clear on the right there.

3381
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:50,530
Well you know they're skyping them in man.

3382
03:29:50,620 --> 03:29:54,400
That's the difference between like ESPN
from decades ago and now people don't

3383
03:29:54,401 --> 03:29:57,220
give a fuck. I think about how many
youtube videos that people watch it.

3384
03:29:57,221 --> 03:29:58,900
They're all going and you and shit.
They don't care.

3385
03:29:59,080 --> 03:30:02,740
They want the information and your
core me a talk. What's going on?

3386
03:30:02,741 --> 03:30:06,190
You got to fight Frankie.
I think he needs good production

3387
03:30:07,720 --> 03:30:10,630
options. You know? He's like,
you need to see Washington Post.

3388
03:30:10,650 --> 03:30:15,460
He's going to defend his back
again, brother. Wow. He's,

3389
03:30:15,461 --> 03:30:20,461
he's DC versus Francis would be
Faulk and crazy still calling DC.

3390
03:30:22,270 --> 03:30:24,050
Wow. Really? I don't bet against DC.

3391
03:30:25,210 --> 03:30:28,600
It's hard to bet against and
gone. No, that guy really,

3392
03:30:29,380 --> 03:30:34,380
I mean you could tell how much stronger
you Jon Jones usually cane throws people

3393
03:30:35,081 --> 03:30:39,840
around but he couldn't throw.
This dude came from kinds of strategy.

3394
03:30:40,690 --> 03:30:44,690
John John would beat friends. Let me
tell you something Jones. Yeah. Wow.

3395
03:30:45,920 --> 03:30:47,570
I bet.
$5.

3396
03:30:49,060 --> 03:30:51,900
John's on another level now or something.

3397
03:30:53,660 --> 03:30:57,500
$5 don't mean that.
The thing about if you get a DC fort,

3398
03:30:57,501 --> 03:31:00,920
Francis DC would not eat. You know
he, he has more options. He's,

3399
03:31:01,010 --> 03:31:03,170
he's healthier than Cain is.
Right.

3400
03:31:03,171 --> 03:31:06,620
He's got more options in terms of the
way he moves. 40 also. Yeah, he is.

3401
03:31:06,710 --> 03:31:09,740
But also he's got success at
heavyweight against Steve Pay.

3402
03:31:09,760 --> 03:31:12,470
He's won the Strikeforce Grand Prix.

3403
03:31:12,500 --> 03:31:15,920
I mean he threw trash down at around
like he was a fucking tank man.

3404
03:31:15,950 --> 03:31:19,730
He was a tank when he was in
Strikeforce at two oh five you know,

3405
03:31:19,731 --> 03:31:22,520
it may very well be that he
fights at its best at heavyweight,

3406
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:28,010
him in John Five you wait because
dcs power heavyweight wake up.

3407
03:31:28,011 --> 03:31:30,810
We've never seen John Heavily.
I don't want to see them at light heavy.

3408
03:31:30,820 --> 03:31:34,100
We've seen how that works out. It's just
not, it would be a phenomenal fight.

3409
03:31:34,101 --> 03:31:38,330
It heavy heavyweight heavyweight. It'd be
phenomenal. But this guy at heavyweight,

3410
03:31:38,360 --> 03:31:42,380
this is, that's the scariest
one. I find John Scarier.

3411
03:31:42,470 --> 03:31:46,700
Ooh, I find John Scared. I think
it'll be like a DC avenging.

3412
03:31:46,701 --> 03:31:49,870
His brother's lost. Oh, there it
is. There going to be ended up,

3413
03:31:49,890 --> 03:31:51,200
the DC's going to retire in March.

3414
03:31:51,201 --> 03:31:55,970
He says when he turns 40 which Dana's
might shut your fucking mouth if they keep

3415
03:31:55,971 --> 03:32:00,770
cup when I say so here's your
money pulls out that John.

3416
03:32:01,160 --> 03:32:04,840
Here's Brock. There's John
or here's Frances. Yeah. Wow.

3417
03:32:05,990 --> 03:32:06,823
Impressive.

3418
03:32:06,860 --> 03:32:09,830
Just from his stature as the
most impressive fighter to
ever step in the octagon.

3419
03:32:09,890 --> 03:32:14,660
In terms of what he has to work
with as far as being five, nine,

3420
03:32:14,750 --> 03:32:17,770
five, 10 minutes. He's,
he's told them that he's,

3421
03:32:17,780 --> 03:32:19,540
I think he's five 11
you see at least five,

3422
03:32:19,560 --> 03:32:22,310
10 let's say five 10 let's give it a five.

3423
03:32:22,311 --> 03:32:26,990
10 year righties below six feet tall
and he's a tank and shoulders are narrow

3424
03:32:28,970 --> 03:32:33,150
and just takes and his base undefeated.
Except for John Jones. It's astonishing.

3425
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:37,050
It's, he saw Jason. Jamie could
find out right now. But you,

3426
03:32:37,130 --> 03:32:39,580
the Google doesn't count
for height and weight. Yeah.

3427
03:32:40,880 --> 03:32:44,550
Instagram hit me standing next to
him. It's so weird. He's outstanding.

3428
03:32:44,750 --> 03:32:48,950
UFC fuck the UFC. How he's still
here now. You could only put shank.

3429
03:32:51,580 --> 03:32:54,000
You could wear high heels guys.
Fred SIPOC.

3430
03:32:54,020 --> 03:32:57,470
Carmen at six five he's
six to shake shaker.

3431
03:32:57,471 --> 03:33:02,210
I'm pretty sure it's like is probably
the shortest heavyweight champion in the

3432
03:33:02,211 --> 03:33:06,500
history of the sport. Right? Oh, he's
a hall of fame right there in Ghana.

3433
03:33:06,920 --> 03:33:11,920
Well that'd be nice to say it like 10
times more muscular than that dude and

3434
03:33:13,181 --> 03:33:17,780
God, I was a real true,
unusual person. Oh Shit. Snap.

3435
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:21,320
You just want thing. I don't give
a fuck bouts. College basketball.

3436
03:33:21,650 --> 03:33:23,600
I don't care either.
But it's weird though,

3437
03:33:23,601 --> 03:33:26,030
when you see these
markets and understand it.

3438
03:33:26,130 --> 03:33:31,130
When you see these athletes like like a
Lebron James who's like a clear top of

3439
03:33:31,491 --> 03:33:34,010
the food chain freak. When you,
when you see one of those guys,

3440
03:33:34,220 --> 03:33:39,220
you see more of those guys and things
like basketball and football clearly.

3441
03:33:39,721 --> 03:33:42,630
Right? What do you mean more? You mean
to all of them? All of them, right?

3442
03:33:43,300 --> 03:33:46,520
What are the numbers? So it's not all,
but what do you think it would be honest.

3443
03:33:46,730 --> 03:33:49,530
Yeah. Yeah. Freaks. We're
the freaks and the MBA.

3444
03:33:49,860 --> 03:33:54,450
Mba has the biggest free NBA.
Nfl. Let's just add them all.

3445
03:33:54,520 --> 03:33:58,710
Let's go three gas free and alignments go
off three together. How about your boy,

3446
03:33:59,140 --> 03:34:03,960
your corn Fred Fan, you Brett brought
to San Diego. Who's that? Jackie. Okay.

3447
03:34:04,140 --> 03:34:07,180
That gigantic gentleman. He's from
another gene. Cool. I don't know.

3448
03:34:07,500 --> 03:34:11,700
Fucking super nice guy.
Skinny right now. So big.

3449
03:34:11,701 --> 03:34:14,590
She has legs and has the worst
that you've ever seen. Football,

3450
03:34:14,610 --> 03:34:15,660
fast food every day.

3451
03:34:15,760 --> 03:34:20,700
This is the perfect example because this
is a to hitting each other all day long,

3452
03:34:20,730 --> 03:34:23,790
different sport. They're tackling
each. Wow. You know what I mean?

3453
03:34:23,791 --> 03:34:25,910
There's swells up freaks and bolts,

3454
03:34:26,230 --> 03:34:31,230
Herschel Walker freaks in the NBA
and the green down the freaks.

3455
03:34:33,541 --> 03:34:36,450
Two guys that are just throwing balls.
There's some freaks,

3456
03:34:36,970 --> 03:34:39,600
different kind of beast right there,
guys with the ball.

3457
03:34:39,980 --> 03:34:43,900
Nobody tackling him against a guy that
where there's people trying to kill you.

3458
03:34:43,901 --> 03:34:46,770
It's the nature of the sport.
But as far as pure athletic ability,

3459
03:34:47,070 --> 03:34:51,930
NBA has the biggest freaks in the world.
Wow. Tallest guys is what you mean.

3460
03:34:52,380 --> 03:34:56,110
Although like all over.
So you have these specimens,

3461
03:34:56,730 --> 03:34:58,950
you have these specimens,
the same day Lewis,

3462
03:34:59,130 --> 03:35:01,740
you have these specimens to stand
out and almost every sport. Right.

3463
03:35:01,950 --> 03:35:04,380
And Brock Brock Lesnar is
a great example of that.

3464
03:35:04,410 --> 03:35:06,210
What basketball play
can fuck with Ray Lewis?

3465
03:35:06,240 --> 03:35:11,240
Name One and what asked me
what we were just fighting.

3466
03:35:11,910 --> 03:35:14,720
No, no, no. You did as a castle.

3467
03:35:15,080 --> 03:35:18,570
Hey Eddie were talking about before and
if you did it to Kathleen of all the

3468
03:35:18,571 --> 03:35:23,040
athletes from NBA, NFL, Nhl. No,
no I don't. I'm a football guy.

3469
03:35:23,310 --> 03:35:27,800
The NBA beats all of them in terms
of like ton of raw food. Yeah,

3470
03:35:27,810 --> 03:35:32,550
like speed jump, no. Everything Jill.
Annoying. It's basketball by far.

3471
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:37,350
So let, let's just say dominating another
man. But let's just say, let's just,

3472
03:35:37,650 --> 03:35:42,510
let's just say, let's go, let's
go NFL. Let's go NBA, UFC.

3473
03:35:42,540 --> 03:35:46,470
Just narrow it down to those three. Yes,
he's waiting. But what are the, right,

3474
03:35:46,471 --> 03:35:50,220
but what are the
percentages of real freaks?

3475
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:54,780
Like the Brock Lesnar type freaks
in the and the NFL and NBA.

3476
03:35:55,650 --> 03:35:59,140
Who gets the most, who gets the
most NFL and what does that number

3477
03:36:00,750 --> 03:36:05,750
get down to the UFC to 10% is
it 22% of Tutsis freak athletes?

3478
03:36:06,210 --> 03:36:09,930
Wow.
And I'd say nine or 6% fell felon.

3479
03:36:09,931 --> 03:36:14,070
Nine 9% and below you're a
freak because unusual. Hugely,

3480
03:36:14,160 --> 03:36:17,910
hugely unusual in every facet. Like,
Oh, you look at a Lebron James,

3481
03:36:18,120 --> 03:36:19,500
you look at mean fill in the blank.
There's,

3482
03:36:19,501 --> 03:36:22,380
there's a bunch of guys and
majority player he played in there.

3483
03:36:22,410 --> 03:36:26,250
You look at all the fuck golden
state warriors to creek free. Jack

3484
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:31,800
Three. Yeah. Yeah. Height
is important. And basketball
because basketball for sure,

3485
03:36:31,860 --> 03:36:36,050
but I mean I'm an Irish fight and
football too. Well, you know when

3486
03:36:36,050 --> 03:36:36,910
you're talking about fighting,

3487
03:36:36,911 --> 03:36:41,911
football's a way more violent encounter
and people that would like be probably

3488
03:36:41,921 --> 03:36:44,260
better at fighting would be drawn to that.

3489
03:36:44,290 --> 03:36:49,070
More of a freak to be in that more
of a violent sport has a mass port.

3490
03:36:49,110 --> 03:36:50,950
Especially to be like super competitive.

3491
03:36:51,010 --> 03:36:55,880
Every cell is way higher than the NBA.
Well here's the other thing too. It's,

3492
03:36:56,020 --> 03:36:56,380
wait,

3493
03:36:56,380 --> 03:37:01,080
there's way more on the line is way more
on the line in regards to in the NFL

3494
03:37:01,150 --> 03:37:02,970
physical punishment.
Exactly.

3495
03:37:03,170 --> 03:37:06,490
But that's watch flooded cause you're
willing to run into a wall or get punched.

3496
03:37:06,650 --> 03:37:08,810
It doesn't mean that that's how
you're ready. Separate roles.

3497
03:37:09,460 --> 03:37:12,850
But we need super athletic guys to survive
in this sport. But here's the thing,

3498
03:37:12,851 --> 03:37:17,650
so important in the UFC going on, there's
not enough money. But here's the thing.

3499
03:37:17,760 --> 03:37:21,460
What if, what if those guys are still
trickling over there nodding the UFC?

3500
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:22,900
Why would they trickle over the jail?

3501
03:37:23,440 --> 03:37:27,280
Well because they think that they could
educate chance at controlling their

3502
03:37:27,281 --> 03:37:32,281
destiny fighting than they would if they
think 20 years colliding with people

3503
03:37:32,411 --> 03:37:35,170
all the time when the football field
thinking about colliding with people,

3504
03:37:35,171 --> 03:37:39,270
it's like, I really feel like
certain guys like look at Ryan Bader,

3505
03:37:39,271 --> 03:37:42,400
his last few fights,
I mean they were talking about this,

3506
03:37:42,700 --> 03:37:44,530
they were talking about this
in the belt or broadcast.

3507
03:37:44,531 --> 03:37:46,960
I got the guy barely got
hit and like three fights.

3508
03:37:46,961 --> 03:37:50,220
He won the heavyweight Grand Prix and
punch against worldclass competent much

3509
03:37:50,221 --> 03:37:52,450
money you make. I don't
know. That's a good question.

3510
03:37:52,480 --> 03:37:55,750
I'm sure you've made a shitload of money
football player to be begging like 10

3511
03:37:55,750 --> 03:37:56,583
million a year.

3512
03:37:56,740 --> 03:38:00,280
But the thing is like he controlled
his destiny in these encounters,

3513
03:38:00,281 --> 03:38:04,710
which I don't think you totally can
and football, but still Ryan Bader,

3514
03:38:04,760 --> 03:38:07,990
the money he makes and the
longevity and all that,

3515
03:38:08,260 --> 03:38:11,170
is that as a fraction where
the NFL or NBA hundred percent.

3516
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:13,630
So you might be the most
famous guy in the world,

3517
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:17,470
but there's the guy who's the third string
quarterback on the San Diego chargers

3518
03:38:17,471 --> 03:38:21,330
who makes more money. Exactly. No, you're
right. I'm 100% with Earth's train.

3519
03:38:21,970 --> 03:38:22,661
Third string stuff.

3520
03:38:22,661 --> 03:38:25,510
They only carry two and then these
days it's just an exaggeration.

3521
03:38:25,720 --> 03:38:28,330
Wouldn't you rather be the guy
who controls his own destiny?

3522
03:38:28,900 --> 03:38:31,120
Like the thing about like, oh,
because for every guy, sorry,

3523
03:38:31,200 --> 03:38:33,670
judged for every guy that
controls his destiny.

3524
03:38:33,700 --> 03:38:37,320
A lot of those guys are fucked over
because you have a pension to Indiana.

3525
03:38:37,540 --> 03:38:41,910
Well pastry to college and
there's a blueprint. Pop water,

3526
03:38:42,010 --> 03:38:45,980
high school. I'm good. I get
a college education. I'm good.
I get drafted. In effect,

3527
03:38:46,540 --> 03:38:50,230
he made $150,000 flat
and then he made taxes.

3528
03:38:50,250 --> 03:38:54,420
That's a punk ass. Yeah. What
do you think you made, um,

3529
03:38:54,460 --> 03:38:57,080
with its sponsors and shit cause
you belt or you can do this policy.

3530
03:38:57,220 --> 03:39:01,660
Let's say me $250,000 on top of that
all to all told a hundred grand.

3531
03:39:03,310 --> 03:39:07,750
Wow. That's about it. Huh?
He's a world champion.

3532
03:39:08,530 --> 03:39:11,020
He's a double champion. Yeah.
Yeah. He's a world champion.

3533
03:39:11,021 --> 03:39:14,050
Light heavyweight and heavyweight over
there. That's a weird thing, right?

3534
03:39:14,051 --> 03:39:15,610
That world champion thing.

3535
03:39:15,790 --> 03:39:18,580
It's almost like no one should be able
to just remember they tried to do that

3536
03:39:18,581 --> 03:39:20,940
shit with fader.
They tried to give him the Wilma.

3537
03:39:21,330 --> 03:39:24,910
They gave him the go wham world,
the Wham a championship. I was that.

3538
03:39:24,911 --> 03:39:26,890
They invented a Wilma
and everybody was like,

3539
03:39:26,891 --> 03:39:31,480
why did you call it hey were you when
you were watching cro cop or last night I

3540
03:39:31,481 --> 03:39:34,290
thought, are they a new cro cop paid? Wow.

3541
03:39:34,490 --> 03:39:37,430
That run through your mind is coke ups.
First I belts I went,

3542
03:39:37,640 --> 03:39:38,780
I put two can do set up cro,

3543
03:39:38,781 --> 03:39:43,781
cop fade or I watch this shit or hate
and the shit if they both sit and that's,

3544
03:39:45,380 --> 03:39:47,000
that's where I'm at with those guys.
Right.

3545
03:39:47,270 --> 03:39:48,950
Like if they still want
to do a coke cro cop,

3546
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:53,780
Avi competitor wants to do the baby.
You still want to talk about a fighting?

3547
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:57,220
Well it'd be hard.
I would really want to talk to some.

3548
03:39:59,390 --> 03:40:03,710
Joey EOL was great cause
I knew Joey in a new URL.

3549
03:40:03,770 --> 03:40:07,040
Like when Joey and Eol we're together
and Joey was like translating back and

3550
03:40:07,041 --> 03:40:11,000
forth. That was great. But I would
have to really know someone real well.

3551
03:40:11,001 --> 03:40:14,500
Who spoke? Russian friends. Any
Russian spies? Callen Columbia dead.

3552
03:40:14,850 --> 03:40:17,720
Carolyn's got some connections meet by.

3553
03:40:17,840 --> 03:40:21,170
We got to go to the beach and pick up a
bottle with a message and they say fate

3554
03:40:21,171 --> 03:40:24,440
or his favorite place. There's red
lobster and his favorite clothing stores.

3555
03:40:24,441 --> 03:40:26,270
Abercrombie,
which I find fascinating.

3556
03:40:26,500 --> 03:40:30,620
That smell and plus them pretty faces
on the lookout recovery. Not For me.

3557
03:40:31,010 --> 03:40:35,930
I go to the law. What do you look
for? Starbucks down the street.

3558
03:40:35,931 --> 03:40:39,680
Starbucks.
Starbucks gun to your head.

3559
03:40:40,010 --> 03:40:44,150
You're going to one store. Nordstrom's.
Dan, what about Bloomingdale's?

3560
03:40:45,220 --> 03:40:46,970
No Bra.
They're nice too.

3561
03:40:50,060 --> 03:40:54,950
Conspiratorial jeans. I went in
there to buy my wife some jeans.

3562
03:40:54,951 --> 03:40:59,930
I'm like, God dammit. These motherfuckers
are 400 cheap. What are your sense?

3563
03:40:59,931 --> 03:41:04,910
Has higher quality clothing
shop good

3564
03:41:06,680 --> 03:41:10,820
before you leave this podcast, you're
less of a human. No, it's okay. It's okay.

3565
03:41:11,220 --> 03:41:15,560
I don't want to talk to you guys. Hate me
for it. You know what I want. I want one.

3566
03:41:15,980 --> 03:41:20,060
One example at why we should believe
the earth is flat. That's what I want.

3567
03:41:20,630 --> 03:41:24,050
You son of a bitch.
You want it so bad and I am high drunk.

3568
03:41:25,200 --> 03:41:28,960
You guys want that to as long as
it's a joke and it's funny, I'm cold,

3569
03:41:28,961 --> 03:41:31,960
it gets angry. It's not fun.
I'm not married to that.

3570
03:41:32,820 --> 03:41:36,410
I'm not married to it
convinced me that it's flat.

3571
03:41:36,680 --> 03:41:39,740
There's no way I could do that. God
really? There's not one example.

3572
03:41:39,790 --> 03:41:43,130
It takes about a year and a half and
like wanting to have this too much.

3573
03:41:43,131 --> 03:41:46,940
Very hard. They locked urination so
strong. You look at your sons cartoons.

3574
03:41:47,600 --> 03:41:50,870
It's all space. I look at all my
shit, all the shit my son likes,

3575
03:41:51,020 --> 03:41:52,680
his everything is,
they're taking space.

3576
03:41:52,820 --> 03:41:55,040
Still doing research on this
currently in space space.

3577
03:41:55,080 --> 03:41:58,040
Want to direct everyone
to Hashtag spaces fake.

3578
03:41:58,700 --> 03:42:02,150
I've been doing research and space being
fake. Is that real? That's a real site.

3579
03:42:02,390 --> 03:42:05,780
Hashtag spaces fake is something
I'm investigating for my next hour

3580
03:42:07,510 --> 03:42:09,560
for legitimately looking deep into

3581
03:42:12,380 --> 03:42:15,480
like what space do you dumb motherfucker.

3582
03:42:17,520 --> 03:42:20,810
It's the same thing. You got it
all wrong. You got it all wrong.

3583
03:42:22,490 --> 03:42:24,010
This is not very organized.

3584
03:42:24,020 --> 03:42:27,470
Know what I'm saying is you
couldn't have it all wrong. Nobody.

3585
03:42:27,590 --> 03:42:32,100
Anybody that thinks the earth is flat,
they totally don't believe what

3586
03:42:32,100 --> 03:42:34,050
we're taught about what's above us.

3587
03:42:34,550 --> 03:42:37,960
So to bake in the sun,

3588
03:42:38,070 --> 03:42:41,130
they mean all the
information we're getting.

3589
03:42:41,760 --> 03:42:45,150
You're lying about that shit that,
it's not that it doesn't exist.

3590
03:42:45,151 --> 03:42:49,170
Of course it exists. We see of course,
but space is fake. Sounds ridiculous.

3591
03:42:49,171 --> 03:42:52,050
Like there's, there's, I'm not
looking at it and it's it. It's fake.

3592
03:42:52,051 --> 03:42:53,610
That's ridiculous.
That's not what it means.

3593
03:42:53,611 --> 03:42:57,480
It means that all the information we
got to buy, all the lights in the sky,

3594
03:42:57,860 --> 03:43:00,870
something alive. They're
lying. They're line too.

3595
03:43:01,890 --> 03:43:05,310
There's a reason that I tell you,
but you guys would don't want to hear it.

3596
03:43:05,340 --> 03:43:08,970
Hold on. So I don't want to
talk to give us the cliff notes.

3597
03:43:09,480 --> 03:43:14,180
The cliff notes are man,
ah,

3598
03:43:14,590 --> 03:43:18,030
have you studied any kind of a,
he doesn't need to be. Let's hear.

3599
03:43:18,031 --> 03:43:18,950
Just so few of us.

3600
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:24,000
The goal has always been for the
most powerful emperors is a one world

3601
03:43:25,711 --> 03:43:29,570
government. Always wanted a one world
government. All of the Roman emperors,

3602
03:43:29,571 --> 03:43:32,720
they try to figure out, they tried to do
different combinations. How about him?

3603
03:43:32,880 --> 03:43:35,700
And they would fall. And they were a new
emperor would come and go, you know what?

3604
03:43:36,030 --> 03:43:37,890
I'm going to fucking rule domination.

3605
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:42,480
I'm not going to let my
soldiers get married that way.

3606
03:43:42,481 --> 03:43:44,850
We'll have a stronger army.
They have different philosophies.

3607
03:43:44,851 --> 03:43:48,210
Everyone believed different shit, but
they all wanted a one world government.

3608
03:43:48,360 --> 03:43:50,640
There's no way to have a fucking
Walmart with government it.

3609
03:43:50,641 --> 03:43:51,900
Nobody's into that shit.

3610
03:43:52,320 --> 03:43:55,620
Not even other rules from small countries
or like one world government that's

3611
03:43:55,621 --> 03:43:58,170
going to put me out of a job.
Fuck your one world government.

3612
03:43:58,380 --> 03:44:02,160
People don't know shit about politics.
Don't want a one world government.

3613
03:44:02,310 --> 03:44:05,910
There's no way you're going to sell the
one world government. It's impossible.

3614
03:44:06,180 --> 03:44:07,770
The only way,

3615
03:44:08,400 --> 03:44:13,400
the only way to make a one
world government work is
to have the people embrace

3616
03:44:13,861 --> 03:44:16,770
it. They have to want it
because nobody wants it.

3617
03:44:17,040 --> 03:44:21,900
So the trick is to make, to make
people want it, to embrace it.

3618
03:44:21,901 --> 03:44:26,400
There's only one way I got to pee.
There's only Miss Alice. I noticed.

3619
03:44:27,340 --> 03:44:32,250
I don't know. The only way, and the known
this forever, the Vatican knew this,

3620
03:44:32,251 --> 03:44:35,240
the Vatican, the pope water to
rule the world. They all knew it,

3621
03:44:35,241 --> 03:44:38,280
but they couldn't do it. They all
knew it, but they knew one way,

3622
03:44:38,490 --> 03:44:40,270
but there's no how they're
going to put it on man.

3623
03:44:40,380 --> 03:44:45,380
The only way is if there was some extra
terrestrial threat from up above us,

3624
03:44:48,360 --> 03:44:53,360
that would be the only way to have
everyone embrace the one world government.

3625
03:44:54,840 --> 03:44:59,590
They all knew that for years. That's
the plan. They can never make that.

3626
03:44:59,840 --> 03:45:03,180
They didn't have the technology 500
years ago. The Vatican knew about it,

3627
03:45:03,330 --> 03:45:06,990
they wanted it, and you go to
the Vatican, you see paintings,

3628
03:45:07,410 --> 03:45:08,610
that paintings of like,

3629
03:45:08,700 --> 03:45:12,570
have you met those with aliens in them
and back when I used to believe in Ufos,

3630
03:45:12,571 --> 03:45:15,260
but before I figured out that um,

3631
03:45:16,100 --> 03:45:19,980
Ufo is where are they want
us to believe in Ufos.

3632
03:45:20,160 --> 03:45:24,330
They're preparing us for a fake alien
invasion. That's always been the plan.

3633
03:45:24,570 --> 03:45:28,470
A one world government, the only way
to do it is to get us to embrace it.

3634
03:45:28,710 --> 03:45:31,600
And the way to embrace it
is from an alien attack.

3635
03:45:31,870 --> 03:45:35,890
Ronald Reagan talked about
it many times at the UN CFR.

3636
03:45:35,980 --> 03:45:39,460
He talked about it because one it make,
he looked at all the, the leaders of the,

3637
03:45:39,730 --> 03:45:41,530
of the nature of the world and said,

3638
03:45:41,590 --> 03:45:45,820
what did it make our lives easier
if we just had some, you know,

3639
03:45:46,210 --> 03:45:50,020
some kind of extra terrestrial
threat. He said, that shit,

3640
03:45:50,110 --> 03:45:52,510
he said that in front
of the UN wouldn't aw,

3641
03:45:52,690 --> 03:45:56,950
like he's trying to get everybody into
then too. I don't think he ever said that,

3642
03:45:57,000 --> 03:46:01,610
but no, no. He said that many times. It's
an video. Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan

3643
03:46:04,950 --> 03:46:09,730
was vice president. He was talking about,
and there's many videos of him saying,

3644
03:46:09,970 --> 03:46:13,750
we are what lies before us.
He's in front of the nation doing it.

3645
03:46:13,780 --> 03:46:17,110
State of the Union address,
saying what lies before us.

3646
03:46:17,290 --> 03:46:22,150
Is the opportunity to forge a new
world, order a world, an order?

3647
03:46:22,151 --> 03:46:26,560
Because he's talking about
like, isn't that means that
the spaces fate? Yes. No, no,

3648
03:46:26,561 --> 03:46:30,340
no, no, no. When people ask
me, why would they fake space?

3649
03:46:31,090 --> 03:46:35,660
It's always been about a fake alien
attack. You can't have a fake alien.

3650
03:46:35,700 --> 03:46:39,730
Never apologize. Never to kind of
a fake alien attack without space.

3651
03:46:39,790 --> 03:46:43,360
I've never heard of politics. He got that
space first. So they always, you know,

3652
03:46:43,361 --> 03:46:46,360
who promoted space more
than anybody who want Nazis,

3653
03:46:47,080 --> 03:46:52,070
Nazis before the Nazis, you know, Mayans,

3654
03:46:52,160 --> 03:46:56,470
the VAT, again, they have all the biggest,
uh, they have all the astronomers.

3655
03:46:56,471 --> 03:46:58,570
They're all Jesuit, Vatican, all of them,

3656
03:46:58,690 --> 03:47:01,390
all the ones that are giving us
this information about space.

3657
03:47:01,540 --> 03:47:02,650
They all come from the Vatican.

3658
03:47:02,770 --> 03:47:06,060
The Vatican has the most beautiful hotels
come here and know what the name of

3659
03:47:06,170 --> 03:47:10,870
the most powerful, you know what it's
name is the most powerful telescope.

3660
03:47:10,871 --> 03:47:14,560
The Bat again, and you know what name it
is. I've done the research on Youtube.

3661
03:47:15,150 --> 03:47:15,983
Hi Nancy.

3662
03:47:17,980 --> 03:47:20,430
This do you want to chill?

3663
03:47:20,440 --> 03:47:24,220
Is the most bellow power telescope
in the world? It's in the Vatican.

3664
03:47:24,240 --> 03:47:28,540
But do you know what's Lucifer that
falls Lucifer's Dick and balls.

3665
03:47:28,541 --> 03:47:31,260
I've never seen this fucking
talent scouts, real legit dude. Uh,

3666
03:47:31,300 --> 03:47:32,510
I think the biggest ones in Chile,

3667
03:47:32,511 --> 03:47:35,500
I think they have to be in high altitude
paddock. Yeah. I don't think it's enough.

3668
03:47:35,950 --> 03:47:39,250
And so when people ask me why
would they fake all this shit?

3669
03:47:39,520 --> 03:47:43,750
But I don't think that's the biggest thing
is just a crazy theory. I'm trying to,

3670
03:47:43,751 --> 03:47:48,160
I'm just, it certainly, we're
talking to these Ellis, these
funny theory, but Eddie,

3671
03:47:48,161 --> 03:47:49,930
these new chilay,

3672
03:47:49,931 --> 03:47:54,790
very large array telescopes that
they're creating are fucking gigantic.

3673
03:47:54,791 --> 03:47:57,830
And they take over enormous
pieces of land. Listen,

3674
03:47:57,910 --> 03:48:01,200
I was with Google those very large,
it's called no,

3675
03:48:01,201 --> 03:48:03,190
it's called the very
large telescope telescope.

3676
03:48:03,191 --> 03:48:05,740
I watched the documentary
with you at your house.

3677
03:48:05,920 --> 03:48:10,920
It was like 2001 and I think in five
years they're gonna be putting a

3678
03:48:10,921 --> 03:48:15,580
documentary about them putting together
the very large telescope in Chile and

3679
03:48:15,610 --> 03:48:18,730
they're talking about by the year
2005 we're going to have this,

3680
03:48:18,910 --> 03:48:23,680
we're going to have three telescopes
are linked with a computer to make us,

3681
03:48:23,890 --> 03:48:28,430
we're going to see further into space
than ever before. None of that shit came.

3682
03:48:28,880 --> 03:48:33,560
What are you talking about? Came, is that
up? Is a very, very large array up yet.

3683
03:48:33,640 --> 03:48:37,040
Nope. Large telescope. Um,
but I know they have the,

3684
03:48:37,900 --> 03:48:40,280
they have them in Hawaii.
We said weird.

3685
03:48:40,310 --> 03:48:45,140
Isn't it weird that every space
documentary, all the series,

3686
03:48:45,141 --> 03:48:47,150
I had them all, Jo, Adam, all,
we watch them all the time.

3687
03:48:47,330 --> 03:48:50,990
I tried to remember all this shit about
a neutron star and a super hyper Nova.

3688
03:48:51,110 --> 03:48:55,670
I was ballsy and Joe were balls deep in
space and then every now and then we'd

3689
03:48:55,671 --> 03:48:59,450
watch this documentary after documentary.
Morgan Freeman ain't got the universe.

3690
03:48:59,540 --> 03:49:01,760
We call that shit. I
DVR it, all that shit.

3691
03:49:01,910 --> 03:49:04,250
Anything that said space was fucking ball.

3692
03:49:04,310 --> 03:49:07,370
I thought it was better than people and
shit cause I knew so much about space

3693
03:49:07,820 --> 03:49:11,870
and every now and then I'd watch all
that shit and wonder and wonder what,

3694
03:49:12,320 --> 03:49:16,430
this is all cartoons. Eddie won, but
this is a cartoon. And then I go, okay,

3695
03:49:16,431 --> 03:49:20,690
whatever, whatever. And then I keep
watching all DVDs on space or I'll see GI.

3696
03:49:20,840 --> 03:49:24,230
There's nothing real and everyone
watches that. They believe it.

3697
03:49:24,380 --> 03:49:28,820
The narration is all programming
what's above us and what we're on.

3698
03:49:28,910 --> 03:49:32,170
We're being lied to. Once you
go flat, you never go back.

3699
03:49:33,530 --> 03:49:36,870
Listen, if you look a campaign,
listen was about everything.

3700
03:49:37,790 --> 03:49:41,500
It's not about,
it's not about who is the one thing.

3701
03:49:41,650 --> 03:49:43,020
This is the one thing I want to say.
Okay.

3702
03:49:43,090 --> 03:49:47,650
It's like it's not that we believe
something ridiculous and you don't,

3703
03:49:47,950 --> 03:49:50,890
you don't believe it. We're
gullible. We're gullible. We,

3704
03:49:50,891 --> 03:49:55,210
we believe some weird shit about the
flatter. We believe some weird shit.

3705
03:49:55,330 --> 03:49:57,910
You don't believe it. You're
smart. It's not about that.

3706
03:49:58,060 --> 03:50:01,750
It's about we actually don't know what
we're on and we always say that we don't

3707
03:50:01,751 --> 03:50:05,740
know, but based on all the shit
that we got by the mainstream,

3708
03:50:06,100 --> 03:50:07,600
we don't believe that.

3709
03:50:07,630 --> 03:50:12,340
Here's what I do believe that it's not
that we believe something crazy and you

3710
03:50:12,341 --> 03:50:13,960
don't because you smell it.

3711
03:50:14,440 --> 03:50:15,273
What is narrow sense?

3712
03:50:15,620 --> 03:50:20,620
It get a totally different tone we looked
at as you from now and we don't pay

3713
03:50:22,740 --> 03:50:26,920
any of that. Yeah, but you use, you use
that microphone. Use a cell phone. Right?

3714
03:50:27,430 --> 03:50:30,370
It's science. Hold on. I believe
at that time I believe in it. Okay.

3715
03:50:30,371 --> 03:50:33,670
Why do you believe in that study?

3716
03:50:33,940 --> 03:50:38,100
I don't need to read something to verify,
but you better benefit consignments.

3717
03:50:38,730 --> 03:50:43,690
You benefit from. It's not every day.
I know. I love this. To cut this off,

3718
03:50:43,950 --> 03:50:44,880
it's 10 o'clock.

3719
03:50:46,750 --> 03:50:51,750
Come see me in Vancouver at the vogue
theater and in Salt Lake City at wiseguys

3720
03:50:51,940 --> 03:50:56,260
march one and two. I love science. I
love science. I don't want to fight.

3721
03:50:56,320 --> 03:51:00,370
I want to laugh about it. I'm an idiot.
I believe in flat earth. I'm crazy.

3722
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:05,230
That's all you need to know. Pasadena
Ice House fight, companion show shit.

3723
03:51:05,410 --> 03:51:09,210
Wednesday night, 10:00 PM
Hauler, boy, Miami Improv.

3724
03:51:09,220 --> 03:51:14,220

Washington DC. March. I'm in Miami.

3725

Brand new Miami and the stories don't

3727
03:51:20,500 --> 03:51:25,430

Anything. Uh, I just dropped a
new music video. Smoke serpent.

3730
03:51:31,380 --> 03:51:35,220
They're all gone. It's on youtube.
It's cut to what dreams may come.

3731
03:51:35,610 --> 03:51:37,080
Check it out by everybody.
