1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,680
Worst intro.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,023
Remember,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,093
could you imagine?

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,050
He's fucking cones.

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,940
So stupid.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,050
The people who stupid that listen,

7
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,980
but just being quiet.

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,060

9
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,213

10
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:13,710
Yeah,

11
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,491

12
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:15,390
but the whole thing's happening.

13
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,760

14
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,200

We're going to get Arriana too and it

How many tractors I've used that present
was very few people are nonbelievers.

38
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,920
They want to believe
in the placebo effect.

39
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,903
Maybe

40
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,540
shit for results,

41
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,890
placebo or not.

42
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,170
I'm in this shit for results.

43
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,910
Give me a Hologram,

44
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,940
cock ring and let me think that this
shit makes my dick work better and it

45
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,430
probably will make my dick work better
on placebo just like everybody else.

46
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:30,711
We're,

47
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:31,810
we're fucking dumb,

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,621
you know.

49
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,160
Um,

50
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,780
did I tell you about
the study on placebos?

51
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,321
You did.

52
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:36,820
And that's one of the reasons
why I brought that up.

53
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,180
It's really just a hair.

54
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:38,510
Yeah.

55
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,891
Yeah.

56
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:39,611
It's brilliant.

57
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:41,880
It's a bro Tell Mpr it's,

58
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,161
you know,

59
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:42,810
it's real.

60
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,240
Um,

61
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,073
they did a study

62
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,151
on a,

63
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:48,400
on just placebo effects per se,

64
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,820
so that gave people what they
told them was the placebo.

65
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,080
They were in the control group,

66
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,160
um,

67
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,993
for a,

68
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,190
a low blood pressure or heart medication,

69
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,443
something like that.

70
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,703
Um,

71
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,030
but they told him we're only giving
you a placebo and it's still affected.

72
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,740
Our blood pressure went down
in the people noticeably like,

73
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,050
yeah,

74
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,530
yeah.

75
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,250
Like measurably,

76
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,730
they think that it has something to do
with just concentrating on whatever it is

77
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,200
and or ritualistic thing.

78
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm concentrating on it every day.

79
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,900
One of the ladies in the study,

80
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,860
like after it ended,

81
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,311
she was like,

82
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:18,690
oh,

83
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,121
that's great,

84
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,170
but I need more of that.

85
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,580
Like my blood pressure is lower,

86
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,503
don't drop me.

87
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,830
I want lower blood pressure.

88
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,071
Like,

89
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,050
can I get as you wouldn't be out,

90
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,280
she couldn't get placebos at rite aid.

91
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,510
That's so crazy.

92
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,260
Yeah.

93
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,350
How weird is the human brain
and what the hell is going on?

94
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,970
Just some sort of regularity helps you,

95
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:34,360
I dunno.

96
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,630
Yeah.

97
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,340
Thinking about all the time you will,

98
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:39,180
there's a dude who was going to
come on the podcast and talk about,

99
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,950
his name is Bruce Lipton
and he wrote a book,

100
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,671
uh,

101
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,200
on that very subject.

102
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,670
Really?

103
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,220
Yeah.

104
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,550
Yeah.

105
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,001
He,

106
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:46,600
um,

107
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,030
he wrote,

108
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,530
it's called the biology of
belief and I ran into his,

109
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:50,861
uh,

110
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:54,400
I believe it's his cousin at one of the
shows and the guy gave me that book and

111
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,470
then he contacted me on Twitter and
he's going to come on and explain to us,

112
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,970
and he's a scientist so he'll,

113
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,530
you know,

114
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,021
the break,

115
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:02,920
I believe he's a scientist.

116
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,680
He'll be able to break it
down and explain exactly.

117
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,700
You know,

118
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,550
what the fuck they believe is going on.

119
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900
And like with the human brain.

120
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,270
Yeah.

121
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,010
In terms of,

122
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,670
you know,

123
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,780
understandable that you and I will be
able to grab the reasonably educated

124
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,620
people to be able to grab,

125
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,600
but the idea is really strange,

126
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,463
you know?

127
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,310
Yeah.

128
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,620
You can fool yourself
into having a real hope.

129
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,170
It's so bizarre that we somehow or another
have little triggers in our body that

130
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,900
we don't know how to push the road stuff.

131
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,300
Yeah,

132
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,601
yeah,

133
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:33,430
yeah,

134
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,791
yeah.

135
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,410
Like when someone gets caught under a car,

136
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,010
yeah.

137
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,590
Why can all of a sudden you throw
that fucking car off person,

138
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,101
but by the way,

139
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,611
they can,

140
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:39,910
man,

141
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,950
people can do crazy shit.

142
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,510
But I said that's cause
the release of adrenaline.

143
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:43,991
Yeah.

144
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,460
Gas I guess.

145
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,030
Yeah.

146
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,863
But also,

147
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,650
you know a lot of what you can't lift
is cause you're not willing to tolerate

148
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
the pain.

149
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,600
You know when you're,

150
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,340
when you're trying to pick
up something really heavy,

151
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,300
it's very painful.

152
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,870
Your body's sending you a lot of signals
and most of those signals are uh,

153
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,471
listen,

154
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,600
listen is not a good thing to do.

155
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,411
Okay,

156
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,191
let's stop.

157
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,450
This is heavy.

158
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,051
What the fuck?

159
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:05,950
This hurts.

160
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,401
Okay,

161
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,211
we're going to drop this.

162
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,710
I'm telling you right now
we're going to drop this.

163
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,440
But when your baby's
trapped under your car,

164
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,640
all those don't make it.

165
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,870
They're like the only thing that saved
the baby and your body just goes into

166
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,910
full crazy gorilla mode.

167
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,540
We tried to lift the car off train tracks
at Bridgetown Portland Burstein and

168
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,470
comedy festivals here.

169
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,670
Really to see if he could do it.

170
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,533
We took a wrong,

171
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,883
oh no,

172
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,770
I only got stuck on the
tracks and he went for it.

173
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,880
And you just started skidding cause
it looks like you can drive over the,

174
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,630
the the,

175
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,720
the stone part,

176
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,920
you know right outside the tracks.

177
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,950
But that drops down so you
would just start sliding.

178
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,910
Wow.

179
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,120
The wheels make no connection.

180
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:44,440
So we had like 12 comics try to
lift this car off the tracks.

181
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,310
We get back it up.

182
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,720
We couldn't do it.

183
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,190
He couldn't even get close.

184
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,450
We took like one tire up.

185
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,340
Like I don't,

186
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,830
I can't imagine some lady
picking the car up off her kid.

187
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,933
I want to see it.

188
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,193
Why is there an opinion?

189
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,030
Well there's probably a video
on youtube or something.

190
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,661
Oh God,

191
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,860
I wouldn't be able to watch it.

192
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,240
Would you be able to watch that amongst
younger woman to try to pick a baby?

193
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,370
That would be way too emotional for me.

194
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,743
You know,

195
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,010
if there's that video though power,

196
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,310
which is sponsored power,

197
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,910
a I that would work,

198
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,600
that would help you rehydrate after
lifting a baby or a car off a baby tired

199
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,920
would give you a special strength.

200
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,550
It is weird how some people would just
have way more physical strength than

201
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:24,911
others.

202
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,820
It's so clear that we're
in some weird phase,

203
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,511
you know,

204
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:33,250
like very few animals I think vary in
size and shape as much as people do.

205
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,360
The only thing that's close,

206
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:37,030
I think his dogs and you know,

207
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,451
by the way,

208
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,190
they don't know where
the fuck dogs come from.

209
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,860
Really don't have a goddamn clue.

210
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,170
Well,

211
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,460
this is one of the things they found out
when they mapped the genome of the dog.

212
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,450
They thought that it was
going to be wolves and a
bunch of different wild canids

213
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,990
and coyotes and all this
different chicken on.

214
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,291
No,

215
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:51,461
no,

216
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:51,581
no,

217
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:51,761
no.

218
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,660
It's all walls.

219
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,673
It's all wove.

220
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,590
All Wolf so that when they just bread it,

221
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,430
just like they've read them now,

222
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,340
they don't have a fucking

223
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,173
clue.

224
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,230
No one has ever been able to
go from wolf to Chihuahua ever.

225
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,910
No one's ever documented,

226
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,091
hey,

227
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm going to take this wolf
and turn it into Chihuahua.

228
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,190
It's one of those things we accept
that we don't understand it.

229
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,390
It's been around for so long.

230
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,640
It's clearly genetic manipulation.

231
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,260
Egypt,

232
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,093
yes,

233
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,031
that cats,

234
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:17,930
we know they had cats.

235
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,741
I think they had dogs,

236
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:22,670
but there's no indication of whether or
not they had the variation of dogs that

237
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,301
we have today.

238
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,520
We have a weird variation,

239
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,360
a little tiny things that are useless.

240
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,751
I mean,

241
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,010
you know cute pets and shit,

242
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,390
but big ones.

243
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,410
They're guard dogs,

244
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,520
work dogs,

245
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,750
dogs for hunting.

246
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,700
So many distinctions.

247
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,451
Arizona.

248
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,620
Just see the wild dogs,

249
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,390
the really,

250
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,223
really,

251
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,410
that's scary shit.

252
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,150
They don't really attack
people that I've seen.

253
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,370
They're just sort of like bare.

254
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,860
There was a story in Georgia a few years
back about some wild dogs that killed a

255
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,550
man.

256
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,060
Really?

257
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,770
Yeah.

258
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,170
Yeah.

259
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,890
I shouldn't do that.

260
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,071
Well,

261
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,904
they get to,

262
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,710
I mean they get to packs and then they
all grow up generation after generation

263
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,401
in the woods.

264
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:55,641
You know,

265
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,730
all you need is a couple of generations
and you're dealing with a fucking killer

266
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,600
animal out there.

267
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,890
That's a scary fucking thing.

268
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:01,810
And they'd take out a dear,

269
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,610
why wouldn't they take out you
if you're alone by yourself?

270
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,850
And there's like 30 of them and
that's how they're traveling.

271
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,333
Like grizzly man.

272
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:08,931
Oh,

273
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:09,764
you finally start.

274
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,130
And that's the same feeling I got.

275
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:11,391
I was like,

276
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:11,661
dude,

277
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,770
if they're eating their young,

278
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,400
what did you make the connection to food?

279
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,593
Awesome.

280
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,540
That was the most ridiculous guy ever.

281
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,440
It's crazy.

282
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,850
I don't understand how
he couldn't see that,

283
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:23,210
but he's like,

284
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,331
oh,

285
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,600
they're eating themselves well hungry.

286
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,840
He was just so gay that he
was just running away from it.

287
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,310
He was running away from the gayness to
the point where he decided to live alone

288
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,710
in the woods with monsters.

289
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,880
Big,

290
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,511
giant,

291
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,320
ridiculous.

292
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,280
They're like rats,

293
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,780
like giant rats sort of bear as well.

294
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:46,070
I'm a peaceful right next to
him and then they just too.

295
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,450
How about the video where he had one
bear who had his back up against a tree?

296
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,130
He was like scratching his back.

297
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,440
So he's standing full up and scratching
his back and he's like fucking feet

298
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,274
tall.

299
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,480
And could you imagine this asshole is
just sleeping in the bushes with a piece

300
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,550
of fabric over his head
for years and years.

301
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,963
Wow.

302
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,301
Yeah,

303
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,260
but will he fucked up as he stayed to la?

304
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,070
He stayed to the point
where they were super,

305
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,180
super desperate.

306
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,960
The those fall bears.

307
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,580
Why do you think he stayed
longer than suicide by bear?

308
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,440
For sure.

309
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,711
Yeah,

310
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,680
he's massively depressed.

311
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,700
That guy was crazy.

312
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,940
If you see how he gets in front of the
camera and starts screaming and the

313
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,010
fucking government bears,

314
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,190
that guy's manic and there's he's,

315
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,630
I think he was trying to commit suicide.

316
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,201
Yeah.

317
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:33,831
In a sense.

318
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,280
Yeah.

319
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,320
He went back when he had nothing else.

320
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,310
That's when he went back.

321
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,360
He went back to the,

322
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
to the Alaska to that,

323
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,860
that area every year.

324
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:41,691
Where Al Yeah,

325
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:43,190
but he didn't go back this late.

326
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,410
We went back in late October
and in November that's
when the bears are going to

327
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,130
sleep.

328
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,240
And so the only bears that are up
are the bears that were unsuccessful.

329
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,660
They didn't know the old ones.

330
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:54,410
They're dying.

331
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,440
And that's what happens man.

332
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,220
They die

333
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,031
and we don't even know.

334
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:57,480
We don't,

335
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,051
we very,

336
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,450
very rarely find bare bones.

337
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,680
It's really kinda interesting.

338
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,491
You know,

339
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,740
bears are massive animals.

340
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,090
One of the babies only just as bear skull,

341
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:09,960
the white,

342
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,650
and they'll probably eat that later and
it wasn't coming back Kilbane within a

343
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:13,700
few days ago.

344
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,533
And I'm like,

345
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,850
well,

346
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,900
they eat their bones.

347
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:16,290
They eat,

348
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,520
they eat their dead bodies.

349
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,070
They the,

350
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,830
the bear that killed this guy,

351
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:24,390
they shot it and killed it and they came
back like two weeks later and it was

352
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,430
just everything gone.

353
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,420
Just a few bones scattered around.

354
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,690
It felt like rib bones or this is
really [inaudible] most of the bones,

355
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,830
they had most of everything.

356
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,150
The chicken at Hardee's there,

357
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,200
weather bears,

358
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,570
man bears are big fucking animals.

359
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,351
You know,

360
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,620
I don't think we can even wrap
our heads around what that is.

361
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,100
It's a big building machine and people
just sleep near him when those two bears

362
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,590
were fighting and the ones shit himself.

363
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,401
Yeah.

364
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,300
How crazy was that?

365
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,070
Great footage?

366
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,610
That was amazing footage.

367
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,391
Amazing footage.

368
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,770
No one else would be
that crazy right there.

369
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,360
And they're really trying
to kill each other.

370
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:55,800
Yeah.

371
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,150
It's an amazing fight.

372
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:00,480
Would always talking about between
these two bears on this like beach,

373
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:00,631
right?

374
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:00,920
He was like,

375
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,320
yeah,

376
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,590
the shore of a lake or
something like that.

377
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,560
We're in a field and lit
or something like that.

378
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,350
Yeah.

379
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,821
Water right.

380
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,654
That scene.

381
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,230
Big scene,

382
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,533
going out,

383
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,120
partying,

384
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,951
trying to bite each other.

385
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:14,760
Like it looks like the death to death
for sure on the eye and ear out.

386
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:14,881
Oh,

387
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,000
they're trying to fuck each other up.

388
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,401
It's over.

389
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,300
Who gets to fuck?

390
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,830
I guess that's what it is,

391
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:20,100
man.

392
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,120
That's how they decide.

393
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
That's how does it
decide who gets to fuck.

394
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,870
That's why I don't
participate in that at bars,

395
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,670
when I see another guy
get involved with a check,

396
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:27,180
I'm heading out.

397
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,391
I'm like,

398
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:27,871
I'm out.

399
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:28,710
I'll see you guys later.

400
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,573
Smart.

401
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,080
That's a healthy way of
one things for a chance.

402
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,993
Goodnight.

403
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,371
Yeah.

404
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,110
And then dudes will get douchey with you.

405
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,010
Like you're like,

406
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,401
Whoa,

407
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,210
settle down.

408
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,110
I don't even know you.

409
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:40,850
You're not even,

410
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,180
we were so used to all be,

411
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:42,511
you know,

412
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,950
men out here having fun.

413
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,843
They're not really angry.

414
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,170
Really snapping.

415
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,470
Yeah,

416
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,790
you're really turning on me like that.

417
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,900
You're the problem dude.

418
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,501
You know,

419
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:49,601
if,

420
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:51,330
if the world was filled with cool people,

421
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,420
partying would be the shit you know of.

422
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,250
The world was filled with people
who could hold their liquor,

423
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,170
keep their weed under wraps.

424
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:58,921
And when you went out,

425
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,440
everybody was cool and everybody
was friendly to everybody.

426
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,274
You don't have to worry,

427
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,720
but it's those fucking few douche bags.

428
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,820
Well you like this
fucking queer knowing me,

429
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,690

430
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,970
Has anyone ever called you a fucking Jew?

431
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,140
Angrily?

432
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,480
I don't know about angrily online.

433
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:18,810
Yeah,

434
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,643

435
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,960

447
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:36,564
right?

448
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,321
Are you familiar?

449
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,220
Did he warn you?

450
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,380
Did he give you ample
opportunity to get away

451
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,050
and lost her laughing?

452
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,990
I was in the parking lot in a,

453
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,720
in West hills of all places
and I go to the parking lot.

454
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:53,920
It was a truck there with these white
skulls on it and I at it and it's like

455
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,760
some shit written and gothic
letter and it says white power,

456
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,710
white power.

457
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,720
Just guy just had this on his car.

458
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,500
Is it a movie?

459
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,110
Wow.

460
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,610
Ooh,

461
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:03,920
no,

462
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,271
no,

463
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:04,481
no,

464
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:04,631
no,

465
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:04,781
no.

466
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,270
It was just out doing it out.

467
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,720
Yup.

468
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,780
It was on the back windows of his truck.

469
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,850
It's a white power and I was like,

470
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:13,960
whoa dude.

471
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,250
It's funny though living in the city
because there is movie prop cars I see all

472
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,750
the time cause I live in Burbank.

473
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,640
I saw like an action news car.

474
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,600
The other one like Whoa,

475
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:23,200
that's a,

476
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,330
that's a really cheesy news van.

477
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:27,830
And it was just from
the new screen movie or

478
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,690
fake newspapers.

479
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,220
Yeah,

480
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,340
where the news,

481
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,720
they've been pull up with
a satellite on the roof.

482
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,810
Yeah.

483
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,590
It's funny how,

484
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,880
I mean all those action newspeople like
if you watch like any of those action

485
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,250
newspeople are any of those
e entertainment people,

486
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,780
they're just interchangeable.

487
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,490
To me they're just,

488
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,610
they're just a delivery device.

489
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,580
They're not even a human being turned on
every once in a while a while and I'll

490
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,350
see a new girl.

491
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,060
Oh she's pretty and they,

492
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,910
here we come.

493
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,300
Brad Pitt says Jeff ran us,

494
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:03,961
didn't have stuff,

495
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:06,400
still remained friends
after all these years.

496
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,490
And it's the same human being that's
really low frequency projection devices

497
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,250
that are disguised as
human beings and they just,

498
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,020
they're the same person that hired that,

499
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,550
that rock band guy once.

500
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,120
Yes.

501
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,260
Mark McGwire Martin.

502
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,711
No,

503
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:20,901
no,

504
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:20,961
no,

505
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:21,161
no.

506
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,430
It's a guy from Mark Mcgrath.

507
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,430
Mark Mcgrath showed us
a little about sports.

508
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:26,920
It goes pretty sure I'm right.

509
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:28,941
That guy.

510
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:29,111
Yeah,

511
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:29,801
he was doing,

512
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:34,300
he was doing that and now he hosts of
terrible fucking song show where they have

513
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,010
to worse.

514
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,031
It's weird.

515
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,864
He's weird.

516
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,430
He's weird because I'm like,

517
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,080
this guy's a fucking rock star.

518
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,400
Like why are you not out?

519
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,360
Why are you doing what I do?

520
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,203
Dude,

521
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,900
you didn't my lowly hosting genre.

522
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,790
Is it your fucking like star?

523
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,910
He was sugar ran,

524
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,700
you know like God damn man.

525
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:56,701
Not that bad was bad ass that I just
want to fly song everyone loved song the

526
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,140
song of the summer.

527
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,290
That's a jam and song man.

528
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,510
Whenever and every time I hear that song,

529
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,490
I mean I don't know too
much of their other music,

530
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,810
but anytime I hear that song,

531
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,070
it was one big head.

532
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,150
I feel like just telling them,

533
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:10,451
listen,

534
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,000
if you can do that once for that song,

535
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,350
you can do more of that.

536
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,820
Please do more of that.

537
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,960
That song was awesome.

538
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,670
Why are you hosting these shows?

539
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:18,850
Man?

540
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,780
I sat a couple of hits,

541
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:20,110
right?

542
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,160
It's kind of being on the road.

543
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,650
We wouldn't all remember
the name Sugar Ray.

544
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:23,440
It was just one.

545
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,280
I don't know man.

546
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,540
I think for a lot of people,

547
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,850
sometimes it's just a different
opportunity to make money.

548
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,440
You don't have to rely on other people.

549
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,400
You might hear music anyway right now it
might be he doesn't want to rely on the

550
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,450
rest of the people in the band.

551
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:35,330
Sometimes his band,

552
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,610
she has can't keep it together.

553
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,420
You know,

554
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,440
they get,

555
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,390
I mean even Keith Richards and Mick Jagger
had ego problems like Keith Richards

556
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,850
just talk shit about
Mick Jagger in his book.

557
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,684
Like,

558
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,733
dude,

559
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,830
you guys have been boys or 70 years you
gotta Talk Shit and your book free son,

560
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,913
you know,

561
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,581
be honest.

562
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,414
Like screech.

563
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,381
That's what he said.

564
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:57,740
I heard.

565
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Let's ruin it for gang bangs on fucking
sets all over the world screech ruined.

566
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:03,860
It was a big mouth.

567
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,790
Got To be honest about these gang bangs.

568
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,240
Now you know,

569
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,200
I know they're like Mario Lopez
can't get his freak on anymore.

570
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,011
You know,

571
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,890
let it do get his freak on screech.

572
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:16,724
Exactly.

573
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,190
Fucking weak ass bitch at sugar way.

574
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
I'd come into the comments
through a few times,

575
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,710
is he cool?

576
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:21,891
Cool.

577
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,270
I don't member sit there and laugh.

578
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,470
Doesn't call attention to himself.

579
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,240
He didn't really want
to fly the whole time.

580
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,070
I've heard him on stern before.

581
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:28,241
He's,

582
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,660
he's a cool dude for sure.

583
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
That's why I don't get it.

584
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,240
Like why are you doing what?

585
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,074
I could do

586
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,830
rock star family.

587
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,861
He might have a family.

588
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:36,870
It might be something like,

589
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,391
hey look,

590
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,550
I'd rather just fucking sure.

591
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,180
Yeah.

592
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,410
I think for a lot of people too,

593
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:41,861
like I said,

594
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,930
it's hard to work with a group of people.

595
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,010
Ho thing is really easy.

596
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,320
I came show to what's
are a couple in a day.

597
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,940
It's easy as fuck.

598
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,871
It's so easy.

599
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:50,704
It's stealing.

600
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,451
That's what I like.

601
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,100
Is this doing?

602
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,100
She does this show caught expose and
they play two a day and it's like I

603
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:01,450
recorded on my DVR and there's
like 30 we've got to get her back.

604
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,510
Was getting accused of not having girls.

605
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,590
I just saw her the other day.

606
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,830
Roy Destroys hilarious retards
cause it's the same day by the way.

607
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't you do it again?

608
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,190
I was at Walmart and Walmart has this
tee shirt sections where it's like the

609
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,330
cool kid tee shirts.

610
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,380
Like it's Elmo.

611
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:21,520
It's like angry birds.

612
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,660
It's like for people like,

613
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,550
you know people who buy,

614
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,384
right?

615
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,231
Walmart,

616
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:26,590
Walmart.

617
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,030
So this is really weird
that they do ronic right?

618
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,560
Yeah.

619
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,920
They have Special Olympics
shirts now in the middle.

620
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,330
And I almost bought one.

621
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:34,810
But I was like,

622
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,690
that's rude because I would
be wearing that as a joke.

623
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,171
And I'm like,

624
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:38,950
wait a second,

625
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,970
this is in Walmart.

626
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,660
Wait a second.

627
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,750
This is supposed to boast.

628
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,480
That's fucked up.

629
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,140
Whoa.

630
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,620
So yeah,

631
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,390
go to your Walmart and buy them quick.

632
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:47,290
Take photos of it.

633
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,190
Someone's going to find out about that.

634
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,210
And this could get ugly.

635
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,143
I bought to,

636
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm leaving as soon as
we get off the air here.

637
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:57,370
I know I'm running to
Walmart before they pull it.

638
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,020
I need to get that just to bring it.

639
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,360
I want,

640
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,680
I need to wear it on the show.

641
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:01,890
We need to all wear it next show.

642
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,250
All right,

643
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,581
we're gonna,

644
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,510
we're gonna take them off.

645
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,670
Send a picture at Walmart.

646
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,713
How dare you?

647
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,921
I'm saying it right now.

648
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:09,230
No.

649
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,610
How dare you fucking Weirdos okay with it.

650
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,240
Yeah.

651
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,073
I think it's funny.

652
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,711
You know,

653
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,060
it used to be okay to say retard.

654
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,240
I'm a little upset that you can't
say retarded anymore and you know,

655
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,790
and without people thinking that
you're brutally insensitive when,

656
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,870
what do I mean?

657
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,550
Has Our society really truly evolved or
they're just these hot button words now

658
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,840
that people choose to act on.

659
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,101
Because when you know,

660
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,180
when you're calling someone a retard,

661
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,010
I'm not saying you have down syndrome.

662
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,630
I'm not saying you have a disease.

663
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,470
You have down syndrome.

664
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,850
I'm saying you're retarded.

665
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,421
You're,

666
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:38,631
you're,

667
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:41,600
you're fucking slow to retard.

668
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,590
It's to slow down.

669
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,090
You know what I heard recently what they
just changed in New York that stands

670
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:46,731
out to Starbucks,

671
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:51,731
they changed the gender biased
bathrooms to have male and female is um,

672
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,110
whenever the brood is rude to run,

673
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,851
whatever,

674
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:57,930
it's segregating,

675
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,461
not segregate,

676
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,390
whatever it's mean to transgender people.

677
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,920
Yeah.

678
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,930
Cause women are having male or bathrooms
or 50 times where it's thinking,

679
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,600
why don't I understand that we should
be able to all shit right next to each

680
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,550
other and you guys can lick girls seat.

681
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,330
Well there are dealers,

682
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,440
they're all single stalls anyway.

683
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,370
Just make them bathrooms.

684
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,233
Who Cares?

685
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,960
Hmm.

686
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,990
I think a lot of dirty
fucking men sitting there,

687
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,780
stinky fat asses their Harry acids down
on the seats that they're going to have.

688
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:22,614
We don't have the trust part.

689
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,750
A little petite shaved baton,

690
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,830
little pink and peach like
beautiful Starbucks keeps it clean.

691
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,370
You could get unlucky dude.

692
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,490
You could totally roll snake eyes and
walk into Starbucks to a fucking shit task

693
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,343
trophy,

694
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,050
a shit splatter catastrophe.

695
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,270
You know you're adding in coffee with,

696
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,120
you know people that are eating
like fucking cupcakes and shit.

697
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,860
That's just like lightening rods.

698
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,451
That's like,

699
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:50,470
so it's like lighting a fuse
inside your asshole have,

700
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:50,950
you know,

701
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,160
because one of them like Starbucks
where the toilets just like that floppy

702
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:54,994
handle or that

703
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,303
Starbucks.

704
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,801
Yeah,

705
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,490
it won't catch and you got to lift
the lid up if it's one of those,

706
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,240
those,

707
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,220
those are dangerous though
in public restaurants.

708
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,120
If I actually lift the lid off yourself
because then people do the upper decker

709
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,820
where they shit and in
the upper part of this

710
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,090
toilet tassels people,

711
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:14,924
I grew up with,

712
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,060
everybody in Boston save
it just for those moments.

713
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,170
It's not a fucking goof.

714
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
C'Mon man is listen,

715
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,260
when it's really cold,

716
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,340
you need some shit to do.

717
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,900
You get bored groups that he took it,

718
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,300
he took a shit in a coffee mug and put
it on top of the day on top of play.

719
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,270
What was it?

720
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,380
A gas thing,

721
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,710
I guess they should know and he just
sit across the street and look at people

722
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:37,544
all day long.

723
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,020
Just stare at them for attending.

724
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,170
Awesome.

725
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,631
You know why?

726
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,464
So I'm sweating.

727
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,610
Re is a nice guy and we like them.

728
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,160
And then it's also funny whenever
someone shits on something,

729
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:46,994
it's just funny.

730
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,893
I was fucking,

731
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,700
I was watching this occupy Wall Street
thing and this guy shitting on a police

732
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:53,534
car.

733
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,560
But the way he's doing
these like so you know.

734
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,300
Yeah cause it's like smearing
all over is all laid back.

735
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:04,301
I mean he's like squeezing his ass of
his police car and he shitting all over

736
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,940
himself and I'm like this is like
the worst way to do that ever.

737
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:08,121
No,

738
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:09,530
you just supposed to get on top.

739
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,870
When I read the shining
down on it and this was it,

740
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,610
I read the headline before
I clicked and I'm like,

741
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,020
I already pictured in my head,

742
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,380
oh he's probably shitting on the wad,

743
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,950
healed or squatting and I got a hood,

744
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,740
a Puma pose and then I saw
him leaning against it.

745
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:21,980
I'm like,

746
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,980
what fucking assholes using the car as
a Douchey Aa to world and all it like a

747
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:28,821
Shitty Douche.

748
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:29,710
It's all getting explode.

749
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,190
He's wiping his ass.

750
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,140
He Shit in his ass over the car.

751
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,640
I'll just have my girlfriend spit it out.

752
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,330
That guy must have stunk for a long time.

753
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,811
See,

754
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,220
that makes me nauseous.

755
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,610
The smell of other people's shit is
the only thing that gets me anymore.

756
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
Since my time on fear factor,

757
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,280
puke doesn't make me nauseous.

758
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,040
Like I could be in a nightclub and on.

759
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,270
I'll throw up right in front
of me and I don't even flinch.

760
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,790
You ate a bug the other day,

761
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,840
one of the like e entertainment people
or something like that and he wanted to

762
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,050
do,

763
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,431
I saw it.

764
00:20:58,431 --> 00:20:58,711
I said,

765
00:20:58,711 --> 00:20:59,041
dude,

766
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,210
this is just protein.

767
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:01,350
If we were living in,

768
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,681
you know,

769
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:02,790
10,000 years ago,

770
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,880
this would be something you would
be happy to eat this bar food.

771
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,350
Thinking about that video on your phone.

772
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,480
Really just thinking about it
and then we'll be on my phone.

773
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,320
We can't talk about it though.

774
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,170
Some day we will someday we will,

775
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:13,831
ladies and gentlemen,

776
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:16,860
but right now due to contractual
obligations that I have with fear factor,

777
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,800
we have to keep some shit on the
raps when that gets on the air.

778
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:20,011
Dude,

779
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:20,641
when there's,

780
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:24,660
there's a bunch of shit that we did the
season that was sold way more over the

781
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:26,340
top than anything we ever did before.

782
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:26,551
Hot.

783
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,270
It's going to vary.

784
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,170
We were just sitting there,

785
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:28,621
standing there,

786
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,820
shaking each other's heads like,

787
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,170
what the fuck are we doing?

788
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,220
And you should've seen sales phase.

789
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:37,160
I should sal Sal's comedy club.

790
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:39,230
And he just sat there
like he saw a calm goat.

791
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah.

792
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,310
Like a ghost man.

793
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,143
I'm sorry,

794
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,070
the bug was nothing.

795
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,570
It didn't taste bad at all.

796
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,460
What kind of bug was it?

797
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:50,871
Who was a,

798
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:51,390
um,

799
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,920
an African cave dwelling.

800
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:53,754
Spider.

801
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,803
It's terrifying.

802
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,750
There's ones with the
tons of crazy long lost.

803
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,150
Yeah.

804
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,480
It's basically a giant alive,

805
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,343
crabbing,

806
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,870
shortness.

807
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,281
Your first,

808
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,090
how big?

809
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:03,440
Well,

810
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,231
it's spread out.

811
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:06,870
It's about that big and
what you do smell it up.

812
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,201
Yeah,

813
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,770
I grabbed that bitch by the center
and just stuff it in there right away.

814
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,970
Just by the legs.

815
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,740
All smash that motherfucker quick.

816
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,390
I smashed them up quick.

817
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,010
But it's a lot of chewing,

818
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,311
you know.

819
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,440
But it didn't really taste that bad.

820
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,981
And,

821
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:20,460
um,

822
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:20,881
but you know,

823
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,670
I knew that you new it's been okay.

824
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,491
It's been okay.

825
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:24,324
This won't hurt me.

826
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,870
Yeah.

827
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,550
People have been eating
those things forever.

828
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,060
Humans have been eating bugs
forever to the tastes good.

829
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:30,540
And anyway,

830
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,090
no,

831
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,930
I appreciate that.

832
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,290
It's,

833
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,001
it's not bad.

834
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,420
I could look those giant
Madagascar hissing cockroaches.

835
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,630
I had one of those in the show too and uh,

836
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,080
there's a lot that's gross and eating
those things but it's also a good form of

837
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:43,830
protein.

838
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,270
If you're really starving to death,

839
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,470
you would totally eat that.

840
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,600
I think the grossest wants out
of this big green with a garden

841
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,570
tomato hornworms one of those too.

842
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,690
They just exploded,

843
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,370
just pouring out.

844
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,270
It was gross.

845
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,600
It was really hard to drink.

846
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,601
Really hard to do.

847
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:00,950
Like what,

848
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,230
what did that taste like?

849
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,280
Real bitter and it tasted like
you shouldn't be eating it like,

850
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,870
like nature's trying to warn you,

851
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,190
which I was assuming they are.

852
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,061
I mean I'm not,

853
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm not into acquiring any
tastes if I don't like it.

854
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,230
Initially I don't like it.

855
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:14,801
You know,

856
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,390
like the idea,

857
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,230
like caviar was always a weird one to me.

858
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,650
Like it's an acquired taste.

859
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:19,330
Do you like it?

860
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:19,840
Oh,

861
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,673
it's a choir.

862
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,700
Like what does that mean?

863
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,880
You're going to spend like 5,000
bucks for something that's acquired.

864
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,650
It's more expensive,

865
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,110
but I'm getting into this
to enjoy some stupid eggs,

866
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,600
but some weird ritualistic thing almost.

867
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,130
It's like,

868
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,410
you know,

869
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:35,661
you're,

870
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:38,670
you're getting eggs of this
animal that's very rare.

871
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,311
Look,

872
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:44,311
you get to crush it's babies before
they ever it on your cracker.

873
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,070
Fishing with David Taylor

874
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,020
in Alaska and we cut up one of the
fishes and all these things in there and

875
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,361
David took,

876
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:50,751
what's this?

877
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,830
And the guy's like eggs and he's like,

878
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,640
is that caviar?

879
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,330
Can I eat it?

880
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,960
And this guy was like,

881
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,070
you.

882
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,241
I mean,

883
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,430
if you want David,

884
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:56,810
just start eating more and more of it.

885
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,910
Every time we call it pregnant salmon,

886
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:00,410
he would just eat more and
more of it until the veteran.

887
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,244
He was like,

888
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,431
oh,

889
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,264
I have to fill up now.

890
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,190
He was so nauseous from
eating all that sand.

891
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,000
You're not supposed to
eat fucking a pound of,

892
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,490
of warm salmon eggs.

893
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,140
Not,

894
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,973
I don't think so.

895
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,993
It happens.

896
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,370
You barred from actually on the open sea.

897
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,103
Wow.

898
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
They'd be grilled on the beat on the,

899
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,361
on the boat.

900
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:17,890
It was so funny.

901
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,700
It look good food.

902
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,593
What does he think?

903
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,610
He was just eating it
because it was caviar.

904
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,810
Not that it was good or,

905
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,050
yeah,

906
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,350
he was like,

907
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,471
oh,

908
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:24,861
it's free.

909
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,520
I should get this as
much as I can right now.

910
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:27,531
Fresh,

911
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,100
fresh.

912
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,671
Is He German?

913
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:31,290
That guy is comes from German
descent or English I think.

914
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,940
I think there's an issue with salmon.

915
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,740
You have to be careful with salmon.

916
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,230
You're not even really
supposed to eat Sushi.

917
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:40,180
If you talk to some quote unquote experts.

918
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:40,631
Yeah,

919
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:41,710
that's fresh water.

920
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,570
Especially salmon because
salmon is its potential.

921
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:46,000
It has a potential for parasites.

922
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,871
It's not likely,

923
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,130
but it's got a potential.

924
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,960
You don't know.

925
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,070
You know most of the farm raised stuff,

926
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:51,850
you know,

927
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,270
I just,

928
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,600
I have it on the head with farm raised.

929
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,811
Those are,

930
00:24:58,811 --> 00:24:59,760
they taste better man.

931
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,730
It's wild.

932
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,280
You know when you,

933
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,470
this is where it weirds me out.

934
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,360
Farm raised is like pink and you know
when they put it in a store they die.

935
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:08,410
That shit like diet,

936
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:08,920
pay,

937
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,400
die,

938
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,920
make it look like a healthy wild salmon.

939
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,860
But it literally becomes such a bit.

940
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,920
And the only way I know again
gets like it loses its soul.

941
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,783
Yeah.

942
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,810
And that crazy,

943
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,050
the color drops out and it tastes worse.

944
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,291
Yeah.

945
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,160
It tastes worse.

946
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,480
What's not worthy?

947
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:29,350
It's not as worthy to catch that goes
along with my theory that things that can

948
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:31,060
get away real quick or better for you.

949
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,590
So I fishes so good for you.

950
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,240
So fucking hard to catch.

951
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,250
You know dear dear is great for you.

952
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,780
So hard to catch the
[inaudible] or the other,

953
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,590
they're so quick.

954
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,960
They have what they have is so good.

955
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,230
It's easy to catch you.

956
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,020
They run away real fast.

957
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,310
It's so good that they develop nature
gave them a chance and that chance as you

958
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:50,830
get to be faster than the
people so that they can't,

959
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,230
you know,

960
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,230
just being able to be out and not being
depressed cause cause cause I'm a farm

961
00:25:57,911 --> 00:26:00,700
raised cows tastes better
than grain fed cows,

962
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:00,940
right?

963
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,690
Yes they do.

964
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,650
Well it's a different taste.

965
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,523
They can sort of be out.

966
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,030
Yeah.

967
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,760
I buy a grass fed beef whenever I can.

968
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,570
And uh,

969
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,620
it's a different taste.

970
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,480
It's like a game animal almost.

971
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:11,314
It's really weird.

972
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,210
I'm kind of exaggerating,

973
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:13,960
but it's a,

974
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,501
it's different.

975
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:14,951
It's way,

976
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:15,191
way,

977
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:15,821
way leaner.

978
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:17,350
So you have to be real
careful when you cook it.

979
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,790
You can't cook it for very long,

980
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,110
you know,

981
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,910
really an overcook it big on,

982
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,200
really dry on the grass fed.

983
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,191
It's delicious.

984
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:24,341
Well,

985
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:26,200
he's a crossfit fanatic Eddie,

986
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,170
if to our buddies,

987
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,130
like in crazy shape or I
suppose he's always like,

988
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,840
try to get me to squeeze
your shoulders and shit.

989
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,480
Fucking crossfit.

990
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,360
I'm talking about his dead lifts
and feel my fucking shoulders.

991
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,760
When those people do that at the same,

992
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,100
it's pretty much you're telling me
about your fantasy football team.

993
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,521
Well,

994
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:42,870
you know,

995
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,703
no,

996
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,340
I totally

997
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,620
see what is coming from me.

998
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,540
People think that it's kind of,

999
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,374
um,

1000
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,711
you know,

1001
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:50,250
it's kind of,

1002
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,510
there's kind of a gross thing
about worrying about what
your body looks like and

1003
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,780
being really into your body.

1004
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,940
There's something gross about it,

1005
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:57,540
you know?

1006
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,710
And yeah,

1007
00:26:58,711 --> 00:26:59,680
it is a little vague,

1008
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,320
but that said,

1009
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,310
isn't it more fun to have like
what's essentially a super body?

1010
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,450
Isn't it more fun to have a body that
can do all kinds of crazy shit that

1011
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:10,790
already regular body can't do.

1012
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,761
So when you know,

1013
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,350
Eddie's in there dead lifting and shit
and I'm putting these big lifts in and

1014
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,960
doing these crazy kettlebell
workouts and shit,

1015
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,010
you just start feeling like,

1016
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,730
wow,

1017
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,770
I feel fucking vibrant.

1018
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,820
You know,

1019
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,740
my body feels good like this.

1020
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,041
You know,

1021
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,580
I love the fact that he
can go in there and have a,

1022
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:31,950
a ferocious workout and
feel fantastic afterwards,

1023
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,160
you know,

1024
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,840
so it's just,

1025
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,673
you know,

1026
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,431
it,

1027
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:36,264
uh,

1028
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,650
it just gets a little work.

1029
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,710
It is a lot of laughter.

1030
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,913
A lot of,

1031
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,580
I wish I could just get that

1032
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,640
they just opened this gym
gym up that been going to,

1033
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,100
or a once in a while curves,

1034
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,450
curves for women and they let me go in
there if I talk it and now it's right

1035
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,170
next to,

1036
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,410
uh,

1037
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,450
this race or this fast food place I go to.

1038
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,070
And,

1039
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,590
uh,

1040
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,690
all the beefy guys come in there.

1041
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,810
And what's so weird is this one guy came
in there and he looked like you looked

1042
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:01,644
at him and you're like,

1043
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,880
that is amazing.

1044
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,481
Like his,

1045
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:03,900
his,

1046
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,800
his structure.

1047
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:07,140
He looks like a real GI Joe Guy.

1048
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,970
Like that looks like a Gi Joe Guy.

1049
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,780
And then he got his food and he was like
getting Sawso from the salsa bar and he

1050
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:15,150
was putting in his bag and
he folded like the bag down.

1051
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:19,410
So like anger or not angry
like it had be folded,

1052
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:24,120
like all the lines had to be like all
the lines had to be straight and stuff

1053
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:24,481
like that.

1054
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:25,350
And then this guy goes,

1055
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,370
oh here's one more,

1056
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,121
something like that.

1057
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:29,730
And he just got this mad look
like he was like unfolding it,

1058
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,810
having to put it in there.

1059
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:31,411
And it was like,

1060
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,910
we are both looking at it going,

1061
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,571
wow,

1062
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,740
that guy's going to emerge.

1063
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,023
Yeah.

1064
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,370
My friend was PSI in college.

1065
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,660
This Ethiopian guy used to work out
and at the top of his lifts we go,

1066
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:52,250
I'm going to fuck somebody up.

1067
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,950
Like getting into bar fights.

1068
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,963
I love doing it.

1069
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,583
That's what kept them going.

1070
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,640
Did you see that light getting in the bus?

1071
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,920
So he would pick fights with people?

1072
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,970
It starts at not hard and be like,

1073
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:03,771
you would have to fight back.

1074
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:04,604
But

1075
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,830
have you talked about
the steroids documentary?

1076
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,431
Bigger,

1077
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:07,851
stronger,

1078
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:08,684
faster.

1079
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,400
Smilier I haven't seen it,

1080
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:11,061
so no.

1081
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:11,241
You know,

1082
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:11,811
I never watched,

1083
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:13,130
so I watched like little clips of it.

1084
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,300
I actually own it on DVD,

1085
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,440
but it never bothered watching it.

1086
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,131
It's not bad.

1087
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:16,351
It's,

1088
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,330
it's pretty interesting.

1089
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:17,511
It,

1090
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:18,021
it would,

1091
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,490
I didn't know though is like,

1092
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,321
well also they should,

1093
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,290
there's cows on there.

1094
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,340
This steroid cows.

1095
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,723
Well they are,

1096
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,060
yeah.

1097
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,140
It's not really a steroid.

1098
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:29,880
Now there's this thing that
happens to certain cows where the,

1099
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,150
uh,

1100
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,140
it's a myostatin inhibitor and it
goes wrong and when it goes wrong,

1101
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,210
they grow like three times.

1102
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:39,200
The regular [inaudible] muscle dude,

1103
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,670
the dog's Huston.

1104
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,350
No,

1105
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,010
it's just from,

1106
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,090
from breeding there's somehow
or another their genetics,

1107
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:45,281
you know,

1108
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:45,881
I've seen those,

1109
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,090
those gigantic house like three
times the size of a person.

1110
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,380
And we were seeing the dogs too.

1111
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,790
There's a whippet it happens too,

1112
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,900
but specifically to whip.

1113
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:56,680
It's for some reason
whippets are very slight dog,

1114
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,540
very fast.

1115
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,710
It's fairly big,

1116
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,330
but I mean it's not a tiny done but tall,

1117
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:01,671
but it's,

1118
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:01,991
yeah,

1119
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,400
it's a thin dog.

1120
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,310
But these whippets that have
this myostatin inhibitor issue.

1121
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,560
Fucking swole.

1122
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,730
Like captain America,

1123
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,050
like the Hulk,

1124
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,640
like ridiculous.

1125
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:13,600
Like you would swear.

1126
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:14,500
It's photo-shopped.

1127
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,090
There's photos of 'em online.

1128
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,220
I'll find one for you just
because you need to peek at it.

1129
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,880
And it's just the weirdest fucking thing.

1130
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,960
How do you spell whippets?

1131
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,910
The way I used to do them,

1132
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,050
they were WBA

1133
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,530
PP maybe.

1134
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,403
Yeah,

1135
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,350
maybe.

1136
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,560
Do you have a really good cracker?

1137
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,570
Did you always buy like
a cheap plastic one?

1138
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,140
Whatever it gonna be,

1139
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,670
Simon.

1140
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,020
I got like this nice
chrome one from wireless.

1141
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:38,911
Yeah.

1142
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:39,131
Yeah.

1143
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:42,550
They used to sell them on how to
take a look at this real quick.

1144
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,800
You just have to see this because
it doesn't even seem real.

1145
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,540
Look in his eyes doesn't,

1146
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,760
oh,

1147
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,990
that looks like a famous actor.

1148
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:50,824
Credible.

1149
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,890
Is that incredible for folks?

1150
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,570
For folks who don't know what this is,

1151
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:56,740
just look up weapons.

1152
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,270
Wipp I think it's p,

1153
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:58,600
p,

1154
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:58,781
t,

1155
00:30:58,781 --> 00:30:59,111
t,

1156
00:30:59,111 --> 00:30:59,560
s,

1157
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,393
whatever it was,

1158
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:00,851
what?

1159
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:01,401
Look up whip.

1160
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:01,511
It's,

1161
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,070
you'll find it.

1162
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,560
It'll,

1163
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:02,900
it's,

1164
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,020
it's dummy proof the Internet these days.

1165
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,550
It'll offer you suggestions,

1166
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,530
but weapons on steroids.

1167
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:09,041
If you look at it,

1168
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:09,611
you'll find this,

1169
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:10,900
this poor dog with this,

1170
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:11,200
uh,

1171
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,170
this defect that comes from just a part.

1172
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,130
It's just as for some reason it
happens more commonly with weapons.

1173
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:19,120
I read it explained,

1174
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:20,440
but I don't remember the explanation.

1175
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,820
But essentially this myostatin inhibitor
issue just gives them this incredible

1176
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:25,660
amount of muscle.

1177
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,160
Like the dog looks like
something out of a cartoon.

1178
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,720
It looks like something out of.

1179
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:32,290
Um,

1180
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,680
did you see the Hawk not,

1181
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,350
never saw him to fucking one with Eric
Bana was the shit with Nick naulty and

1182
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:38,541
uh,

1183
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:39,520
the dogs,

1184
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,151
they had these,

1185
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,950
these crazy dogs that were infected,

1186
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:42,401
but the hulk,

1187
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,500
Sam know dogs are turned to help dogs.

1188
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,150
Oh No.

1189
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:45,880
When they got mad,

1190
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,150
yeah,

1191
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,140
the dogs would get mad.

1192
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Who'd come hope dogs and they were fucking
ridiculously awesome and hot dogs in

1193
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:53,010
the hallway.

1194
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,820
He got in a fight.

1195
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:53,991
Oh,

1196
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:54,231
okay.

1197
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,140
They were going to walk up and epic.

1198
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:56,861
Dude,

1199
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:57,461
it was awesome.

1200
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:01,180
But now went back moment in three d
special effects really when they were

1201
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,630
regular dogs with a cool,

1202
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,450
fun.

1203
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:03,670
No,

1204
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,890
they knew what was up for the bad guy,

1205
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:06,230
bro.

1206
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,300
They were working for the bad guy,

1207
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,310
let it rolled.

1208
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,900
He jacked him with the hulk
serum and fucking and say,

1209
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:12,581
that's not real.

1210
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:14,110
If it was you could jack with a hotel.

1211
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,130
They would just be mayhem.

1212
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,000
It wouldn't know how to attack for you
unless you were trained killer dogs

1213
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,510
already.

1214
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,100
But why would the dog listened
to you once it becomes,

1215
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,520
yeah,

1216
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,770
it would just do whatever it wants
to come and listen and you stupid.

1217
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:24,610
We just do mayhem.

1218
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,060
Oh No.

1219
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,893
Oh

1220
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:27,761
yeah.

1221
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:31,240
He would just bark and you would go
flying across the room just from the,

1222
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,074
the bark,

1223
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,490
like the transformers would do that.

1224
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:34,181
The evil transport.

1225
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:37,000
What to do that just to create Alex,

1226
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,040
but I know two dogs,

1227
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,040
they try so hard with

1228
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,640
the hulk movie.

1229
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,350
Did they just Redo it
with different people?

1230
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:42,910
Hey,

1231
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,720
the Hawk is for sale right now,

1232
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:45,554
by the way.

1233
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,110
Yeah.

1234
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,760
And they,

1235
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,830
they're selling all these like real props,

1236
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,660
like the iron man,

1237
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:52,490
like best and stuff like that.

1238
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:54,260
And one of the things with the whole head,

1239
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,910
I tap out way before we really,

1240
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm not that Geeky.

1241
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,253
Yeah.

1242
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,600
But they were like
saying the price is like,

1243
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,480
it's so far it price had
been around in the thousands,

1244
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,750
like one thousand two thousand dollars.

1245
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:02,961
I'm like,

1246
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:03,794
wow.

1247
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,890
Can you imagine coming in and go into
your living room having this glass case

1248
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:08,360
with the Hawk hedge is
sitting there going,

1249
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,920
I have any bad,

1250
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,090
I would be pretty bad ass.

1251
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,000
The original holds.

1252
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,833
What's his name?

1253
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,320
Uh,

1254
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,570
I think it was from the first frig.

1255
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:14,870
No,

1256
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,710
there's this from that one.

1257
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:15,890
No,

1258
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,011
no,

1259
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,170
I think it's from the first movie.

1260
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,210
It is a thing.

1261
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,330
Is it something there's

1262
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,210
no,

1263
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,421
no,

1264
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:23,680
it's,

1265
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,200
it's,

1266
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,590
I dunno.

1267
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,170
I'll show you what,

1268
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:25,491
I'll try it.

1269
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:28,100
Pro Lou Ferrigno was
told me to stop smoking.

1270
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,061
He told you?

1271
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:29,240
Yeah.

1272
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,600
I took,

1273
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,500
I took an acting class with his wife once
a long time ago and we're all standing

1274
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,110
outside of that was waiting
around during a break or for them,

1275
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,460
you know,

1276
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,960
so we were all smoking and he was
sitting in the car waiting for,

1277
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,310
took to come out.

1278
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,383
He's like,

1279
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,130
you shouldn't smoke.

1280
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:43,840
Whoa.

1281
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,280
And I was like,

1282
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,611
yeah,

1283
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:44,971
I know.

1284
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:45,271
It's,

1285
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:46,081
it's prepared for me.

1286
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:46,620
I know.

1287
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,330
And then when I turned
back around and my friend,

1288
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,260
and then I turned back around to see him
after like a minute and he's still just

1289
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:53,400
staring at me and he goes,

1290
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:53,780
uh,

1291
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,040
surgery shouldn't smoke.

1292
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:55,940
And I was like,

1293
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,151
yes,

1294
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:56,984
sir.

1295
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,191
Put it out.

1296
00:33:58,191 --> 00:33:58,430
No,

1297
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,190
he just said it well,

1298
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,023
more forceful.

1299
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,003
Wow.

1300
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,300
Said it more serious.

1301
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:02,661
And I was like,

1302
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:03,650
I'm not taking a chance.

1303
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,270
It's because so big.

1304
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,260
He's Lou Ferrigno.

1305
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,680
Yeah.

1306
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,270
He was on the mantra
when I was hosting it,

1307
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:08,690
really?

1308
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:08,901
And,

1309
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:09,500
uh,

1310
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,550
I met him and I said,

1311
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:11,061
hey Lou,

1312
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:11,690
I'm Joe.

1313
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,560
Thank you very much.

1314
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:16,430
It's really an honor to meet shows or
always a huge friend ever since back in

1315
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,480
the pumping iron days.

1316
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,314
And it's not.

1317
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,071
That goes all.

1318
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,470
Thanks.

1319
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,600
Some really excited.

1320
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,610
Do you work out to you?

1321
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,593
That's what you said.

1322
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,493
You work out.

1323
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,513
I'm like son

1324
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,461
do.

1325
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:33,461
I worked at a fucking kid that was
born with this motherfucker right here.

1326
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,761
Come on kid.

1327
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,980
What if you were born of my that
you'd have such a horrible life.

1328
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,983
Ridiculous.

1329
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:38,990
Just giant.

1330
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,630
Make us in your arms and kids
that you see once in a while.

1331
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:42,464
That's ship photos.

1332
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,420
Really muscular kids.

1333
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,150
It was just so surreal
talking to Lou Ferrigno.

1334
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,920
You and I are talking about working out.

1335
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,470
What do you want to talk to him?

1336
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,060
A lot of kettlebells like to did you just

1337
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,150
dude makes fun of the man.

1338
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,100
You so rig.

1339
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,290
No,

1340
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,200
Brian make it fun.

1341
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,480
I love the Frig.

1342
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,513
No,

1343
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,363
one day

1344
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,400
she had to take it to the
lowest common denominator.

1345
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,760
All right.

1346
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,290
You went for the low hanging fruit.

1347
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,010
He didn't know what anywhere around
these just trying to be on him side.

1348
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,680
These hopes don't talk man.

1349
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,710
That whole time actually just this was a
hawk standing so like cause it was CGI.

1350
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,140
I think it's what they used for people
who are looking at cameras and stuff like

1351
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:27,800
that.

1352
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,431
Let me see what it looks.

1353
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:29,130
It does look good.

1354
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,260
It looks pretty creepy.

1355
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,370
You're not buying that thing.

1356
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,040
Don't buy that.

1357
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,631
What are you talking about?

1358
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:32,781
All right.

1359
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:36,590
What do you my dad buy it
now and it's on a stick to,

1360
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:37,424
it's on TMC

1361
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,160
son.

1362
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,351
No,

1363
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:43,530
I'm probably not going to
Marvel's having this pretty dope.

1364
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,803
It's pretty dope.

1365
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,110
I'll tell you what I would buy.

1366
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:46,944
I would buy the,

1367
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,290
the head of the American
Werewolf in London.

1368
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,670
The original best werewolf of all time.

1369
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,020
Yeah.

1370
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,470
There's been a few werewolf movies that
have been kind of fun over the years,

1371
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,990
but none can fuck with an
American Werewolf in London.

1372
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,213
That movie,

1373
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,390
it looks so real.

1374
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,770
It looks so real.

1375
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,540
That movie,

1376
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,830
and it was a long ass time ago,

1377
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,281
dude,

1378
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:09,810
they did that shit in the
80s I movie rocks so much.

1379
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:11,850
It looks so much better than
that fixed star wars stuff.

1380
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,520
When that thing was in London,

1381
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,940
when it was fucking people up in
the streets when it came out of the,

1382
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,170
the dirty movie theater.

1383
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:23,910
It kills everybody in the dirty movie
theater on the London streets like they

1384
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:27,080
showed just enough of it
to scare the fuck out.

1385
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,760
They didn't have to close up,

1386
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:32,370
show the thing moving around
because when you do that,

1387
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:35,910
then people get used to it and
they knew how to do it back then.

1388
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:36,721
You know those,

1389
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:37,490
those,

1390
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,450
the special effects were not nearly as if,

1391
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:43,680
as Lou Joe's scared me so bad that
I walked 45 minutes out of my way,

1392
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,650
wants to get back home after saying
it instead of the seven minutes,

1393
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,030
it would have taken a fine.

1394
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,320
That's scary.

1395
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,500
They knew how to,

1396
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,110
I mean the American Werewolf in London,

1397
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:55,321
people,

1398
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:58,590
I guess it's John Landis and whoever
else was involved in John to that.

1399
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,580
Yeah.

1400
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,160
Whoever else was involved in
creating the imagery behind it.

1401
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:03,560
Just such an awesome job.

1402
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:05,400
A special effects guy was
supposed to be some legendary.

1403
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,270
How the vice guy,

1404
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:06,451
oh,

1405
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:07,201
it's Rick Baker.

1406
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,034
He's the man,

1407
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,250
but he's also the guy who did the last
wolf man with Benicio Del Toro and I

1408
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,920
didn't like that special effects at all.

1409
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,720
I thought that was a silly choice.

1410
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,003
They went,

1411
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,600
they went with this loan,

1412
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:26,170
Chaney junior look from like or whoever
the fuck you original wolf man was as a

1413
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,730
long Chaney Jr uh,

1414
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,010
I was original wolf man.

1415
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,880
Don Not Vamos Paul.

1416
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,833
Oh,

1417
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,190
Claude rains.

1418
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,010
Well it says Claude
rains and loan Chaney Jr.

1419
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,370
I'm not sure which one was the uh,

1420
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:45,961
the monster.

1421
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:46,621
I think it's long.

1422
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:47,454
Chaney Junior.

1423
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,331
And they went to look like,

1424
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:48,660
yeah.

1425
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:48,811
Yeah.

1426
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:51,170
My point is that movie is from 1941,

1427
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:52,004
man.

1428
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,420
And so what they did is like
an updated version of it.

1429
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,263
It looked real.

1430
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,620
It looked like a thing that's
just a stylistic choice.

1431
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,840
But as long as it looks
real as that version of it,

1432
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,870
well their idea was they wanted to be
a real person instead of a CGI thing

1433
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,640
because they had this great actor.

1434
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,720
And when do you get an actor
as good as Benito del Tora Way,

1435
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,920
man.

1436
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,730
So use him to embody the beast
and then you'll do some CGI,

1437
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,290
like his legs were Cgi,

1438
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,470
so they bet backwards like a
dog's legs and shit like that,

1439
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:24,780
which is really weird that
he's walking upright on those.

1440
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,250
But it's a movie,

1441
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,380
but the,

1442
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,310
the real issue is the exact opposite of
what you got from the American wealth in

1443
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,140
London for the American
Werewolf in London,

1444
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:35,220
there was mystery.

1445
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,651
There was like,

1446
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:39,460
there's a scene where this guy
gets killed in the London subway,

1447
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,160
there's shithead and
he's kind of a shithead.

1448
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,650
So you kind of like a happy with you guys.

1449
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,420
Yeah,

1450
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,460
he's a dickhead and he's just stumbling.

1451
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:45,911
Fuck.

1452
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:47,500
And he's trying to hold
onto his briefcase.

1453
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:48,490
And so this thing is,

1454
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,270
he's running and this thing's chasing
how many falls down on an escalator.

1455
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,270
And as he's going on this escalator up,

1456
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,900
you see the thing at the bottom of
the escalator and that ends the scene.

1457
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,070
And it's terrifying.

1458
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,900
You just know what's terrifying.

1459
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,740
You don't have to see a killer.

1460
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,190
Yeah.

1461
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,750
It's terrifying because they just played
at just enough where you don't even get

1462
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:08,260
to see it.

1463
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,620
He sees it and you can see it in his
eyes and he runs and then you hear the

1464
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:15,820
thing in the background making this crazy
noise and he's running and you can't

1465
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:16,480
see it.

1466
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,550
And then finally in the end of the scene,

1467
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:20,500
you see it at the bottom of the
stairs and that's all you need,

1468
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:21,010
man.

1469
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,843
That's all you need.

1470
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,030
They show that movie is the absolute
perfect Horror Monster Werewolf movie to

1471
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:28,420
watch that again now,

1472
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:30,550
so the best and it's got some humor in it.

1473
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,990
There's something I want to see in there.

1474
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,020
He gets laid Shizam it's everything.

1475
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:39,070
You want to have a movie
that one hot English bitches.

1476
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,570
Holla at your boy.

1477
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,883
That's what

1478
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,863
I forgot what I was just,

1479
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,650
sorry.

1480
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,280
I don't know,

1481
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,630
but if I had a head,

1482
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,493
that's what I would buy.

1483
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,400
I wouldn't buy the whole kit,

1484
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,010
but I'll by the American
Werewolf in London,

1485
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,610
I would buy robocop probably
or something like that.

1486
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,720
From your childhood.

1487
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,310
You remember it or star wars.

1488
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,470
Star Wars did this,

1489
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,460
this desk.

1490
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,110
It's so fucking weird.

1491
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,540
That's sort of where it's so much.

1492
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,430
You're such a like,

1493
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,000
it's just a mixture of the
weirdest shit I've ever seen.

1494
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,970
Stevia and marijuana and knives.

1495
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,410
Dog Tag,

1496
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,760
weird reading glasses,

1497
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,460
tablets and the skulls.

1498
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,270
It's my mind.

1499
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,560
Skull fucking belt buckle.

1500
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,580
Stanley Kubrick's Odyssey.

1501
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:20,414
The hidden.

1502
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,280
It looks like what's buried with a mummy.

1503
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,173
What the fuck?

1504
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,330
This is just like a god.

1505
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,540
If they unbury the uncovered
this 2000 years from now,

1506
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,851
I'd be like,

1507
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:29,684
what was this?

1508
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,240
This was like an error made and
they came in here and we're like,

1509
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:32,541
wow,

1510
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,350
these treasures,

1511
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,290
these must be treasuries.

1512
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
This is all a mixture of my message.

1513
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:39,860
Must have been a collector pile all
this together and this is my message.

1514
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,140
Well you know if they like
you look around my house,

1515
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,610
I collect like a lot of weird shit.

1516
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,740
I can see you buying that giant hood,

1517
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:46,971
putting it somewhere.

1518
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:47,910
I probably would if you,

1519
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,730
if you weren't here and if
you didn't make fun of it,

1520
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,433
but it saved me,

1521
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,540
saved me from a ridiculous purchase.

1522
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,330
Ebay does get me,

1523
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,230
it's like five grand to somebody who's
going to make a purchase on something.

1524
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,920
Probably it said two grand.

1525
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,020
Now if it's on Ebay grant already,

1526
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,470
it'll probably jack up the,

1527
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:09,050
the last day they say on Ebay is where
it really all goes going to go in five

1528
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:09,884
seconds.

1529
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,290
Really.

1530
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,950
They have these things
where like Ebay sniping,

1531
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:13,820
I think it's what it's called,

1532
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:15,140
where it's like people that,

1533
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:18,350
I think there are programs
that automatically sit
there and at the last second

1534
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,720
just throw in like real fast math,

1535
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,790
math to like try to beat it real quick.

1536
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,690
Wow Dude.

1537
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,940
That kind of stuff kind of freaks me out.

1538
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Like little little bots and little things
and people are incorporated on the web

1539
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:33,980
so you can

1540
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,490
automatically bid at the last second we
anything like that or people automate

1541
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,270
things.

1542
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:43,270
It's like when you open up the
door for hoax stirs and Tunis and,

1543
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,060
and coders and people know how
to tweak things and you know,

1544
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,361
it's like,

1545
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:48,720
remember when you used to play online?

1546
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:51,480
If here just play quake online
and people would get bought,

1547
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,633
drink,

1548
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,933
drank,

1549
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,510
you know what a bot is and it's bullshit.

1550
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,190
Or a Bot is like sort of your plot.

1551
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,113
Here's what it is.

1552
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,420
There's artificial intelligence involved
in quake and they figured out a way to,

1553
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:06,590
when they make the game,

1554
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,090
it's a d first person shooters.

1555
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:12,410
So you're running through all these crazy
corridors and you see other characters

1556
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:13,760
in there and you shoot at each other,

1557
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,151
right?

1558
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:14,390
You know,

1559
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,460
you're looking at it through
your own perspective.

1560
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,691
And when,

1561
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:18,051
when,

1562
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:19,040
when they make these,

1563
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,341
uh,

1564
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:19,671
these,

1565
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:20,840
these video games,

1566
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,510
you can have one of these artificial
intelligence people and just insert them

1567
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,760
into the game and yeah.

1568
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:28,911
Well,

1569
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,050
you can also have,

1570
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,390
you could have it set
up so you never miss.

1571
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,790
You can have a Bot that just knows,

1572
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,600
see it read the code.

1573
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,071
Of course.

1574
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:37,904
Nice cheating.

1575
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,710
He reads the code and it knows absolutely
exactly where your character is at all

1576
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:43,190
times.

1577
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,110
So every time you press the launch button,

1578
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:45,950
you cannot miss,

1579
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,340
right?

1580
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,890
So you're just killing
people in like three seconds.

1581
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:49,724
As soon as you see them,

1582
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,890
and I've played with people
like this online and it's like,

1583
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:52,641
it's really frustrating.

1584
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,110
It's like you're not
playing a real person.

1585
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,210
You play and they're
laughing and I'm like,

1586
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm doing it.

1587
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,040
Like,

1588
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,873
do what?

1589
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,670
This is stupid.

1590
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,140
Obviously we're going
to beat me like this.

1591
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:00,861
Yeah.

1592
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:02,150
I don't know what my point was.

1593
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,080
I had a point.

1594
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,201
Oh,

1595
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:06,800
what do you think of these bots that
automatically bid that kind of shit?

1596
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,850
Did it ruin quake?

1597
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,540
Never draw that back to
they're really nice dude.

1598
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,260
Strong memory that,

1599
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,591
yeah.

1600
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:17,990
There was a very circuitous route
and just took in this conversation.

1601
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,303
Yeah,

1602
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,000
exactly.

1603
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,661
My friend who asked me,

1604
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:21,850
I'm in college,

1605
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,791
it was early on,

1606
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,880
but he gets automated telling me to keep
calling your phone over and over again,

1607
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,750
my dorm phone.

1608
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,510
So we just fill up my voice mail.

1609
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,630
Why would he do that?

1610
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,710
Just to be a dick.

1611
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,130
And that's when you
give people that power.

1612
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:34,461
It's like,

1613
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:34,850
all right.

1614
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,750
It was funny once,

1615
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,730
don't keep doing it for a fucking month.

1616
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,650
You have to trust shitty pranksters
when you have comics for friends,

1617
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:43,484
man.

1618
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,603
They're always,

1619
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:44,931
it's like,

1620
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:45,291
all right,

1621
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:45,951
I got it.

1622
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:46,461
I got it.

1623
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:47,000
It was good.

1624
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,910
And leave it alone as code
of ethics about your praying,

1625
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:51,020
trying to fuck with people.

1626
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,550
I've got some excellent Photoshop,

1627
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:53,510
Brendan Walsh,

1628
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:53,960
uh,

1629
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,540
putting a girl's chaps on in Houston.

1630
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,950
I'm not sure he wants that shit
on you to give the girls chaps.

1631
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,800
Yeah.

1632
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,420
But Holla at him.

1633
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,410
Uh,

1634
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:03,951
Brendan,

1635
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:08,300
B r e n d o n Walsh on Twitter.

1636
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,070
And contact him and tell him,

1637
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:10,620
Yo,

1638
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,470
it's at least released the info.

1639
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:12,921
Dude.

1640
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:13,970
It's hilarious.

1641
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,190
He's in his underwear in
a country western bar.

1642
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:17,270
It takes his pants off.

1643
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,660
Really?

1644
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,600
He's trying to put on the waitresses
chaps and I got video of him.

1645
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:25,601
I'm interviewing him while this
is going down and he's Pi Pi side.

1646
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,240
He's going to be in a
Ontario this weekend,

1647
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:29,421
right?

1648
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:29,781
Yes.

1649
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:30,021
Yeah.

1650
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:33,120
He's going to be in the Ontario
this weekend with Joey and me.

1651
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,380
Where are you at are this weekend?

1652
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:34,920
This weekend?

1653
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm here.

1654
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,790
You're here.

1655
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:36,350
You're in Hollywood.

1656
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,330
You're doing the storytelling

1658
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,460

1659
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,710
Yeah.

1660
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,090

1661
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:42,540
What is that?

1662
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,373
That date?

00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,120
20th powerful.

1664
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:45,691
I'm in town.

1665
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,120
I'll be there to lend support.

1666
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,170
What's the subject?

1667
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,470
Um,

1668
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,303
Halloween stuff.

1669
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,900
I got no stories through song.

1670
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,680
You write your own pitch as have fun live.

1671
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
I lived in a haunted
house for a little bit.

1672
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,430
Really has a dare to win.

1673
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:04,431
Some will know it because I really believe
if you really believe in that Shit,

1674
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,610
which I pretty much don't
to the haunted houses.

1675
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,180
No,

1676
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,930
not really.

1677
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,763
I don't really.

1678
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:11,963
Um,

1679
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,291
my,

1680
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:13,830
uh,

1681
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,500
my grandmother was supposedly psychic,

1682
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,363
not on one.

1683
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:18,451
I'm good.

1684
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:19,010
Thanks.

1685
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,640
My grandmother was supposedly psychic.

1686
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:21,931
She was a very,

1687
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:22,764
very strange lady.

1688
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,461
And,

1689
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:24,030
um,

1690
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,451
she,

1691
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,620
she did know things.

1692
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,240
She had this weird way of like,

1693
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,074
she would tell you,

1694
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,120
like she told my father
just had a nowhere,

1695
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,530
or my grandfather,

1696
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:32,640
I should told them out of nowhere,

1697
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,230
Chow call your mother,

1698
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,250
call your mother right now.

1699
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:35,850
And he was,

1700
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,650
he was like doing some crossword puzzle.

1701
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,221
They were always like,

1702
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:39,220
this is how they would talk to each other.

1703
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,170
She would yell at him and he would go,

1704
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:40,621
I write,

1705
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:41,101
I write,

1706
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:41,934
I write.

1707
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:42,690
Yeah.

1708
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,200
He,

1709
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,560
uh,

1710
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,310
he goes to visit his mom and
as he gets to his mom's house,

1711
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,144
as she dies,

1712
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:48,550
he,

1713
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,210
he is there the moment she dies,

1714
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,860
as he walks in the door,

1715
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,630
he gets to see her last seconds of life
and she says goodbye to him and then she

1716
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,290
dies.

1717
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,123
Wow.

1718
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,900
And somehow or another,

1719
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:02,550
my grandmother knew this and uh,

1720
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,100
it could have been just a crazy lucky gas.

1721
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,360
It could have been total bullshit.

1722
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:08,490
She wanted him out of the
house and she just got lucky,

1723
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,670
know difficult.

1724
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,500
Who knows?

1725
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,940
But also scientifically it could be.

1726
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,070
Yeah.

1727
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,310
I think she died the next day.

1728
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,300
She did weird shit.

1729
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,163
The story over the years,

1730
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,850
she would do weird shit.

1731
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:18,720
Like one time,

1732
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:18,990
um,

1733
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,010
she woke my mother up out of her bed
and brought her downstairs and then five

1734
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:27,000
minutes later the roof collapsed
over her bed and fucked her bat up.

1735
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,050
Yeah,

1736
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,250
there was weird shit like that.

1737
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:29,910
Anyway,

1738
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,750
they had a guy,

1739
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,630
this is back in,

1740
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,140
then my grandparents lived in Newark,

1741
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:34,974
New Jersey.

1742
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,641
And uh,

1743
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,170
it was,

1744
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:36,930
uh,

1745
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,260
it started out in all Italian neighborhood
and then it became an all black

1746
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:40,831
neighborhood.

1747
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,650
Then it became an all Puerto Rican
neighborhood and Dominican's and all these

1748
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:44,490
other people moved in.

1749
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,840
And my grandparents,

1750
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,010
they stayed there forever.

1751
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,450
And at one point in time,

1752
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:48,680
uh,

1753
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,140
they,

1754
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,040
they were renting the room out apparently
to some dude and dude died and they

1755
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,890
swore that this dude
was still in the house.

1756
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,730
It goes,

1757
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,300
you know,

1758
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,360
and that was like where I was staying.

1759
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,430
I was staying in that same room.

1760
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,600
Did you ever see anything?

1761
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,433
I didn't say shit.

1762
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:02,783
I didn't see shit.

1763
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,410
I walked around on my
deck and my hand like,

1764
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:05,244
what?

1765
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,630
I'm not scared of ghosts.

1766
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,290
Come blow me then grove his son right now.

1767
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:09,700
What are you,

1768
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,381
you gonna scare me?

1769
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:10,631
Woo.

1770
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:11,220
Woo.

1771
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,521
Woo little.

1772
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:12,331
You're not even there.

1773
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:13,170
You're translucent,

1774
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:13,351
Bro.

1775
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:14,220
Like go right through.

1776
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:15,480
You stupid.

1777
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:16,470
Stop Bothering Kale,

1778
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:16,890
Huh?

1779
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:17,251
No,

1780
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,150
they don't do shit.

1781
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,610
You have to be a total pussy
to be scared of a ghost.

1782
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,850
Those fucking ghost shows
to drive me bananas.

1783
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,810
I never find anything.

1784
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,330
There's nothing there.

1785
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:28,350
You Fox and explained
this Geiger readings,

1786
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,820
they have a fucking leg.

1787
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,530
They have a like a circle that
they'll highlight on a screen.

1788
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:33,460
Look at this moment,

1789
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,570
there's something appears
for kind of dresser.

1790
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,300
There's nothing behind that dress.

1791
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:37,840
You asshole.

1792
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,040
It's lit in your screen.

1793
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,930
Are you talking about a camera from 1978
where we are down in the basement in

1794
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,220
the readings are off the chart.

1795
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,450
This is amazing.

1796
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:46,991
And they're all,

1797
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,740
it's all night vision
and you see the knife?

1798
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,500
I don't hear that.

1799
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,191
I don't hear that.

1800
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:52,024
Do you hear that?

1801
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,810
I don't hear it there.

1802
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,693
One of the first

1803
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,070
when the first threads I ever
did on your message board ways.

1804
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,471
I,

1805
00:47:59,471 --> 00:47:59,880
I,

1806
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,810
my sister,

1807
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:01,560
I think it was,

1808
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,060
she went to this haunted house,

1809
00:48:03,061 --> 00:48:05,280
a famous haunted house in West
Virginia and they stayed at,

1810
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,330
and she took a photo using our camera
and one of the first things I ever posted

1811
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:14,130
on your form was like these photos
because it actually had like a person that

1812
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:17,760
looked like a ghost standing on the
porch and it was fucking creepy.

1813
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:18,960
And I've been trying to find that,

1814
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,910
that photo for so many years.

1815
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,661
I lost it.

1816
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:23,520
It's not in your archive thing anymore,

1817
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,710
but it's like the photos are goes now too.

1818
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,410
Well,

1819
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,280
what do you think goes?

1820
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,370
What'd he say?

1821
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,070
I can't believe nobody
even asked you this,

1822
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,490
but do you know the orbs thing?

1823
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,050
You know about orbs?

1824
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:35,920
Yeah.

1825
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,550
No.

1826
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,383
Okay.

1827
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,710
This is where it gets hilarious.

1828
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,020
There's a apparently hold on,

1829
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:41,261
hold on,

1830
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:41,620
hold on.

1831
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,460
Before you start those.

1832
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:42,850
Okay.

1833
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,860
I just want to say whenever
I hear stories like this,

1834
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,490
I know in my brain I can call it.

1835
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,780
I always like,

1836
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:50,740
all right,

1837
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,980
what's the story going to be about and
if these whatever these things are orbs

1838
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:55,030
or we're so awesome.

1839
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,620
Why am I just hearing about it now?

1840
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,760
Because you know what it is.

1841
00:48:57,761 --> 00:48:58,810
You probably know it by something,

1842
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,763
some other name.

1843
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:00,430
You know what I mean?

1844
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,960
Like whenever it's,

1845
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:03,340
I'd be story like that or like,

1846
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:03,521
you know,

1847
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:05,960
going into the light
when you die or whatever.

1848
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:06,930
I want to hear it.

1849
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,511
Well it's a,

1850
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,760
it's a photographic artifact.

1851
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,330
Oh,

1852
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,580
from mostly from digital photography.

1853
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,390
Okay.

1854
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:13,841
What it is,

1855
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:18,820
it shows these little circular things
that look like it's probably dust in the

1856
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,450
air and cashes the,

1857
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,260
the flash that creates like little orbs,

1858
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,430
orbs.

1859
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,310
But people are convinced that
it's like positive spirits.

1860
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,820
Oh there are beings and that the dust
just like positive spirits and like the

1861
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:32,980
more dust I guess you collect around you,

1862
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:34,480
there's holes are like little fairies.

1863
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,380
So what?

1864
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,550
They're hoarders or like well they
believe what they believe is some people

1865
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,290
believe that when you have
like all this positive energy,

1866
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:45,370
that positive energy actually manifests
itself in these fears but that you

1867
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:46,181
cannot see it.

1868
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:48,550
They're gonna only be viewed
when it's photograph question.

1869
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,840
How did I know that there are
positive fares and not negative?

1870
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,340
I don't know.

1871
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:56,300
Cause they say if you talk to the people
who really believe in it and Bravo they

1872
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,110
say that it when it shows up,

1873
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:03,670
when you have positive
thoughts and positive energy
and I've seen some pictures,

1874
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:07,450
I've received your really interesting
pictures of like people happy smiling and

1875
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:10,330
they're holding their hands up
and there's orbs all around,

1876
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,720
all of their photo but
it also could be lent.

1877
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,070
Has it ever been a picture
of somebody's happy it does

1878
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,920
and dust and stuff.

1879
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,411
But there,

1880
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:24,570
there is definitely a lot of weird shit
that happens in photos that aren't,

1881
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,650
that isn't dust.

1882
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:28,190
But the problem is is that thinks

1883
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,671
anything,

1884
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:29,810
it means it's a ghost.

1885
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:30,644
It's got to be out.

1886
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:32,901
Speaking of which,

1887
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:37,010
have you guys heard about this new
Photoshop thing that removes the Biller?

1888
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,790
How's that takes up?

1889
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,680
If you take a photo saying it
feels it's like a blurry photo,

1890
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:48,010
it can calculate where each image went
wrong and how it all stretched out and

1891
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:50,080
they could turn it into an unbeliever.

1892
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:51,700
He picture would,

1893
00:50:51,701 --> 00:50:52,500
it pretty much looks,

1894
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,360
it looks at the photo and does its math,

1895
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:59,570
like how the blur is and it finds the
path that like if you're holding the

1896
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:01,790
camera and you first
what it would have been.

1897
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,271
Yeah,

1898
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,500
like if you're holding the camera,

1899
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:05,780
you're taking a photo and it
goes a little right there.

1900
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,090
It can see that in the camera by the blur.

1901
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,400
The blur is and so it tries to reverse
that and straighten it back together and

1902
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,810
it works really well.

1903
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,500
If one of my favorite things on the iPhone
is when you open up a picture and it

1904
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:18,951
opens up,

1905
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,690
but it's this blurry for
a second and you're like,

1906
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:20,841
oh,

1907
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:21,674
I can already see it.

1908
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,010
Let's see it better and it gets all clear.

1909
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:25,851
I love it.

1910
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:26,750
I love that feeling.

1911
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:27,620
Yeah,

1912
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,453
it's amazing.

1913
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,800
You guys should definitely
upgrade to the cloud thing.

1914
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:31,311
It's nice.

1915
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:35,570
I can now look at every photo like
on my home computer right now.

1916
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,700
And you know those dreams,

1917
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,910
everything from your
home computer constantly,

1918
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,920
constantly.

1919
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,240
Does that mean if you lose your phone,

1920
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,770
someone's going to see
all your Dick Pictures?

1921
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,080
Uh,

1922
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,420
final?

1923
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:44,630
No,

1924
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,871
no.

1925
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,040
Cause you have brass farms,

1926
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,330
you have a password lock on it.

1927
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,253
By the way,

1928
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,790
I just found out about this program.

1929
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:50,150
I don't,

1930
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,370
I can't find it yet and I
can't remember the name.

1931
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:55,700
But there's this program that you could
put on your iPhone that if somebody gets

1932
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:56,750
the pass code wrong,

1933
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,240
it will automatically take a photo of the,

1934
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,520
of the using the front camera.

1935
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,310
And so then if you lose
it then you can track it.

1936
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:05,780
Also using Google maps,

1937
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,320
you can play alarms that you can
have a recorded from your computer.

1938
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,180
I know you've got my phone.

1939
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,511
Yeah,

1940
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:12,680
I can't remember the name of it.

1941
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:13,790
So from your computer at home,

1942
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,130
but you control it from a mobile
money account or whatever it is.

1943
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,060
Yeah.

1944
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,170
So it's in the iCloud.

1945
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,153
Wow.

1946
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:22,660
Yeah.

1947
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,050
I can't remember the name though.

1948
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,830
Fuck.

1949
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,221
Well,

1950
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:29,180
it's like sling shot or somebody
tweaked that shit to us please.

1951
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,020
I know you are.

1952
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,853
You're out there.

1953
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:35,090
You Oh witters or hoarders
of information that,

1954
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,530
that thing that I had,

1955
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:37,490
that video they had on the,

1956
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:37,881
on the,

1957
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:38,470
um,

1958
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,680
the voice control was incredible.

1959
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:41,060
We were military Steve Jobs.

1960
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:47,120
You know what bugs me about it is that
now people are going to be using that

1961
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:51,950
shit all day and telling him just having
fucking conversations with their phone.

1962
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,590
There's going to be all these
robots talking everywhere.

1963
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:54,831
You know,

1964
00:52:54,831 --> 00:52:57,980
like you're going to be in a coliseum
and you're just gonna hear like tons of

1965
00:52:57,981 --> 00:52:58,810
robots.

1966
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,590
What's playing at the movies

1967
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,440
that's going to happen.

1968
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,170
They're just going to wander
around and talking to their call.

1969
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,160
Margaret,

1970
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,230
I can't wait to us higher ratings.

1971
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:10,281
I heard,

1972
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:10,551
fuck,

1973
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:10,941
I could hurt.

1974
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:13,490
You could fuck with it and like
ask it crazy questions like,

1975
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:14,330
who made you,

1976
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:14,900
are you?

1977
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,100
Would you marry me?

1978
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:16,491
And she's,

1979
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,530
that's where it'd be like,

1980
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,461
yeah.

1981
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:18,800
Okay.

1982
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,490
Apple.

1983
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,140
If apple let people have like,

1984
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:21,401
you know,

1985
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,030
like do shit to it.

1986
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:25,980
Like you could do to like Unix
or Linux or something like that

1987
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,020
because then you could
make like fuck mods.

1988
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:28,320
Right?

1989
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,870
You could have some dirty bitch
that gives you your text messages.

1990
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:32,630
I can go and dirty bitch,

1991
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,181
you know?

1992
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:33,540
Tell me,

1993
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,440
tell me what the fuck,

1994
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:34,921
what,

1995
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:36,030
what kind of texts I got.

1996
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:36,571
Oh,

1997
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:37,321
this is what I got first.

1998
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:39,870
I got a message from a sucky did
real good since that's the baby.

1999
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:40,531
Yeah.

2000
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:40,951
Yeah.

2001
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,180
How's my tax looking?

2002
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,780
I would make an Ari Shaffir said and
then she reads a text message so you can

2003
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:46,890
say like dirty shit to you.

2004
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,650
They call you dirty boy.

2005
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,780
You want your message from Ari.

2006
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,960
You can have why got don't you little
bitch thousands and thousands of

2007
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:59,040
programmed responses to various questions
that possibly could come up and you

2008
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,330
can just talk dirty to this bitch.

2009
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,650
They should have an avid program.

2010
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,910
They should have an APP or a girl.

2011
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,910
You can keep track of the cycle and the
way it'll show you where you are in a

2012
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:10,200
cycle is how much a guy can get
away with not using a condom.

2013
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,663
Really.

2014
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,980
So when she's closer to obviating,

2015
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,190
maybe like three condoms owners on
the picture they've gun or something.

2016
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,050
And then when they,

2017
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,590
she's like,

2018
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,600
whenever the time is when
you just totally not fertile,

2019
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,640
just so blessed away.

2020
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,250
Condoms are the grossest
things of all time.

2021
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,490
I really even,

2022
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:28,770
you know,

2023
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:29,610
they're necessary,

2024
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,473
don't get me wrong,

2025
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,750
but it Christ stupid fucking rubber
sword over your dick feel like ridiculous

2026
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:38,880
nonsense.

2027
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,110
We're so gross though.

2028
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,771
We so gross.

2029
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:43,170
We give each other Kudos
through our dicks pussies.

2030
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:45,271
I mean,

2031
00:54:45,271 --> 00:54:48,480
it's not just an issue of Islam
is an issue of making people,

2032
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:51,540
which is most certainly a fucking issue
because there's a lot of people you

2033
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,100
fucked that you don't
want to make people with.

2034
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:57,300
That's a dirty God damn trick of
nature that we need to fix pronto.

2035
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:57,810
You know?

2036
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,670
Instead of trying to
fucking get rid of the Fed,

2037
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,080
listen and let's try to fix that.

2038
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:05,300
Let's try to fix this fucking equals
making people thing about that equals man,

2039
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,231
fuck for fun.

2040
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,640
And then if you want to make people,

2041
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,470
you know you have to be
able to turn something off.

2042
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:11,280
It should be a better person.

2043
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,080
I was really considering it
a sec to me the other day,

2044
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,780
which is like 10 minutes
of serious thought into it.

2045
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,230
You're crazy.

2046
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,230
You don't want kids if
you don't want kids.

2047
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:20,210
No.

2048
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,890
One of the worst things that could happen
to me right now cause I get someone

2049
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:23,430
pregnant.

2050
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,060
Well,

2051
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,100
so why would it be crazy?

2052
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,370
Like cheaper to own a gun.

2053
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,240
Have you been Joe?

2054
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:29,911
Have you say that?

2055
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:30,900
But you know what man,

2056
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:31,740
it sounds crazy,

2057
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:34,800
but if you haven't checked that you were
really into and you had a little ori

2058
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:35,490
hanging around you,

2059
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,720
you would love a fucking love it.

2060
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,960
You would love it in a way that
I couldn't even describe to you.

2061
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,040
It just seems like a huge
commitment and a huge time eater.

2062
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,600
It's just got to meet the right guy.

2063
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,493
And what if it was,

2064
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,140
what if it was to girl?

2065
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,710
That's not the issue going and it's
not cool enough to get rid of it.

2066
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,410
I have several friends that have
children with people they don't like.

2067
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,790
I know a bunch of people in that
situation and it's a sad situation.

2068
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,311
That's what I mean.

2069
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:00,780
That's the worst thing that
could happen to me right now.

2070
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:01,230
Yeah.

2071
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,500
But it doesn't mean that you're,

2072
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,210
I wish there was a reversible way
cause that's the only negative is okay.

2073
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,250
At some point I want to do this,

2074
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:09,690
but somebody who I believe there is,

2075
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:11,700
I believe there's new
technology that they uh,

2076
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,830
they attach a clip and it
basically pinches off your,

2077
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:21,030
where your dick sauce comes out like over
a Doritos bag and I don't know how it

2078
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:21,391
works,

2079
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:23,470
but your body just sort of reabsorbs it.

2080
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,010
So

2081
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,220
your,

2082
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,001
your loads are all,

2083
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:25,870
it's just blanks,

2084
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,630
a gigantic thing of sperm.

2085
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,610
The next time when you
open up the flood gates,

2086
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,840
it must be one super,

2087
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,461
super.

2088
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:32,920
Yeah.

2089
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,520
Dead,

2090
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,260
uh,

2091
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,770
pushing forth fucking armies
and John laying carpet,

2092
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,320
new carpet.

2093
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,153
That's what sound,

2094
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:42,570
that's it.

2095
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,820
Your loads and felt like I felt like a
week or two they'll have that smell when

2096
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:49,030
you first go into a apartment when
they've just done it on you and laying the

2097
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:49,864
carpet down.

2098
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,153
I like smells,

2099
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,260
smells like it should.

2100
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:54,610
It's the most clean.

2101
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,100
Such a crap shoot apartment living.

2102
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,570
It's always a crap shoot.

2103
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:00,070
We always had weird neighbors,

2104
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:00,904
man.

2105
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,170
Have you ever had an apartment?

2106
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:03,130
We had cool neighbors.

2107
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,980
Like every now and then you hear about
somebody who's got some set up somewhere

2108
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,290
and there's like a cool
apartment building and every,

2109
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:08,441
you know,

2110
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:10,090
it's small place and yeah.

2111
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,591
And everybody's cool.

2112
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:13,630
I'm only friends with
my next door neighbors.

2113
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,610
They before they both
work at the store nearby.

2114
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:16,240
Me Too.

2115
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,391
Oh,

2116
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,560
they both work at the store?

2117
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,010
Yeah.

2118
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:18,640
And so it's like,

2119
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:18,821
I know,

2120
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:19,620
but that's crazy.

2121
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,340
You look outside with one
of them sometimes with like,

2122
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,760
so you got three people from the
comedy store and one little one.

2123
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,760
They work at the um,

2124
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:26,310
none of them.

2125
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:26,411
Oh,

2126
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:27,310
the corner store.

2127
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:27,951
Is that what you're saying?

2128
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:29,010
Here are the one right below it.

2129
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:29,201
Yeah.

2130
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:30,010
Not The comedy store.

2131
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:30,191
Yeah.

2132
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:30,370
No,

2133
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,700
you got a nice convenience setup.

2134
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,740
But that store right there too.

2135
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,940
It was at store 24 hours.

2136
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,390
No,

2137
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,340
two of them to those bitches.

2138
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:36,790
Yeah.

2139
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,660
Weak ass bitch.

2140
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,890
Sometimes I've been up to,

2141
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:40,990
we're at a point like one
time they open please six.

2142
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:41,990
That was sex.

2143
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,690
There used to be one point in time,

2144
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:44,770
a 24 hour pool.

2145
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:45,890
All Hollywood billiards.

2146
00:57:45,891 --> 00:57:48,580
There's 24 hour pool hall
in La and it was awesome.

2147
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,620
I came here before the earthquake,

2148
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,680
the first team to know
what happened there.

2149
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,070
Yeah,

2150
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:54,341
yeah.

2151
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:54,851
But no,

2152
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:55,630
they moved,

2153
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,730
they moved from their location.

2154
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,180
That wasn't the original location.

2155
00:57:58,181 --> 00:58:00,910
Now their religion
location was downstairs.

2156
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,140
I forget what street it was on,

2157
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,170
but it was an awesome old CD place.

2158
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:05,981
And uh,

2159
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:08,260
I came down here to do some shit for MTV.

2160
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:10,060
Me and I did this little thing,

2161
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:11,290
this little rock and spring.

2162
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:11,770
Breck,

2163
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,001
no,

2164
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:12,251
I was like,

2165
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:12,520
oh,

2166
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,940
Highlet thing we did.

2167
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:18,170
It was me and a couple of different people
tried it with me and they just had me

2168
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,090
out here for a few days.

2169
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,270
But one of the highlights of my trip
was I got that go to that Hollywood

2170
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:23,650
billiards before it went under.

2171
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,910
It was just bad ass man.

2172
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:25,840
I went downstairs,

2173
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:26,170
I was like,

2174
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:26,531
oh,

2175
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:27,190
sign me up.

2176
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,120
This place is perfect.

2177
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:28,360
I know.

2178
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,580
I saw people arguing over how much to bat.

2179
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:31,420
I saw,

2180
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,840
I saw people playing money playing pool
for money and it was like two o'clock in

2181
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:36,460
the morning and I saw some posers.

2182
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:37,294
I saw some like,

2183
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,050
you know some when I don't
want to say pollsters,

2184
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,440
people didn't really know how to
play pool that well I should say.

2185
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,660
And then I'm not posers people
just banging balls around.

2186
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,430
So there was like regular
people and there was like,

2187
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,100
you know,

2188
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,460
there was that actor from um,

2189
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,001
fuck,

2190
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:49,870
what movie was he in?

2191
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,430
16 candles.

2192
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:52,540
Was that the,

2193
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,700
the dude he,

2194
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,730
Michael Thomas.

2195
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:55,943
What does it say?

2196
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,930
What does Michael Michael Hall,

2197
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,071
yeah,

2198
00:58:59,071 --> 00:58:59,680
it's hacking people.

2199
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,960
That Guy Michael,

2200
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,801
I saw him there.

2201
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:03,830
I also saw him at domino,

2202
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:04,664
Hollywood,

2203
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,400
Hollywood athletic club.

2204
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,440
That was another place
where they used to have a,

2205
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:10,660
that was an awesome little
pool hall that closed down.

2206
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:12,580
These failed to play pool with
a bunch of different places.

2207
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,410
I like a stupid sport.

2208
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:15,244
It's dying.

2209
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:16,490
It's dying right in front of mine,

2210
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,343
but I won't accept it.

2211
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,101
Too much space.

2212
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:18,934
It's too fun.

2213
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:19,803
It's too fun to play.

2214
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,380
Won't accept.

2215
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,140
I want to it.

2216
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,973
They're crazy.

2217
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,360
Fuck you fucking mother.

2218
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,470
It's not mine.

2219
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,011
It's mine.

2220
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:28,844
It's my home phone.

2221
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,920
Doesn't do the cool party anymore.

2222
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:32,480
Now I don't even care about anymore.

2223
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:33,890
Yeah,

2224
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:34,730
that's even better.

2225
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:35,720
You're going to have it ring man.

2226
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:36,750
At least have a robot voice.

2227
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,470
Fram Jelly

2228
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,533
name man.

2229
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,173
Damn man.

2230
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,343
Learn.

2231
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,350
You want to call it from whoever.

2232
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,460
That was an important character.

2233
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,000
Really?

2234
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,220
Yeah.

2235
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:53,871
It was supposed to.

2236
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,220
I forgot to tell him I couldn't do this.

2237
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,420
I have to do a podcast.

2238
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,710
I had to talk to him real quick resident.

2239
00:59:58,790 --> 00:59:59,481
Was it the president?

2240
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:00,290
Was that Obama?

2241
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,410
Have you been following the latest news
now on what a bond is killing us all at

2242
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:05,300
the raping her children.

2243
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:06,850
Medical Marijuana.

2244
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,500
It's so pathetic there.

2245
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:13,580
They're going after medical marijuana
like on an aggressive way and not,

2246
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:14,691
hold on,

2247
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:15,524
hold on.

2248
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:15,920
Okay.

2249
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,190
Yeah.

2250
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,670
Well,

2251
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:20,970
I just want to know if this is the
attorney general or if it's Obama or the

2252
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:21,680
state's attorneys,

2253
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,780
like a bodiless day.

2254
01:00:22,781 --> 01:00:23,011
Okay,

2255
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:28,011
go for it changed its stance and the
stance was originally that they would only

2256
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:33,170
go after people who violated
both state and federal law.

2257
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:35,760
What's that?

2258
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,281
Your phone is off.

2259
01:00:36,281 --> 01:00:37,114
The phone's off the hook.

2260
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:39,621
Yeah.

2261
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:41,930
But the problem with state
and federal law is the state,

2262
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,561
the state law.

2263
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:42,800
I've,

2264
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,820
I've seen parts of it.

2265
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:45,230
It says you can't operate for profit,

2266
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,430
which everyone sort of does and it's
just sort of like what's for profit,

2267
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:52,660
what's not and that I don't
think you're allowed to profit,

2268
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:57,050
but you're definitely allowed to make
money too to actually pay for employees I

2269
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,100
think and things like that.

2270
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:00,880
So I think if you do do it by the book
and not like some of these places,

2271
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,650
that's also selling cocaine gets
all their money to the employees.

2272
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:04,790
They take some for themselves.

2273
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:05,060
That's how,

2274
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,110
that's why you run a business.

2275
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,280
I wish I believed them.

2276
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:07,671
I wish.

2277
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:10,710
I believe that when they were really
doing was eradicating the evil people who

2278
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:13,970
were a part of this peaceful
medical and medical marijuana scene,

2279
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,880
peaceful and helpful medical marijuana
scene and what we're going to do is just

2280
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,460
eradicate the the ones that are problems.

2281
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:19,850
Right.

2282
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,620
But if you really were
caring about people,

2283
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,450
that's not what you would
concentrate on first.

2284
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:23,871
Okay.

2285
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:26,750
You wouldn't concentrate on people
distributing marijuana even if they were

2286
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:27,680
doing it illegally.

2287
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:28,370
What are they doing?

2288
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:32,250
They're getting good stuff out to people
illegally making me not have to go to a

2289
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:36,530
shitty part of town or deal with some
sort of criminal behavior to get the same

2290
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:36,890
stuff.

2291
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:37,330
No,

2292
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:41,390
and it becomes a matter of priorities
when it comes to law enforcement like you

2293
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:43,370
incompetent fucks.

2294
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,250
Like why are you paying attention to this?

2295
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,880
This is a non issue that hurts no
one and you're paying attention to,

2296
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:50,714
that's the problem.

2297
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:51,860
You know what think might happen?

2298
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:54,020
I think this might get it legalized
in California if they start

2299
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:56,830
closing the box wrong.

2300
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:59,010
I think the potter did that
point come and go like,

2301
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,451
oh,

2302
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:00,090
okay,

2303
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:00,923
we don't have,

2304
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,680
but the issue is still stands.

2305
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:04,520
It's not a stuck,

2306
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,990
it's a federal issue.

2307
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,180
It was what you don't understand
the federal government,

2308
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:10,460
regardless of whatever the
state chooses is still,

2309
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,560
they're shutting down
everywhere in America.

2310
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:16,310
Well they're first starting supposedly
supposedly starting in San Diego cause I

2311
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:19,710
guess San Diego is like one of those
areas where everyone around it,

2312
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:20,010
there's a

2313
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,940
very high,

2314
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,360
uh,

2315
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,940
like people don't want it there
as much as very conservative.

2316
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,430
You go to her to make them open cell.

2317
01:02:25,431 --> 01:02:27,750
And so what now they're doing
is they're attacking the,

2318
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,170
uh,

2319
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,730
publications and like,

2320
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:31,320
like newspapers and,

2321
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,860
and for advertising it,

2322
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,240
because supposedly there's
like this ridiculous law.

2323
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:41,241
Like you're not allowed to advertise
anything that's illegal or illegal drugs.

2324
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,290
You can't advertise cigarettes.

2325
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,940
And I'm in magazines anymore.

2326
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,330
Right.

2327
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:46,163
You can't at all.

2328
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,090
I don't think so.

2329
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:47,550
Really.

2330
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,910
I think it used to be no cartoons and
a lot of people and then it was like,

2331
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,210
I don't think there's
just no bro whenever.

2332
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,193
Wow.

2333
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,600
Because they don't want the
sort of real live with it,

2334
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:55,261
but it's sort of harmful.

2335
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:59,340
I wonder what the numbers are as far as
p p p how much have people dropped off

2336
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,480
of smoking cigarettes?

2337
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,773
I've met a lot.

2338
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:02,480
I bet.

2339
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,313
I bet a lot.

2340
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,550
I don't think kids are smoking as much.

2341
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,443
I think it's,

2342
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,130
you can't smoke in public places.

2343
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:09,660
I think one of the biggest things for me,

2344
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,561
it's back in the day,

2345
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,490
you know you smoke cigarettes,

2346
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,440
you could smoke in restaurants,

2347
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:14,610
you could smoke anywhere.

2348
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,090
Now it's kind of a tenure brand.

2349
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,000
It can be a lot more
peer pressure moments.

2350
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:18,863
Right,

2351
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,003
exactly.

2352
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,130
People still smoke,

2353
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,490
but I have no idea if
it's less or more people.

2354
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:25,863
This question,

2355
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:30,900
according to that article in La Times
for 2007 American smoking rates declined

2356
01:03:31,331 --> 01:03:36,331
in the seven years leading up to 2004
but remained steady from 2004 to 2007

2357
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:37,751
moms.

2358
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:41,850
Largely due to a cut in funding for
smoke prevention programs and the things

2359
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:42,550
that works.

2360
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:42,971
Yeah.

2361
01:03:42,971 --> 01:03:47,971
Tobacco industry doubling its marketing
spending just to keep it even.

2362
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,350
Yup.

2363
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:54,350
Doesn't Ling tumbling since 1997 tobacco
consumption in developing countries has

2364
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:59,590
increased at an annual rate of 1.7%
according to the UN Food and Agricultural

2365
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:00,190
Organization.

2366
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:00,521
The key,

2367
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:01,510
the question is,

2368
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,600
is that heavy marketing from
the tobacco industry has cow.

2369
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,250
Okay.

2370
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,083
So I,

2371
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,083
wow.

2372
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:12,790
It seems like steadied off when this
study was made whenever I'm 2007 but

2373
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:13,551
when I was growing up,

2374
01:04:13,551 --> 01:04:14,270
my first high school,

2375
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,400
there was no question
I would not be smoking.

2376
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,151
And he was like,

2377
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,984
I've never tried that.

2378
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,550
Rarely do you meet other
kids and you're like,

2379
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,200
oh well they're sort of
normal and they do it.

2380
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:21,980
Okay.

2381
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,813
Maybe I could.

2382
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:23,260
Yeah,

2383
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,021
I mean taking classes,

2384
01:04:24,021 --> 01:04:24,854
I would smoke.

2385
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,300
I would go outside and smoke.

2386
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,760
Really in high school.

2387
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:27,951
Yeah.

2388
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,960
We had this bridge that we
can just crawl underneath.

2389
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:31,930
You kind of watch out for your health,

2390
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:32,764
man.

2391
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,770
That's why I freaked out and we w

2392
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:35,140
I,

2393
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:39,680
we have to talk about this in the podcast
because so many people got attached to

2394
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:40,514
it on Twitter.

2395
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,710
Our last a podcast we did,

2396
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:45,210
Brian and I have little hissy fit because,

2397
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,990
well I was tired and I was,

2398
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,790
I was tired and uh,

2399
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,200
I had been working a lot and um,

2400
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,570
I had a short fuse and Brian was hammered

2401
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,610
and that was hammered because I've been
doing this juice diet and on the way the

2402
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,453
podcast.

2403
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:03,260
So I wake up and I go to bed and I have
juice and so like I was in the car and

2404
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:04,400
it awesome so far it's like,

2405
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,234
let's drink.

2406
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,660
And I'm like,

2407
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,080
ah,

2408
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,680
okay.

2409
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,850
So we got like all this beer.

2410
01:05:07,851 --> 01:05:10,740
I had like three or four beers
and by the fourth beer I,

2411
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:11,830
I was so to the,

2412
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,890
have you listened to my voice?

2413
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:13,970
I could barely talk.

2414
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,310
I have no protein in me except everyone.

2415
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:16,790
You'd honestly,

2416
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:17,391
you're not slurring.

2417
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:18,250
There's the way you always talk

2418
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,643
that is used.

2419
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,030
Brian gets pie.

2420
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,820
I'd everyone always like,

2421
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:26,520
what does he never wants you to draw?

2422
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,130
Everybody else I talked to.

2423
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:30,500
All right,

2424
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,061
I'll be like,

2425
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:31,894
I'm fucking,

2426
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,720
I just happen off a beer and
like you get slurry fast.

2427
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,070
Do you really think it has something to
do with that carbon monoxide poisoning

2428
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,390
and you have no idea that really,

2429
01:05:42,391 --> 01:05:44,550
do you really think that you think
about that every now and then?

2430
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:45,330
Did that,

2431
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:46,163
do you know,

2432
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,550
looking back at it,

2433
01:05:47,551 --> 01:05:50,140
it seems what I,

2434
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,590
I guess you'd say the story again.

2435
01:05:52,591 --> 01:05:54,510
I rented out when I was in college.

2436
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:57,060
I had this place and I had the top room,

2437
01:05:57,061 --> 01:05:58,170
which was like the attic,

2438
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,080
but it was bad at it.

2439
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,210
So I was like brick walls.

2440
01:06:00,211 --> 01:06:02,650
It was really bad as it was a
carbon monoxide was looking at them,

2441
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,930
a brick walls on one site and then
would shitty windows on the other side.

2442
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:08,040
And it was drafty.

2443
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,050
And so,

2444
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:09,510
uh,

2445
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,170
there was only one heat vent
that came out of this brick that,

2446
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:16,170
that I had my bed right
underneath cause I lived in Ohio,

2447
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:17,160
so it's fucking cold.

2448
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,120
And so like the heat would just come
out of this event and warm up the whole

2449
01:06:21,121 --> 01:06:21,691
entire room.

2450
01:06:21,691 --> 01:06:22,490
So yeah.

2451
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,323
And uh,

2452
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:24,510
when I was moving out,

2453
01:06:24,511 --> 01:06:25,530
the landlord was like,

2454
01:06:25,531 --> 01:06:25,711
you know,

2455
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:27,480
going through to make sure
I didn't destroy anything.

2456
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,531
And they go,

2457
01:06:28,531 --> 01:06:28,801
Whoa,

2458
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:29,031
Whoa,

2459
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:29,221
whoa.

2460
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,570
Why is that thing not cover it up?

2461
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:30,991
I'm like,

2462
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,420
what the fuck you're talking about it?

2463
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,510
And they're like,

2464
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:33,691
no,

2465
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:35,040
that's the carbon dioxide,

2466
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:35,470
uh,

2467
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:36,120
uh,

2468
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,721
furnace,

2469
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:37,050
you know,

2470
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:39,420
output take that's
supposed to be covered up.

2471
01:06:39,421 --> 01:06:39,601
You know,

2472
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:42,280
it's supposed to be
like a chimney exhaust.

2473
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:43,883
Those two,

2474
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,600
I cooked his brain.

2475
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,490
I found that's why you slur.

2476
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,110
He says he used to be able to talk better.

2477
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,033
I think I,

2478
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,040
I think it will.

2479
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:51,270
What?

2480
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,980
I think how I originally said it was like,

2481
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:53,461
like,

2482
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:53,881
yeah,

2483
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:57,480
I think it definitely made me have a
slight little stutter or a little thing.

2484
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:58,710
I don't think it drastic,

2485
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:01,380
dramatically changed
anything over Manasseh.

2486
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,190
Lauren,

2487
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,640
I have no idea when you're drunk.

2488
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:04,631
Crazy.

2489
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:08,020
That is that you just said that you
think that sleeping in this house,

2490
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,850
it might've given you a certain stutter.

2491
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:10,410
Yeah.

2492
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:10,621
Well,

2493
01:07:10,621 --> 01:07:11,190
I mean I'm just,

2494
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,023
when you drink,

2495
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,560
if you look at old videos of myself,

2496
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:13,811
like I,

2497
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:15,030
I think that it's nice.

2498
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,080
It's nice to think that.

2499
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,640
Right,

2500
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:16,890
right.

2501
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,460
It's also,

2502
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,660
you look at old videos of me and I'm like,

2503
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:18,811
no,

2504
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:19,890
I'm just the same crazy person.

2505
01:07:19,891 --> 01:07:20,550
I've always been.

2506
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:21,960
I talked to the exact same,

2507
01:07:21,961 --> 01:07:22,291
you know,

2508
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:23,720
I just threw,

2509
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,770
wrote something and this is a
good idea and this would help you.

2510
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,120
Getting back to one of the,

2511
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,560
we were talking about,

2512
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,443
um,

2513
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:34,820
being able to communicate and
I think a lot of this learn,

2514
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,061
you know,

2515
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:38,150
what would help you tremendously
if you would write things.

2516
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,980
I really think if you been right,

2517
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:40,701
I know,

2518
01:07:40,701 --> 01:07:41,270
I know,

2519
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,691
I know,

2520
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:42,261
I know what you're saying.

2521
01:07:42,261 --> 01:07:43,094
That it helps you,

2522
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,780
it helps to form sentences,

2523
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:46,760
better help form ideas.

2524
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:47,410
Better is a,

2525
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:51,950
an idea that somebody had on the message
board and it was a very astute idea.

2526
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,620
And the guy said that when you write
and you get used to writing things,

2527
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:58,160
it helps you form sentences and
phrases in your head better.

2528
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,351
Yeah.

2529
01:07:58,351 --> 01:07:58,711
But you know,

2530
01:07:58,711 --> 01:07:59,070
when I'm,

2531
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,641
when I'm out,

2532
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:01,110
like off the air,

2533
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:01,451
you know what,

2534
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:02,220
I'm off the air.

2535
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,930
I'm like at the Olive Garden,

2536
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,381
I'm sorry,

2537
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:05,610
Applebee's or wherever I'm at.

2538
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,430
I'm just having a conversation
so I'm not stuttering.

2539
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:08,790
I'm not,

2540
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:09,210
I'm not,

2541
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,650
not finishing sentences.

2542
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:11,791
You're,

2543
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:12,271
you're really,

2544
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:16,760
you guys are all really focusing on me
getting really stoned and in two seconds

2545
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:18,710
later sitting down and talking on a mic

2546
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:22,360
mean.

2547
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,640
I mean sometimes,

2548
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,800
I mean I'm not talking
about just general talk,

2549
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:28,920
I'm talking about like sometimes you
have an idea and you having a hard time

2550
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:29,820
figuring out how to get,

2551
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:34,821
cause I'm stone does not come to it when
you read a lot more to like go way up.

2552
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,511
It does.

2553
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:36,870
Yes.

2554
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:37,470
Unquestionably.

2555
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:41,370
But I also think right actress was stupid
actions is still sound really smart

2556
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:43,080
because they read a lot cause
they read scripts all day long.

2557
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:44,530
Yeah.

2558
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:45,510
I have to read a bunch of them.

2559
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,201
Just keep reading.

2560
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:48,980
I'm an or an over and over and over
again and they're just like sure.

2561
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,260
Say because they all thought about it.

2562
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,230
Then you've known new
actresses it move out here.

2563
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,130
Yes.

2564
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,680
There are a lot of stupid hot chicks.

2565
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,140
Yeah.

2566
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:56,430
Oh yeah.

2567
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,150
A lot of them are.

2568
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:57,550
Yeah.

2569
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:57,930
Yeah.

2570
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,340
And those go on to succeed.

2571
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:00,090
Some of them.

2572
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:03,120
I always wonder how much
is stupid and how much is,

2573
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:07,830
they've never been exposed to anything
other than this narrow band of mental

2574
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:08,670
operation.

2575
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,200
They just stay in that.

2576
01:09:10,201 --> 01:09:12,540
So they come out of it whole entertainment

2577
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,151
tonight.

2578
01:09:13,151 --> 01:09:13,990
Frequency

2579
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,500
stay in that frequency.

2580
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:20,650
What is that dumb or is that just they,

2581
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:24,160
they're comfortable there because
otherwise I wouldn't watch it.

2582
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,470
The news is on the other channel there's
some smart washer that like stupid

2583
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:27,860
shit.

2584
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:28,161
I know.

2585
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:28,850
That's true.

2586
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,280
It's got to be some stupid stuff.

2587
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,120
Yeah.

2588
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:32,953
That's okay.

2589
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,260
I think there's more
crazy in Hollywood than of

2590
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:37,703
it's fucking crazy.

2591
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:39,000
It's ridiculous.

2592
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,420
How much crazy like it makes me like when
you hang out with somebody that's not

2593
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:43,590
crazy and you meet somebody new,

2594
01:09:43,591 --> 01:09:44,070
you're like,

2595
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,760
oh my God,

2596
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,180
this is,

2597
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:49,320
I could see that this person's not crazy
and I had just hang out with crazy so

2598
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:51,450
much that I feel like everybody is that,

2599
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:51,810
you know?

2600
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:51,961
Yeah.

2601
01:09:51,961 --> 01:09:54,330
There's so many Weirdos that hanging out
at the comedy store that you just sort

2602
01:09:54,331 --> 01:09:54,991
of take it for granted,

2603
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:57,300
like a shocker lock off and you're like,

2604
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:57,481
oh,

2605
01:09:57,481 --> 01:09:58,530
it's just normal part of your life.

2606
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:01,260
Having to deal with those people
that whenever I was around that dude,

2607
01:10:01,261 --> 01:10:02,760
I was always ready to
kick him in the chest.

2608
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,130
I was always ready for bum rushed to that.

2609
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:11,140
Don't expect that he'll hit people and
fucking screaming drunk as shit from that

2610
01:10:11,371 --> 01:10:11,611
guy.

Two blocks for for a dollar.

2612
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,630
He always Paul McGee,

2613
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,150
bones wonky of guns.

2614
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,450
He was so cool.

2615
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:21,840
Uh,

2616
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,151

so close to the show.

2622
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,300
Joy Come my conversations
with Robert [inaudible].

2623
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,300
He and I had a very
interesting little friendship.

2624
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,110
He's,

2625
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,590

2627
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,210
schizophrenia I guess.

2628
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,480
Yeah.

2629
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,313
I don't know who,

2630
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,430
he was always nice to me.

2631
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,650
He was always complimentary.

2632
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,350
He was always very a gentleman.

2633
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,910
I'd be on this team then the other
team that people would torment them.

2634
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:48,210
Yeah.

2635
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,260
I don't think that's nice.

2636
01:10:49,261 --> 01:10:50,280
I don't think play along with your,

2637
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:50,881
with your game,

2638
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:51,750
but I'll just get on the good side.

2639
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,100
I think he's a nice guy.

2640
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:53,860
I know.

2641
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,171
Excellent.

2642
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:55,950
You're reached out my hand
to shake them recently.

2643
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:56,680
I forgot.

2644
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,461
I forgot.

2645
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:58,181
I think I knew it,

2646
01:10:58,181 --> 01:11:00,550
but I forgot and he freaked the fuck out.

2647
01:11:00,551 --> 01:11:00,851
And I'm like,

2648
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:03,970
I felt so bad because now he
thinks timeline on the bad side.

2649
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:04,570
I think.

2650
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,171
Oh No,

2651
01:11:05,171 --> 01:11:05,680
no,

2652
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,400
I heard a people,

2653
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,450
I'll talk to him for you.

2654
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:08,880
So,

2655
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,713
well

2656
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:11,561
what do you guys have?

2657
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:14,160
Like if I see and why would
it happy to talk to my luck.

2658
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,730
Robert,

2659
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,541
that would be funny though.

2660
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:16,140
If you had like,

2661
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,540
like conversations every
night at Hello Joe.

2662
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,171
I was just,

2663
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:20,850
I don't know his story,

2664
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,860
but I apparently he was a like a lawyer,

2665
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:23,520
right.

2666
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:23,980
And he was,

2667
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,480
uh,

2668
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,313
went to Nyu,

2669
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:25,680
play,

2670
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,650
played on site.

2671
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:27,420
Uh,

2672
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,780
I think it played out like some sort
of like college basketball team.

2673
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:31,290
Really.

2674
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,290
Maybe the division to
city college or whatever.

2675
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,041
But yeah.

2676
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,960
Then we came out here
to do whatever you want.

2677
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,800
Look crazy.

2678
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,410
Wow.

2679
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:41,000
Who said he thought he was gonna he
thought he was next in line to host it

2680
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:41,834
tonight show.

2681
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:45,300
Cause he'd attended more tapings of the
tight shot of Johnny Carson than anyone

2682
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,110
else.

2683
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,460
So he hates Jay Leno.

2684
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,900
He hates all things.

2685
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:49,501
He stole it from him.

2686
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:50,670
He calls him lemon Jello.

2687
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,920
He's got a weird disconnect.

2688
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,170
But I don't know why.

2689
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:56,580
I always enjoyed being around that guy.

2690
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,930
If I have like a roach left,

2691
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:58,671
you know,

2692
01:11:58,671 --> 01:11:59,491
and start throwing words like,

2693
01:11:59,491 --> 01:11:59,960
Hey Robert,

2694
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,430
I want this kind of a pump,

2695
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,220
which you very much,

2696
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,830
I love how he even asks what
it is to really wants to know.

2697
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,873
Great.

2698
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,700
Who's the guy that he's
at the comedy store.

2699
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,260
He always has like glasses
on and like this blonde,

2700
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,560
weird shaggy hair and I'm like
a weird mustache or something.

2701
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:19,050
I think he was a Ding Dong
or at one time the older guy.

2702
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:19,973
But he's like,

2703
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,930
I just found that like I
always in front of surfer.

2704
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,270
No,

2705
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:22,510
no,

2706
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:22,801
no.

2707
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:23,370
But it's like,

2708
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:23,940
it's like that,

2709
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,620
but this guy that it's like he's kind of,

2710
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:25,951
you know,

2711
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:26,490
on that,

2712
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,780
that same kind of thing.

2713
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,720
And I find out he's like
an action star in India.

2714
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,350
Like number one of the
number one Indian accent.

2715
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:36,660
He's been doing these videos
and they're like really popular.

2716
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,650
And this whole time I'm like,

2717
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:37,921
ah,

2718
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:39,270
he's just this Ding Dong or guy.

2719
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,440
They always hangs out here.

2720
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,240
Wow.

2721
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,073
Actions.

2722
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:42,950
Yeah,

2723
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,370
and if you look at the trailers,

2724
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:44,731
uh,

2725
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:46,170
it's amazing.

2726
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:46,980
Like you're like,

2727
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,570
it's the best thing you'll
ever see in your life.

2728
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,100
God,

2729
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:49,411
I don't know.

2730
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:54,411
His name on show gets a weird group of
people how bearers controls and cr get

2731
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,950
just finds them.

2732
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:56,970
I don't know how he finds them.

2733
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,121
Well,

2734
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:57,960
what a commitment to,

2735
01:12:57,961 --> 01:12:59,340
he's been doing it for a decade.

2736
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:02,700
You should have him on the show sometimes
way more like love to have barest

2737
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,563
anytime you want to do it.

2738
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:04,600
Well,

2739
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,000
he's busy with his show.

2740
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,801
Jimmy Kimmel show,

2741
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:08,634
right?

2742
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,093
Or something.

2743
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,510
I love dawn Burris.

2744
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,840
It's also gets off for like
a week at a tire there.

2745
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,870
He's such a fun guy to be around.

2746
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,550
He's helped me form a,

2747
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,020
a unique part of my standup.

2748
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:22,050
When I see him being goofy and
saying horrible things like,

2749
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:22,550
oh,

2750
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,131
how does he get away?

2751
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:23,761
You watch them enough.

2752
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:23,971
You're like,

2753
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:24,280
okay,

2754
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,920
I can sort of see a little bit of a smile.

2755
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,630
He tells old ladies to be like,

2756
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,901
Oh,

2757
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,070
you filthy whore.

2758
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,860
You love getting bent over and just rail,

2759
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:32,311
don't you?

2760
01:13:32,311 --> 01:13:32,671
Dirty,

2761
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,504
dirty whore.

2762
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,411
And they love it.

2763
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:35,131
They laughing,

2764
01:13:35,131 --> 01:13:36,140
they with their grandchildren,

2765
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:36,631
the island,

2766
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:37,590
while he's saying it,

2767
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:39,830
he's smiling and laughing
while he's saying,

2768
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,230
we had this door guy who
didn't understand that,

2769
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:44,430
and I would always say like on stage,

2770
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:44,650
he's like,

2771
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:44,741
Hey,

2772
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:45,001
what's up?

2773
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,790
Black people or there was going to like
interact with black people and bears are

2774
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:48,181
always like,

2775
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:49,080
you bitch,

2776
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:49,800
how dare,

2777
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,670
but in a fun way.

2778
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,300
That's Dork.

2779
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,133
I didn't get it.

2780
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:55,500
And one day he just goes up with
some woman from in the audience,

2781
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:56,850
from onstage and he goes,

2782
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,410
what's up you black bitch?

2783
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:00,983
And it ruined.

2784
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,700
Then that's five hours of show.

2785
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:03,773
Oh No,

2786
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,590
it wasn't there.

2787
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:04,921
It was like,

2788
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:06,010
what's with that room?

2789
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,723
No,

2790
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:09,680
Kyle,

2791
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,500
that's what they call them.

2792
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,333
Sick Kyle.

2793
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,363
Oh God.

2794
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:14,300
Kyle,

2795
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,700
Kyle nickname doctor.

2796
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,360
That just didn't know how to do it right.

2797
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,493
Bad for him.

2798
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,960
There's a lot of nut heads
working at that place.

2799
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:28,900
If there was ever a
vortex of insane people,

2800
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:29,890
it's the comedy store.

2801
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:30,873
Yeah.

2802
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,150
So many nutty fucking
humans in that choice.

2803
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:34,690
We're like,

2804
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,400
how do you even survive in life?

2805
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:37,331
Kind of crazy.

2806
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:37,790
Yeah.

2807
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:38,110
Yeah.

2808
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:38,831
And I know you're just here,

2809
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:40,900
just one of the people
here and in that place.

2810
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:43,640
There's a lot of those people
that are still regulars on,

2811
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,980
they still go on stage.

2812
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:45,641
You know,

2813
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:46,930
you can go there and it's,

2814
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:50,740
you'll see half a show and half
like a psychology experiment.

2815
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,401
Dude crab.

2816
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:53,620
It's goes up there sometimes
and it's so hard to take.

2817
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,520
What happened to him.

2818
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,480
He just fried,

2819
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:57,430
he's fried and it just like,

2820
01:14:57,431 --> 01:14:58,500
it used to be like,

2821
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,020
yeah,

2822
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,801
he used to be funny.

2823
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:01,180
He used to be a funny guy when I saw him,

2824
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:03,910
he was like on the tail end of that and
then I don't think he's used anymore,

2825
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:07,030
but I think you're just caught up
and it just like you're burnt out.

2826
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,110
No brain left.

2827
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:08,510
Yeah.

2828
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,360
He has this horrible stories.

2829
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:14,020
It'll just start on you midway through
a story and you just traps you.

2830
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:14,591
Oh No,

2831
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:17,650
she's so sad and on stage
just becomes so horrible.

2832
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,080
There's been a couple times lately that
had been going there and this is like

2833
01:15:22,081 --> 01:15:22,620
prime,

2834
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,520
not prime I guess,

2835
01:15:23,521 --> 01:15:24,030
but like,

2836
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:24,301
you know,

2837
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:29,301
Sunday 10:00 PM nine 30 nice crowd in the
audience of like friends of the comedy

2838
01:15:29,731 --> 01:15:30,030
store,

2839
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:30,863
just like maybe it was,

2840
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,120
I'm sorry Monday it was Monday,

2841
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,481
but same kind of thing.

2842
01:15:33,481 --> 01:15:33,960
Right.

2843
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:34,460
But there was,

2844
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:34,950
there's,

2845
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:35,930
this is uh,

2846
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
like two comics in a row that I watch
and I got angry because they had like 10

2847
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:43,710
minutes spots at this time and you know,

2848
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,120
it was the worst thing ever.

2849
01:15:45,121 --> 01:15:46,680
The crowd just sitting there like,

2850
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:47,191
really?

2851
01:15:47,191 --> 01:15:49,260
Are we watching this awful shit?

2852
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,780
And I get mad.

2853
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:52,614
I had to leave.

2854
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,010
The weird thing about those nights,

2855
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:54,731
well you've seen them.

2856
01:15:54,731 --> 01:15:55,570
So the open mic,

2857
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,020
it's like they've sat
through so much shit,

2858
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,160
but at some point they just
lose faith and stand up.

2859
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,490
So if you go all like the employees
are going right after that.

2860
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:03,790
Yeah.

2861
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,121
And they're like,

2862
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:05,530
what are you going to do to us now?

2863
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,930
It was so hard.

2864
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,173
God,

2865
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,330
that's exactly what it is.

2866
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:12,480
It's like beaten.

2867
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:16,050
You can't just keep beating every,

2868
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:16,871
every host.

2869
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:17,201
Just be like,

2870
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:17,381
all right,

2871
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:17,771
that's nice guy.

2872
01:16:17,771 --> 01:16:18,990
Really funny and at some point when I,

2873
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,620
I never said that because I'm like,

2874
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:23,480
they're not going to believe me after
you say five times in a row and say this

2875
01:16:23,481 --> 01:16:24,880
guy and the worst things ever,

2876
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:26,170
unless the guy's really funny.

2877
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:26,480
Yeah.

2878
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,640
Never say he's really fun.

2879
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:28,281
Then one time,

2880
01:16:28,281 --> 01:16:28,410
but like,

2881
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:28,811
hey guys,

2882
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:29,051
by the way,

2883
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,190
I know there's been a shit show.

2884
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,410
It's been madness of
homeless people right now,

2885
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,440
but this guy is funny.

2886
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,293
You can say that.

2887
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:35,260
Yeah.

2888
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,093
Fuck.

2889
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:37,600
They would get so hard.

2890
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,730
I used to have to host that like years.

2891
01:16:39,731 --> 01:16:41,440
I would host such very good for your act.

2892
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:41,860
Yeah.

2893
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,480
It was for yours and how to apply.

2894
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,090
It helped you as a Freddy said the
first time you went to let me do it.

2895
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:46,391
He goes,

2896
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:47,560
if she lets you do it more than once,

2897
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,400
watch how much quicker
it makes her onstage.

2898
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:51,221
Every three minutes.

2899
01:16:51,221 --> 01:16:53,770
I got to get back up there and start
thinking of something to get the crowd

2900
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,620
going away and you also
learn how to manage the room,

2901
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,690
becomes sort of a social manager.

2902
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,250
Keep all these people,

2903
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:01,084
you know,

2904
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,810
I have to keep doing like in between
everybody to make him laugh at 30 seconds

2905
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,770
to figure out how to make them laugh
fast and then bring on the next awful

2906
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:08,481
awful,

2907
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:11,600
awful types from actually
used to love comics.

2908
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:11,931
Like boom,

2909
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:16,670
Shaka Laka who would go on in drag with
a bucket on his head and you know what?

2910
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,490
At least he got the crowd going and you
see how the crowd at least after him,

2911
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:19,941
like he'd be like,

2912
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:21,320
keep that going for the next guy.

2913
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,550
But didn't you ever want to just sterilize
that fucking microphone after you're

2914
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,393
done?

2915
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:26,883
Dude,

2916
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,283
I still worse.

2917
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:28,720
That's,

2918
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,140
that's probably the worst thing ever.

2919
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,930
Sometimes I totally
forget to when I'm like,

2920
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,070
oh I just touched my

2921
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,271
microphone.

2922
01:17:37,271 --> 01:17:38,990
That'll never gets clean.

2923
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,120
Never.

2924
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,090
And they don't find new ones.

2925
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,200
Cool.

2926
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,380
They've been there for a while.

2927
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:44,121
One that's there.

2928
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:45,410
It's probably the one that I bought.

2929
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:49,960
It has to a blown up completely before
they replaced that cheap content,

2930
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,580
just sucking that shit out of it.

2931
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:54,510
I've always found my,

2932
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,610
and I think about it later,

2933
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:56,444
I'm like,

2934
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,760
that's terrible cause it smells.

2935
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,750
Sometimes even through the night enough
people have the little spittle laying on

2936
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,540
it just thinks,

2937
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:05,691
damn.

2938
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:06,560
I was going to talk about,

2939
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,460
oh this,

2940
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,340
I read some fucking studies as strangers
study that I've ever read and it's a

2941
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:17,350
bunch of scientists that are convinced
that there is no free will and that the

2942
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:24,431
moment you decide and make up your
mind to do something in reality,

2943
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,180
you had already decided
several seconds before this,

2944
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:29,014
she talks about those,

2945
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,620
did you talks about it?

2946
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:30,981
He said,

2947
01:18:30,981 --> 01:18:32,560
the thing is you can't tell yourself up.

2948
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,390
Think of an elephant like
what made you say to yourself,

2949
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:37,160
think of an elephant you're making,

2950
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:37,850
you're making.

2951
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,290
There is no independent thought.

2952
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,830
It's cool and I really don't fully
understand it because a lot of what I

2953
01:18:42,831 --> 01:18:47,060
understand about it could be completely
opposite from the way my take on it

2954
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:48,020
because I thought about it.

2955
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:48,261
I'm like,

2956
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:51,320
this is a fascinating thing because you
essentially have philosophers that are

2957
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:56,321
arguing with scientists and in a sense
they're both right because maybe you,

2958
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:01,820
you don't change what you're doing.

2959
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,170
Maybe maybe you know,

2960
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,730
there is no real freewill,

2961
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:09,230
but maybe it's because the seven
second thing that happens before you,

2962
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:09,890
you know,

2963
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:13,460
you make up your mind to whatever the
choice is going to be that you're gonna

2964
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:13,701
pick.

2965
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:15,140
Maybe that's just a random thing,

2966
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:16,820
but the results of that,

2967
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:21,410
maybe that's what they can't measure the
results or you change the way you think

2968
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:26,470
and that essentially is free will the
freewill but already changed the way you

2969
01:19:27,651 --> 01:19:28,020
think they're,

2970
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:28,853
that's what they're saying.

2971
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,760
They're not accounting for character.

2972
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:34,760
And I don't think it's an either or
because I think that certain amount of

2973
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:37,100
character and certain amount
of will can be developed.

2974
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,310
And the essential question
is why you develop again,

2975
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:45,620
where you designed to develop it as just
just your natural course of your life

2976
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:46,761
that you're following,

2977
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:48,350
that you're supposed to follow anyway.

2978
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:52,010
And you are just tricking yourself into
thinking these are your own decisions.

2979
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,890
But this is almost like laid out right
where it's like you're going to make this

2980
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:55,161
decision,

2981
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:56,720
this is what you're going
to struggle with it,

2982
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:57,770
and then they come to this.

2983
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:01,280
Imagine they have under
further investigation,

2984
01:20:01,281 --> 01:20:05,660
they show that there really is a code
that already set up picking out through

2985
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:10,661
the air and that code is like a genetic
code or like a computer code and that

2986
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:11,121
it's,

2987
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:16,020
it's a wireless frequency that we're
tuned into that is moving us in a very

2988
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,960
specific program to do
a exactly what we do.

2989
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,070
If this is what they're saying,

2990
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:21,540
if they're saying that you know your,

2991
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:26,370
your mind has made moves to to make
this decision seven seconds before you

2992
01:20:26,371 --> 01:20:28,530
consciously decided
that he says about God,

2993
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:30,990
where it's like if God knows what we're
going to end up doing because there's no

2994
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:31,824
time to God.

2995
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:32,431
Yeah.

2996
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:33,990
In the normal concept of God,

2997
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:35,730
then there's no free will.

2998
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:36,451
He knows what we're going to do.

2999
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:38,520
He knows we're going to make a decision
this way or that way and this is the

3000
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:38,821
best way.

3001
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:41,400
I was explained how that maybe it's
not the best way of thinking about it.

3002
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,450
If you go and see Jurassic Park with
someone who's never seen it before and you

3003
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:46,110
say,

3004
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:46,231
Oh,

3005
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:48,330
this guy's about to get killed
and then he gets killed,

3006
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,290
your friend is going to be like,

3007
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,790
why did you make that dinosaur to do that?

3008
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:52,890
Like you didn't do it.

3009
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,600
You just know what's going to happen.

3010
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,910
It doesn't mean it doesn't
mean you're commanding me.

3011
01:20:59,130 --> 01:20:59,770
It's a,

3012
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:01,230
it's a very interesting concept.

3013
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:01,501
No,

3014
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:01,581
no,

3015
01:21:01,581 --> 01:21:01,740
no.

3016
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,610
It's an interesting concept because I
want to believe that I'm in control of my

3017
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:06,040
life.

3018
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:06,990
You want to assure,

3019
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:07,861
you know,

3020
01:21:07,861 --> 01:21:08,790
and we all do,

3021
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,020
but why do we,

3022
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,640
why do we want to absolutely believe
that we're not just following some Howard

3023
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,340
determined pattern of behavior power.

3024
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,091
I want to be leaders,

3025
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:18,924
not followers.

3026
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:19,051
Well,

3027
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:19,381
sort of,

3028
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:20,760
but like when you're at your best,

3029
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:21,840
like say on stage,

3030
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:22,051
you know,

3031
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:23,730
we talk about like being in that groove,

3032
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:24,480
you're not,

3033
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,680
you're like a passenger.

3034
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:27,450
You're like riding that fucking thing,

3035
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:28,380
right?

3036
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,730
That's when you are at your best,

3037
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:30,330
right?

3038
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:30,961
When it's not,

3039
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:32,280
you're not really even thinking about,

3040
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:33,091
not even in control.

3041
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:34,820
He just sort of floating best.

3042
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,850
Did it ever say shine?

3043
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:36,800
Shine?

3044
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,071
Yeah.

3045
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:39,030
The movie about the pianist that work,

3046
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,440
that goes crazy.

3047
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,000
It's the guy who won the Oscar.

3048
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,261
He,

3049
01:21:42,261 --> 01:21:44,190
he did some Holocaust movie later.

3050
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:44,920
Oh yeah,

3051
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,360
yeah.

3052
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,380
I know who you're talking about.

3053
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:46,940
Yeah,

3054
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,773
whatever.

3055
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,330
The little kid one,

3056
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:50,383
he learned it,

3057
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,240
but they said when he was playing the
thing and all you hear the sound drop off

3058
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,760
and all you hear is the
bumping of the keys,

3059
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:59,340
the physical keys hitting his fingers,

3060
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:00,870
you know,

3061
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,680
cause everything goes quiet.

3062
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,140
It's like that's how it sort of feels
like when you're in the zone on stage

3063
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,040
where it's ever,

3064
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,710
you're just sort of like,

3065
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:06,340
Huh,

3066
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,970
and now I'm saying this and those
people are reacting this way.

3067
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,451
Right,

3068
01:22:09,451 --> 01:22:09,931
and you're,

3069
01:22:09,931 --> 01:22:10,261
you're,

3070
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:11,640
you're floating through it.

3071
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,080
You're not even conscious.

3072
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,201
Oh,

3073
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:13,531
look at that.

3074
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:13,791
Look at what,

3075
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:17,960
I just sit there and you can't even
think about that too much because that'll

3076
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:18,661
distract you.

3077
01:22:18,661 --> 01:22:20,130
But it's like you're
just going on autopilot.

3078
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:20,970
It's like boogie boarding.

3079
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,470
You just catch away and just keep going.

3080
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:22,981
Well,

3081
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:23,281
you know,

3082
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:25,140
that's the concept of also the muse.

3083
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:27,830
The idea of creativity coming
as something you tune into.

3084
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,920
It just hits you and it's all so
maybe that is all really connected.

3085
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,581
We talked about that.

3086
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:33,391
When you get a great bit,

3087
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:33,900
you're just like,

3088
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,800
I just sort of came to me.

3089
01:22:34,801 --> 01:22:37,980
I didn't do it out of the air
just comes out of the ether.

3090
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:40,800
You have to sit yourself
down to to receive it.

3091
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:41,634
That's what you gotta do.

3092
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:42,661
That's what I was saying.

3093
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:43,494
You should write.

3094
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:44,071
You know,

3095
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:46,320
cause I think you have a
lot of really funny ideas,

3096
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:47,790
but you keep them all in your head.

3097
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:48,271
You know,

3098
01:22:48,271 --> 01:22:51,360
you bounce him out on stage and you write
things down that you're going to do.

3099
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:53,370
But I think if you wrote a blog,

3100
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:54,390
like a funny blog,

3101
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,310
I think you would really get into it.

3102
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:00,720
And I have some really funny shit and
it would really help your stand up.

3103
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,823
It really helps your,

3104
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,820
your word,

3105
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:06,160
you're forming sentences and it
really helps your material because

3106
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,341
you,

3107
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:06,521
you,

3108
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:08,170
when you sit down to write a blog,

3109
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,820
at least for me when I write,

3110
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,690
I just,

3111
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,220
I never restrict myself,

3112
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:12,970
you know,

3113
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:15,550
unless I'm working on this particular
bit that I'm trying to tighten up.

3114
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,240
I don't restrict myself to like what
subject or how I'm going to do it.

3115
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:20,440
I just start writing.

3116
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:21,970
Like if maybe it'll come out funny,

3117
01:23:21,971 --> 01:23:23,050
maybe it will come out creepy.

3118
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,033
Maybe it'll come out.

3119
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:24,940
Yeah.

3120
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,900
We just write just whatever the fuck I'm
thinking and as you're writing then you

3121
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:29,141
know,

3122
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:29,471
it's like,

3123
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:33,910
it takes longer to write the word
neuroscientists that it does to think of a

3124
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:34,451
neuroscience,

3125
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:35,860
but it makes you keep thinking about it.

3126
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:36,040
Right.

3127
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,110
It makes me think about it.

3128
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:37,871
Right.

3129
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:42,070
But it's almost in the ideas like it's
richer in your mind as just sitting down

3130
01:23:42,071 --> 01:23:42,881
and just think,

3131
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:44,530
just thinking without actual pen.

3132
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:44,830
Yeah.

3133
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:46,570
When you actually write things down,

3134
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,660
there's something to it I
think where it enriches the,

3135
01:23:49,661 --> 01:23:52,780
it's hard to keep your compensation to
like if you're thinking about whatever it

3136
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:52,991
is,

3137
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:53,940
I don't know this call,

3138
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,560
we were trying to write a bit about skills
without writing it down about putting

3139
01:23:56,561 --> 01:23:57,340
a pen to paper,

3140
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,700
write your mind then wanders to something
else and you're no longer doing the

3141
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:01,510
writing about the thing.

3142
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,350
That's why I've said it before.

3143
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:03,011
I'll say it again.

3144
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:05,650
That right room application is the shit.

3145
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,640
If you have a Mac,

3146
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:10,440
it's called right room and I know
there's a PC a variation before,

3147
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,970
but I'm on team Mac so you can suck it.

3148
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:15,730
The best real world advice I
got on writing came from uh,

3149
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,100
Damon Wayans actually wants the,

3150
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,681
I'm starting.

3151
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:18,370
Yeah,

3152
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:19,230
because people said like,

3153
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:19,391
oh,

3154
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:20,210
it's so helpful.

3155
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:23,290
So that's what the problem
is in everybody's brains.

3156
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,760
There's a laziness where it's like,

3157
01:24:24,761 --> 01:24:25,001
yeah,

3158
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:26,290
but what am I going to write for an hour?

3159
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:27,820
Like I'm never going to fucking do that.

3160
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,410
Whereas what he said in the morning,

3161
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:30,880
before you go to work,

3162
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,280
you take 10 minutes and set an alarm.

3163
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,990
If it's 1102,

3164
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,790
when you're starting set of for 1113.

3165
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,800
So as that next minute
start to get 10 minutes,

3166
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,060
as soon as the alarm goes off,

3167
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,480
stop writing and you
always have 10 minutes,

3168
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:44,590
you can put in 10 minutes.

3169
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,161
It goes,

3170
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:46,210
one of two things happens.

3171
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,193
One,

3172
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:47,500
uh,

3173
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,430
if you do have more time,

3174
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,230
you'll keep writing if you want to.

3175
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,080
So we'll get it going already
to the rest of the day.

3176
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:54,670
You're thinking about what
you're already put on paper.

3177
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,380
So you're going to keep
writing in your head.

3178
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:57,220
You're going to keep that,

3179
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:57,910
that,

3180
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:58,743
uh,

3181
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,010
the brain just pumping.

3182
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:00,881
You know what I mean?

3183
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:03,280
But you can always spare 10
minutes who always keep doing it.

3184
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,430
I haven't,

3185
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,051
let me get home.

3186
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:05,980
You can write more if you want,

3187
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:06,820
but just every morning,

3188
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:07,683
10 minutes.

3189
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,370
And it seems so foolish.

3190
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:10,420
If you can't put in 10 minutes.

3191
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,343
It does.

3192
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:12,303
And I don't

3193
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,430
very specific,

3194
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:14,150
um,

3195
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,080
set a mindset when it comes to
anything that's going on in my life,

3196
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,030
especially with stand up and,

3197
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,620
and anything creative.

3198
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:23,090
If I'm not writing,

3199
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,030
I never completely feel in the zone.

3200
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:28,250
Like I will have to sit myself down.

3201
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:29,810
Like if I have like a gig coming up,

3202
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:34,490
like let's say I'm doing a theater and
the weekend I have to sit myself down and

3203
01:25:34,491 --> 01:25:35,324
write something.

3204
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:40,040
I have to sit myself down and get that
part of my brain just crank it up.

3205
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,061
Here's an idea,

3206
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:42,200
here's something I'm working on.

3207
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,990
Even if I don't talk about that on stage,

3208
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,240
but you're still,

3209
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,930
the fact that I'm working on new
shit just puts you in a better mood.

3210
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,770
Better brain move.

3211
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:53,270
Makes me feel productive.

3212
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,670
It makes me feel like I'm,

3213
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:54,940
I'm,

3214
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,241
I'm,

3215
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:57,890
I'm putting out what I'm neat
when I'm supposed to put out.

3216
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:02,280
I believe you also feel like confident
or like a winner because you wrote and so

3217
01:26:02,281 --> 01:26:04,040
that helps your that's yeah.

3218
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,520
Well I think when you do what you know
you're supposed to feel like a loser.

3219
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,230
I got made a non paid regular.

3220
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,960
Mitzi and maybe just like I was allowed
to do belly room shows or something.

3221
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:12,560
Right.

3222
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,160
But my sets around town over my expert
just killer for like three weeks,

3223
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,290
cause I felt like I'm a real comic.

3224
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:19,400
Yeah.

3225
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,720
But it didn't make my writing any better.

3226
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:21,680
I was still doing the same jokes.

3227
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:25,040
And they have told me that when he got
his black belt from February see over

3228
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:25,590
doom,

3229
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:27,470
he immediately became
better on the ground.

3230
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,240
And Ryan Parson said that too.

3231
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:30,620
They were just thinking he deserved it.

3232
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,131
Yeah.

3233
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:32,210
We just started like going,

3234
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,740
he just started putting in his head like,

3235
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:34,251
yeah man,

3236
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:35,870
I'm a fucking black belt in Jujitsu.

3237
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:36,743
Shit.

3238
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,930
Yeah Ma'am is a legit,

3239
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:41,960
and you go for it said to a
man may ham's ground game is,

3240
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:44,790
and no fucking joke when you
think it was fight with business.

3241
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,020
It's a great fight side.

3242
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:46,963
You know,

3243
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,960
it's a great fight.

3244
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,250
It's an interesting fight.

3245
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,113
It's a fucking,

3246
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:54,010
the coaching and the show is what's been
the most impressive thing about Ma'am

3247
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,853
to me.

3248
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,251
I was,

3249
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:55,570
uh,

3250
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:57,560
we were texting each other
back and forth today.

3251
01:26:57,561 --> 01:26:58,041
I was like,

3252
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:58,580
dude,

3253
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,070
you're a fucking good coach man.

3254
01:27:01,071 --> 01:27:02,780
He's a really good coach.

3255
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:05,080
Like his instructions are very clear.

3256
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,751
Post up,

3257
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:06,590
post up.

3258
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:07,190
Alright.

3259
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:09,230
Lefthand could get his controls risk.

3260
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:09,410
Good,

3261
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:09,951
nice,

3262
01:27:09,951 --> 01:27:10,550
nice.

3263
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,990
It's like everything is steady.

3264
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,220
Walks the guys through it,

3265
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,560
get them in an elbow ain't got,

3266
01:27:14,561 --> 01:27:14,840
yeah,

3267
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,201
and he's like,

3268
01:27:15,201 --> 01:27:15,381
all right,

3269
01:27:15,381 --> 01:27:17,360
he's breaking now he's break
and he's looking to quit.

3270
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,080
He's looking at a quick,

3271
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,200
I mean he talked his fighters
through the entire thing.

3272
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:21,951
Get its back right.

3273
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:22,700
Flatten them out,

3274
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:23,480
flatten them out.

3275
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:23,750
Alright,

3276
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,321
soften them up.

3277
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:24,741
He's done.

3278
01:27:24,741 --> 01:27:25,370
Let's finish.

3279
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,203
Let's finish late.

3280
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:28,250
And they understand that
this thing is screaming

3281
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:37,200
Freeman at the top of his lungs and he's
so mad because may one every fucking

3282
01:27:37,201 --> 01:27:37,481
fight.

3283
01:27:37,481 --> 01:27:41,760
So Bisbing business fighters just getting
checked and may is talking to dudes

3284
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:43,620
through it perfectly.

3285
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,250
It was,

3286
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,270
it was amazing.

3287
01:27:45,271 --> 01:27:45,690
I was like,

3288
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:46,201
damn,

3289
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:49,330
that just shows people it may have is
really all about when those fights the

3290
01:27:49,331 --> 01:27:52,060
same time as they're doing the fight
now as the coaches are fighting.

3291
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:52,260
No,

3292
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:52,401
no.

3293
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:54,120
That's the next in the next integration.

3294
01:27:54,121 --> 01:27:55,170
When we do it on Fx,

3295
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:56,430
then it's going to be in lifetime.

3296
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:58,590
You mean December 3rd
is that what you mean?

3297
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,993
Yes,

3298
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,340
but normally eventually
it's going to be live.

3299
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:02,850
They're going to have,

3300
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,330
the fights are going to
be live on telephone.

3301
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:05,520
Television used to do it on a different,

3302
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:05,731
oh,

3303
01:28:05,731 --> 01:28:05,941
really?

3304
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:06,630
Every week.

3305
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:06,871
Yeah.

3306
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:07,490
I don't know.

3307
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,970
I don't know how they're
going to synchronize that.

3308
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,440
They're figuring it out with Fx,

3309
01:28:10,441 --> 01:28:11,490
but that's going to be amazing.

3310
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:11,730
Wow.

3311
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,250
But Damn,

3312
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,830
these 135 pounders,

3313
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:16,140
145 pounds are fucking awesome.

3314
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,670
Brian has the best idea for that.

3315
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:18,240
It goes.

3316
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,260
It's just so small.

3317
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,011
He says,

3318
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:24,910
I should come in and prance around the
octagon on ponies and make it the reason

3319
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,240
I knew Brian Red Bell.

3320
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:28,230
You said that all adorned.

3321
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,520
Then I'll let you ride a favor,

3322
01:28:29,521 --> 01:28:34,130
send you all adorned and the one 35
was it have to move around with us.

3323
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:36,570
That would be awesome.

3324
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:39,550
Horns and stuff.

3325
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,260
I can't participate in that for that

3326
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:48,530
and I feel like little lines
and then they're lying.

3327
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,473
Crossers

3328
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,833
flux are,

3329
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,190
I don't even know what to do.

3330
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:56,130
That little prancing when
it gets down on one knee,

3331
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,013
like

3332
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:59,710
very regal.

3333
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:02,190
Would it be a pony with
the hair over the hubs

3334
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,090
to be an extra blessing and to have that
extra hair that just blossoms run their

3335
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:06,990
Budweiser ponies.

3336
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:11,760
So what the fuck is that
one of the fighter route is
that man weird fucking dust

3337
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,850
covers they have over their feet and shit.

3338
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,750
That man their feet.

3339
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:17,670
Somebody make that,

3340
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:18,920
they invent that horse.

3341
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:19,741
It's like dog breeding.

3342
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:20,060
They just,

3343
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,050
that's all they could do with horses.

3344
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:21,901
Is that what they did?

3345
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:22,261
Maybe.

3346
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:22,650
Maybe.

3347
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:22,980
Right.

3348
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,610
Well the,

3349
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:25,020
a bunch of different breeds.

3350
01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:25,950
Apparently we were wrong.

3351
01:29:25,951 --> 01:29:26,784
And the Indians,

3352
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:29,640
a new agriculture before the,

3353
01:29:29,641 --> 01:29:29,841
uh,

3354
01:29:29,841 --> 01:29:33,500
the white man and they taught the
white man had to grow corn and uh,

3355
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,260
be,

3356
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:38,880
they apparently might have even had
horses before European settlers,

3357
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,050
but the ink is didn't,

3358
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,960
the Incas didn't know
about the horse cause,

3359
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:44,730
but there might've been some
other horses that were left.

3360
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:45,980
They also think that the,

3361
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,260
the first settlers in America
might've been the Chinese.

3362
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,070
Really?

3363
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:50,251
Yeah.

3364
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:52,470
The Chinese might have found
from the Bering strait.

3365
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:52,980
Yeah,

3366
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:53,101
no,

3367
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:53,251
yeah,

3368
01:29:53,251 --> 01:29:53,760
we do that.

3369
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,240
We've got the one.

3370
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:54,351
No,

3371
01:29:54,351 --> 01:29:54,420
no,

3372
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:54,541
no.

3373
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:55,374
Not that.

3374
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,330
The Siberians I mean,

3375
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:58,164
on boats.

3376
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,130
Yeah.

3377
01:29:59,130 --> 01:29:59,431
Yeah.

3378
01:29:59,431 --> 01:29:59,851
There's,

3379
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:00,740
there's a,

3380
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,890
I believe there's,

3381
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,810
there's a bunch of pump,

3382
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:03,271
you know,

3383
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:06,330
there's a bunch of history
that's obviously lost in
North America because North

3384
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:09,630
America used to be covered in a glacier
and the gray shirt fucking crushed

3385
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:12,450
everything and melted and created
the Great Lakes and all that shit.

3386
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:13,500
But there,

3387
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,440
the other thing I mostly Filipinos
and they'll always look somewhat,

3388
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,603
you know,

3389
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,151
Mexican,

3390
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:19,950
they look sort of Mexican for the Asians.

3391
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,110
And I talked to Edwin San Juan
yesterday and it was like,

3392
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:22,231
yeah,

3393
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:24,770
the Spanish came and rape
the fuck out of both the,

3394
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,540
my name is Edwin San Juan San Juan,

3395
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:28,374
and I'm an Asian.

3396
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:29,191
Yeah.

3397
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:29,560
Crazy.

3398
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,393
Yeah.

3399
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,800
Well that's a Filipinos.

3400
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,251
It's a weird,

3401
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:34,290
it's a Chinese and the
Chinese and Spanish.

3402
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:34,861
So they must have,

3403
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:35,591
the Chinese must have like,

3404
01:30:35,591 --> 01:30:38,310
just when not the Asians must
have just gone on both that way.

3405
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:39,144
Going West,

3406
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,240
we were going use,

3407
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,700
they found cocaine,

3408
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:45,270
they found cocaine residue in
some Faroes something or another.

3409
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:48,120
They found evidence of
cocaine use in ancient Egypt.

3410
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,510
And what's insane about that as cocaine
can only be grown in South America,

3411
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,530
can't be growing and in relationships.

3412
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,433
Yeah,

3413
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:56,360
the climate doesn't suit it.

3414
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,200
I don't know.

3415
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,970
Part of the time they think that
they might've been on a fucking ship.

3416
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,130
The other possibility is
that the climate was way,

3417
01:31:02,131 --> 01:31:03,270
way different back then.

3418
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:03,961
I don't know if that,

3419
01:31:03,961 --> 01:31:06,360
I'm sure they have a pretty
detailed record of the can also be,

3420
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:06,630
weren't,

3421
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:09,580
didn't some people used to bring stuff
from other parts of the world we,

3422
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:09,721
yeah,

3423
01:31:09,721 --> 01:31:11,130
but they were saying by boats,

3424
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:13,140
they didn't know that people
were traveling the globe.

3425
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,460
That that mean that we are
talking about 2,500 BC,

3426
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,420
but we do know that they
have boats back then.

3427
01:31:18,421 --> 01:31:21,720
There's some really detailed
boats that they found in tombs,

3428
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,980
like incredible boats,

3429
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:25,770
like big giant put together
boats inside tombs,

3430
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,281
you know,

3431
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,080
so that we know that they could get on,

3432
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:28,943
maybe not,

3433
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:29,221
you know,

3434
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:30,060
across the ocean,

3435
01:31:30,061 --> 01:31:30,840
but they could,

3436
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,111
they were,

3437
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,420
they definitely had the
concept of boats down,

3438
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,630
you know?

3439
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:35,150
Yeah.

3440
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:35,983
But yeah,

3441
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,733
I was just going to say,

3442
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,050
so the people that like that,

3443
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:42,270
like live in North America,

3444
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:42,481
I'm like,

3445
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:44,190
this whole thing used
to be covered in ice,

3446
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,233
so there's not,

3447
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,250
there's not that many
people that were here.

3448
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:48,600
Everybody sort of eventually went,

3449
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:48,781
oh,

3450
01:31:48,781 --> 01:31:49,920
this is open now.

3451
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:50,943
And then,

3452
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,220
then people stormed in there,

3453
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:54,054
just jumped,

3454
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,871
look at all the space.

3455
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:55,560
It's crazy,

3456
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,490
crazy how it happened.

3457
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:58,980
If you look at like the
evolution of the earth,

3458
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,321
you know,

3459
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:02,600
and like the progress of
people moving around it.

3460
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:06,260
A very strange thing that
this one awesome spot that uh,

3461
01:32:06,261 --> 01:32:10,090
used to be connected to everything
was completely empty except for it's,

3462
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,160
you said a few tribes have no,

3463
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:13,683
yeah.

3464
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:14,351
Really.

3465
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:15,610
I mean there's just a tiny,

3466
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:16,121
tiny number.

3467
01:32:16,121 --> 01:32:17,500
So much extra real estate.

3468
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:17,780
Yeah.

3469
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:18,613
It's what a crazy,

3470
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:20,281
go somewhere else with it.

3471
01:32:20,281 --> 01:32:20,981
We go with the Buffalo.

3472
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:21,431
Go to,

3473
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:22,264
let's wait.

3474
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,660
Where's your house for though?

3475
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:28,260
With the buffalo is for the short period
of time that when the Indians were like

3476
01:32:28,261 --> 01:32:28,710
in the,

3477
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:32,830
like in the best situation before the
white men found out what the fuck was over

3478
01:32:32,831 --> 01:32:33,460
here.

3479
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,350
This must've been the dopest playground.

3480
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,160
Aw.

3481
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:36,820
Yeah.

3482
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,020
They had a whole continent.

3483
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,463
Talk about too far.

3484
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,080
Is this Christ big foot's well,

3485
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:44,914
yeah.

3486
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,190
There's a lot of things that can kill
you and Jaguars and shit like that.

3487
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:52,360
What's really crazy is that just 10,000
years ago there were saber tooth tigers.

3488
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,070
Wrap your head around that.

3489
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:55,590
That's just town thousand years ago.

3490
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,200
Long three points.

3491
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:56,640
Yeah.

3492
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,370
Cool.

3493
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,240
But don't want to be cool.

3494
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:59,800
Wild fucking animal.

3495
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:00,400
That was,

3496
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:05,200
it had swords and its skull big giant
swords that came out and it would just

3497
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:07,080
slash open your neck with these sores.

3498
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,380
Both lifestyle.

3499
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:08,710
Yeah.

3500
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:10,040
Eyeball pop out care.

3501
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,890
You're fucking both fighters style.

3502
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:17,020
You see that video or the video to the
image of the bull fighter that got Gordon

3503
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,350
Spain was brain his face through his face.

3504
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:21,370
Right through his eyeball.

3505
01:33:21,371 --> 01:33:23,020
It shows the horn popping out.

3506
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,400
These was out?

3507
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:24,621
No,

3508
01:33:24,621 --> 01:33:24,791
no,

3509
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:25,810
it's paralyzed,

3510
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,110
uh,

3511
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,630
paralyzed that side of his face.

3512
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,470
It's amazing how quick it happened
to the videos or it's just like,

3513
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:34,400
just having goes down here,

3514
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:36,400
you see the gazelle leaping over the guys.

3515
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,091
Oh my God,

3516
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:38,500
I heard them talking about
that or the other day,

3517
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:40,540
this gaming guy from wherever that was.

3518
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,373
Explain what it is.

3519
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:41,700
Oh,

3520
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,350
okay.

3521
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:43,390
Because not everybody lives.

3522
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,280
Zol has six players.

3523
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:45,940
There's this,

3524
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:48,010
there's this bike path in South Africa,

3525
01:33:48,011 --> 01:33:52,510
South Africa and it's in like the
reservation are reserved for animals.

3526
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:53,200
Yeah.

3527
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,130
And this gazelle,

3528
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:54,520
just,

3529
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,000
this guy's taping his buddy ahead of them
and they're both biking and this cause

3530
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:59,320
they'll just suddenly runs in a screen,

3531
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:02,470
tries to jump over this biker
as he's speeding down this path.

3532
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:02,921
Yeah.

3533
01:34:02,921 --> 01:34:03,161
Just,

3534
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:07,270
he doesn't see the guy coming in quick
enough and the Gazelle runs into him or

3535
01:34:07,271 --> 01:34:07,571
whatever.

3536
01:34:07,571 --> 01:34:08,404
It knocks it down.

3537
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,690
Big deer like animal,

3538
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,250
but hit him full clip going
like 40 miles an hour.

3539
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:19,450
He goes flying lands on his fucking
head and then noises he was making.

3540
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:19,890
It was like,

3541
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:20,100
Hey,

3542
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:20,933
oh noises.

3543
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,090
That's Kao noises.

3544
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,410
When someone gets knocked out of it,

3545
01:34:23,411 --> 01:34:24,071
when they're waking up,

3546
01:34:24,071 --> 01:34:24,571
they make noise.

3547
01:34:24,571 --> 01:34:25,404
Like you see his helmet,

3548
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:27,640
his helmet shattered,

3549
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:28,930
just a hole in it.

3550
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:29,141
We're like,

3551
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:29,291
yeah,

3552
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:29,831
that's what that was.

3553
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:31,880
Or your brain would look like right
now if you weren't wearing a home,

3554
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,250
that's scary as fuck dude.

3555
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:34,510
Get the hose hit dead on.

3556
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:34,781
Yeah,

3557
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:38,140
he could've died for sure if he didn't
have a helmet on his head and up and

3558
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:39,550
smushy they said this,

3559
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:42,880
this reserve guys said the sun
was probably in the gazelles.

3560
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:46,930
I angle was coming in that way or
whatever and he just saw him at the last

3561
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,130
second because he was speeding
faster than normal I guess.

3562
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:49,964
So it was just like,

3563
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:50,371
you know,

3564
01:34:50,371 --> 01:34:52,480
he just timed it and they saw
him and let's try to jump over.

3565
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:53,650
There's a great video.

3566
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:54,560
Online wasn't a tie.

3567
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:58,580
This is a great video in line of a guy
on a motorcycle with a camera in the

3568
01:34:58,581 --> 01:34:59,450
front of his motorcycle.

3569
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:00,800
He's carving through canyons

3570
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:07,970
and he hits a deer and you see one
frame where you see the deer's face.

3571
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:08,690
Oh,

3572
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,130
fucking bad ass.

3573
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,291
Boom.

3574
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,890
And he just goes fucking fine.

3575
01:35:13,891 --> 01:35:16,580
And you see the camera flying
through the air and spins,

3576
01:35:16,581 --> 01:35:17,480
and then it goes black.

3577
01:35:17,481 --> 01:35:19,490
And then it shows the
guy he actually survived.

3578
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:20,780
He got laid out,

3579
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:21,950
his bike is destroyed,

3580
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:23,090
and he just flipped and,

3581
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:23,924
but he was wearing,

3582
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:24,560
you know,

3583
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,460
it actually says,

3584
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,350
make sure you were always
wear a helmet and we're,

3585
01:35:27,351 --> 01:35:28,640
we're leather men.

3586
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:29,750
He was like covered in like a,

3587
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,051
you know,

3588
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:31,520
like one of those racers,

3589
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:35,180
Tom outfits that you can actually kind
of take a little bit of an impact with it

3590
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:35,420
on.

3591
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,940
It's not because you're sliding down.

3592
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:38,831
That's what happened.

3593
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:39,320
A Harris,

3594
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,900
it was sliding down the street
and just ripping the skin off.

3595
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:42,763
But when you hit it,

3596
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,530
you hit a deer and 60 miles an hour.

3597
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:46,740
It ain't that like,

3598
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,310
it's sliding.

3599
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,280
You're going flying,

3600
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:49,691
you're,

3601
01:35:49,691 --> 01:35:50,990
you're going to fly through the air.

3602
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,063
Everything's flying.

3603
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,690
You don't know what the
fuck is going to happen.

3604
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:55,430
You just hit a deer and it's just,

3605
01:35:55,431 --> 01:35:56,540
you're going way too fast.

3606
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,560
You took on that speed,

3607
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,630
you're on something
that's like 3000 pounds,

3608
01:35:59,631 --> 01:35:59,901
but no,

3609
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:00,540
not that heavy.

3610
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:00,891
What is it?

3611
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:01,730
What does a motorcycle or whatever,

3612
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:02,564
but he's a hundred pounds,

3613
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:03,621
500 pounds,

3614
01:36:03,621 --> 01:36:04,454
600 pounds,

3615
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:06,470
one of those like Ninjas or you're just,

3616
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:07,670
your body goes that fast.

3617
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,900
It's like you're going 60 miles an hour.

3618
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:12,110
You keep going 60 it's ridiculously fast.

3619
01:36:12,111 --> 01:36:13,670
Those things are so crazy.

3620
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:14,151
You know,

3621
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:16,960
I see them on the highway
sometimes just fucking by

3622
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,500
the weirdest thing ever that that's legal.

3623
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:24,840
I mean this is like what
a massive risk taking of,

3624
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,890
we have a high waist in
California for people don't know.

3625
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:30,530
Most rational states
all across this country.

3626
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:32,030
You have to stay in your fucking lane.

3627
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:32,421
All right?

3628
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:33,770
You can't just drive in the middle.

3629
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,551
In California,

3630
01:36:34,551 --> 01:36:39,230
they let motorcycles drive in between
the fucking cars and I dunno who says

3631
01:36:39,231 --> 01:36:42,770
that's okay and they often hit your
side mirrors and it happened twice.

3632
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:43,791
I've had it happen.

3633
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:44,624
I've had it happen.

3634
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:46,400
They just go right through it.

3635
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:49,160
Especially those dudes are those
big crazy fat Harley bikes.

3636
01:36:49,161 --> 01:36:50,840
You know those things
aren't that nimble man.

3637
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:54,110
What are those guys even trying like
the ones with the big ass like that.

3638
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,990
The storage containers on the side
trying to go in between lanes.

3639
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:58,730
What is this?

3640
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:00,380
What's up with these handlebars?

3641
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:00,810
I don't know.

3642
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:02,270
These handlebars where
they look like they're,

3643
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:03,860
they're like lower,

3644
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:04,410
lower,

3645
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:07,130
no more rocky on the top of the stairs.

3646
01:37:07,131 --> 01:37:10,130
In Philadelphia they get more
attention because it's like,

3647
01:37:10,131 --> 01:37:10,551
hey,

3648
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:11,361
look at me.

3649
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:15,720
I'm on allow motorcycle cycle for person
fruit folks looking or not looking or

3650
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,760
rather listening at home.

3651
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:21,720
We're doing the arms up in the air
thing where they call them hangars,

3652
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:22,623
ape hangers.

3653
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,493
That's what they call them.

3654
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:27,140
The crazy handlebars
that are like super tall,

3655
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:27,891
right to live,

3656
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:28,471
live the ride.

3657
01:37:28,471 --> 01:37:32,060
Your motorcycle motorcycles
must be so much fucking fun.

3658
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:32,894
Now think about it.

3659
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:36,200
People get together in groups and
they all just ride around together.

3660
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,730
I want to get that fat tire one,

3661
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,780
the one that has the really,

3662
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,460
that's a big one.

3663
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:42,680
Get the trials handling call dude.

3664
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,710
The Tri Cycle one.

3665
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,280
I think those fat tire ones
are just kind of cool looking.

3666
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,680
But I think if you want
a bike that handles,

3667
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:49,514
you know,

3668
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,090
mean a sport bike is like a bike
that would handle really good.

3669
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:54,020
But like,

3670
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:54,501
you know,

3671
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:56,160
you get like a balanced road bike.

3672
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,500
This tricycle motorcycles look fine.

3673
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:00,720
I need them to not be as,

3674
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,021
uh,

3675
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:02,190
as dom looking to,

3676
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:02,960
you know,

3677
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,980
tries to go motorcycles.

3678
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,351
Yeah,

3679
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:05,850
they do look a little look at me.

3680
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:06,230
Yeah.

3681
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:08,130
Somebody does fat Tuesday
has Corey Holcomb.

3682
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,440
Cory does.

3683
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,441
And it's like,

3684
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:11,274
what is this?

3685
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:11,641
Yeah,

3686
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:12,570
you're talking about an aren't ya?

3687
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,081
Oh,

3688
01:38:13,081 --> 01:38:13,510
that's all.

3689
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:14,343
Is that what it is?

3690
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:15,991
You're talking about it.

3691
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:16,824
So he got ya.

3692
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:17,670
He likes it.

3693
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:17,821
Oh,

3694
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:18,271
that's funny.

3695
01:38:18,271 --> 01:38:20,310
So much attention toward
that dude's really funny.

3696
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,520
He's hilarious.

3697
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,490
When does he have a
special or anything out?

3698
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,413
I Dunno.

3699
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,310
I Dunno.

3700
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:29,490
Ideas always talks about how he was
talking about when we did the NAB show in

3701
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:30,720
Toronto two years ago.

3702
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,950
I was like summer before this one,

3703
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,253
um,

3704
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,070
that he had this bit about,

3705
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:40,590
the worst thing about your girl having
a miscarriage is that you have to act

3706
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:41,424
upset.

3707
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,080
Oh he's acts out it

3708
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,110
does happen.

3709
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:50,820
And he does it for like
a while and then you see,

3710
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:54,130
I'm like reaches handover and go gosh

3711
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,420
flush.

3712
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,310
That's hilarious.

3713
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,590
Yeah that's a for I hear your,

3714
01:39:02,591 --> 01:39:06,930
your pain about one and a
half of a sack to me I feel.

3715
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:07,590
Yeah.

3716
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:08,490
You know a lot of comments.

3717
01:39:08,491 --> 01:39:09,400
I got roped in over there.

3718
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:10,350
No.

3719
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:11,110
Oh yeah,

3720
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:15,210
no though we all know them and we all
know what happens but becomes their life

3721
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:18,720
when it's just a weird thing that you
get connected to someone like you.

3722
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:19,631
They're inescapable.

3723
01:39:19,631 --> 01:39:22,650
And we were supposed to hook up three
times and that was supposed to be it for

3724
01:39:22,651 --> 01:39:23,484
our story.

3725
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,470
We're not supposed to be
spending 30 years together.

3726
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:26,040
Yeah,

3727
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,270
that's a weird thing man.

3728
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,253
It's a weird thing.

3729
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:29,370
They're getting that operation.

3730
01:39:29,371 --> 01:39:33,210
Just the print out some fake medical
records saying that you have a past family

3731
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:33,680
history.

3732
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,320
Here's the weird thing.

3733
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,000
So every time I hear something like that,

3734
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:37,560
like the only real excuse to not do it,

3735
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:38,700
it's something ridiculous like that.

3736
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,750
It's almost like joking.

3737
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,051
No,

3738
01:39:40,051 --> 01:39:40,210
no.

3739
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:42,080
Just how you do they have with case farms,

3740
01:39:42,081 --> 01:39:42,914
you just in it.

3741
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,123
I mean if it's got,

3742
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,030
we're going to think in terms of that.

3743
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:46,290
You could definitely have a mastectomy.

3744
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:51,030
I think they have a pill for men
that they're working on it forever.

3745
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,560
Since I was,

3746
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,850
since I just started fucking,

3747
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,040
I would think that it's going
to kill your deck though.

3748
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:56,761
I would think.

3749
01:39:56,761 --> 01:39:58,650
Did any pill that just the board said,

3750
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,191
yeah,

3751
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:02,400
I think any pill that probably
like it's going to affect your day.

3752
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:06,960
What if they cut it with like
Viagara 90% so it's like,

3753
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:07,111
hey,

3754
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:07,530
whatever.

3755
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:08,130
Everything good.

3756
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:09,980
Could you imagine if that happened and uh,

3757
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:11,970
only sole as babies were born.

3758
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:15,270
It's not that starts the apocalypse.

3759
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:19,980
It's not only conceive soulless babies,

3760
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,340
they come out with fucking Parana teeth.

3761
01:40:22,341 --> 01:40:23,500
You just need the way out of the post.

3762
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:24,780
No eyeballs.

3763
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,133
Yeah.

3764
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:28,410
That's what starts it.

3765
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,640
There's so many different scenarios
as to what's going to start it.

3766
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,670
What's going to start the Zombie apart.

3767
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:35,970
We all agree it's going to start.

3768
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,590
There will be a Zombie
apocalypse at some point.

3769
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:40,110
Well we all know that there's too
many fucking people for the amount of

3770
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:44,010
resources that we have in this one area
that we've all chosen to reside in and

3771
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:47,220
eventually that Shit's going to fall
apart if we don't figure out this whole

3772
01:40:47,221 --> 01:40:49,410
petro chemical dependency thing.

3773
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,270
We're eventually gonna
run out of fucking oil.

3774
01:40:51,271 --> 01:40:51,541
I mean,

3775
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:54,430
whether it's a 500 years from now
or 10 years grand scheme of it,

3776
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:55,360
we're running oil,

3777
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:59,500
there'll be mass extinction and it start
over with the amount of people we can

3778
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:01,330
handle with no oil.

3779
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,470
Good luck with all that.

3780
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:05,560
He loved the walking
home and smelling rotten.

3781
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:06,250
Good luck.

3782
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:11,250
20 to 40 hours joy that shit and worrying
about who's going to eat your dog

3783
01:41:11,951 --> 01:41:12,784
tonight.

3784
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,010
You know,

3785
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:17,020
cause they need those times and then you
smell it cooking and you look over the

3786
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:20,620
window and you see your fucking neighbors
chewing on your dog looking like

3787
01:41:20,621 --> 01:41:21,350
fucking monster.

3788
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:25,280
Like I hate my fucking dog hungry.

3789
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:26,531
Yeah.

3790
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:27,570
People got gonna start eating dogs.

3791
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:28,660
I think I was studying people.

3792
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,910
We're going to realize we're going
to have to eat some of each other.

3793
01:41:30,911 --> 01:41:32,260
There's just too many to go around.

3794
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,970
That's where mad cow comes from.

3795
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,990
Cows eating each other in the
grand cow disease comes from,

3796
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,910
it's called Jacob's Crutchfield.

3797
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:42,850
I think that's the name of the
official name of the disease.

3798
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:43,870
Um,

3799
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:46,120
it comes from cows being forced,

3800
01:41:46,121 --> 01:41:49,600
fed brain tissue can on the grant.

3801
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:54,280
And this same exact disease
manifests itself amongst cannibals.

3802
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:55,990
When cannibals eat their,

3803
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:56,141
uh,

3804
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:57,670
their rivals brains,

3805
01:41:58,030 --> 01:41:59,020
they get sick,

3806
01:41:59,200 --> 01:41:59,911
but then realized that,

3807
01:41:59,911 --> 01:42:00,744
that you get the shakes.

3808
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:03,220
Yes.

3809
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,600
The book of Eli is,

3810
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,011
it wasn't.

3811
01:42:05,011 --> 01:42:06,060
So that wasn't a movie.

3812
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,060
The book of your life in the mood.

3813
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:08,290
Yeah,

3814
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:09,123
that's true,

3815
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:09,993
dude.

3816
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:10,620
That's right.

3817
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:11,830
I may or may not have been in the book.

3818
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:13,590
Probably wasn't in the original,

3819
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:14,770
but it is true.

3820
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,450
The same shitty ending of the book.

3821
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:19,920
Why did I watch this
whole thing with this?

3822
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:24,210
That was a brutal ending in
to find out that he's blind.

3823
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:26,570
I don't see it doesn't pay off.

3824
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,550
He's blind the whole time,

3825
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:29,950
but he's not really the
whole things in Braille.

3826
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:30,990
And he's the only one that can read it.

3827
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,380
It's got the message of the Bible.

3828
01:42:32,381 --> 01:42:33,410
That's what he was living for us.

3829
01:42:33,411 --> 01:42:34,244
So we can move,

3830
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:35,620
make the Bible live along.

3831
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,211
And by the way,

3832
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:39,280
what's the translation
is an ancient Hebrew,

3833
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,393
all English,

3834
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:41,000
all English.

3835
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:41,711
She's given the gift.

3836
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:42,400
Who knows it by heart.

3837
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,170
All English to fucking cunts.

3838
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,543
How dare he,

3839
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:47,110
I can put it in a library,

3840
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:48,473
but it is a thing.

3841
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:52,060
Apparently that is the disease
when people get the shakes.

3842
01:42:52,061 --> 01:42:52,450
Yeah.

3843
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:53,280
From that,

3844
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,420
there was something else we talked
about last week that we shouldn't,

3845
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:57,700
I don't know if you knew about that.

3846
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:02,740
I funds not being built this time around
in China really being built in Brazil.

3847
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:03,923
Riley,

3848
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:06,070
this new iPhone is being built in Brazil.

3849
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,193
Brazil.

3850
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:08,620
Hopefully they don't have as many.

3851
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:10,650
So we were talking about sweatshops.

3852
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:11,650
I don't,

3853
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,371
I don't know man.

3854
01:43:12,371 --> 01:43:14,980
I think they took a lot of heat
from what happened in China.

3855
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:15,540
They,

3856
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,600
they have these Foxconn studios,

3857
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,250
right?

3858
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:23,250
It's Foxconn studios at 420,000 people
working 15 hours a day for $175 a month

3859
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:27,460
and no air conditioning
and hot fucking China.

3860
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:28,960
And does anyone have air
conditioning in China

3861
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:31,700
like that?

3862
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:31,931
Real?

3863
01:43:31,931 --> 01:43:32,621
They know it exists.

3864
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:33,640
It's not like a ghost.

3865
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:36,550
I read this thing that they were talking
about Perry or Romney or one of those

3866
01:43:36,551 --> 01:43:37,860
guys wherever first Massachusetts.

3867
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,850
I literally don't care
about politics at all,

3868
01:43:39,851 --> 01:43:40,750
but some of it interests me.

3869
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:41,441
But like,

3870
01:43:41,441 --> 01:43:41,890
uh,

3871
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:42,510
there were saying how,

3872
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:42,730
oh,

3873
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:47,120
well the unemployment premiums went
up there up to 14% in Massachusetts.

3874
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:48,250
So that shows how bad they are.

3875
01:43:48,251 --> 01:43:50,140
That 43% higher than the national average.

3876
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,261
And then somebody like,

3877
01:43:51,261 --> 01:43:51,980
yeah,

3878
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,300
but when I institute this thing,

3879
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:54,320
it was 20% over.

3880
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,640
It's down to 14%.

3881
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,170
You can't just say,

3882
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:57,950
I don't know why.

3883
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:59,360
What were you saying that
I just thought of this,

3884
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:00,970
uh,

3885
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:02,100
the people in Foxconn.

3886
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:02,421
Oh yeah,

3887
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:02,611
yeah.

3888
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:02,921
It was like,

3889
01:44:02,921 --> 01:44:05,020
what if no one in China has
air conditioning and it's not,

3890
01:44:05,021 --> 01:44:06,400
that sounds way worse,

3891
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:07,420
but yeah.

3892
01:44:07,421 --> 01:44:08,290
But either way,

3893
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,760
that's extreme.

3894
01:44:09,761 --> 01:44:10,650
Hundred 70 bucks a month.

3895
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:15,670
You're so cheap and a family of
suicide and suicide nets all around the

3896
01:44:17,831 --> 01:44:18,664
building.

3897
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:23,890
So this conversation you have
to decide that's wow that,

3898
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:26,050
that there's like millions
of people that work there.

3899
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:26,801
It's all this conversation.

3900
01:44:26,801 --> 01:44:30,340
Yet there's millions of people there
that that the rate is actually lower than

3901
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:31,691
the national average.

3902
01:44:31,691 --> 01:44:33,340
The national average that's,

3903
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:34,050
yes,

3904
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:34,420
it is.

3905
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:34,841
It is.

3906
01:44:34,841 --> 01:44:39,430
Is that it's actually 420,000 people
that are employed there and their rate is

3907
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:41,080
slightly below the national rate.

3908
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:41,410
Wow.

3909
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:43,570
So really it's not about them being like,

3910
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,411
oh look how bad the other,

3911
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:45,250
you have to have suicide notes.

3912
01:44:45,251 --> 01:44:45,461
I was like,

3913
01:44:45,461 --> 01:44:45,601
no,

3914
01:44:45,601 --> 01:44:45,671
no.

3915
01:44:45,671 --> 01:44:47,520
Look how above and beyond
they're going lead.

3916
01:44:47,521 --> 01:44:51,700
The real question is how many of
those people kill themselves at work?

3917
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:53,783
[inaudible]

3918
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:54,610
right,

3919
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:55,240
exactly.

3920
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,260
That's why it's depressing.

3921
01:44:56,261 --> 01:44:56,700
It's funny.

3922
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,200
How many times have you heard like
post office and his guys going in and

3923
01:44:59,201 --> 01:45:01,780
shooting up the place or
just happen at Seal Beach?

3924
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:05,470
Supposedly one of the employees just
killed like eight people there at that an

3925
01:45:05,471 --> 01:45:05,791
employee.

3926
01:45:05,791 --> 01:45:06,940
I thought that was a boyfriend.

3927
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:07,181
Oh,

3928
01:45:07,181 --> 01:45:07,510
was it?

3929
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,650
I thought it was a guy that worked there.

3930
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:09,850
I could see wanting to kill yourself.

3931
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,541
If you work in an album,

3932
01:45:10,541 --> 01:45:13,420
I don't know that an apple
plant for months and months
and they come in one day.

3933
01:45:13,421 --> 01:45:13,930
It's like guys,

3934
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:15,410
big announcement and if it
stops working for a second,

3935
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:16,041
it's like we're,

3936
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:16,610
we're here.

3937
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:17,620
We just got a great review

3938
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:19,490
and the Gawker and be like,

3939
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:19,940
oh,

3940
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:20,540
okay,

3941
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,080
excuse me,

3942
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:22,070
and just go up to the roof

3943
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:23,660
and just fucking ended.

3944
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:24,550
It hasn't,

3945
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,810
you know,

3946
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,460
I think it's probably
one of these things that,

3947
01:45:26,461 --> 01:45:26,791
yeah,

3948
01:45:26,791 --> 01:45:29,670
whatever they're making like
$200 a month or whatever it is.

3949
01:45:29,671 --> 01:45:31,360
Even once every fuck once if I,

3950
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,580
I think if anything it's,

3951
01:45:33,581 --> 01:45:37,350
it's probably in around them like how
much does rice costs and things like that.

3952
01:45:37,351 --> 01:45:38,770
You know what I mean?

3953
01:45:38,771 --> 01:45:38,911
It's,

3954
01:45:38,911 --> 01:45:41,310
you can get a hold back
for $5 first of all,

3955
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,410
I know where you live sucks horribly,

3956
01:45:43,411 --> 01:45:44,640
but you don't need to escape.

3957
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:44,990
Well,

3958
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:46,890
what do you want to retirement?

3959
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,071
Well,

3960
01:45:47,071 --> 01:45:50,400
you can retire on a bag of rice and it's
also giving them a place to live though

3961
01:45:50,401 --> 01:45:50,731
too,

3962
01:45:50,731 --> 01:45:51,990
which is not most jobs.

3963
01:45:51,991 --> 01:45:52,141
Yeah,

3964
01:45:52,141 --> 01:45:53,310
you might get paid shitty,

3965
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:54,150
but you're awesome at getting,

3966
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:55,163
you know,

3967
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,033
getting into live.

3968
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:59,300
Do you're living in a dormitory
stacked on top of each other that,

3969
01:45:59,360 --> 01:45:59,680
and there's,

3970
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,370
they're not making enough money
to like buy a house somewhere.

3971
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:02,581
I mean,

3972
01:46:02,581 --> 01:46:03,331
what are they gonna do?

3973
01:46:03,331 --> 01:46:08,331
They're just going to get wrung out to
dry drained of your humanity just so that

3974
01:46:09,061 --> 01:46:09,894
we can have phones,

3975
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:10,351
but what are,

3976
01:46:10,351 --> 01:46:10,950
what are,

3977
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:11,850
what are the other Pete,

3978
01:46:11,851 --> 01:46:14,170
which is we're where that factory is or,

3979
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:18,000
or their houses or people living in
like on boats is a good question.

3980
01:46:18,001 --> 01:46:18,181
Like,

3981
01:46:18,181 --> 01:46:18,511
you know,

3982
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:22,530
maybe that reality is so much better
than the Zombie apocalypse that they were

3983
01:46:22,531 --> 01:46:25,800
living in before this fucking Chinese
sweatshop factory opened up and they're

3984
01:46:25,801 --> 01:46:27,150
probably getting medical on that.

3985
01:46:27,151 --> 01:46:27,984
I'm not sure if they do.

3986
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,073
They probably are.

3987
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:31,910
Everybody sort of wants to say like,

3988
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:32,101
well,

3989
01:46:32,101 --> 01:46:32,551
maybe if it's,

3990
01:46:32,551 --> 01:46:33,540
everything is okay,

3991
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:35,220
but the reality is it's sweatshop itself.

3992
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,193
It is a sweat shop.

3993
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,190
You don't hire children in America.

3994
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:38,430
Right.

3995
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:42,390
We had to make a law and it sucks what
other people do pay them shittily and

3996
01:46:42,391 --> 01:46:42,661
it's like,

3997
01:46:42,661 --> 01:46:42,781
yeah,

3998
01:46:42,781 --> 01:46:43,620
of course we're going to have it there.

3999
01:46:43,621 --> 01:46:44,100
It's cheaper.

4000
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,020
And then you realize Microsoft,

4001
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:47,010
Sony,

4002
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:50,040
every single fucking company
does the exact same thing.

4003
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,690
Even at Fox con.

4004
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,080
Well that's,

4005
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:52,381
you know,

4006
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:53,800
it's really interesting is I try,

4007
01:46:53,801 --> 01:46:54,530
I said,

4008
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,400
I wrote this on Twitter and I wrote us on,

4009
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:57,121
on the message board.

4010
01:46:57,121 --> 01:46:57,510
I said,

4011
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:01,650
what about a phone called the iPhone Karma
and what it is is a phone that's made

4012
01:47:01,651 --> 01:47:02,484
in America.

4013
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:05,040
You pay people a good wage.

4014
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:05,251
Yeah,

4015
01:47:05,251 --> 01:47:08,160
you pay them a good wage and I'll pay
double for your phone and you're better to

4016
01:47:08,161 --> 01:47:11,850
have a sticker where everyone else can
see that you're paying fucking sell

4017
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:12,840
hundreds

4018
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:19,820
be such a great lesson that it might not,

4019
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,250
it might not be a moneymaker.

4020
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,530
No.

4021
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:22,770
You know,

4022
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,603
they would never do it.

4023
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:26,520
One of the guys that have maybe also be
admitting that they were doing something

4024
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,300
bad on the other end.

4025
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,080
Exactly.

4026
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,840
One of the guests were message boards
said that they should have an iPhone Karma

4027
01:47:30,841 --> 01:47:31,680
and then an iPhone.

4028
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:36,710
I think he's evil tyranny as and it's
like super cheap and is support the dark

4029
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:44,001
lord as they fucking drop bombs
from olive green color to it.

4030
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:47,250
It's made out of flesh of Afghany babies.

4031
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:48,480
Even even like the shirts,

4032
01:47:48,481 --> 01:47:50,280
they even tee shirts and clothing,

4033
01:47:50,281 --> 01:47:51,130
like half of that shit.

4034
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:53,450
It comes from even worse
conditions than Foxconn,

4035
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:54,110
you know?

4036
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:54,770
I Dunno.

4037
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:56,650
I mean it's really weird to wear.

4038
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:57,780
Where do you prioritize?

4039
01:47:57,781 --> 01:47:57,991
You know,

4040
01:47:57,991 --> 01:48:01,380
obviously it's horrible that there's
war going on right now and civilians and

4041
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:04,260
Afghanistan and Iraq are
dying and they didn't.

4042
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:05,820
It's not their fucking fault.

4043
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:07,080
And the whole thing is chaos.

4044
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,473
You can only pick one.

4045
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,910
What can you do good things to think
about that you have to go did a countries,

4046
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,720
they countries have to
make it last and be like,

4047
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:15,931
look,

4048
01:48:15,931 --> 01:48:16,080
no,

4049
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:16,980
this is illegal.

4050
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:22,100
You have to fucking have these
conditions and got by our rules.

4051
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:23,581
They don't.

4052
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:24,414
They won't do it.

4053
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:25,850
We're not worth anything anymore,

4054
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,041
man.

4055
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:26,641
We're broke.

4056
01:48:26,641 --> 01:48:27,600
We're broke as fuck.

4057
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,070
I don't even understand how that works.

4058
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:30,030
I understand how it works.

4059
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:30,930
I finally figured it out.

4060
01:48:30,931 --> 01:48:32,370
Tell these fucking podcasts.

4061
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,420
Nobody's working anymore.

4062
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:36,930
90% of you listening right
now just going to shut up.

4063
01:48:36,931 --> 01:48:37,181
Shut up.

4064
01:48:37,181 --> 01:48:38,014
You're going to ruin hitch.

4065
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:38,401
Yeah.

4066
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:40,890
There was all listen to
podcasts all day long at work.

4067
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,870
It's motherfuckers ruin
everything I think.

4068
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:45,900
I think we should just
have a country bias out.

4069
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:48,270
That's what's the most expensive country,

4070
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:48,550
right?

4071
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:49,620
We might be the most successful,

4072
01:48:49,621 --> 01:48:50,610
which is the scariest thing.

4073
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:53,880
That means that the banks of the
really key ones controlling everything.

4074
01:48:53,881 --> 01:48:55,290
If everybody's fucking broke,

4075
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,513
everybody's proud.

4076
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:00,780
There's that one country where
everybody's just fucking Bawling Jz style,

4077
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:03,120
24 seven in their underwear,

4078
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:05,490
popping bottles with models
and the top of a yacht.

4079
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:08,800
No one's doing that.

4080
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,571
Not One country.

4081
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:11,430
Then how is anybody winning
and if nobody's winning,

4082
01:49:11,431 --> 01:49:12,540
where does all the resources go?

4083
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,340
You kind of who's got the money?

4084
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:15,174
Who's got the papers?

4085
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:15,700
You've got to just,

4086
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:16,560
it's my problem with the occupy,

4087
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,850
occupy Wall Street stuff.

4088
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,650
I just don't quite understand.

4089
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:22,440
I like the rising up and
stating your mind and stuff.

4090
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:24,080
I just don't understand who
you're picketing forward,

4091
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:25,140
what results you're hoping for.

4092
01:49:25,610 --> 01:49:25,920
Well,

4093
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,140
they want change and I don't know,

4094
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:28,380
but the super rich,

4095
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,030
they're the ones,

4096
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:30,391
I mean,

4097
01:49:30,391 --> 01:49:31,060
are they going to be like,

4098
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:31,150
oh,

4099
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:32,280
I'm to not affecting me in any way.

4100
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:33,490
The good thing is what they're,

4101
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,320
they're doing is getting people to think
that this is a very unstable situation

4102
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:40,950
and because it is and that people are
fed up because they are and they should

4103
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:41,251
be.

4104
01:49:41,251 --> 01:49:44,700
This is a fucking
terrible financial system.

4105
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:45,870
It's horrible.

4106
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,040
I don't understand it.

4107
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:51,820
I know that billions of dollars had been
thrown around in the form of bailouts

4108
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:56,000
and some say much more than that if
you follow the accounting because yeah,

4109
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:59,890
they forced the force an audit and Ron
Paul had something to do with this and

4110
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:00,990
they shout out,

4111
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,840
there was just fucking,

4112
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:06,190
just insane amounts of money loaned to
all these different creepy clients all

4113
01:50:06,191 --> 01:50:10,540
over the world and bailouts just put
in left and right and it's all our tax

4114
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:10,781
money,

4115
01:50:10,781 --> 01:50:10,991
man.

4116
01:50:10,991 --> 01:50:11,741
It's all scary.

4117
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:15,400
They spent all our fucking money and
we're broke and we're in two wars at the

4118
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:16,234
same time.

4119
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:21,330
And no one has any solution that seems
to want to deviate from the current path.

4120
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:26,890
Everyone's solution is stay on the
current path and manage it better.

4121
01:50:26,891 --> 01:50:27,670
So then there,

4122
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:28,510
except Ron Paul,

4123
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:29,171
what does he know?

4124
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:30,010
He has a better solution.

4125
01:50:30,011 --> 01:50:30,281
What's his,

4126
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:31,720
how he wants everybody back.

4127
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,141
He's like,

4128
01:50:32,141 --> 01:50:32,974
this is ridiculous.

4129
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:33,551
Yeah,

4130
01:50:33,551 --> 01:50:34,271
and because of that,

4131
01:50:34,271 --> 01:50:35,470
they don't even pay attention to him.

4132
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,150
There's this new guy
that they're following.

4133
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:37,930
It was this black guy,

4134
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:38,500
the black guy.

4135
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,191
Herman pain.

4136
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:40,024
Is that what his name is?

4137
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:41,050
Haven't we had enough?

4138
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:42,873
I just kidding.

4139
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,560
He's a black Republican.

4140
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:44,851
They sent,

4141
01:50:44,851 --> 01:50:48,580
said they've sent in Mothra to battle
with Godzilla or he's not going to run.

4142
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:49,740
Fuck Jay's run.

4143
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,550
He's the black guys ahead.

4144
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:51,860
Oh,

4145
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:52,750
he's a head right now.

4146
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:52,981
Yeah.

4147
01:50:52,981 --> 01:50:53,111
Yeah.

4148
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:53,480
Okay.

4149
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,990
We need to find out if you ever
thought about robbing and shooting up.

4150
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,110
This guy is different.

4151
01:50:58,210 --> 01:50:59,570
He's such a Republican treatment.

4152
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:00,700
He says that if a,

4153
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:01,571
you don't have a job,

4154
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:02,470
that's your fault.

4155
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:03,041
Wow.

4156
01:51:03,041 --> 01:51:03,431
And that's okay.

4157
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:04,041
If you're not rich,

4158
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:04,874
it's your fault.

4159
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,220
Have you ever thought about doing that,

4160
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:06,580
Joe?

4161
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,280
Just like,

4162
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:07,520
you know,

4163
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,100
when he was retiring
in a different country,

4164
01:51:09,101 --> 01:51:09,400
I'm,

4165
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,600
I'm fucking Cat Stevens.

4166
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:12,410
Sing out was in France.

4167
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:18,070
Mostly it's us cars or cars or
traditionally our conditioning.

4168
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,753
Herman Cain,

4169
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:20,800
that's his name.

4170
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,401
Herman Cain.

4171
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:22,990
He's a very successful businessman,

4172
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:24,930
but I think a lot of those
occupy wall should be,

4173
01:51:24,931 --> 01:51:27,670
we want to do away with capitalism as a,

4174
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:28,510
you know?

4175
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:28,781
Yeah.

4176
01:51:28,781 --> 01:51:30,620
There's a lot of Hippie bitches
out there that need a punch.

4177
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:31,530
I think that's their problem.

4178
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:32,770
It's like why should 1% habit,

4179
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:34,480
we should all be equal in this long.

4180
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,340
You're proposing a giant change.

4181
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:37,890
There's a lot of no.

4182
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:38,321
Yeah,

4183
01:51:38,321 --> 01:51:39,220
that's not cool.

4184
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:39,700
You know,

4185
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,060
you don't,

4186
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,530
you don't deserve to be equal.

4187
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:41,861
Okay.

4188
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:45,730
What you deserve as a fair system to
compete in the tax breaks for the rich.

4189
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,440
It's just look so shitty.

4190
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:49,630
There should always be
benefit for performance.

4191
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,850
That's why what makes human beings excel?

4192
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,710
It should be a benefit for performance.

4193
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,820
So your ideas,

4194
01:51:54,821 --> 01:51:56,140
your socialistic nonsense,

4195
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:56,541
it's it.

4196
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:58,300
It violates human behavior.

4197
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:02,230
It violates everything that we know
about how people operate and how people

4198
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:03,064
progress.

4199
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:04,330
We like to compete with each other.

4200
01:52:04,331 --> 01:52:05,050
It's fun.

4201
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,400
We like to prove that we're worthy.

4202
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:08,150
We liked to create
things that people enjoy.

4203
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,720
We like to put out a bunch of things
and would like to be rewarded for that.

4204
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:11,860
And there's nothing wrong with that.

4205
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:12,883
Hippies.

4206
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:13,950
All right?

4207
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:16,270
Just because you can't run doesn't
mean other people can't run.

4208
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,200
Okay?

4209
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:17,860
They want to run.

4210
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,400
Let us run.

4211
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,090
Shut up.

4212
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:22,090
All it seems like they've succeeded in
doing is getting cops in trouble for

4213
01:52:22,091 --> 01:52:22,924
beating on them.

4214
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,050
We're all like one man.

4215
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:25,991
They should be new.

4216
01:52:25,991 --> 01:52:27,310
Many man,

4217
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:28,181
there should be money.

4218
01:52:28,181 --> 01:52:28,541
There's just,

4219
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:30,130
you should be a fair system.

4220
01:52:30,131 --> 01:52:33,070
It's supposed to be one piece
of gold equals one donkey.

4221
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:34,330
It's supposed to be,

4222
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:34,661
you know,

4223
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:38,800
it's supposed to be based on that problem
or 1% will still own all the gold.

4224
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:39,311
Yeah,

4225
01:52:39,311 --> 01:52:40,330
but so fucking what?

4226
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:40,611
It's,

4227
01:52:40,611 --> 01:52:42,130
it's a capitalist game,

4228
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:42,993
you know,

4229
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:45,560
trying to get a cap on it.

4230
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,011
I mean,

4231
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:47,780
it wouldn't be bad to
put a ridiculous cap.

4232
01:52:47,781 --> 01:52:51,970
Like say you can't have more than $10
billion ever and everything more than $10

4233
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:52,101
billion go.

4234
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:52,371
Yeah,

4235
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:52,791
you're right.

4236
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:55,490
Just fucking give it to charity and
you'd just be laughing in Baldwin.

4237
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,110
So wouldn't stop you from,

4238
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:57,710
you know,

4239
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:57,921
you,

4240
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:00,950
you'd still be wanting to make a lot of
money if you were that dude who was out

4241
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:01,784
there,

4242
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:02,720
you know,

4243
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,760
I can ask what am I 10 billion.

4244
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,620
Most of them don't get like that.

4245
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,560
Whatever makes a guy like bill
gates become a guy like bill gates.

4246
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:09,871
Make some,

4247
01:53:09,871 --> 01:53:12,590
keep putting in more money and
keep working until they're old men.

4248
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:13,251
You know,

4249
01:53:13,251 --> 01:53:13,940
they enjoy it.

4250
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:18,110
Bill Gates could have retired like with
windows 95 he could have just sold that

4251
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:18,944
shit.

4252
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,593
I probably would have,

4253
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:22,761
well no,

4254
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:23,594
you need a,

4255
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:28,650
you need a competitor now windows me cause
but the Mac Osx back then sucked the,

4256
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:30,860
I mean not OSX before,

4257
01:53:30,861 --> 01:53:31,700
pre Osx,

4258
01:53:31,701 --> 01:53:32,370
whatever it was.

4259
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:34,710
Steve jobs started back off.

4260
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:37,430
That's a reason I didn't want to switch
over to Mac cause because their ios nine

4261
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:39,410
or before it was really hard to use.

4262
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:42,410
You couldn't see what was open and
it was just like way harder to use.

4263
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:46,940
I remember when John Carmax started coding
for the Mac when they first started.

4264
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:50,660
Tried to port it software games
or the Mac and he was like,

4265
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:51,381
oh my God,

4266
01:53:51,381 --> 01:53:52,460
like she's things are crap.

4267
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:56,540
Like I remember they said there was no
multitasking and the operating system,

4268
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:59,870
no preemptive multitasking and no memory
protection and the things are just shut

4269
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:00,930
down crash.

4270
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:03,490
And it was like talking to me to make
a blog about how many times he had to

4271
01:54:03,491 --> 01:54:04,324
reboot,

4272
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,300
just crash.

4273
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:08,330
But then they get that Osx and
it became much better at all.

4274
01:54:08,331 --> 01:54:09,010
It's dope.

4275
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,010
It's like it's the future.

4276
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:10,701
And by the way,

4277
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:11,380
this is only,

4278
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:11,690
you know,

4279
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:12,650
obviously step one,

4280
01:54:12,651 --> 01:54:15,020
there's going to be some
new shit in like 10 years.

4281
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:18,290
It's going to make this look
like we're playing pong.

4282
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:19,500
When they did away with the,

4283
01:54:19,501 --> 01:54:19,910
with the,

4284
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:20,743
with the um,

4285
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:21,620
uh,

4286
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:22,453
just drive,

4287
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:22,881
I was like,

4288
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:23,530
what are you guys

4289
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:24,363
doing?

4290
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:26,920
The no one's you're idiots.

4291
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:28,510
We got put a floppy in.

4292
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,650
We had so many people.

4293
01:54:29,651 --> 01:54:30,461
When I worked at gateway,

4294
01:54:30,461 --> 01:54:35,461
that was right when we stopped putting
disk drives and our computers and like

4295
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:36,131
you could still,

4296
01:54:36,131 --> 01:54:36,370
we,

4297
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:40,930
we still have this external one that
you could like hook up a using USP and

4298
01:54:40,931 --> 01:54:42,370
people got so angry.

4299
01:54:42,371 --> 01:54:43,240
People come in and goes,

4300
01:54:43,241 --> 01:54:44,074
you guys are,

4301
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:47,580
we don't want change.

4302
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:49,020
They want it floppy disks.

4303
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,250
They wanted that.

4304
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,450
It's works fine.

4305
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:53,130
Why are you messing with the system?

4306
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,340
I saw one on the sidewalk the other day.

4307
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,980
I wanted to pick it up and I'm like,

4308
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:00,800
I wonder why I'm the fuck's on
this floppy disk on the sidewalk,

4309
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:01,461
but I was like,

4310
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:01,581
wait,

4311
01:55:01,581 --> 01:55:02,720
I don't even have a floppy disk.

4312
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:05,161
Hey man,

4313
01:55:05,161 --> 01:55:06,900
someday those are going to be fascinating.

4314
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:08,370
Someday they're going to be really fast.

4315
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,260
I just got rid of my floppy
disks when I the hoard it.

4316
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:11,250
You just do.

4317
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:12,160
I had some old Macquarie,

4318
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:13,200
like a script on it or something.

4319
01:55:13,201 --> 01:55:14,670
I don't think you'd be all ended
up essentially it was like,

4320
01:55:14,671 --> 01:55:15,240
Ari,

4321
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,710
you're never going to
put this in anywhere.

4322
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:17,730
Just throw it away.

4323
01:55:17,790 --> 01:55:18,151
Wow.

4324
01:55:18,151 --> 01:55:18,984
Look at that.

4325
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:20,093
I would have kept it.

4326
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:23,520
I did keep it for fucking
20 years for no reason.

4327
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:24,341
I had one,

4328
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:24,991
an old,

4329
01:55:24,991 --> 01:55:25,351
old,

4330
01:55:25,351 --> 01:55:28,860
old Mac laptop computer that had like,

4331
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:30,361
it was thick,

4332
01:55:30,361 --> 01:55:33,960
like a fucking brick and it
was like a big ass computer.

4333
01:55:33,961 --> 01:55:37,410
But the screen inside it's pretty
small and it had a track ball.

4334
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,850
I like the train track,

4335
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:41,420
I remember of my favorite ones,

4336
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,960
but the little none of that look like it.

4337
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,900
Like some little ads.

4338
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,200
Ibm thinkpad,

4339
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:47,910
that red dot on there
that you can mess with.

4340
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:50,370
So when we were talking
about this iPhone Karma,

4341
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:50,900
um,

4342
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:53,940
the idea of it being a at an
American phone and you know,

4343
01:55:53,941 --> 01:55:54,840
you could actually pay for it.

4344
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:56,670
So you're saying that they
do them in Brazil now?

4345
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:57,200
Yeah,

4346
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:58,033
they,

4347
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,930
they do them in this
factory in Brazil I think.

4348
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:04,090
I think they just are
mixing it up because uh,

4349
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,123
the,

4350
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:09,930
the company that is manufacturing the
four s actually had this idea in their

4351
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:14,190
head like how many they were going to
have to make and they just found out.

4352
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:16,650
But from all these preorders that
so many people are ordering it,

4353
01:56:16,651 --> 01:56:19,860
it's about 50% more than they anticipated.

4354
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:21,390
50% more,

4355
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,081
the percent more.

4356
01:56:22,081 --> 01:56:24,480
So I think what they have to
do is just supply and demand.

4357
01:56:24,481 --> 01:56:27,140
Like Foxconn can't have
an extra can't handle.

4358
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:27,931
He can't handle that.

4359
01:56:27,931 --> 01:56:29,460
Especially if they're
probably doing the IPAD too,

4360
01:56:29,461 --> 01:56:31,860
so they're just that splitting
up the factories now.

4361
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:32,911
But you know,

4362
01:56:32,911 --> 01:56:34,220
it's just like anything you do.

4363
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:34,611
Yeah.

4364
01:56:34,611 --> 01:56:35,900
It's like that episode
of what's happening.

4365
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:39,740
When Raj got that deal to print up the
Christmas cards and birthday cards and

4366
01:56:39,741 --> 01:56:41,900
stuff and then they gave him
such a large order that he,

4367
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:43,700
they couldn't handle it and
they had to go to business.

4368
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,700
Was that a quiz?

4369
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:51,680
It could have been anything.

4370
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,600
I can't believe you
actually remember that plot.

4371
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:54,711
Different episodes.

4372
01:56:54,711 --> 01:56:55,010
Yeah.

4373
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:55,830
I never wanted her to sit.

4374
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:56,001
I'm like,

4375
01:56:56,001 --> 01:56:56,450
wait,

4376
01:56:56,450 --> 01:56:57,140
the order too much.

4377
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:58,130
You had to go on a business.

4378
01:56:58,131 --> 01:56:59,750
I don't get that at all,

4379
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,273
but it made sense to them.

4380
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,140
They were like,

4381
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:04,050
it's only black people watching.

4382
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:04,903
Just say it.

4383
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,820
Probably Jimmy Walker got really upset
after a while and didn't want to say

4384
01:57:07,821 --> 01:57:08,720
dynamite anymore.

4385
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:09,111
Yeah,

4386
01:57:09,111 --> 01:57:09,944
he hated it.

4387
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:11,031
He was,

4388
01:57:11,031 --> 01:57:11,480
um,

4389
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,350
he was tortured by it.

4390
01:57:12,351 --> 01:57:13,184
I guess

4391
01:57:13,190 --> 01:57:13,401
it's,

4392
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:13,521
well,

4393
01:57:13,521 --> 01:57:14,120
it's kind of weird.

4394
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,440
You probably just get sick of saying it,

4395
01:57:15,441 --> 01:57:16,430
but you remember the old saying,

4396
01:57:16,431 --> 01:57:17,960
where's the beef now?

4397
01:57:17,961 --> 01:57:19,450
Bringing that shit back now too.

4398
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:19,990
Yeah,

4399
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:21,320
it's is long dead,

4400
01:57:21,321 --> 01:57:21,750
by the way.

4401
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:22,130
I know.

4402
01:57:22,130 --> 01:57:23,430
Long before I met her one,

4403
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:25,260
you met the where's the beef lady?

4404
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,153
Yeah.

4405
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:29,640
No one's ever said that.

4406
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:30,330
Ever.

4407
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:31,950
In all the years that woman existed.

4408
01:57:31,951 --> 01:57:36,930
So now my mom was an executive secretary
for the Whitney's corporation from in

4409
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:37,231
Columbus,

4410
01:57:37,231 --> 01:57:38,064
Ohio.

4411
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,960
I had a Wendy's today feel very guilty.

4412
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:43,231
Well,

4413
01:57:43,231 --> 01:57:43,561
you don't want,

4414
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:47,010
as far as like fast food cheeseburgers
go pretty fucking sporty.

4415
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:48,120
You feel better about that one,

4416
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:48,361
right?

4417
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:48,960
Then other ones?

4418
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:49,331
Yeah.

4419
01:57:49,331 --> 01:57:50,070
It tastes better.

4420
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:50,551
It tastes better.

4421
01:57:50,551 --> 01:57:51,384
You can tell it's hot.

4422
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:52,260
They just made it,

4423
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:52,950
you know,

4424
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:54,680
I'm pissed off at Carl's junior right now.

4425
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:56,370
He's on the Midwest,

4426
01:57:56,370 --> 01:58:00,810
but that new steak burger they show where
it's this humongous steak burger with

4427
01:58:00,811 --> 01:58:04,860
blue cheese and onion rings and it
falls onto the TV and it's bouncing and

4428
01:58:04,861 --> 01:58:05,940
beautiful and huge.

4429
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:06,930
Yeah,

4430
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:07,200
well,

4431
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:07,360
yeah,

4432
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,161
it looked like CGI.

4433
01:58:08,161 --> 01:58:08,730
Exactly.

4434
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:10,950
I just got it the other day and
it looked like somebody sat on it.

4435
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:13,471
What the heck?

4436
01:58:13,471 --> 01:58:14,670
This is all smooshed.

4437
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:15,780
Where's all the fucking shit?

4438
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,580
So they made me a new one
and I just didn't even look.

4439
01:58:17,581 --> 01:58:20,490
I just took it home and I opened it
up and in the same fucking thing,

4440
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,300
it was just,

4441
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:26,100
it was just like the most pitiful looking
fucking nasty burger and maybe Matt.

4442
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:26,480
Okay.

4443
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,320
I've always said that.

4444
01:58:27,321 --> 01:58:28,490
That's like actresses.

4445
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:31,580
You get them home and they'll
never look like the pictures,

4446
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,670
like their head shots when
they got the glamor shots,

4447
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:35,360
the some,

4448
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,830
some actresses or cheeseburgers,

4449
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:37,770
you know,

4450
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:38,810
he's talked to my agent about it.

4451
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:40,250
He said he had girls
sometimes where he's like,

4452
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,180
you're a quirky.

4453
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:43,750
If you get this headshot that
makes you look like a model,

4454
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:44,950
you're going to be brought in for stuff.

4455
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:46,960
You'll never book what's wrong with you?

4456
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:49,040
It goes off my glasses on
and they want to be hot.

4457
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:50,490
Two pictures,

4458
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:51,190
best friend.

4459
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:52,060
They don't want to be wacky.

4460
01:58:52,061 --> 01:58:53,110
The wacky best friend.

4461
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:54,500
How did the redhead from,

4462
01:58:54,510 --> 01:58:56,710
from your show and from
suddenly Susan deal with that?

4463
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:57,941
Well,

4464
01:58:57,941 --> 01:59:00,550
the one from suddenly Susan started
hanging around with a bunch of gay dudes,

4465
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,040
so you got drunk you to draw that way.

4466
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,211
Kathy Griffin,

4467
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:05,044
she's killing him.

4468
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:05,883
She's killing it.

4469
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:07,340
Well,

4470
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:07,991
everybody loves her.

4471
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:08,320
She's,

4472
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:08,920
she's funny.

4473
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,753
She's funny.

4474
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:10,571
She's cool too.

4475
01:59:10,571 --> 01:59:12,280
I liked her and then Vicky,

4476
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:13,950
she's just,

4477
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:14,783
she does a lot of,

4478
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:16,570
a lot of Broadway.

4479
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:17,711
Really?

4480
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:19,000
It's actually really real acting.

4481
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:19,241
Yeah,

4482
01:59:19,241 --> 01:59:20,380
she's an amazing singer.

4483
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:22,000
She's got an incredible voice,

4484
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:22,660
like a really,

4485
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:25,190
I think that's like probably
her first love all the answers,

4486
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:26,651
but she,

4487
01:59:26,651 --> 01:59:26,951
you know,

4488
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:27,610
she always does.

4489
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:29,350
She's always on sitcoms and stuff too.

4490
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:30,730
That's cool.

4491
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:31,720
I wonder how they deal with that though.

4492
01:59:31,721 --> 01:59:32,030
It was like,

4493
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:32,350
okay,

4494
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:33,340
I'm going to be quirky.

4495
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:34,000
That's okay.

4496
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,320
I know it was the cute
girl when I grew up,

4497
01:59:35,321 --> 01:59:37,360
but in la it looks a little different.

4498
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,860
Vicky had a hot body though.

4499
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:40,070
Really thank you Lewis.

4500
01:59:40,071 --> 01:59:40,210
Yeah,

4501
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:41,043
she's a dancer.

4502
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:42,940
She had a hot body and that's nice.

4503
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:43,601
She's quirky,

4504
01:59:43,601 --> 01:59:44,434
but she was

4505
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:46,990
the robot scroll by robot.

4506
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:49,030
This high school on the way over here.

4507
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,570
Yeah,

4508
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:51,940
and they were playing Lacrosse and all
of these high school girls had their

4509
01:59:51,941 --> 01:59:53,720
shorts shorts on.

4510
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:55,871
It was so fucking,

4511
01:59:55,871 --> 01:59:57,300
they have the best legs.

4512
01:59:57,460 --> 01:59:59,400
Isn't it funny that that's like that?

4513
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:00,851
For sure.

4514
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:01,660
Shouldn't fuck them.

4515
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:01,931
Okay.

4516
02:00:01,931 --> 02:00:02,591
It's not right.

4517
02:00:02,591 --> 02:00:05,170
You're an old man and
they're young and you know,

4518
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:06,520
you shouldn't know,

4519
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,090
but,

4520
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:07,780
but,

4521
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,171
but,

4522
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:08,650
but,

4523
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:09,190
but,

4524
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:10,520
but why is,

4525
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:11,463
why,

4526
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,600
what's going on here and explain
what's happening to my peanuts.

4527
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:14,650
Whoa.

4528
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:16,030
When do we blend that we make,

4529
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:20,800
we make a cutoff at 18 and that arbitrary
cutoff means that this girl can handle

4530
02:00:20,801 --> 02:00:21,180
it.

4531
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:21,491
All right,

4532
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:21,671
look,

4533
02:00:21,671 --> 02:00:22,590
I know you're just gonna fuck her.

4534
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:23,001
I forget her,

4535
02:00:23,001 --> 02:00:23,834
but now it's legal.

4536
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:26,980
At 18 the bell rings,

4537
02:00:26,981 --> 02:00:29,290
we've decided that
enough time has gone by,

4538
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,730
the chicken has hatched,

4539
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:31,560
this is it.

4540
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:32,950
It's ready for delivery.

4541
02:00:32,951 --> 02:00:33,611
Go run.

4542
02:00:33,611 --> 02:00:34,600
And he gets run.

4543
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:38,230
And the moment the clocks takes
12 you can shove your cognitive,

4544
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:40,960
but if you put it in five minutes
before the clock ticks 12,

4545
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:41,913
they could lock you.

4546
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:42,450
Fuck,

4547
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:45,340
rub it on the outside until
12th can't even do the hell.

4548
02:00:45,341 --> 02:00:47,420
You can't even talk about it on a podcast.

4549
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:49,200
You can't even have a
talking about it on the,

4550
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:50,810
okay,

4551
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:52,180
so for the record,

4552
02:00:52,181 --> 02:00:53,470
this girl that we're talking about is 23.

4553
02:00:53,471 --> 02:00:54,304
It just looks really young.

4554
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:55,010
No,

4555
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:58,780
we're talking about is when a person
turns 18 that's what we're talking about.

4556
02:00:58,781 --> 02:00:59,520
God,

4557
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,660
it's just weird that we
have like a little fucking,

4558
02:01:01,730 --> 02:01:02,291
it's weird,

4559
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:04,060
especially when you see those
girls that are 17 and you look,

4560
02:01:04,061 --> 02:01:04,451
you look like,

4561
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:05,230
or 26.

4562
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:06,460
I live by a horse stable.

4563
02:01:06,461 --> 02:01:10,060
So there's all these really
hot rich chicks that have uh,

4564
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:11,500
that have horses.

4565
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:15,040
So I'll be in Starbucks just waiting
in line and just some of them man with

4566
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:19,060
their little horse boots on and there
are little horse outfits and you're just

4567
02:01:19,061 --> 02:01:19,330
looking at,

4568
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:19,630
I'm going,

4569
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:20,380
God damn it.

4570
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:21,490
This is not fair.

4571
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,030
This is really not rude.

4572
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:26,890
It's rude that girls
don't get that though.

4573
02:01:26,891 --> 02:01:29,380
Girls don't look at 15
year old boys and go women.

4574
02:01:30,270 --> 02:01:31,103
Yeah.

4575
02:01:31,390 --> 02:01:31,901
Give me that.

4576
02:01:31,901 --> 02:01:35,500
Young Teachers Look at 29 year old guy,

4577
02:01:35,501 --> 02:01:36,161
30 year old guy.

4578
02:01:36,161 --> 02:01:36,994
He was really something like that.

4579
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:37,661
Right.

4580
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:37,910
You know,

4581
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:40,850
because men's powers right
around that age when girls,

4582
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:42,470
they're at their best when they're 17,

4583
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:45,410
if anyone has passed that
you're gone downhill.

4584
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:47,180
So that's why you feel the way you do.

4585
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:49,520
And notice those girls never
look at us and be like,

4586
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:50,870

4587
02:01:50,871 --> 02:01:53,840
Is that man boobs a yeah.

4588
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:54,440
You know,

4589
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:55,670
like it doesn't go the other way.

4590
02:01:55,671 --> 02:01:58,520
Like little girls do not
like older men in the 30s.

4591
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:00,330
Will they do a lot of listed?

4592
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:01,533
Oh yeah,

4593
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:02,541
they'd been molested.

4594
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:02,950
They do.

4595
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:05,720
And please Facebook if
you have Holla at Ari,

4596

4597
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:08,510

Always got solutions.

4600
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:13,590
What's that guy from lost
though than a producer guy?

4601
02:02:13,591 --> 02:02:16,130
They just married that
16 year old in Hawaii.

4602
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:16,620
Funny.

4603
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:17,453
As an actor.

4604
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:18,231
An actor.

4605
02:02:18,231 --> 02:02:18,500
Yeah.

4606
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:18,771
Yeah,

4607
02:02:18,771 --> 02:02:19,011
yeah.

4608
02:02:19,011 --> 02:02:19,431
He was,

4609
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:20,030
um,

4610
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:20,851
I forget who he was.

4611
02:02:20,851 --> 02:02:21,641
He was in lost.

4612
02:02:21,641 --> 02:02:22,500
He wasn't like right.

4613
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,190
Part of it really.

4614
02:02:23,190 --> 02:02:24,050
It wasn't a big part.

4615
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:24,831
But yeah,

4616
02:02:24,831 --> 02:02:27,500
the girls tweets are Goddamn hilarious.

4617
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:29,090
Her videos are awesome.

4618
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:32,380
Just don't know if you watch her jean or
17 now and she's talks about Jesus and

4619
02:02:32,381 --> 02:02:34,080
it talks about how dirty
and naughty she has her.

4620
02:02:34,081 --> 02:02:37,790
Her name is Courtney Stotten
follow this crazy bitch.

4621
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:41,690
I shouldn't call her a bitch cause she's
only six 16 follow this crazy style.

4622
02:02:41,691 --> 02:02:42,820
Not the type person,

4623
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:47,420
but all her pictures are her and
her bikini poke at her tits out.

4624
02:02:47,421 --> 02:02:50,870
She was also alliteration
way through and Oh yeah,

4625
02:02:50,871 --> 02:02:51,140
yeah.

4626
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:52,250
He's just very fun.

4627
02:02:52,251 --> 02:02:53,810
Cut and keep the videos.

4628
02:02:54,490 --> 02:02:54,881
Listen,

4629
02:02:54,881 --> 02:02:55,460
this is like,

4630
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:56,293
this is her,

4631
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,193
her updates,

4632
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:00,050
the sugary taste of satisfaction is bliss

4633
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:07,340
inside of yourself and you will be
victorious and then it has a wink smile.

4634
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:09,350
Like Holy Shit.

4635
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:12,380
He imagined that nonsense you have
to listen to before she'll blow much

4636
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:13,214
nonsense.

4637
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:14,083
This poor guy,

4638
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:18,710
even though he's 51 and she's 16 and
he's really shy and he should be in jail

4639
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:18,960
because they,

4640
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:19,671
where did they get married?

4641
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:20,271
Where is that legal?

4642
02:03:20,271 --> 02:03:20,930
Vegas.

4643
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:21,763
Powerful.

4644
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:24,680
Powerful Vegas.

4645
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:25,850
I think she's from Hawaii.

4646
02:03:26,170 --> 02:03:29,650
And so you're allowed to get married in
Vegas and 16 the weird thing is you say

4647
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:30,493
lost for that.

4648
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:30,711
Yeah.

4649
02:03:30,711 --> 02:03:32,360
There will be a national
standard for that.

4650
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:34,160
They have weird ones like New Mexico.

4651
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:38,790
I think a man to boy is
like 13 man to a boy.

4652
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:39,330
Yeah,

4653
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:39,680
yeah,

4654
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:40,130
yeah.

4655
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:40,970
Talk to the young boys.

4656
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:41,120
They,

4657
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,860
they'll protect them in
New Mexico as a smarter,

4658
02:03:42,861 --> 02:03:43,730
I might've made that up.

4659
02:03:44,970 --> 02:03:45,803
It's fast

4660
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:49,940
and I really don't know.

4661
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:51,140
I was like 70% sure.

4662
02:03:51,141 --> 02:03:54,050
I know it was a fact at one point in
time that one state had that I thought it

4663
02:03:54,051 --> 02:03:57,020
was New Mexico and I was using it in
this piece that I was writing about,

4664
02:03:57,021 --> 02:03:57,230
uh,

4665
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:57,660
uh,

4666
02:03:57,660 --> 02:04:01,520
about fucking Catholics and how weird
it is that they take Catholics when they

4667
02:04:01,521 --> 02:04:04,160
get accused of child molesting and they
just ship them out of state and they do

4668
02:04:04,161 --> 02:04:05,090
it on a regular basis.

4669
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,241
And I was wondering,

4670
02:04:06,241 --> 02:04:06,510
you know,

4671
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:09,050
maybe they shift them to places where
the laws were different and I'm like,

4672
02:04:09,051 --> 02:04:10,130
what law would be different?

4673
02:04:10,131 --> 02:04:13,450
And then it finds out that New
Mexico was one that had a weird law.

4674
02:04:13,451 --> 02:04:18,050
I was like men to women was like 16 but
men to boy was like 13 and I'm like,

4675
02:04:18,051 --> 02:04:18,321
Whoa,

4676
02:04:18,321 --> 02:04:21,040
who to hear how your
organization is acting.

4677
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:24,650
Totally making my own connection.

4678
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:25,461
So that's why.

4679
02:04:25,461 --> 02:04:28,610
But I remember reading all these
different various state laws.

4680
02:04:28,611 --> 02:04:29,450
Like you have to be careful.

4681
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:31,920
You have to drag a girl across
a certain spot that don't yet.

4682
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:33,470
We fucking also take someone under age,

4683
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:34,850
across state border.

4684
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:36,790
Even if you live close to the border,

4685
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:37,210
well look,

4686
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:40,130
it's just going over there like Kentucky
and Cincinnati when they just sort of

4687
02:04:40,131 --> 02:04:40,741
at twine,

4688
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:41,610
they're right next to each other.

4689
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:42,780
The Kentucky Airport is,

4690
02:04:42,781 --> 02:04:44,580
or this incident in airports in Kentucky.

4691
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:46,950
It's real bizarre.

4692
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:50,580
So like there you who if what's the
agent candidates lower there too,

4693
02:04:50,581 --> 02:04:51,390
right?

4694
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:54,440
I think it's 1616 might be 17 age consent.

4695
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:56,460
[inaudible] 18 is right.

4696
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:58,670
You know a girl's 18 she's a little hook.

4697
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:00,170
She's out in her own lettered fucking,

4698
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:02,860
hopefully you've taught her to
be nice and maybe be around,

4699
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,200
not going to have a great memory of this,

4700
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:05,130
but it will help her grow.

4701
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:05,791
Yeah.

4702
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:06,121
Look,

4703
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:07,920
everybody's had awkward sexual moments,

4704
02:05:07,921 --> 02:05:08,250
you know?

4705
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:10,800
Hopefully she's around nice people
and nothing bad happens to her.

4706
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:12,120
Of course everybody wants that,

4707
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:15,200
but at a certain point in time get a lot
of person to be a person and what year,

4708
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:16,700
what year is that?

4709
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:19,860
Is Not bad to have sex with
somebody you want to have sex with.

4710
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:20,810
Relate to.

4711
02:05:20,810 --> 02:05:21,000
Yeah.

4712
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,080
Like someone said this to me like,

4713
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:24,780
well you know how you got to treat
your daughters and they start dating.

4714
02:05:24,781 --> 02:05:25,730
I go there.

4715
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:26,940
They're girls.

4716
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:30,030
Girls like boys and girls like
boys have boys like girls.

4717
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,960
It's my job to make sure that
they see what a nice guy is like.

4718
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,100
You know where that question comes from.

4719
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:36,770
That question comes from
the ideal that you're like,

4720
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:37,200
no,

4721
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:39,210
I think sort of sex as
victimization of women.

4722
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:43,080
Well it's also the idea of someone
shoving their cock and your baby.

4723
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:44,230
Okay.

4724
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:46,020
It's not just that you raise this child.

4725
02:05:46,021 --> 02:05:48,840
Since there was this little
bit that it's something bad,

4726
02:05:48,841 --> 02:05:49,680
but it's going to happen to them.

4727
02:05:49,681 --> 02:05:51,390
But it's also you just,

4728
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:54,780
you're losing the innocence of
their youth even if they want it.

4729
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:58,110
What about a guy shopping is talking
to a girl that looks the same sort of

4730
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:58,973
innocence of youth?

4731
02:05:59,120 --> 02:05:59,530
Nah,

4732
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:00,780
it doesn't matter if the guy loses,

4733
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:01,741
the guy loses it.

4734
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:03,900
It's like a celebration
when the girl loses

4735
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:06,330
cog in the back of,

4736
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,700
you're a parent that is
happening through her.

4737
02:06:08,730 --> 02:06:08,941
Yeah.

4738
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:11,000
If you're a parent and
you come outside and you,

4739
02:06:11,001 --> 02:06:16,001
you see a foggy car and you peer in and
your daughters suck in some guy's cock,

4740
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:18,270
it's going to bum you out.

4741
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:19,104
Man.

4742
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,113
That's funny.

4743
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:21,600
It's going to bum you out,

4744
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:21,830
dude.

4745
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:22,651
I don't even like saying it.

4746
02:06:22,651 --> 02:06:23,880
If it's like someone that like,

4747
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:26,270
I know and sort of not
like have a crush on,

4748
02:06:26,271 --> 02:06:27,660
but sort of just like as a human,

4749
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:30,660
like if I saw Eleanor fucking below
on some guy in a car and be like,

4750
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:31,703
Whoa,

4751
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:31,831
well,

4752
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:32,011
you know,

4753
02:06:32,011 --> 02:06:35,680
this girl had to get permission from her
father to the other end of the valley

4754
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:36,330
signed over.

4755
02:06:36,330 --> 02:06:36,690
Yeah,

4756
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:39,300
and her mother and father and no
problem with her marrying this dude.

4757
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:42,810
I don't know was a perfect example for
that is exactly what I was thinking of.

4758
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:43,921
She's just going to be,

4759
02:06:43,921 --> 02:06:45,120
she's going to be fascinating,

4760
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:47,040
but this girl is 16 year old.

4761
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,450
She's so fascinating already.

4762
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:49,740
She's like,

4763
02:06:49,741 --> 02:06:50,371
whatever it is.

4764
02:06:50,371 --> 02:06:53,370
She's like often deep end crazy man.

4765
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,920
Like if you could get like
a fucking one of those,

4766
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:56,761
those helmets,

4767
02:06:56,761 --> 02:06:59,400
the record brainwaves
put it on a chick's head.

4768
02:06:59,550 --> 02:07:01,580
It would just be like
4th of July and there

4769
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,230
everything just killed it.

4770
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,580
All sorts of different directions.

4771
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:07,600
What if the holdings viral marketing,

4772
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:10,470
her 16 year old,

4773
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:16,400
the next lonely girl eight puts out a
lot of tweets that are really Joaquin

4774
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:18,720
Phoenix of hot chicks because
you're just hiring role.

4775
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:19,710
Half of like writers.

4776
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:20,640
It's just a troll.

4777
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,511
Yeah,

4778
02:07:21,511 --> 02:07:22,051
I don't think so,

4779
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:22,321
dude.

4780
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:23,610
I think she's a nutty bitch.

4781
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:24,420
That's what I think.

4782
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:26,150
She's just a hot young,

4783
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:26,731
young,

4784
02:07:26,731 --> 02:07:27,564
nerdy girl.

4785
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:31,560
There's so many crazies now and there
are also employed it now just working.

4786
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:32,011
It's working.

4787
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:32,641
We're talking about it.

4788
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:33,480
We're on this podcast.

4789
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:36,040
Half a million people listening
to this cause it's so weird.

4790
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:37,510
Follow her tweets though.

4791
02:07:37,511 --> 02:07:39,220
Who cares if she don't
want to support her?

4792
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:39,671
Listen man,

4793
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:40,421
I ain't giving her anything.

4794
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:41,051
Father's tweets.

4795
02:07:41,051 --> 02:07:41,310
These,

4796
02:07:41,310 --> 02:07:45,170
these bitches not supporting
that entertain you.

4797
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,170
Her videos are fucking hilarious.

4798
02:07:47,171 --> 02:07:50,400
She talks about haters and
stuff and she's retarded

4799
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:53,030
to master mixes.

4800
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:58,170
Wild wiggling and jauntily jiggling
myself into jolting jams as I Friskopoly

4801
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:04,981
flaunt a flirty outfit completed with
sexy white seven inch Gogo boots.

4802
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:06,183
Wink.

4803
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,780
She got that in 440 characters.

4804
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:08,230
Yup.

4805
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:09,063
All of it.

4806
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:12,730
She gets a little hairy age.

4807
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:16,270
It's probably her husband writing it.

4808
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,890
When do you think we're
going to see the sex tape?

4809
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:19,240
Cause it's going to be illegal.

4810
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:20,170
Isn't that fascinating?

4811
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:23,170
This the sexy then if she makes it then,

4812
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,860
but she has to be 18 I'm actually Mexican
and you have to make sure they would

4813
02:08:26,861 --> 02:08:31,540
have to make sure that she would have
to have a newspaper in the paper and a

4814
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:35,770
clock and as soon as it strikes me night
and she hits 18 he shoves it in there

4815
02:08:35,771 --> 02:08:37,210
and just talked to monkey fucking her.

4816
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:39,190
Imagine that if that would be the video,

4817
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:41,020
like there's a count down.

4818
02:08:41,021 --> 02:08:44,650
The first five minutes of the video
is just four minutes and 59 seconds,

4819
02:08:45,670 --> 02:08:47,680
eight seconds in a porno,

4820
02:08:47,681 --> 02:08:49,270
but she's not doing any porn until,

4821
02:08:49,810 --> 02:08:50,280
yeah.

4822
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:50,500
Yeah.

4823
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:53,320
Well she sits there great episode of
where their ass up in the air with her

4824
02:08:53,321 --> 02:08:57,970
pants on and maybe playing with blocks
on the ground or something with her hands

4825
02:08:57,971 --> 02:08:58,690
on her button.

4826
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:03,640
The moment it hits one zero bank slop,

4827
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:08,760
he comes running in like
a fucking linebacker Dick
Right in the pussy that they

4828
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:12,160
should do that and they
haven't done that already.

4829
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:14,010
You know,

4830
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:14,590
they should do it.

4831
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:16,790
Most ridiculous porn producers get on it.

4832
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:20,650
Do you think there's ever anyone who's
done a porn and that porn was the first

4833
02:09:20,651 --> 02:09:21,490
time they had sex?

4834
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:22,450
Yes,

4835
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:22,721
for sure.

4836
02:09:22,721 --> 02:09:23,330
Yeah.

4837
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:23,920
It must be right.

4838
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,570
It should be a brother and a sister,

4839
02:09:25,571 --> 02:09:26,550
twin brother and sister.

4840
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:29,710
1159 verifiable,

4841
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:31,061
verifiable.

4842
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:33,040
I would love to see someone have
sex for the first time on camera.

4843
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:33,790
Yeah.

4844
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:34,040
If,

4845
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:35,350
if I knew it was real,

4846
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:37,240
but first time it was not that good.

4847
02:09:37,241 --> 02:09:37,820
Right now.

4848
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:38,201
It's just like,

4849
02:09:38,201 --> 02:09:40,710
what the hell are we doing
from a voyeuristic standpoint.

4850
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,680
It'd be interesting to watch.

4851
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:43,420
We are all about Ari.

4852
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,830
I show you my third time.

4853
02:09:44,831 --> 02:09:45,664
If you wanted to,

4854
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:46,650
you know your third topic.

4855
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:48,280
It's horrible.

4856
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,113
It was last week.

4857
02:09:49,950 --> 02:09:52,840
Just get a fucking camera
set up in his house,

4858
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,120
ate a bunch of tribulus and got in there.

4859
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:57,190
It's every touch herself taped myself.

4860
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,443
No,

4861
02:09:58,530 --> 02:09:59,111
it's bad for you.

4862
02:09:59,111 --> 02:10:00,340
Did she gets on the Internet?

4863
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:01,203
I never have.

4864
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:03,100
Well luckily it's under
the before the Internet.

4865
02:10:03,110 --> 02:10:04,870
Not like the way your body looks naked.

4866
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:06,550
Do I not know.

4867
02:10:06,551 --> 02:10:09,070
It just seems like a lot of setup
time and like I just want to fuck.

4868
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:13,190
It's very creepy like when you watch it
a bunch and see your butthole and stuff.

4869
02:10:13,191 --> 02:10:18,191
Like if I were to do it again the other
way around you you don't like your

4870
02:10:19,301 --> 02:10:19,630
angles.

4871
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:20,380
Yeah.

4872
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:20,701
Horrible.

4873
02:10:20,701 --> 02:10:22,990
It was horrible at angles.

4874
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:26,200
You didn't know how to work the my space
days it was on a water bed so it was

4875
02:10:26,201 --> 02:10:27,880
just really creepy looking.

4876
02:10:27,881 --> 02:10:32,881
It was just butt holes and motions and
bad people have like started up their own

4877
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:34,970
like porn sites too.

4878
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:37,910
There's a bunch of them where it's like
guys and their wives and they would just

4879
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:39,110
fuck on camera.

4880
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:40,280
Yeah,

4881
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,240
it was real common.

4882
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:42,980
I remember like wifeys world,

4883
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:44,880
that is one of them is it?

4884
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:47,030
Or they get divorced once you realize,

4885
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:47,151
oh,

4886
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:48,050
I could just pick these,

4887
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:48,890
um,

4888
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:49,723
and make a bunch of money.

4889
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:51,650
I don't mean she mentioned
be the hot old MILF,

4890
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,041
but now,

4891
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:54,080
but she's probably like
in her late forties,

4892
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:56,990
I think because this is a long
time ago that this was going on,

4893
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:59,510
but it was all videos of this guy.

4894
02:10:59,570 --> 02:11:02,420
He never saw the guy but
his wife just blowing them.

4895
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:04,820
She's just constantly
sucking on the same cock.

4896
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:09,470
And there's another one where there was
I deep throat.com remember that same

4897
02:11:09,471 --> 02:11:09,830
thing?

4898
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:10,790
That girl and her husband,

4899
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:12,410
a lot of porn stars to do that.

4900
02:11:12,411 --> 02:11:17,240
Like a only fuck this my boyfriend now
that's the only guy that shit's boring to

4901
02:11:17,241 --> 02:11:20,000
us girls more or you're not commit.

4902
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:21,590
It seems like you're liking this.

4903
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:22,520
I'm turning out.

4904
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:24,680
Yeah.

4905
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,060
What do you mean really
in love with that guy.

4906
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:28,940
How strange.

4907
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,350
Horrible Shit.

4908
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:31,993
How's your smoking?

4909
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:33,740
Smoking.

4910
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:34,573
You're smoking buddy.

4911
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:38,300
James James is fine.

4912
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:39,913
My smoking buddy.

4913
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:40,640
That's great.

4914
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:45,230
Isn't it weird being friends with a
porno stars and then you see their work

4915
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,490
isn't that strange feeling.

4916
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:48,050
I know you still,

4917
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:48,680
something's happening.

4918
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,970
It makes masturbation easier though.

4919
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:52,400
It makes masturbation easy.

4920
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:53,630
You're hanging out with
somebody and you're like,

4921
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:56,240
oh I could actually see what this
girl looks like having sex now.

4922
02:11:56,241 --> 02:11:56,720
And that's,

4923
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,553
you know,

4924
02:11:57,880 --> 02:11:58,713
hmm.

4925
02:11:59,010 --> 02:11:59,920
Cause he hung out with them.

4926
02:11:59,921 --> 02:12:02,180
Normally when I know when I
know somebody who has a point,

4927
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:03,470
I'll avoid it on purpose.

4928
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:04,610
Like I don't want to fucking see this.

4929
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:07,910
But then I remember after Jaden wouldn't
fuck me that night when I came home I

4930
02:12:07,911 --> 02:12:08,161
was like,

4931
02:12:08,161 --> 02:12:10,070
I look beat off to you as well.

4932
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:14,980
What happened was he thought
he's going to get some and uh,

4933
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:17,630
she's gonna come over Ariz and there
or you were going to go over hers.

4934
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,790
I went over to her place and then
you've got to smoke weed together.

4935
02:12:19,791 --> 02:12:20,240
And I was like,

4936
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:21,073
Oh shit.

4937
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:24,890
Smoke weed to Aa with a hot porn star,

4938
02:12:24,891 --> 02:12:25,341
so he's like,

4939
02:12:25,341 --> 02:12:26,210
oh shit,

4940
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,380
it's on kid and she got up there.

4941
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:30,010
She's like already know this isn't,

4942
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:30,771
I mean my panties,

4943
02:12:30,771 --> 02:12:31,880
but that's just how I roll.

4944
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:38,140
Most of them are actually
not as horny and got Olson.

4945
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:42,170
The Guy I want to meet [inaudible] seems
like in real life she'll fuck you know

4946
02:12:42,171 --> 02:12:42,681
the janitor.

4947
02:12:42,681 --> 02:12:43,171
That's what it is.

4948
02:12:43,171 --> 02:12:46,040
Do you want to seem like that
Norton shot a load into her?

4949
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:47,440
Yeah,

4950
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,740
that's why I actually think he pulled out,

4951
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:49,574
but we think he,

4952
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:51,410
she said that he could've
come inside of her,

4953
02:12:51,411 --> 02:12:52,280
but I think he panicked.

4954
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,173
Oh Wow.

4955
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,161
I talked to Jason.

4956
02:12:54,161 --> 02:12:55,100
Jason a podcast.

4957
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:59,660
Let's talk about that too
because you got to a podcast.

4958
02:12:59,661 --> 02:13:00,800
It's out on its own now.

4959
02:13:00,801 --> 02:13:02,720
It's not under the desk
squad a label anymore.

4960
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:06,800
He got a divorce but we're
all in the same family.

4961
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:09,560
I want to be more at home
and stuff and on the road.

4962
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:13,040
So he got a whole set up and everything
and we actually use that setup on a

4963
02:13:13,041 --> 02:13:13,361
plane.

4964
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:14,270
It's pretty fucking cool.

4965
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:16,070
That was really good.

4966
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:16,500
Dude.

4967
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:19,850
Came out like the setup
is nice and I'm going to,

4968
02:13:19,851 --> 02:13:24,851
I'm going to start duplicating
that handheld likes
Sennheisers with a cover and

4969
02:13:25,851 --> 02:13:27,740
it connects right into one of those zooms,

4970
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:29,433
you know?

4971
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:33,480
But she was on the podcast and
actually talked about going home.

4972
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:34,760
How are you?

4973
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:36,300
She fears arched fear.

4974
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:37,134
Skeptic time.

4975
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:38,221
If you go to,

4976
02:13:38,221 --> 02:13:41,040
if you've got to are the
great.com everything's on there.

4977
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:41,993
So what did she do?

4978
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:44,730
You guys talked about it like going
home that night and it was kind of

4979
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:45,510
uncomfortable.

4980
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:45,941
I got,

4981
02:13:45,941 --> 02:13:49,980
it was like hearing her side
of it and it's completely fine.

4982
02:13:49,981 --> 02:13:50,281
It's like,

4983
02:13:50,281 --> 02:13:50,490
no,

4984
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:51,690
I had no intention of ever.

4985
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:52,533
Fuck,

4986
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:53,520
fuck people.

4987
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:54,353
I don't want to fuck.

4988
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:54,991
Like,

4989
02:13:54,991 --> 02:13:55,170
oh,

4990
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:56,100
that sounds reasonable,

4991
02:13:56,101 --> 02:13:56,811
but we'll have my,

4992
02:13:56,811 --> 02:13:57,980
why is my deck still drug?

4993
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:00,570
Listen,

4994
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:02,820
I saw you let that black
guy fucking your asshole.

4995
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:04,521
She's hard core.

4996
02:14:04,521 --> 02:14:08,310
I mean have your mouth actually she
was talking about it doing anything,

4997
02:14:08,311 --> 02:14:08,760
but again,

4998
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:09,630
she's never done that before.

4999
02:14:09,631 --> 02:14:10,560
I actually really wanted it.

5000
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:11,580
That was one of her goals.

5001
02:14:11,581 --> 02:14:12,570
She wants to do an gang bang.

5002
02:14:12,571 --> 02:14:13,590
She did it finally right.

5003
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:14,270
Oh God.

5004
02:14:14,270 --> 02:14:14,430
Yeah.

5005
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:16,260
That was just like how many people was it?

5006
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:18,403
Do you remember?

5007
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:19,980
What is the name again?

5008
02:14:19,981 --> 02:14:20,640

5014
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:39,023

5015
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,040
Oh,

5016
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:40,260

He's like 10 dudes are banging her head.

5022
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:46,550
Is a lot of dudes be fucking a one.

5023
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:48,180
Wouldn't do that in the year.

5024
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:49,111
First of all,

5025

5027
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:00,480
That scared me a little cause she looked
like she was almost about to black out

5028
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:06,230
choking and Cox and then afterwards she
was crying and like saying how amazing

5029
02:15:06,691 --> 02:15:06,931

way for people to see.

5032
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:11,880
Wow.

5033
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:12,661
She's an awesome,

5034
02:15:12,661 --> 02:15:13,494
I hung out with her yesterday.

5035
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:14,430
She's so awesome.

5036
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:15,450
She's funny too,

5037
02:15:15,451 --> 02:15:15,751
man.

5038
02:15:15,751 --> 02:15:17,460
She was really funny on the podcast.

5039
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:18,900
We did the podcast with her dude.

5040
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:19,770
She's,

5041
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:20,640
she's a funny check.

5042
02:15:20,641 --> 02:15:20,971
She says,

5043
02:15:20,971 --> 02:15:21,804
Funny Shit.

5044
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:22,501
She won't,

5045
02:15:22,501 --> 02:15:24,840
he refuses to post on your
message board anymore.

5046
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:29,100
There's a lot of meaning
meanies message board.

5047
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:29,934
There's no way.

5048
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:30,890
Yeah,

5049
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:31,230
yeah.

5050
02:15:31,230 --> 02:15:31,820
That's a thing.

5051
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:33,510
Too many people wouldn't
know the right line.

5052
02:15:33,690 --> 02:15:33,841
Well,

5053
02:15:33,841 --> 02:15:34,471
you know what it is,

5054
02:15:34,471 --> 02:15:34,740
man.

5055
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:38,400
It's just that they're anonymous and
it's too easy to just fucking poke.

5056
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:39,910
Too easy to be a dick.

5057
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:40,870
But even that,

5058
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:41,340
you know,

5059
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,420
the comments were that late at night.

5060
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:44,400
Some will have a girl on
stage and she'll be like,

5061
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:45,291
it'll be Kevin.

5062
02:15:45,291 --> 02:15:46,380
Kind of weird.

5063
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:49,670
And hopefully we're all hoping she
takes her shirt off the end goal,

5064
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,263
but somewhat alike.

5065
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:52,200
So whoever's on state,

5066
02:15:52,201 --> 02:15:53,034
let's say barest.

5067
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:54,190
Yeah,

5068
02:15:54,190 --> 02:15:55,260
Jay Pgi.

5069
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:55,610
Yeah.

5070
02:15:55,610 --> 02:15:56,170
And you'll be like,

5071
02:15:56,170 --> 02:15:56,670
PJ,

5072
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:57,580
you're ruining it.

5073
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:59,700
Just not understand the line.

5074
02:15:59,701 --> 02:16:00,960
We've all agreed on here.

5075
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:02,431
Choose your tooth.

5076
02:16:02,431 --> 02:16:03,264
You fucking whore.

5077
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:05,340
Yeah.

5078
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:05,941
Now she's just,

5079
02:16:05,941 --> 02:16:07,730
now she's clammed up here.

5080
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:08,730
You have to trust a lot of people.

5081
02:16:08,731 --> 02:16:09,210
You can't,

5082
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:10,320
there's only a few ruins it.

5083
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:10,621
Well,

5084
02:16:10,621 --> 02:16:11,270
I have,

5085
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:13,850
who knows how many thousands
of members on my message board.

5086
02:16:13,851 --> 02:16:16,260
It's impossible to money
if I'm our douche bags.

5087
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:20,070
Unfortunately people got upset that I
said there was a lot of negativity on the

5088
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:20,611
board and like,

5089
02:16:20,611 --> 02:16:24,270
here are your mood angry
about what did I said it,

5090
02:16:24,271 --> 02:16:24,781
but I said,

5091
02:16:24,781 --> 02:16:25,260
I'm like,

5092
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:25,520
there's,

5093
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:28,170
we had a conversation about how many
negative people are on the board,

5094
02:16:28,171 --> 02:16:29,070
but you're fucking,

5095
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:30,640
and we're not lying.

5096
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:31,563
We're not lying.

5097
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:35,110
You guys are drawing desert
tiresome and it's not everybody.

5098
02:16:35,111 --> 02:16:37,210
There's a lot of really
cool smart people there.

5099
02:16:37,211 --> 02:16:39,340
I mean we've met a
bunch of them in person,

5100
02:16:39,341 --> 02:16:40,760
like the savage science dude,

5101
02:16:40,761 --> 02:16:41,594
that guy's coolest.

5102
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:43,440
Johnny rotten.

5103
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:43,631
Cool.

5104
02:16:43,631 --> 02:16:44,050
It's fun.

5105
02:16:44,050 --> 02:16:45,100
There's a lot of quick people.

5106
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:46,480
It's not a WIC is great.

5107
02:16:46,481 --> 02:16:47,680
I hung out with wicked Houston,

5108
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:48,551
do Wiccan.

5109
02:16:48,551 --> 02:16:49,180
His mom,

5110
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,450
I drank with WIC and his
mom and Houston and HR.

5111
02:16:52,451 --> 02:16:52,751
Yeah,

5112
02:16:52,751 --> 02:16:52,911
yeah,

5113
02:16:52,911 --> 02:16:53,140
yeah,

5114
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:53,780
yes mam.

5115
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:55,870
Cool fucking people in the day.

5116
02:16:55,871 --> 02:16:57,530
And we did have negative
people back in the day.

5117
02:16:57,531 --> 02:16:58,750
It was like one or two people.

5118
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:00,880
We dealt with it now.

5119
02:17:00,881 --> 02:17:03,100
It's like so many numbers.

5120
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:06,220
The numbers just so big and
there's some of the MNA influence.

5121
02:17:06,830 --> 02:17:07,510
Yeah,

5122
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:08,051
that's a problem.

5123
02:17:08,051 --> 02:17:09,310
Those guys come in with that attitude.

5124
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:13,000
Somebody Jewish bags and they
want to get into arguments too.

5125
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,130
There's some guys that are
just professional trolls.

5126
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:18,790
Like that's all they do is they just
say things hoping to upset your feelings

5127
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:20,050
and hoping to drag,

5128
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:22,620
drag you into some sort of an
arguments and then you're there.

5129
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:27,760
It's like I got in a fight with a fucking
Francesca Hilton and I was so mad at

5130
02:17:27,761 --> 02:17:28,810
me letting my slow sad.

5131
02:17:29,130 --> 02:17:29,920
You remember that crate?

5132
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,780
She's like John's his
granddaughter or something.

5133
02:17:31,781 --> 02:17:32,540
Her daughter.

5134
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:32,981
I remember her.

5135
02:17:32,981 --> 02:17:33,910
She was hanging out at the store.

5136
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:35,043
Oh,

5137
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:36,610
why is she crazy?

5138
02:17:36,611 --> 02:17:39,270
And then Mitzi eventually made her
a paid regular for who knows why.

5139
02:17:39,830 --> 02:17:40,840
That's why she hangs around.

5140
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:42,131
Oh Wow.

5141
02:17:42,131 --> 02:17:43,180
Now I do remember it.

5142
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:44,080
She's kind of a big girl,

5143
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:46,170
big just super attention whore,

5144
02:17:46,190 --> 02:17:47,023
like needs it.

5145
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:49,960
So she was in the showroom the
other day and she was making noise.

5146
02:17:50,050 --> 02:17:52,750
Bears is on stage and he said
something to me on stage.

5147
02:17:52,751 --> 02:17:53,380
I'm like,

5148
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:55,060
oh look at Jews coming
or something like that.

5149
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:55,901
And I was like,

5150
02:17:55,901 --> 02:17:56,531
I have one question.

5151
02:17:56,531 --> 02:17:58,630
Why is she in here making
noise during a show?

5152
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,240
I don't understand why this stupid idiot
is making noise and not being thrown

5153
02:18:01,241 --> 02:18:02,074
out.

5154
02:18:02,130 --> 02:18:03,790
And then I went across
and then while I was on,

5155
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:06,040
she took a phone call
while she's moving up,

5156
02:18:06,041 --> 02:18:06,910
the phone rang.

5157
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:07,331
She was like,

5158
02:18:07,331 --> 02:18:07,571
sorry.

5159
02:18:07,571 --> 02:18:07,740
I'm like,

5160
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:08,920
shut the fuck off.

5161
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:10,001
You fucking bitch.

5162
02:18:10,001 --> 02:18:11,050
Shut it the fuck off.

5163
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,100
How many people in the audience?

5164
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:13,900
25 30 something like that.

5165
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:14,501
Why don't we just like,

5166
02:18:14,501 --> 02:18:15,550
what are you doing here?

5167
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:17,030
Why are you in the show room?

5168
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:19,241
And I'm like,

5169
02:18:19,241 --> 02:18:20,020
you're a fucking con.

5170
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:20,853
You need to die.

5171
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,400
She would have like,

5172
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,750
why am I fighting with an idiot?

5173
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:23,663
Goddammit.

5174
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:24,941
I leave my lights.

5175
02:18:24,941 --> 02:18:26,290
I don't think it drawn into this shit.

5176
02:18:26,350 --> 02:18:27,183
Your mother's a con.

5177
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:28,023
What'd you say?

5178
02:18:28,090 --> 02:18:28,960
All right.

5179
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:29,831
What'd you say?

5180
02:18:29,831 --> 02:18:30,340
What'd you tell her?

5181
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:30,701
What she said?

5182
02:18:30,701 --> 02:18:31,630
Her mom's dying and I said,

5183
02:18:31,631 --> 02:18:32,260
I hope you die.

5184
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:33,093
You're a con.

5185
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:34,893
Whoa.

5186
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:35,530
Oh no,

5187
02:18:35,530 --> 02:18:35,861
her mom.

5188
02:18:35,861 --> 02:18:36,671
I would never talk her mom.

5189
02:18:36,671 --> 02:18:37,660
What are you guys talking about?

5190
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:40,413
Don't understand.

5191
02:18:41,910 --> 02:18:42,743
Whoa.

5192
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:45,280
Or you needed to sit down
and talk to this person.

5193
02:18:45,510 --> 02:18:45,790
No,

5194
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:46,211
I just need it.

5195
02:18:46,211 --> 02:18:47,720
Never be involved with her iPhone Karma.

5196
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:49,060
Don't try and resolve issues.

5197
02:18:49,061 --> 02:18:49,930
Grow I Karma.

5198
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:52,600
What do you think about the fact that
this person is in your life to move you in

5199
02:18:52,601 --> 02:18:53,290
a certain direction?

5200
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:54,340
I felt so bad about it.

5201
02:18:54,341 --> 02:18:54,590
I was like,

5202
02:18:54,590 --> 02:18:54,671
well,

5203
02:18:54,671 --> 02:18:56,380
why did I let her have
any control over me?

5204
02:18:56,860 --> 02:19:01,790
I know that's a terrible thing when you
let your anger get away from you do.

5205
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,510
She's security guard
and Houston and there's,

5206
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:09,250
this lady was like so rude and would
they tried to like move me through to get

5207
02:19:09,251 --> 02:19:10,120
me into the arena.

5208
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,430
I had my pass on me and she was that,

5209
02:19:12,431 --> 02:19:13,120
I don't care.

5210
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:13,840
I don't care.

5211
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:15,430
I need to find his name on the list.

5212
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,301
I was like,

5213
02:19:16,301 --> 02:19:16,841
wow,

5214
02:19:16,841 --> 02:19:17,310
okay.

5215
02:19:17,310 --> 02:19:19,270
It's like the tone and the light.

5216
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:20,680
You're so pleasant to deal with them.

5217
02:19:20,681 --> 02:19:23,590
So w got you listen to me
thing and they'll like,

5218
02:19:23,591 --> 02:19:23,771
you know,

5219
02:19:23,771 --> 02:19:26,080
and after everybody told
them everything's cool,

5220
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,410
I show the ID,

5221
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:31,640
ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba got the badges on
and have the names on it and all the

5222
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:32,474
designations.

5223
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,100
Finally after that,

5224
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:34,521
she,

5225
02:19:34,521 --> 02:19:37,040
she informs me that we
have to wear wristbands.

5226
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:38,600
So she's a,

5227
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:39,980
and I got to put it on you and I can,

5228
02:19:39,981 --> 02:19:40,791
can I put it on myself?

5229
02:19:40,791 --> 02:19:41,624
I have it in my hand.

5230
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:42,081
She goes,

5231
02:19:42,081 --> 02:19:42,381
no,

5232
02:19:42,381 --> 02:19:43,580
you cannot do it yourself.

5233
02:19:43,581 --> 02:19:43,820
Get,

5234
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:45,260
I will put it on you sir.

5235
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:46,370
And then the guy's like,

5236
02:19:46,371 --> 02:19:47,570
you disrespecting her man.

5237
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,403
You disrespected her.

5238
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:50,960
I go on disrespecting her
by trying to put this paper.

5239
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:51,410
I go,

5240
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:52,640
you guys are power tripping.

5241
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:52,851
I go,

5242
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:53,900
this is ridiculous.

5243
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:54,231
I go,

5244
02:19:54,231 --> 02:19:54,560
I'm trying to,

5245
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,400
trying to go to work.

5246
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:55,690
You,

5247
02:19:55,690 --> 02:19:57,180
you want me to wear the paper wristband?

5248
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,460
I wear the paper wristband,

5249
02:19:58,580 --> 02:19:59,930
but you have to put it on me.

5250
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,190
What the fuck man,

5251
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:03,290
that's the problem when those
people get put in charge.

5252
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:03,801
Exactly.

5253
02:20:03,801 --> 02:20:04,940
Like if you're working at Starbucks,

5254
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:07,940
you shouldn't be in control
of throwing somebody out.

5255
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:09,110
It was so gross.

5256
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,820
It's gross and people power trip,

5257
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:11,991
you know?

5258
02:20:11,991 --> 02:20:13,690
And when people just act like Dixon,

5259
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:16,970
it's one thing as you're following the
rules and there was another lady that we

5260
02:20:16,971 --> 02:20:17,900
dealt with on the other side,

5261
02:20:17,901 --> 02:20:18,201
you know,

5262
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:19,220
and show your id,

5263
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:22,070
go through the whole thing and she was
very pleasant and the way she did it.

5264
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:24,170
And how y'all doing this
afternoon and be like,

5265
02:20:24,171 --> 02:20:24,411
good,

5266
02:20:24,411 --> 02:20:24,891
how you doing?

5267
02:20:24,891 --> 02:20:25,490
Everything good?

5268
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:26,241
Everything's good.

5269
02:20:26,241 --> 02:20:28,970
Let's just check up here
real quick and say your name.

5270
02:20:29,230 --> 02:20:29,650
Oh God.

5271
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:30,920
I should know you should not.

5272
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:31,281
All right,

5273
02:20:31,281 --> 02:20:33,800
well here's your id going
through and that's all.

5274
02:20:33,810 --> 02:20:34,760
You know what best,

5275
02:20:34,761 --> 02:20:35,594
how does that,

5276
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:36,800
why does that to do,

5277
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:37,700
I got a security guard,

5278
02:20:37,701 --> 02:20:38,240
one of the UFC,

5279
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:43,220
I think it was in Nashville and I was
sitting up in those seats and because no

5280
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:43,581
one was there,

5281
02:20:43,581 --> 02:20:44,480
I didn't know anybody there.

5282
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,790
And I went back to get something to
eat and when I came back she goes,

5283
02:20:46,791 --> 02:20:47,301
do you have a path?

5284
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:47,511
I'm like,

5285
02:20:47,511 --> 02:20:48,650
I don't really have one at all.

5286
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:49,280
I to go,

5287
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:49,490
oh,

5288
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:50,323
I'll try to remember you.

5289
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:51,621
And next time I went back there,

5290
02:20:51,621 --> 02:20:52,730
I got her a fucking Pepsi.

5291
02:20:53,230 --> 02:20:54,020
Nice.

5292
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:54,311
She was like,

5293
02:20:54,311 --> 02:20:54,590
you know,

5294
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:55,700
you saw me walking with this guy.

5295
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:55,971
You know,

5296
02:20:55,971 --> 02:20:56,660
I'm cool.

5297
02:20:56,660 --> 02:20:57,111
It's all right.

5298
02:20:57,111 --> 02:20:58,340
You're being a regular human being.

5299
02:20:58,400 --> 02:20:59,233
Good for you.

5300
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:00,440
She was totally Rad.

5301
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:01,350
That's the move tool.

5302
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:05,410
You should get them something
cool noticing that cooler
than someone else might

5303
02:21:05,411 --> 02:21:07,010
love to help you out and you look thirsty.

5304
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:07,940
That's made me feel joy,

5305
02:21:07,941 --> 02:21:08,740
a little shiny.

5306
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:11,480
You exactly what we bring a little
shiny ass to then to each other,

5307
02:21:14,470 --> 02:21:15,540
do it.

5308
02:21:15,541 --> 02:21:16,790
I'm telling my CT and two weeks,

5309
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,830
whereas yours is going to do an Edmonton,

5310
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:19,251
Edmonton,

5311
02:21:19,251 --> 02:21:19,581
Alberta,

5312
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:20,120
Canada,

5313
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:20,953
Canada.

5314
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:25,220
Gather round where the comic strip
and what are the exact dates?

5315
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:30,440
The October 26th through the 30th
October 26th through the 30th Edmonton.

5316
02:21:30,700 --> 02:21:31,820
Let's summarize this happen.

5317
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:32,840
Let's make this happen.

5318
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:34,550
Can people buy tickets online already?

5319
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:35,340
Yeah.

5320
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:35,610
Yeah.

5321
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:37,120
It's actually the comic strip.ca,

5322
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:38,900
the comic strip.ca.

5323
02:21:38,930 --> 02:21:41,150
That's their version of.com
and again for the people.

5324
02:21:41,151 --> 02:21:41,990
Slow to write this down.

5325
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:42,824
What is the date?

5326
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:46,760
It is October 26th to the 30th the 26th
through the 30th and what days are you

5327
02:21:46,761 --> 02:21:47,790
going to do the CD?

5328
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:48,621
I think all of them.

5329
02:21:48,621 --> 02:21:49,160
I'm not sure.

5330
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:49,940
Definitely the weekend.

5331
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:50,180
Ooh,

5332
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:51,013
that's a good mood.

5333
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,880
You should try to put everything down,

5334
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:54,680
put everything you have done.

5335
02:21:54,681 --> 02:21:54,831
I mean,

5336
02:21:54,831 --> 02:21:57,080
you have over the course of
the years that I've known you,

5337
02:21:57,410 --> 02:21:59,040
you've rotated acts a few times.

5338
02:21:59,210 --> 02:22:00,110
Other times where it's like,

5339
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:00,980
I'm just tired of it.

5340
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:01,881
Well,

5341
02:22:01,881 --> 02:22:02,081
you know,

5342
02:22:02,081 --> 02:22:02,451
it's funny,

5343
02:22:02,451 --> 02:22:04,130
like we were talking about
that one bit that you have,

5344
02:22:04,131 --> 02:22:05,750
that you had a line that I said,

5345
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:06,880
how come you don't do lose it?

5346
02:22:06,881 --> 02:22:07,220
And you're like,

5347
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:08,360
actually that was from another bed.

5348
02:22:08,361 --> 02:22:08,630
I'm like,

5349
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:09,530
Oh yeah.

5350
02:22:09,531 --> 02:22:09,771
You're like,

5351
02:22:09,771 --> 02:22:10,970
if they're kind of the same bit,

5352
02:22:11,210 --> 02:22:13,120
it's just one little
overlap of a lot of like,

5353
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:13,850
yeah,

5354
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:14,511
I'll just say it's like,

5355
02:22:14,511 --> 02:22:15,590
why did you come inside me?

5356
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:17,360
I have a few girls in a
few different stories.

5357
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:18,380
Having had said that to me.

5358
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:19,640
Yeah,

5359
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:21,190
both Ainsley and otherwise you're like,

5360
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:22,280
no reaction one is so much better.

5361
02:22:22,281 --> 02:22:22,431
Like,

5362
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:22,910
yeah.

5363
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:23,790
At the time now,

5364
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:25,000
you know,

5365
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:25,471
I've been doing that.

5366
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:26,820
I've been recording a lot of my stuff.

5367
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:29,310
I like listening to it like
with a mind with in mind,

5368
02:22:29,311 --> 02:22:29,580
like,

5369
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:30,660
can I see this stuff?

5370
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:31,610
And I'm like,

5371
02:22:31,610 --> 02:22:32,450
I can't do that bit.

5372
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:33,293
Can't do that bit.

5373
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:34,260
You can't do that long.

5374
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:34,860
And that's okay.

5375
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:35,730
You can do it anyway.

5376
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:36,301
You're wrong.

5377
02:22:36,301 --> 02:22:36,920
You can do something.

5378
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:37,530
But when it's,

5379
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:38,610
when it's like a full act out,

5380
02:22:38,611 --> 02:22:39,130
what am I getting?

5381
02:22:39,130 --> 02:22:40,320
There's a minute and a half here.

5382
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:42,060
Will you just explain it after you do it?

5383
02:22:42,061 --> 02:22:44,040
For the poor folks that have this on CD,

5384
02:22:44,410 --> 02:22:45,420
what I just did was,

5385
02:22:45,421 --> 02:22:45,720
you know,

5386
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:47,010
reached down and grabbed my deck,

5387
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:50,130
whatever was actually a see me lot of
Dane and he was really cool about it.

5388
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:50,380
Oh,

5389
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:52,890
it was like you'd do
a lot of physical cds,

5390
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:53,340
right?

5391
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:53,910
Like that's,

5392
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:54,121
you know,

5393
02:22:54,121 --> 02:22:54,990
he's a physical comic.

5394
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,360
We've got a lot of audio cds.

5395
02:22:56,390 --> 02:22:56,670
I'm like,

5396
02:22:56,670 --> 02:22:57,120
what are you going?

5397
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:57,391
He goes,

5398
02:22:57,391 --> 02:22:58,400
after my first CD,

5399
02:22:58,990 --> 02:22:59,400
uh,

5400
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,211
I had to go back and say,

5401
02:23:00,211 --> 02:23:01,044
no more act outs.

5402
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,460
I can't see any of those on stage.

5403
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:02,960
I real,

5404
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:03,310
I don't know,

5405
02:23:03,310 --> 02:23:03,620
honestly.

5406
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:03,811
Yeah.

5407
02:23:03,811 --> 02:23:04,320
We were like,

5408
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:04,591
he said,

5409
02:23:04,591 --> 02:23:04,861
no more.

5410
02:23:04,861 --> 02:23:05,700
God's elect out,

5411
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:08,340
I'm assuming as something like for for
like a five minute long thing where it's

5412
02:23:08,341 --> 02:23:09,120
like,

5413
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:09,271
yeah,

5414
02:23:09,271 --> 02:23:10,710
this makes no sense and CD form.

5415
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:12,023
That's interesting.

5416
02:23:12,030 --> 02:23:12,630
Yeah.

5417
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:13,410
I think,

5418
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:13,670
you know,

5419
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:17,850
he said it would always justify what he
was doing with his words somehow like

5420
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:18,091
you know,

5421
02:23:18,091 --> 02:23:18,350
to,

5422
02:23:18,350 --> 02:23:19,183
to help illustrate it.

5423
02:23:19,230 --> 02:23:19,790
That's smart.

5424
02:23:19,790 --> 02:23:20,700
Yeah that's smart.

5425
02:23:20,701 --> 02:23:22,470
But some people just love like that.

5426
02:23:22,471 --> 02:23:24,270
Just a plain physical comedy.

5427
02:23:24,271 --> 02:23:27,420
And even though you don't understand
what the fuck is going on when you're

5428
02:23:27,421 --> 02:23:28,530
listening to the CD,

5429
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:30,060
sometimes it's okay,

5430
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:31,470
but here's my thoughts on it.

5431
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:32,131
Like there's some words,

5432
02:23:32,131 --> 02:23:32,970
cause [inaudible] had this,

5433
02:23:32,971 --> 02:23:33,151
he goes,

5434
02:23:33,151 --> 02:23:33,271
when,

5435
02:23:33,271 --> 02:23:34,470
I remember when I was listening to cds,

5436
02:23:34,471 --> 02:23:35,640
there was some things I couldn't see.

5437
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:36,900
I know he made a funny face there,

5438
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:37,801
but it'd be like,

5439
02:23:37,801 --> 02:23:38,401
I love this.

5440
02:23:38,401 --> 02:23:40,950
And I was so wish I could also
see it live so I can be there.

5441
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:42,540
But they didn't lose anything out of it.

5442
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:43,403
Like damn it.

5443
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:43,711
I know.

5444
02:23:43,711 --> 02:23:44,670
It's a cool funny face.

5445
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:46,840
There's nothing quite so like,

5446
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:47,490
yeah,

5447
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:48,960
being live at standup show,

5448
02:23:48,961 --> 02:23:50,340
even if it's a 40 people in the room,

5449
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:53,670
it's still better than any CD
or a special and I think that,

5450
02:23:53,671 --> 02:23:54,001
yeah,

5451
02:23:54,001 --> 02:23:56,520
and I think that really if
you're going to record a CD,

5452
02:23:56,521 --> 02:23:57,480
if you want to record a special,

5453
02:23:57,481 --> 02:24:00,120
the real way to do it is 200 people.

5454
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:02,910
That's not what anybody
ever wants to hear.

5455
02:24:02,911 --> 02:24:04,640
Everybody wants to do these big giant,

5456
02:24:04,641 --> 02:24:07,110
I think that's what this place
is around that 200 people.

5457
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,633
It's perfect.

5458
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:11,300
First CD I ever did was
the last stop in Houston.

5459
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:13,380
There was the old last up to 50,

5460
02:24:13,381 --> 02:24:14,040
maybe.

5461
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:17,520
I think we got 300 people in there one
day and it goes stuffed folding chairs

5462
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:21,300
off at different level than
like a than like an auditorium.

5463
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:21,900
Yeah.

5464
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,760
I mean I just did the uh,

5465
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:26,070
the Verizon wireless theater and Houston,

5466
02:24:26,071 --> 02:24:27,840
it was fucking awesome and it's huge.

5467
02:24:27,841 --> 02:24:29,190
That place is gigantic,

5468
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:29,910
but,

5469
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:31,950
but I hadn't been Houston forever,

5470
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:33,500
so it was a lot of energy there is,

5471
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:35,070
for me it was like a big,

5472
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:35,880
this is like,

5473
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:37,200
that's an important city for me.

5474
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:39,631
It's stuck in your head.

5475
02:24:39,631 --> 02:24:41,370
Like I gotta make a show for these people.

5476
02:24:41,371 --> 02:24:41,611
I'm like,

5477
02:24:41,611 --> 02:24:41,881
why?

5478
02:24:41,881 --> 02:24:42,451
Like I don't know.

5479
02:24:42,451 --> 02:24:42,841
I just,

5480
02:24:42,841 --> 02:24:43,531
there's something men making.

5481
02:24:43,531 --> 02:24:45,330
You're going to go back to
a comedy club there soon.

5482
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:45,720
Yeah,

5483
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:46,171
I might.

5484
02:24:46,171 --> 02:24:47,590
I might go back to that comedy club too.

5485
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:47,801
When I'm,

5486
02:24:47,801 --> 02:24:51,750
when I put my special out after
I'm done with the special,

5487
02:24:51,751 --> 02:24:54,390
I'm going to have to write some new shit
and I'll spend a lot more time doing

5488
02:24:54,391 --> 02:24:58,050
clubs and a lot less time doing
theaters because of the clubs.

5489
02:24:58,051 --> 02:24:59,700
It's way easier to come up with new shit.

5490
02:24:59,701 --> 02:25:03,120
It's a more experimental environment
when there's like 200 to 300 people,

5491
02:25:03,390 --> 02:25:06,000
the acoustics at a place
like that must be creepy.

5492
02:25:06,820 --> 02:25:08,190
Like a giant place I think.

5493
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:10,830
I Dunno sort of mean.

5494
02:25:10,831 --> 02:25:12,000
It's all about the sound system.

5495
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:12,580
Sound system.

5496
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:14,760
So if the crowd is up against the wall,

5497
02:25:14,761 --> 02:25:16,860
like if it goes all the
way to the outside walls,

5498
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:18,030
laughter bounces.

5499
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:20,910
I'm making this part up but it seems
like a bounces harder and everyone laughs

5500
02:25:20,911 --> 02:25:21,570
more.

5501
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:23,950
But when there's space in
between the wall or the ceiling,

5502
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:24,351
yes.

5503
02:25:24,351 --> 02:25:27,070
Ceilings and it doesn't go off as much
because you're not surrounded by this

5504
02:25:27,071 --> 02:25:27,550
laughter.

5505
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:27,821
Yeah.

5506
02:25:27,821 --> 02:25:28,654
Like I'm,

5507
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:31,630
the perfect example is the
right and a wrong way to do it.

5508
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:36,660
It's COBB's cobb's in San Francisco
calms the old comms was 150 fucking like,

5509
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:38,560
I'm not that into that room.

5510
02:25:38,561 --> 02:25:39,251
Everyone was okay.

5511
02:25:39,251 --> 02:25:41,680
But it's like the old room build room.

5512
02:25:41,681 --> 02:25:41,951
Yeah.

5513
02:25:41,951 --> 02:25:42,784
Ridiculous.

5514
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:43,810
It's on a Wednesday.

5515
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,870
Did you really just don't
like best up San Francisco?

5516
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:47,070
Great Room.

5517
02:25:47,090 --> 02:25:48,190
It was a great room.

5518
02:25:48,191 --> 02:25:51,670
It was real small and it was one of
the few rooms that I would do for cheap

5519
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,060
because I knew that I would go up there
and have a real good time and I knew

5520
02:25:55,061 --> 02:25:57,080
that would be a good place to fuck around.

5521
02:25:57,090 --> 02:25:57,460
Yeah.

5522
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:58,630
Work on my material.

5523
02:25:58,900 --> 02:25:59,471
And so,

5524
02:25:59,471 --> 02:26:00,070
um,

5525
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:02,140
it gave us shitty wage
but make it a good show.

5526
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:02,350
Yeah.

5527
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:04,750
But they want to do
that too at giant place.

5528
02:26:04,810 --> 02:26:09,670
Now there are places like four 50 with
a big high ceiling and a bounce bounce

5529
02:26:09,710 --> 02:26:10,660
back far back.

5530
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:11,860
So you're really far away.

5531
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:14,200
But it's so cool that
it doesn't even matter.

5532
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:15,140
It's still really great.

5533
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:15,881
Crowds are great,

5534
02:26:15,881 --> 02:26:17,020
but the crowds are fantastic,

5535
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:18,143
but it's not perfect.

5536
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:20,350
So there's two places to me that
they're like super important.

5537
02:26:20,351 --> 02:26:21,184
Three places.

5538
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:22,960
Boston's cause I started there,

5539
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:24,520
San Francisco and Houston.

5540
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:24,880
Those are,

5541
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:26,110
those are the two places.

5542
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:26,951
So I used to just,

5543
02:26:26,951 --> 02:26:27,910
because this is what I did,

5544
02:26:27,911 --> 02:26:28,691
my first CD,

5545
02:26:28,691 --> 02:26:29,170
that one,

5546
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:30,460
that pink thing on the wall back there,

5547
02:26:30,461 --> 02:26:31,330
the Warner brothers one,

5548
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:33,400
I got a deal with Warner brothers.

5549
02:26:33,430 --> 02:26:35,270
They were going to like really push this.

5550
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:36,460
It was a really good deal.

5551
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:38,620
And then Disney bought them.

5552
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:40,053
So Disney,

5553
02:26:41,230 --> 02:26:42,010
Disney bought them.

5554
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:42,251
Yeah,

5555
02:26:42,251 --> 02:26:46,660
it was Disney and they won't have
done that is their heads were not,

5556
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:48,430
they didn't promote my CD at all.

5557
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:48,971
They listened to,

5558
02:26:48,971 --> 02:26:49,241
it was like,

5559
02:26:49,241 --> 02:26:50,770
what the fuck are you talking about?

5560
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:53,920
The opening bid is two guys fucking
each other in the basement while they're

5561
02:26:53,921 --> 02:26:54,491
working out.

5562
02:26:54,491 --> 02:26:54,641
Yeah,

5563
02:26:54,641 --> 02:26:55,660
I remember that getting pumped.

5564
02:26:57,250 --> 02:26:57,911
They heard that.

5565
02:26:57,911 --> 02:26:59,760
I mean I wanted everybody
to hear that one.

5566
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:01,150
I wanted that to be the first track.

5567
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:04,200
I wanted it to be something
that I could only do like want,

5568
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:04,721
they would said,

5569
02:27:04,721 --> 02:27:04,931
bull,

5570
02:27:04,931 --> 02:27:06,220
do you think about doing a song?

5571
02:27:06,221 --> 02:27:06,421
I said,

5572
02:27:06,421 --> 02:27:06,521
yeah,

5573
02:27:06,521 --> 02:27:07,354
I'll do a song.

5574
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:07,931
And they said,

5575
02:27:07,931 --> 02:27:09,160
what do you think about
doing like a sketch?

5576
02:27:09,161 --> 02:27:09,461
And I said,

5577
02:27:09,461 --> 02:27:09,671
okay,

5578
02:27:09,671 --> 02:27:10,600
I'll come up with a sketch.

5579
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:13,210
So I decided I want to come up
with something that's so fucked up.

5580
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:15,460
You can't have it anywhere
else else with that.

5581
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:16,480
It has to be,

5582
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:16,870
yeah,

5583
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:17,200
Yup.

5584
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,750
We ever rerelease that or are you an ally?

5585
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:20,613
You can still buy it.

5586
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:24,340
It's really hard and it's always
the CD that's not on like,

5587
02:27:24,341 --> 02:27:26,930
you know the iTunes or it's
not on anything like that.

5588
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:27,641
Did digital,

5589
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:28,000
I don't,

5590
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:28,833
I don't believe that.

5591
02:27:30,050 --> 02:27:35,050
Like I think I've tried to find it a
couple of times and bought a Phi and all

5592
02:27:35,081 --> 02:27:35,730
that.

5593
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:37,420
I think there's some good material on it,

5594
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:38,680
but were a better comic now.

5595
02:27:38,681 --> 02:27:40,870
But they were still a
really good comic though.

5596
02:27:42,510 --> 02:27:42,830
Yeah,

5597
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:43,660
it's good stuff.

5598
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:44,140
I mean,

5599
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:48,460
I was really proud of it when it came
out and it was really proud that I did in

5600
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:50,840
Houston because Houston was my,

5601
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:54,430
my number one favorite comedians
are Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks.

5602
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:55,840
Those were my two favorite guys,

5603
02:27:55,841 --> 02:27:56,890
and they're both from Houston.

5604
02:27:57,220 --> 02:27:58,120
So for me,

5605
02:27:58,960 --> 02:27:59,290
well,

5606
02:27:59,290 --> 02:27:59,680
uh,

5607
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:02,470
being able to sell out in
Houston pack this place,

5608
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:02,771
I was like,

5609
02:28:02,771 --> 02:28:03,191
wow,

5610
02:28:03,191 --> 02:28:03,611
this is,

5611
02:28:03,611 --> 02:28:04,444
this is like,

5612
02:28:04,450 --> 02:28:04,631
man,

5613
02:28:04,631 --> 02:28:05,464
I love kind of say,

5614
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:05,950
ah,

5615
02:28:05,950 --> 02:28:06,783
he was the best.

5616
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:07,653
He was my favorite.

5617
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:08,830
I think out of all,

5618
02:28:08,831 --> 02:28:10,060
let me see if I miss stuff.

5619
02:28:10,061 --> 02:28:10,511
He does.

5620
02:28:10,511 --> 02:28:11,890
It makes me just like go like,

5621
02:28:11,891 --> 02:28:12,724
wow.

5622
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:13,071
Yeah,

5623
02:28:13,071 --> 02:28:15,100
it'll all the so good.

5624
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:16,300
Or all the great guys.

5625
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:19,720
I feel like he just had this
completely different approach.

5626
02:28:20,170 --> 02:28:22,760
Like I remember watching him the
first time I've watched him going,

5627
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:22,941
oh,

5628
02:28:22,941 --> 02:28:24,580
that's comedy too.

5629
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:25,483
Yeah.

5630
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:26,323
Oh,

5631
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:29,540
the opening up a new club in San
Diego to really just in Hollister.

5632
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:30,200
Yeah.

5633
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:30,441
Yeah.

5634
02:28:30,441 --> 02:28:32,210
This is my series in the margin or man,

5635
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:32,911
yeah,

5636
02:28:32,911 --> 02:28:34,590
there's been a couple times
where I've wanted down.

5637
02:28:34,950 --> 02:28:36,330
Isn't that the one with the song on it?

5638
02:28:36,331 --> 02:28:37,290
You're awesome.

5639
02:28:37,291 --> 02:28:39,490
Song 50 penny and a like,

5640
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:41,250
I wanted to play that
for people and I'm like,

5641
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:41,431
oh,

5642
02:28:41,431 --> 02:28:42,264
I'll find it on it.

5643
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:42,780
Oh wait,

5644
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:43,860
I'll find it on this.

5645
02:28:43,890 --> 02:28:44,070
Oh,

5646
02:28:44,070 --> 02:28:45,210
and it's not in anything.

5647
02:28:45,290 --> 02:28:45,651
Well I'll,

5648
02:28:45,651 --> 02:28:46,670
I'll have them put it on.

5649
02:28:46,671 --> 02:28:47,690
I'll figure out a way to put it on.

5650
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,020
Right.

5651
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:49,880
I'm sure Warner brothers probably owns it.

5652
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:50,630
That's what it is.

5653
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:51,020
But it's,

5654
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:51,860
it's not as good as,

5655
02:28:51,861 --> 02:28:52,340
like I said,

5656
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:54,500
my delivery is not nearly
as good as it is now.

5657
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:55,311
It's funny.

5658
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:56,650
Comedies feels like
they've got everything.

5659
02:28:56,780 --> 02:28:57,141
Yeah.

5660
02:28:57,141 --> 02:28:58,130
Comedy is weird like that though.

5661
02:28:58,131 --> 02:28:59,930
I like having something when I was,

5662
02:28:59,931 --> 02:29:00,440
you know,

5663
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:01,470
well the same thing as musicians,

5664
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:04,340
like albums of a,

5665
02:29:04,341 --> 02:29:06,350
of a band that plays not
with the major album.

5666
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:06,710
And you're like,

5667
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:06,950
ah,

5668
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:08,090
I see where you're going,

5669
02:29:08,091 --> 02:29:08,924
but you're not there yet.

5670
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:10,510
But it's still like I'd want to have it.

5671
02:29:10,610 --> 02:29:11,720
And that to me,

5672
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:16,520
that CD represents a sort
of an awakening that I had,

5673
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:17,010
um,

5674
02:29:17,010 --> 02:29:17,571
with,

5675
02:29:17,571 --> 02:29:18,590
with standup comedy too,

5676
02:29:18,591 --> 02:29:21,350
because I was doing news radio
and when I was doing news radio,

5677
02:29:21,351 --> 02:29:24,050
there was a long time where I
got fucking really lazy man.

5678
02:29:24,050 --> 02:29:25,640
And I wasn't writing any new material.

5679
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:26,191
Oh yeah.

5680
02:29:26,191 --> 02:29:27,024
They talked about that once.

5681
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:28,191
I was just,

5682
02:29:28,191 --> 02:29:29,720
it was just being lazy.

5683
02:29:29,721 --> 02:29:32,630
I was just doing the TV show and
when I was doing the TV show,

5684
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:34,130
I'd get tired from doing it.

5685
02:29:34,131 --> 02:29:34,791
And then I would,

5686
02:29:34,791 --> 02:29:35,624
um,

5687
02:29:36,210 --> 02:29:36,830
you know,

5688
02:29:36,830 --> 02:29:37,220
I would,

5689
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:39,710
I would fuck off and I
wouldn't write any new shit.

5690
02:29:39,740 --> 02:29:40,730
So he's just do the same stuff.

5691
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:40,910
Yeah.

5692
02:29:40,910 --> 02:29:43,280
But it might be at my act got
really stale and then some,

5693
02:29:43,281 --> 02:29:45,500
a writers from the show
came to see me and I bombed.

5694
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:45,741
Oh,

5695
02:29:45,741 --> 02:29:46,260
really?

5696
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:46,840
Yeah.

5697
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:47,900
With the old stuff store.

5698
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:48,150
Yeah.
