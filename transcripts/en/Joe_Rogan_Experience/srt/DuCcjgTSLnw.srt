1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,830
They say that infinity is so intense,

3
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:07,530
like the idea of infinity and this is
the best way to wrap your head around it.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,120
If infinity Israel,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,930
that means that in the universe not only
has everything that we've said in the

6
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:20,601
exact same order and the exact
same pauses in the exact same

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,610
timeframe and fuck up of
words or slip of the tongue,

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,230
it's happened exactly that
way in exactly that order.

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,880
An infinite number of times,

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,230
not just one,

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,180
but an infinite number of times that
everything that's ever taken place down to

12
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,350
the millisecond has not just
happened once somewhere else,

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,960
but infinite times somewhere else.

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,500
Wow.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,090
That's how big infinity is.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,830
That's what no end means.

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,970
That's so weird.

18
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:55,110
Like it just like when you're doing
some mundane thing like jerking off,

19
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:56,220
coming to porn.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,230
I'm just thinking this is infinite.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,680
It's an infinite loop of
Tj's that's happening.

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,571
Oh,

23
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:03,001
shins,

24
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,190
oceans of ges.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,200
You could just see like just a
universe filled with you squirting ah,

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,223
fractal,

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,440
like literally a universe that's real
like so the sky would be absolutely filled

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
from horizon to horizon with
with you coming more than this.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,070
All the come from all the Dunkin's
in all over the world at once.

30
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:32,910
Drenched the earth.

31
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,560
We would drown and seaman.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:34,831
Oh,

33
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,720
how's the entire population would drown.

34
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,040
We would be coded in like a million
miles thick of com because if you think

35
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,780
about what infinity means,

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,030
how many different
Dunkin's would be coming,

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,590
there's no end to it.

38
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,710
So one ounce of calm equals 100 billion
oceans filled with come instantaneously

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
raining down upon those oceans would
be filled with more me's coming.

40
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,800
So not only that,

41
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,120
the universe itself would not be big
enough to contain the earth size.

42
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,240
Just from the sheer amount
of calm it was covered it.

43
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:06,910
Yeah,

44
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,420
it would push the
atmosphere way past the sun.

45
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,450
It would light the earth on fire
and turn it into a big come.

46
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,450
One of those fucking hush puppy.

47
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,780
It was a big come hush puppy
when the come got so big.

48
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,200
It touched the side of
the deep fryer is so big,

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,850
it touches this time and then puts the
sun out and presses out into the outer

50
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,684
galaxy.

51
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,160
That's how much come.

52
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,240
And then infinite amount
of people coming in.

53
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,011
And then some,

54
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,640
like some God chef would
just come and eat it.

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,960
It's just not a cooking show.

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,680
And,

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,460
and then,

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,791
you know,

59
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,350
he lives in another world where you're
coming on and it just goes on forever.

60
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:43,741
No,

61
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,060
that's how you impregnate the sun.

62
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,880
You fill up planet with come to the,

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,320
stop up a black hole.

64
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,970
We don't know what to
do about a black hole.

65
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,550
We're going to get an infinite
amount of Dunkin's to come in it.

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,811
Well,

67
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:55,021
it's,

68
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,500
you know,

69
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,830
mass broken down to the smallest part.

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,530
Uh,

71
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,460
it's not going to stop an
infinite amount of carb.

72
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,503
Trust me,

73
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,500
there's a whole other universe inside.

74
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,210
They're still not big enough
for infinite amounts of calm.

75
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
Sorry.

76
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,070
The black holes,

77
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,300
like what the fuck?

78
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,480
The black hole is like Sasha drag and
the fucking giant black cock being force

79
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,190
fed while she's lying on her back.

80
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,070
Snots going down into her eyelashes.

81
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,280
That's the he lived verse is

82
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,070
so symbolic.

83
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,750
So some bog of gag porn,

84
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,200
you're coming into a black hole,

85
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,600
the fucking whole of Van
and starts sputtering.

86
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,910
No,

87
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,910
that's spinning.

88
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,680
The spinning of the black hole absorbing
matter just gets all choked up like a

89
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,210
fucking,

90
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,610
like,

91
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,520
like a dishwasher disposal
system with a spoon in it.

92
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,170
You know when those garbage disposals,

93
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,330
the spoon drops in it.

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,260
You scared to put your hand
in there to try to unstop it.

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,550
Do you think,

96
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,610
and that's how the universe was created.

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,190
His infinite,

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,250
infinite come looped
went into a black hole.

99
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,660
Do you think that ever come
into a black hole in the future?

100
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,441
Oh yeah.

101
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,370
If we live long enough,

102
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:22,380
someone's going to want to do that.

103
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,410
They're gonna want to be the first guy,

104
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,010
some Richard Branson type asshole,

105
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,550
the first guy to show the world.

106
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,500
I want to inspire you that you
too can come in a black hole.

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,770
Him with a fucking black socks on.

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,850
So I always come,

109
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,060
he sends like a shuttle from
his pod and he's got like,

110
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,100
it's like a glory hole into the next
shuttle and he's wearing an aqua man t

111
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,410
shirt.

112
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,410
It's way too small and he's a little
slightly embarrassing roll of fat,

113
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,970
pulls out of the bar of like a little
waterfall and he's just jerking off with

114
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,310
his black socks on into it until

115
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,660
you never know until you try.

116
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,070
I seek to inspire.

117
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,090
I'm seeking to inspire
you that you too humble,

118
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,570
man.
