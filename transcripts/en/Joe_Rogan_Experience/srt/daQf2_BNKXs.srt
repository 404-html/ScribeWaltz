1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,630
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,291
I'll tell you what,

3
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,160
we bring up a lot.

4
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:04,660
I hope I haven't overdone it in the shows,

5
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:09,661
but I'm fascinated by this idea that
we're never going to go backwards.

6
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:10,781
Yes.

7
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:10,991
You know,

8
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:11,824
when you talk about,

9
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,041
you know,

10
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,810
this modern world and you
look around and you think,

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,111
okay,

12
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:15,910
basically since the renaissance,

13
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,810
it's been all,

14
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,130
this is the stock market.

15
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,580
We've been going up ever
since the renaissance and
the idea that everybody has

16
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,240
is that,

17
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,100
and we're never going to go backwards.

18
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,430
We're never going to go look at a
thousand years from now and see people who

19
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:29,800
don't know about DNA sequencing anymore.

20
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,270
It's planet of the apes,

21
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:31,511
right,

22
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,550
where you've gone backwards and Oh,

23
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:36,280
the statue of Liberty's
partly buried in the sand.

24
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,051
And I mean we,

25
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,390
we,

26
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,590
but every other culture,

27
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,870
every other country in the civilization,

28
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,690
in the history of the
world has thought that.

29
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:43,871
I mean,

30
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,040
you didn't think the Romans were thinking,

31
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:45,281
God,

32
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:45,641
it's great.

33
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,170
Now pity it can't last.

34
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,301
Yeah.

35
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:48,400
But we learned from them.

36
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:48,940
We know,

37
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,690
maybe we can not just that maybe the
whole globalization of the fact that

38
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:53,680
everybody's connected.

39
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,210
We'll change that dynamic.

40
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,440
But I think if you're gonna,

41
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,150
if you're trying to learn
from history one thing,

42
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:02,290
history shows us these stock market
upticks in the civilization stock market

43
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,124
don't last.

44
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,930
So what does that,

45
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,171
well,

46
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:07,170
we like to think we're more special
than all the other animals first and

47
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:07,621
foremost.

48
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,970
So we would like to think that,

49
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,420
you know,

50
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,080
even me,

51
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,460
I'm guilty of this guilty,

52
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,810
absolutely as charged.

53
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,770
We'd like to think that we are
eventually going to cheese,

54
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,150
achieve the highest levels
of understanding and that
that's the trend that

55
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:23,700
things are going and eventually
going to work everything out.

56
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,440
And we won't have war
someday in the future.

57
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,270
And that somehow or another,

58
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,780
we are basically human beings
are basically good and uh,

59
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,870
we're going to work this out in the
universe is going to reward that.

60
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,190
But I got one word,

61
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,570
the one word that refutes that.

62
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,190
Dinosaurs.

63
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,503
Okay.

64
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,020
The whole world was fucking run by Conti,

65
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,580
heartless lizards,

66
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,790
cold blooded monsters without a fucking
Spec of emotion that never wrote a

67
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:51,210
fucking thing down,

68
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,040
didn't give a shit about culture,

69
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,480
would eat their babies,

70
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,610
would eat anything that stood still.

71
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,360
That's what dominated this
earth for the longest time,

72
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,220
and if it wasn't for an asteroid impact,

73
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,500
very likely would still be a version
of that animal still running shit.

74
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,023
Bad cops.

75
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,170
Fucking Ed Asner.

76
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,063
Yeah,

77
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,090
exactly.

78
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,550
Bad Cop shows or one of my
favorite things of all time,

79
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,340
so much so that there was a
show called Della Ventura.

80
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,450
I remembered the name of my
manager also manages Kevin James,

81
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,770
who's a the king of Queens.

82
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,250
Right.

83
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,690
And they were on the same network as
Danny Aiello when he had this show called

84
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,191
Delavan.

85
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:32,370
Tara and I had them get me the tapes
because that you couldn't find them.

86
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,990
I have I trailer the original master

87
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,413
tapes,

88
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,061
great show.

89
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,430
It's horrible and
awesome at the same time.

90
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,990
I cherish these tapes.

91
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,900
I have people over for
Delavan tour watching parties,

92
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,500
and I'm not walking around
bump them over to a digital.

93
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,353
I have to do that.

94
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,293
I'm sorry.

95
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,500
It's so bad.

96
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,334
It's so awesome.

97
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,280
Only get so many runs on the tape so you
to you gotta transfer that should not,

98
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,320
haven't watched them in years.

99
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,760
I'll over transfer.

100
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,880
I can.

101
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,070
I have them like in a sacred spot.

102
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Have candles around them and
make sure it keeps him safe.

103
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,350
I thought it'd be a really
good idea to buy first season,

104
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,450
macgyver DVD box set.

105
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,751
I was like,

106
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,110
fuck where you're at a meeting dollars.

107
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,680
Let me tell you about macgyver.

108
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,440
Macgyver is infinitely
better than Delavan.

109
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,570
I mean,

110
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,840
it's not measurable.

111
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,340
Dell inventory is one of the worst
shows the world has ever known.

112
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,440
That's where man beats up every
young punk that crosses his eye.

113
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,270
He's the best at everything
he does or the grants.

114
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:37,660
Marino fucking you will
drown in Danny Aiello Ego.

115
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,340
You will drown.

116
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,470
You will never make it out alive.

117
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,260
She was good and do the
right thing so well.

118
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,900
He's an amazing listener,

119
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,070
right?

120
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,601
No bullshit.

121
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,370
I don't know who made the script.

122
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,510
I don't know what the fuck happened.

123
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:49,990
That show.

124
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,840
I'm talking about shitty.

125
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,843
I'm talking shit.

126
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
Maybe Danny thought it
was a subtle comedy,

127
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,630
but he's an amazing actor.

128
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,051
There's no,

129
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,320
you can't take that away from them.

130
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:57,641
The Guy,

131
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:00,520
he's an incredible actor and so
of course he has a bit of an ego.

132
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,890
He's,

133
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,141
he's,

134
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,410
he's fucking bad ass.

135
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,244
He's a bad ass actor,

136
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,850
but still,

137
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,140
that show was so bad.

138
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,490
It hurt your feelings.

139
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,923
It was.

140
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,011
It was so bad.

141
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,970
You would watch it and go,

142
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,680
Holy Shit.

143
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,673
Like he plays,

144
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,680
he plays pool with this guy,

145
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,491
this young punk,

146
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,800
and he fucking shoots in
every ball and the guy goes,

147
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:18,910
you're the best I've ever seen.

148
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,530
Mr. What's your secret?

149
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,010
He goes,

150
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,843
my secret,

151
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,020
don't miss.

152
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,650
It's the best,

153
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,940
worst show ever.

154
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,810
This fall in a fetal position and,

155
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,330
and break your own fingers
because you screwed.

156
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,440
See them so tightly,

157
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,400
so embarrassed for him.

158
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,150
Let me tell you about the first season.

159
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,003
The episodes,

160
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,850
I don't know.

161
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,271
I don't know.

162
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,920
There's had two seasons I think.

163
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,760
I think he went to see,

164
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,080
they might have been just one season.

165
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:44,914
I'm not sure.

166
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,570
I have a nice box of them.

167
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,610
The first season of macgyver to watch it.

168
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,520
It's three quarters voiceover.

169
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,020
I don't random jungle shots like
helicopter over the jug with like,

170
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,250
and then I broke him out of prison.

171
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:57,701
It's like him.

172
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,534
No Way.

173
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,180
Next voiceover

174
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,310
bullshit thing really that bad.

175
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,860
They could have shot the entire thing
are seasoned and about four days.

176
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,790
What if,

177
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,180
okay,

178
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,781
let's say,

179
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:10,290
uh,

180
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,030
I don't know anything about
your personal situation,

181
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:12,451
but it's,

182
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:13,590
let's say you're in love.

183
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,490
You're found the girl.

184
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,690
This is the one you want to marry.

185
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,524
Okay.

186
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,910
And you have the opportunity
for one day or one hour,

187
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:25,911
let's say an hour to feel what it's
like for you to fuck her and she gets to

188
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:31,371
feel what it's like to be you
having sex with her so you,

189
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:35,970
you feel what it's like to be her getting
fucked by you and she feels what it's

190
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:38,880
like for you to fuck her.

191
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,860
We think you could do that.

192
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:42,930
Do you think you could lie there
and get fucked by yourself?

193
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,580
I don't think I could handle an hour.

194
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,410
I don't think I can handle it.

195
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,480
Our of what I'm dealing with.

196
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,440
There's nothing you could do that.

197
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:53,460
Do you think you could deal with like
kissing you and do you think you'd love

198
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,430
her enough to let her be you
for an hour and you'd be her?

199
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,610
I really love myself so I'm pretty sure
that if I got fucked by me and if I was

200
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,120
a chick for an hour,

201
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,980
I'd probably really enjoy it.

202
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,814
I'd probably be,

203
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,493
if I was,

204
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,670
if I was a check,

205
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,850
I'd probably be a squirter.

206
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,050
Do you think you'd give up the booty?

207
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,520
What'd you go anal.

208
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,080
Would I give it a check and just
taking the ask from yourself?

209
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,691
Well for me,

210
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,021
yeah.

211
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:21,920
I mean I'm yourself.

212
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,073
Yeah.

213
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,830
You spit on your hand or writing around
solar analogy back and open it up wide

214
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,903
for you.

215
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,340
I don't Dunno if I should go
ask them out for yourself.

216
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,200
That's the real quick question.

217
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,460
How much do you really love yourself?

218
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,640
Because you probably don't love yourself
enough to go after ass to mouth on

219
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,090
yourself.

220
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,300
Fuck.

221
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,680
But if you watch porn,

222
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,440
girls who don't even love guys
are willing to go ask to mouth.

223
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:42,920
Right?

224
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,180
So consider,

225
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:44,901
well,

226
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,550
the [inaudible] are
getting like 2000 bucks.

227
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,900
So do I hope for two thousand
five thousand to fuck myself?

228
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,360
If that's all it takes for
you to go ask him mouth,

229
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,380
we can have that arranged

230
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,220
the way it has to be fucking upset,

231
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,460
right?

232
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,030
Yep.

233
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,990
We'll just make a mask.

234
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,110
We just make a mask.

235
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,963
It

236
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,840
would just make a mass
that looks just like you.

237
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,591
It's not gay.

238
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,400
If it's yourself,

239
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,190
how about we make them bass looks just
like you and we put it on a girl with a

240
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:11,000
strap on.

241
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
So it is like you're fucking yourself.

242
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,000
Not Enough.

243
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,520
No,

244
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,290
definitely not.

245
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,220
You need to be the girl.

246
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,750
I need to actually be a girl.

247
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,621
Because then you'd say,

248
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,041
yeah,

249
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm,

250
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,301
I'm not even me.

251
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:20,770
I'm hurting.

252
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,141
You look down,

253
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,010
you see your penis and you go,

254
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,903
oh no,

255
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,661
no.

256
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,590
I'm still a guy.

257
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,110
That's a fuck on a game I play.

258
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,093
I know.

259
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,150
I'm so confused.

260
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,230
I don't know whether I would
fuck this thing or I wouldn't.

261
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,640
I don't know what's me and what's not.

262
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,353
Okay.

263
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,400
Oh Shit.

264
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,880
Itunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

265
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:05,420
Server.
