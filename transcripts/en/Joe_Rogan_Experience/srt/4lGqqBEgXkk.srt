1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,660
David Seaman who was on the podcast last
week had a really interesting take on

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,880
coin that I thought it was kinda funny.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,480
Um,

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,010
he was saying that if,

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,330
if bank,

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,650
like Bank of America for site,

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,520
if they were smart,

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,800
they would get involved in bitcoin.

10
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,640
He was like,

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,060
you already have this
established name brand.

12
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,980
Like cryptocurrencies
are going to be here.

13
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:22,190
They're,

14
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:22,550
they're,

15
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,030
they're,

16
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,870
they're here to stay.

17
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,733
This is his take.

18
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,090
He's like,

19
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,050
why wouldn't you capitalize on the name
brand that you've already built in on

20
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,230
and get on the mark and quick get in on
it now in the early days and establish

21
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,830
like that Bank of America
like still has uh,

22
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,020
like a footing in,

23
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:42,530
in this as well as in regular money.

24
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,370
And he was like,

25
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,840
it would be a really wise investment.

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,910
I think you're going
to see that happening.

27
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Um,

28
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,120
in short time really,

29
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,361
um,

30
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,530
we saw this with the Internet,

31
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,400
which was at first the telecommunications
companies fought tooth and nail.

32
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,200
They could not believe
that a decentralized packet
switch network like the

33
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,180
Internet would deliver quality,

34
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,650
voice and quality video.

35
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:07,380
They wanted to build highly
controlled and structured networks.

36
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,603
Um,

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,960
and they tried to fight it because it,

38
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,120
it threatens and long distance market,

39
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,260
which was very lucrative.

40
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,490
It threatened many other markets.

41
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,324
Today,

42
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,600
three quarters of all international
calls happen on Skype.

43
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,650
Three quarters,

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,370
three quarters.

45
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,760
That's,

46
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,490
that's a market that a few,

47
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:23,990
you know,

48
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,290
two decades ago was,

49
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,650
uh,

50
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,101
15,

51
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,320
$20 billion market and disappeared.

52
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,430
Um,

53
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,590
and essentially they had
to restructure operations.

54
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,730
Now they made up for it.

55
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,790
The smart ones became very
good as Internet service
providers and created whole

56
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,331
new businesses.

57
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,950
The replace those lost revenues.

58
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,670
So,

59
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,110
so what happened there is you have these
telecom companies trying to fight it

60
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,660
until some of the smaller ones,

61
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,150
some of the ones that don't have solid,

62
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,880
entrenched positions and
can't take advantage of size.

63
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,471
Thank,

64
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,490
you know what we've,

65
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm going to cut off from this herd and
go play with that bit bitcoin a bit.

66
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,720
And as soon as that starts happening,

67
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,870
there's almost a stampede because
everybody tries to rush into it.

68
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,330
That's what happens
with telecommunications.

69
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:09,630
The smaller providers started peeling
off from the herd and instead of fighting

70
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:09,751
it,

71
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,910
they started trying to
build service providers.

72
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,880
So it's really just a
matter of who runs first,

73
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,030
right?

74
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,740
Someone's going to start
running and then right.

75
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,200
And then the first breaks apart
because until the first one breaks,

76
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,011
everyone's like,

77
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:23,301
well,

78
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:26,010
we were too serious
for this bitcoin stuff.

79
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,700
And they're looking over their shoulder
trying to make sure that everybody else

80
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,320
is also staying away from it.

81
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,960
But eventually the market dynamic changes.

82
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,690
So it's just essentially,

83
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:36,830
it's just human nature,

84
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,430
like with human nature this to certain
rules that are just always going to be

85
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:41,264
into place,

86
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,340
play hard to get and follow the leader.

87
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,210
Those are two big ones.

88
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,340
Yeah.

89
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,340
And bitcoin threatens some business
structures within the banking industry.

90
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:51,341
It May,

91
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,460
it's gonna make it difficult for
them to charge exorbitant fees to do

92
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:56,530
international wire transfers
when you can do it cheaper.

93
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,510
Just like if you have Skype,

94
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,550
you can't $3 a minute
long distance calls and,

95
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,290
but at the same time,

96
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,050
the smart bankers are looking
at this and their thing.

97
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,771
Yeah.

98
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,410
But if we have a cheap,

99
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,071
efficient,

100
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,360
secure payment system,

101
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,500
we can build some really interesting
things on top of that and create whole new

102
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,980
businesses that are very competitive
that can actually give us a lead.

103
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,820
So we,

104
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,100
our alge run the heard the,

105
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,850
you know,

106
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,080
disruption in a competitive
market is actually very,

107
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,810
very enticing to the,

108
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,350
to the second and third tier players
because they don't have an advantage.

109
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,390
They're too small to compete
against the big guys.

110
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,550
But if they see this
disruptive technology,

111
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:39,791
I think,

112
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,570
well maybe if I hit your ride on
that I'm going to overtake everybody.

113
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,650
Um,

114
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,640
and you know,

115
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:49,120
I can be the blockbuster
or I can be the Netflix,

116
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,590
I can be the tower records
or I can be the iTunes.

117
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,830
And we've seen this happen
in technology races before.

118
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,401
Yeah,

119
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,240
that's fascinating.

120
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,901
How people,

121
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,930
some people just don't want
to buck the trends they did.

122
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,320
They don't want to go along with the
flow of things or they want to buck the

123
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:05,681
trends.

124
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,270
They want to somehow or another figure
out a way where they can prove everybody

125
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,751
else wrong.

126
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,410
And VHS is making a comeback.

127
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,031
And you know,

128
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,620
renting movies is still valid.

129
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,130
You know,

130
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,430
there's,

131
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,770
there's a lot of those fuckers out
there that just won't let it go.

132
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,250
Radio companies change is scary.

133
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:21,940
Yeah.

134
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,773
It is scary.

135
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,260
But that's,

136
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,891
that's a,

137
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,450
that's the nature of the beast.

138
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,830
Especially today when we're involved in
the craziest time for change the world

139
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:30,664
has ever known.

140
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,170
Yeah.

141
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,920
Um,

142
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,900
there at the moment,

143
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,670
being on the top of an industry,

144
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:39,060
especially an industry that's involved
in technology is a very precarious

145
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:39,894
position.

146
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,230
You know,

147
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,580
if you talked to,

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,833
um,

149
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,990
Kodak a decade ago,

150
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,400
do you think they would,

151
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,490
they would realize that suddenly it's
the largest vendor or manufacturer of

152
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:56,400
cameras in the world would
be a telephone company.

153
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,990
Nokia,

154
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:57,991
Nokia,

155
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:02,991
within three years became the world's
largest maker of cameras and suddenly the

156
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,040
entire industry changed.

157
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,790
Right.

158
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,260
And how do you compete against that?

159
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:08,610
They're not even in your industry.

160
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,050
They just came out of left field.

161
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:13,470
It's like you're suddenly the horse
buggy manufacturer and forward is taking

162
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:16,950
your business and you never
expected that was going to happen.

163
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,321
Well,

164
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,540
Nokia has a camera phone now,

165
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,890
a windows phone.

166
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,070
That is some insane amount of pixels.

167
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,570
It's like 40 fucking
megapixels or something.

168
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,623
Something crazy.

169
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,580
41 41 megapixel says Jamie,

170
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,780
Jamie's on top of that shit.

171
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,450
41 fucking megapixels on a phone.

172
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,000
I mean this thing I think
has have the note three,

173
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,770
I think it has 12 or something.

174
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,031
You know,

175
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,050
it's better than that.

176
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,760
Are you familiar with Moore's law?

177
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,810
Yes.

178
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,350
So,

179
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,981
so for,

180
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,540
for your listeners to Moore's law,

181
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,180
it was created by Gordon Moore processors,

182
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:49,450
right?

183
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,860
Processing speed and yeah.

184
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:55,390
And what he said was that he estimated
that because of the way silicon works

185
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,860
every 18 months,

186
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,430
the speed of a computer with double
or the price would drop by half.

187
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,300
And that has been true now
for more than 25 years.

188
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,200
Wow.

189
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,650
And,

190
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,580
and that thing then plays
out in camera megapixels,

191
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,580
in storage on SD cards in the size of the,

192
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,870
of your smartphone,

193
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,651
in the,

194
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,490
a number of sensors you can
put into the smartphone.

195
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,450
And it's battery.

196
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,830
Battery life is the one
that's lagging behind.

197
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,410
And it's the main thing that's
holding back this technology.

198
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,080
Moore's law also applies
to things like bitcoin.

199
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,760
It also applies to networks like the
Internet and what it means is that if

200
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,880
you're in an industry that's established
and suddenly you have a competitor

201
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,400
that's coming at you with
the power of Moore's law,

202
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,580
you better watch out because you're in,

203
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,010
it's not a matter of whether you
will be able to compete in a decade.

204
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,310
It's a matter of whether your
industry will still exist in a decade.

205
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,880
Right,

206
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,713
right.

207
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,180
Yeah.

208
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,370
Isn't that fascinating?

209
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,100
That whole industries can just vanish

210
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,010
150 years of Kodak and then
suddenly film doesn't exist.

211
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,220
Gone in the decade.

212
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,550
Do you remember when you used to
have to pay money for long distance?

213
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,600
You know,

214
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,250
long distance calls don't exist.

215
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:08,300
Like you can call New York right now and
your home phone and it's regular call

216
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,051
on your cell phone.

217
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,100
It's totally normal.

218
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,040
Like if you used to call long
distance on a cell phone,

219
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,290
it was an exorbitant amount of money.

220
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,940
Saturday afternoons,

221
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,090
London payphone.

222
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,340
When I was a student,

223
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,530
I would go there with a stack of coins
that was probably about $10 worth in

224
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,364
today's money.

225
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,870
I would sit in a payphone and my family
would know what time I was going to call

226
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,773
coordinated.

227
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,790
I'd call in,

228
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,100
they'd be a line of 15 relatives sitting,

229
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
standing behind the phone on
the Athens side and would be,

230
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,941
hi mom,

231
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:38,721
I love you very much.

232
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,201
Hi Dad.

233
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:39,951
I love you very much,

234
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:40,700
Hasis.

235
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,540
It's all awesome.

236
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:41,871
Okay,

237
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,270
next aunt,

238
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,393
aunt Maria.

239
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,590
Julie Ann's what?

240
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,910
London is awesome.

241
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,270
And I'm stuffing coins as fast
as I can into this pay phone.

242
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,104
And then you know,

243
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,460
four or five minutes later,

244
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:53,750
$10 down the drain,

245
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,170
and I've said hello to the entire
family and that's all I could afford.

246
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:57,650
Wow.

247
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,820
That was my experience.

248
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,160
And now you could Skype for
hours for free and not crazy.

249
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,440
Yeah.

250
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,880
Look at a video of each other,

251
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,670
talking to each other
through your laptop for free.

252
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,051
Wow.

253
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,861
Fascinating,

254
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:10,630
fascinating times.

255
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,350
When you put it in that
kind of a perspective,

256
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,360
you really sort of understand the change.

257
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,733
They just,

258
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,600
the ability that we have to reach out
to each other is just unprecedented in

259
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,261
human history.

260
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:24,530
It's never been even remotely
close to what it is now.

261
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,830
I saw somebody walking down the street
the other day skyping with someone while

262
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,260
they were walking on the street and they
were talking while they're walking down

263
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:30,561
the street.

264
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:30,801
They're like,

265
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,041
yeah,

266
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,060
so we're going to blah,

267
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,250
and then the other
person's on the other end.

268
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,270
I'm looking at their phone.

269
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:35,511
I'm like,

270
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,171
this is crazy.

271
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,970
They're doing it through
a cell phone connection.

272
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,230
I'm doing that all the time now.

273
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:39,860
Yep.

274
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,290
Walking down the street through
a cell phone connection,

275
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,270
streaming video back
and forth to each other.

276
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,133
It's amazing.

277
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,973
Amazing.

278
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,260
Okay.
