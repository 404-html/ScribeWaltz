1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,893
Hello

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,993
bitches,

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,270
if you had the opportunity to go
and view any culture from the past,

4
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:11,020
like if you could be completely invisible
and walk around amongst the Romans or

5
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:15,400
cave people or native Americans
before the Europeans came,

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,503
what would you choose?

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,021
Wow,

8
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:17,801
that's really hard.

9
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:18,330
Question.

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,163
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,450
Um,

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,290
I think,

13
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,610
I don't know when the time would be,

14
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,980
but the first time where anything
was trying to be colonized,

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,340
like changed from being what your regular.

16
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,050
Like the first time I got boat showed up
in Polynesia or something like that and

17
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,050
some white people got out,

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,321
right?

19
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,600
We're used to being in
the fields every day and,

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,490
and you know,

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,700
this guy hunts and this guy watches
after the boys and teaches them and this

22
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,600
one's already more all you know.

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,780
And then all of a sudden they
come up and they're building like,

24
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:56,614
you guys.

25
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,210
Well yeah,

26
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,830
you live for colored Cox.

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,170
Women are staring at their fucking
balls two feet from the ground.

28
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:07,004
What are these things?

29
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,330
My,

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,630
what the fuck is going on?

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,933
Jesus Christ.

32
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,260
This guy's got a fucking look at his ears,

33
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,220
jumped off his fucking teeth.

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,350
He's got bones in his fucking ear.

35
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,230
Can I get a Bible

36
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,923
lesson?

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,230
There was this thing called Noah's Ark.

38
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:27,831
Sit down.

39
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:29,390
These fuckers don't pay attention.

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,260
Can you fucking round them up?

41
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,310
Calling me and the boys going to
need about 40 these fucking things.

42
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,210
Climb trees.

43
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,260
What is your character's name?

44
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,510
I love the guy who needs
to come back more often.

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,290
This is the conversation,

46
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,683
Joe.

47
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,670
They climb trees.

48
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,380
What do you mean that they fucking.

49
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,090
They don't even don't even
with our hands and an agent

50
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,040
out there for 20 minutes.

51
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,160
Eat a Gundam lead.

52
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,490
I run a fuck is going on.

53
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,760
I'm getting eaten by ants.

54
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,594
He's laughing.

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,030
I saw a statement was in someone went,

56
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,290
it was a tourist spot,

57
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:06,850
but I pass the tourist spot and went in
the house and there was a statement in

58
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,380
there and I know it just,

59
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,370
it's simple,

60
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,550
but it just blew my mind and it said one
person could change the whole world for

61
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,980
a better as long as
they don't give a damn.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,540
Who gets that credit
and that a fucking day.

63
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,470
And I,

64
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,880
and I thought like if you really don't,

65
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,930
if you just want to sit back,

66
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,400
you just want to see things better and
you really can change for the better,

67
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,990
but you don't have to worry about going,

68
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:32,501
you know,

69
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:37,480
so and so said that where someone's so
set that up so and so did that because

70
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,960
now you're doing it for different reasons.

71
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,750
Yeah.

72
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,510
I never had that before.

73
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,730
I'd never heard that before until like
yesterday I saw like I saw that quote

74
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:51,731
into making that's a problem
that I continually have
all of us wanting to all of

75
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,110
those ideas.

76
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,490
And that's,

77
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,490
I think part of what's excellent about
this medium and particularly the way it's

78
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,910
been executed by you lot,

79
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,390
is that it's,

80
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,740
it's discourse,

81
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,101
you know,

82
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,960
like this kind of things.

83
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,460
Not really,

84
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,630
you know,

85
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,081
like you said,

86
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,270
the fast moving fast cut sound,

87
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,900
bitey,

88
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,260
vidyard,

89
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,530
bombarding of an artillery of
mostly erroneous information.

90
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,550
You don't get people here.

91
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,870
People our,

92
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,510
after our talk in examining,

93
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,860
discarding as you said,

94
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,200
who really knows and
returning to that point,

95
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,034
it's sort of,

96
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,020
it's sort of encouraging
because I've had like,

97
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,951
you know,

98
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,360
like as I like,

99
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,340
I've always felt like an I don't like
agree with like a bill o'reilly or Sean

100
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,880
Hannity or those guys.

101
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,940
I've always kind of felt a bit.

102
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,520
I think they were all right
if I hung out with a lot.

103
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,670
There's something about bill
o'reilly can marginally carve.

104
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,020
Oh,

105
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,780
come on.

106
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,560
Like I think I think he was kind of okay.

107
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,950
You would think you would joke around
with them and you guys start laughing

108
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,590
about some things and that's
kind of a reassuring thing,

109
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:50,891
isn't it?

110
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:55,340
And like it to not be kind of like once
you get a like I think that's what's

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,500
kind of ugly about both liberalism
and neoliberalism is as you can see,

112
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,920
is people just forcing their
idea and they've lost touch with.

113
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,210
And I do it all the fucking time.

114
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,560
Yeah.

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,610
Let's start with what is it
that we're genuinely here for.

116
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,530
And that thing you said of like
you can change the world if like,

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:09,880
you know,

118
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,540
no one,

119
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,760
like if you're willing to do,

120
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,000
if no one knowing about it,

121
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,330
that's like,

122
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,830
ah,

123
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,020
the,

124
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,240
the,

125
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,490
the,

126
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:14,820
the,

127
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,520
that I feel in my gut shows me how much
my ego is still involved in the shit I

128
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,060
do.

129
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm not a fan of sharks.

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,153
I don't like them.

131
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,420
They scare the fuck out of me.

132
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,980
And that's what's keeping me from surfing.

133
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,740
Surfing looks like it's fucking awesome.

134
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,260
I see guys like you on those big waves.

135
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,440
But I don't know about the big
waves that that's beyond me.

136
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,270
I believe it.

137
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,350
Even when I was young,

138
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,090
I don't think I ever like this.

139
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
This kind of shit does not.

140
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm not designed for that.

141
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,343
It's not fun looking.

142
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,730
Nope.

143
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,563
That's not me.

144
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,360
We're looking at,

145
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,520
for people who are listening,

146
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,020
we're looking at an image.

147
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,710
Is that you?

148
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:47,990
Who's,

149
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,270
who's?

150
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,371
Uh,

151
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:48,880
that's me.

152
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,541
Well Jesus.

153
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:49,870
Dude,

154
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,703
tell me about this.

155
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,750
It looks like I'm falling off a building.

156
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,430
It looks like you're falling off several
buildings stacked on top of each.

157
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,160
I'll tell you what,

158
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,510
that,

159
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,890
that,

160
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,360
that actual number right there.

161
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,480
I actually felt like I was
falling off a building.

162
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,363
It was an,

163
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,770
I was absolutely sure I was
eating shit right there.

164
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,240
So.

165
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,731
And you didn't.

166
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,001
Um,

167
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:07,451
I didn't.

168
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:07,691
Yeah,

169
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,261
it was a miracle.

170
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:11,260
I actually fell from the top and
landed on my board and made the wave.

171
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,570
And there's a big wave at a,

172
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,970
at a wave off the north
coast of Maui called jaws.

173
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,760
Now how high is that wave?

174
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,070
Probably 50 feet on the face.

175
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,030
Maybe,

176
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,863
maybe more.

177
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,793
Maybe 60.

178
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,340
So you're falling off the top of the wave,

179
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:31,210
like it breaks and you're
coming over the lip or the,

180
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,110
what would you call it?

181
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,960
What do you call the
edge of the wave came up?

182
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,160
Yeah,

183
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,010
I'm falling from the lip.

184
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,290
But the cool thing is you're
doing it with your hands.

185
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:38,490
You know,

186
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,940
like you're doing it with your bare hands.

187
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,320
Like this wave comes in and
you have to read the wave.

188
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,031
You have to time it,

189
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,270
you have to position yourself so you.

190
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,460
So you have to catch it in the steepest
part right before it throws over like

191
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:48,641
that,

192
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,930
because if it throws
over your eating shit.

193
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,980
So you know,

194
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,120
you gotta it's just,

195
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,170
it's so precise,

196
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,661
you know,

197
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:55,450
it'd be able to turn it
on a giant wave like that.

198
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,890
Especially like the bigger
the wave is the it moves.

199
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,971
So it gets really,

200
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,020
really technical and so,

201
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,590
you know,

202
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,210
a few successfully ride
one of those waves.

203
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,044
It's a lot of fun.

204
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,650
I would imagine it gets super addictive
when you're in that tube and you're

205
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,660
slicing through it and you see the water.

206
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,320
Oh yeah.

207
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,730
Going over the top of you.

208
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,300
Yeah,

209
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,750
it is,

210
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,830
it is so much fun.

211
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,281
It's like,

212
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,114
um,

213
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,811
it is,

214
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,710
it's such a blast.

215
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,544
It's um,

216
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,900
it's super addicting.

217
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,380
I,

218
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,770
you know,

219
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,940
I've been surfing since I was,

220
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,080
I've been surfing on,

221
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,080
on a surfboard standing up since I was
five on my surfboard from my dad and um,

222
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,460
I'm still totally obsessed with it.

223
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,294
It's weird.

224
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,750
There's nothing else in my life like
that where I'm absolutely psyched.

225
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,680
Like when the waves are good,

226
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm,

227
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,330
I'm like a little kid still.

228
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,710
What is it about it,

229
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:38,601
dude?

230
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:38,960
It's like,

231
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
it's like hunting.

232
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,581
It really is.

233
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,890
It's like I'm out in nature
and no one's bothering me.

234
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,060
I don't need to talk to anybody.

235
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,960
I can go do my own thing.

236
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,540
I can go down the beach no
matter how shitty of a day I had,

237
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,590
no matter how much stress,

238
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,431
whatever,

239
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,430
like if my kids getting a bad report
card or I had to pay my taxes or whatever

240
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,264
the hell it was,

241
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,380
I can just put on my trunks,

242
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,700
dry down to the beach,

243
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
grab my board and I'm good.

244
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,730
And as soon as I hit the water,

245
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,410
I'm fine.

246
00:06:59,410 --> 00:06:59,670
And,

247
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,540
and that's how I am a bowhunting
and people who don't bow hunt,

248
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,620
they don't understand that.

249
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,041
They're like,

250
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,000
why the hell would he do that?

251
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:05,151
Like,

252
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:05,571
what do you,

253
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,404
what do you find,

254
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:06,981
you know,

255
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:07,130
like,

256
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,420
what do you find good about that?

257
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,490
Like being out in the
forest for days at a time.

258
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,540
It's the same thing.

259
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,250
Just,

260
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:12,530
you know,

261
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,550
people who have a porn addiction,

262
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,663
those coasts,

263
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,090
they're like,

264
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,661
I had to stop,

265
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:16,451
but it was getting crazy.

266
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:17,940
I couldn't concentrate on anything.

267
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Yeah.

268
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,751
Well,

269
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:19,381
that's what they're saying.

270
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,360
Michael Jackson had some
sort of a sex addiction.

271
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,670
Jesus dark too.

272
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:26,361
Super Dark,

273
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,260
like midnight.

274
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,820
It's just spooky that that guy was doing
that to these kids while he was the

275
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,720
biggest star world.

276
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,140
I mean,

277
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,880
we all know it's true.

278
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
What are people still going?

279
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:41,514
No,

280
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,361
because they don't want to.

281
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,200
They don't want to believe.

282
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,190
Come on.

283
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,920
There's an elementary
school near in Hollywood,

284
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,970
uh,

285
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,370
the,

286
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,160
the auditorium for the school
as Michael Jackson Auditorium.

287
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,430
Feel free to change that
whenever you change.

288
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,540
That's Jamie's version though,

289
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,340
for sure.

290
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,290
It's free.

291
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,580
Oh,

292
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,620
that's so true.

293
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,130
God.

294
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,290
But the sugar amount process,

295
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,640
doesn't matter if it's processed or not.

296
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:08,941
All right,

297
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:09,750
let me ask you this.

298
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,291
I got to pick it up.

299
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:10,861
Put it in the spring.

300
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:11,340
Bottled water.

301
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,031
I just whip your dick out,

302
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,864
bro.

303
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,710
Guess how much?

304
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,910
Not Small enough for that.

305
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,550
Don't piss all over my floor here.

306
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:16,800
Yeah,

307
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,480
you can do it in there.

308
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,790
Just just corn hole that we
have to go soon anyway because,

309
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:20,970
uh,

310
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,410
I got to get something somewhere.

311
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,490
I just got a p folks.

312
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:25,500
Don't put a camera on
him because that's rude.

313
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,910
There he goes.

314
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,750
Don't put a camera on them.

315
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,520
We don't lose our that much.

316
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:32,610
Sugar is in a.

317
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,950
We put the camera nearest Dick or were the

318
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,591
first folks.

319
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:39,210
That's the first time
anybody's peed on the pocket.

320
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,560
Don't take a photo of his dick.

321
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,340
It's blocked by the cup.

322
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,030
Just have you guys taken
a photo of your dick,

323
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:45,820
Bro.

324
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,190
That's a full Kombucha.

325
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,690
Definitely don't drink that.

326
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:49,890
You're going to piss in the pickles too.

327
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,350
How'd you cut off stream?

328
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,921
For sure.

329
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:55,140
You dribbling on my car
but not fully finished.

330
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,430
Fully,

331
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,263
fully,

332
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,193
fully pinched.

333
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,471
Do.

334
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,300
That's a lot of pig.

335
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,580
That's a lot of fear.

336
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,060
Will be at the comedy
store tomorrow night.
