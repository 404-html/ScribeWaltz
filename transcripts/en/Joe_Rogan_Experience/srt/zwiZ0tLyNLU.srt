00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,340
The Joe Rogan experience podcast,
whenever,

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,530
whenever you talked to a rapper or any 
dude who has like a name like kid cuddy,

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,890
you'd never know.
Am I supposed to call you kid?

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,890
I'm immortal technique comes on the 
podcast all the time.

5
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:31,020
To this day,
I don't know what to call that dude.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,050
I love it.
He's cool as fuck.

7
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:35,120
I love talking to them,
but I never know what to call them.

8
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:38,480
Don't call them tech comm.
A mortal Mr.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,570
Technique.
So I had to ask you before this podcast 

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:43,570
started,
I said,

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,160
do I refer to you as kid cuddy or do I 
call you Scott?

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,160
I introduced myself to other human 
beings with my government name Scott.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,580
I don't walk up and say goodbye,
but no.

14
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:58,070
Like I get Mr cuddy sometime and that's 
a little weird.

15
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:59,540
It makes me sound like a stripper or 
something.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,150
Mr [inaudible].
Mr Cuddy,

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,640
Mr Kelly's cool.
If it's like a chick.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,740
Yeah.
Yeah,

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,870
that's a.
it's.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,240
It's a weird.
There's not a whole lot of white dudes 

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,240
who ever pulled off the like the 
nickname,

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,150
like carrot top weird Al Right.
Weird.

23
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:18,120
I was always weird.
Al.

24
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,640
It's always weird.
Al yankovIc.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,450
No.
Hi,

26
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm al yankovic.
It's weird.

27
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,840
al right.
P dot p dot diddy,

28
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:25,100
puff daddy,
prince,

29
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,990
whatever.
A lot of black guys pulled it off.

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,610
I mean just.
You just keep going forever,

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,680
but there's a small handful of white 
people ever pulled off the nickname.

32
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,430
Okay.

33
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,390
I would say you're going to talk about 
captain kirk,

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
captain and captain into neil.
The kid goes deep into the 19 seventies 

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,340
drAwer,
the captain to neil.

36
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,060
What?
How.

37
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,630
That's a terrible band from back waY 
back in the day.

38
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:53,630
Terrible by today's standards,
but back in the day,

39
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,390
people love them.
Do you remember the captain into.

40
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,890
You know,
I don't remember what they sang.

41
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:02,891
I shouldn't even say that terrible 
because I'm being a dick because I 

42
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:02,891
don't.
I doN't remember any of their songs.

43
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:07,480
Probably sitting tHere like,
I believe one of them is dead captain.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,280
I think one of them got some serious 
anorexia through.

45
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:18,281
I think the woman got serious.
I might be mixing my stories up from 19 

46
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,790
seventies bands that I barely pay 
attention to,

47
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,490
but you want to talk about the people 
that have got some fucking stories.

48
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,550
You know,
the people that that grew up during the 

49
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,650
sixties and were like famous during the 
seventies.

50
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,580
Yeah.
Those are,

51
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,000
that's a strange little slice of 
americAn life right there.

52
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,270
You could imagine it was just a whole 
nother way of living,

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,480
you know?
I think there was a lot more 

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,480
communication amongst human beings.
Yeah,

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,210
for sure.
Like just,

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,470
you know,
just casual conversation.

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
It wasn't like weird.
Nowadays if you even just say hi to 

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,520
someone walking down the street,
it's like,

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,180
what the fuck?
Being polite.

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,160
LIke what the fuck did you say to me?
Well,

61
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,650
I think two things are going on.
One,

62
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:59,651
people are just nervous because there's 
a lot of new stories about terrible 

63
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,180
things have happened over world.
Like most of whAt you get in the news is

64
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:06,181
terrible things,
so people always woRried about terrible 

65
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:08,491
things when they meet strangers and then
to everybody's fucking texting and 

66
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,150
emailing and the amount of time you 
spend.

67
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,520
Person a person has probably been 
greatly.

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,890
Yeah,
for sure.

69
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,110
AnD,
and,

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,560
and um,
support,

71
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,420
you know,
there's healthy dose.

72
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,580
They'll probably just put up

73
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,600
picture the capital.
Now we know.

74
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,530
I mean,
one of them love buddy miles.

75
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,230
He has one of those caps and routes all 
the time.

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,240
That's a good cap.
Just letting everybody know that you 

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,240
liked to party.
Miles teller,

78
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,240
miles teller.
He wills,

79
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,860
he wears a cap like that all the time.
That's one of those things.

80
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,740
If you walk around with a captain's hat 
on and you're like a sober guy,

81
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
you're an asshole.
No parties.

82
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,700
He gets it in one of those dudes doesn't
smoke weed.

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,830
Doesn't drink.
I don't do toll straight.

84
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,280
I'd be wearing like a captain's hat.
You're a fucking idiot.

85
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,880
But there's something if you're like 
some hunter s thompson do with captain 

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,900
tat on your,
on while you got a bottle of whiskey in 

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:00,900
one hand,
a bottle of vodka.

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,350
The other that's.
I want to talk to that dude for real.

89
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,640
you know,
I'm hanging out with him.

90
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,290
Yeah.
There's certain outfits that you allowed

91
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,530
to wear if you get fucked up like the 
way stan hope tresses,

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,820
like if stan hope was like a sober guy 
that he can pull off that outfit.

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,700
He's hammered all the time.
So he was wearing this bright checkered 

94
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:19,700
leisure suit or whatever he wears.

95
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah.
Every city he goes to a thrift store and

96
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:25,150
tries to find the most shittiest,
I guess,

97
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:25,730
suit you can pop.

98
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,930
Oh,
sweet stuff that doesn't fit them all 

99
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:30,930
the time.
It's like barely fits him.

100
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,850
He's awesome dude.
You're a,

101
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,690
you're a young man and you're doing very
well.

102
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Everything is going well for you.
This is A trying time in your life.

103
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,430
Yeah,
man.

104
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,410
I'm trying.
What's it like to be kid cuddy?

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,410
Uh,
it's um,

106
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,500
it's cool man.
I feel like it's intrusive.

107
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,390
No,
no.

108
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,150
I mean,
um,

109
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,220
you know,
it's nothing too spectacular.

110
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,530
I'm mostly like trying to stay creative 
and uh,

111
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,030
hang around family a lot,
get family time and when my mom and my 

112
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,181
daughter and so,
like my life is split between that and 

113
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:03,460
you know,
creating,

114
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
you know,
it's a good balance.

115
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,090
I found the balance now at 30.
At 32,

116
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,610
you're living the dream.
Yeah,

117
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,240
it's cool,
man.

118
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,820
I can't complain.
You know,

119
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,650
the days I complained,
I realize I can't complain.

120
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,530
You definitely can't complain.
No,

121
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,590
I mean to be a professional entertainer 
is probably the luckiest job of all 

122
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,370
time.
Like you made it.

123
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,290
Well,
it's really deeper than that.

124
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,710
I think that just have a fan base,
you know,

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,980
that supportive is the real ultimate 
blessing because you know,

126
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,700
guys get record deals all the time,
you know,

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,610
some of their music and shit,
you know,

128
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,190
but then it's just like,
you know,

129
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,770
but then when you have,
you know,

130
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,440
you have a lot of artists that come and 
you know,

131
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,560
ended up having like a grassroots 
following and they have a fan base that 

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,080
rides with them then entire career.

133
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,090
That's,
that's man,

134
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,100
that's a,
that's a blessing on top of a blessing.

135
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,140
You never know because today's audience,
you know,

136
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,910
these kids like you one minute,
they hate you the next,

137
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,010
like you want me to hit your next and to
have a fan base in that

138
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,510
type of climate and it's awesome.

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Yeah,
that is the thing that it used to be 

140
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
like if you were a rapper or any kind of
entertainer,

141
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,260
you were only as good if you're a 
comedian,

142
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,370
you're only as good as the people got to
see you out there.

143
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:17,371
LIke it was really difficult to,
to build a fan base if you weren't on 

144
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:20,941
something,
if you weren't on a television show of 

145
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:20,941
your warrant,
you know,

146
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,450
a weekly regular guests length the 
tonight show or something like that.

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,300
It was really hard for someone like 
build a fan base.

148
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,450
But today because of the internet,
rappers,

149
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,470
singers,
musicians,

150
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:30,550
I mean everybody,
comedians,

151
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,580
all,
they can kind of keep tabs and just 

152
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,580
communicate with people directly.

153
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

154
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,360
And I feel like I caught him was at the 
beginning,

155
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:43,361
the early stages of that wave of just 
know another way for people to find 

156
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,890
music online,
new artists,

157
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,810
you know,
music that you probably wouldn't hear on

158
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,480
the radio stuff.
That's quality,

159
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,470
quality,
you know,

160
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,220
music and now you know,
things are way more advanced.

161
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,720
Even since when I started,
you know,

162
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,340
when I dropped dead at night,
that was 2007.

163
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,360
I think the only platform at that time 
that I had at my disposal to upload 

164
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,251
music was my space and that was 
literally how the world discovered my 

165
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:09,890
voice,
you know,

166
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,600
through my space music page.
And how did my space dropped the ball so

167
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:19,601
hard had the world by the balls.
They had everybody.

168
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,950
I think,
um,

169
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,630
you know,
everybody I don't think,

170
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,130
I don't even think they've fallen off 
like that.

171
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:28,940
I just think that there's just so much.
There's just so much out there.

172
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,460
There's definitely,
there's an over abundance of,

173
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,300
you know,
this,

174
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,120
like for every facebook there's five 
more other facebook's.

175
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,310
Well there's always new ones coming out 
too.

176
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,650
It's got to be hard to figure out a new 
thing though.

177
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:41,570
Like what's the new things that involve 
video?

178
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,850
What's going to be the new thing?
Memes and emojis.

179
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,710
I think it's just a combination of 
everything just like,

180
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:51,711
well you,
it's a one stop shop to just anything 

181
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,280
that you can dick around on the internet
with.

182
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,780
It's possible through this

183
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,610
app,
you know,

184
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,960
probably.
Right.

185
00:07:55,961 --> 00:08:00,961
And I think it's also,
have you seen that new thing that a 

186
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,130
unbox therapy did a video on?
Oh my god.

187
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:07,420
Louis from unbox therapy did this video 
of this new iron man tech.

188
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,360
If you go to his page,
go to unbox therapy.

189
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,430
Iron man for real.
I think it's called as a youtube video 

190
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,430
that he put up.
It's insane to do.

191
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,150
You're putting on these gloves.
Are these goggles rather that cover your

192
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,920
cover,
your eyes sort of oculus rift style.

193
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,230
but you see everything.
I would see you clearly.

194
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,490
But in front of you there's like icons 
and things that I can move around.

195
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:31,180
I can open things and close them.
And you do it all with hand gestures.

196
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,630
So like as I'm looking at you,
if I have these glock,

197
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,670
these goggles on,
I'd be looking at you and I'd see these 

198
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,861
floating geometric objects like boxes,
circles and you can open them up and 

199
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:45,220
close them and move them around and they
stay places like minority report style.

200
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Oh she remembers doing that on a screen.
But you're going to be able to do it 

201
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,221
like in the air,
like when tony stark put that helmet on 

202
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:56,900
it,
that's going to be like reality and in 

203
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:56,900
his

204
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,390
words and louis' words,
he said,

205
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,750
this guy wants to make the world the 
desktop.

206
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,960
The world is your screens while it's 
takeaway screens and the screens are 

207
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,171
going to be the world.
You put this thing on and you just see 

208
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:09,171
through it and there's no more screens 
anymore.

209
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:10,680
Everything you do,
you do through this.

210
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,870
This is his ultimate goal.
Now there's the like the glasses look 

211
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,930
all like fucking gnarly,
like some super visor,

212
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,150
virtual reality them,
they're right up there.

213
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,670
They're pretty big right now.
But so was the first phone.

214
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,010
Remember those home telephones,
those giant boxes?

215
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,250
They used to have to crank call people 
up and needs to fucking put cables into 

216
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,670
holes and shit.
You remember all that.

217
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,670
That was what a,
that was an old phone used to be like,

218
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,700
but you know what,
this type of technology you wouldn't 

219
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,700
want,
you know,

220
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,270
walking down the street or like on you 
everyday that easily to access.

221
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,020
I mean,
people wouldn't,

222
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,100
you know what I mean,
like it's kind of like not that weird 

223
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,141
that it's kind of big and something that
you gotta like be stationary with at 

224
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:57,810
home.
That's actually saves,

225
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,530
saves a world in some small way for a 
few years.

226
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,230
You met?
Yeah.

227
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,100
Until like,
you know,

228
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,250
apple figures it out to have it on your 
phone or something.

229
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,430
But they're gOnna they're gonna make it 
in like a google glass form for sure.

230
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,340
Well the google glasses is like just a 
smaller version of that.

231
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,450
yeah.
So you can't,

232
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,030
you can't,
you swIpe and stuff,

233
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,910
but you can't really manipulate the 
image in real time.

234
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,590
Have you played with it at all?
Yeah,

235
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,590
I got one.
One,

236
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,030
it's a,
you know,

237
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,730
it's cool.
It was,

238
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,440
I mean I'm not gonna.
I went out in the streets a couple times

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,870
and I really noticed.
I actually tweeted about this,

240
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,600
tweeted about it because it was so funny
to me.

241
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,510
My experience going on public with 
google glasses.

242
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:38,511
People just really thought that I was 
either taking a picture of them are 

243
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,541
filming them and that when people were 
really concerned because there's no 

244
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:41,541
like,
recording lie and you could tell it,

245
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,840
there's a lens there,
you know,

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,470
and especially once you miss people ask 
you what it is and you say google glass,

247
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,520
people have heard about it.
They're like,

248
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,980
are you filming me?
And I thought it was interesting,

249
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,590
you know,
because this is something that like,

250
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,190
you know,
you might see a celebrity,

251
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:58,191
you know,
freak out beCause they're getting 

252
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:58,191
photographed or filmed trying to,
you Know,

253
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,430
live their lives and do something with 
their families and try to have some 

254
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,881
privacy and then the public really 
doesn't understand why they might freak 

255
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,390
out and why that might be intrusive,
but it's,

256
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,690
it's a funny twist for me to walk in a 
place and all of a sudden someone's 

257
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:11,690
like,
are you filming me?

258
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:11,700
Whoa,
whoa.

259
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:13,100
Like,
what are you doing this?

260
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:13,650
It's like,
no,

261
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:18,651
I'm not filming a random person that's 
intrusive because I understand that 

262
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:22,311
that's intrusive,
but it is a potential option for the 

263
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:22,311
future.
That's what's weird about it,

264
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:22,590
but it just,
it was,

265
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,880
it was interesting to just see like that
was besides people being like,

266
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,510
oh,
it's cool,

267
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,650
can I try it?
It was just like,

268
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,110
are you filming me?
Like,

269
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,180
are you filming mary taking a picture at
home?

270
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,630
I supposed to know that you're telling 
me the truth,

271
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,730
you kNow,
because you could just be lying and then

272
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,170
even if I take it off it cuts off so 
it's not like you could see what I'm 

273
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,170
seeing when I'm doing it.
You know,

274
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,730
They have little cameras,
members stand hope had that fox show way

275
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:48,790
back then they had little cameras that 
would go on glasses like in the eyes,

276
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,030
the eyebrow part of a glass and he put 
his glasses on and he would walk into 

277
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,100
some and do these pranks

278
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,250
and they would.
The film was good enough to put on 

279
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,250
television and that was a long time ago.
Yeah,

280
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,110
I mean you could film stuff and put it 
up on your twitter through the google 

281
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,560
glass and the photos are pretty quality 
of that in a couple of times.

282
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh wow.
It's going to get crazier than that 

283
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:10,580
right there.
It's gonna.

284
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,320
Get to some point where you're going to 
be able to put contact lenses on or 

285
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,320
something,
you know,

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,950
but I don't know.
I mean that's,

287
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,410
that's wild shit with the contact lenses
and they all have their own.

288
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,430
they get charged with solar power 
because your eyes are always open.

289
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,070
Yeah.
Constant solar energy.

290
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,780
Right?
Technology in my eye though,

291
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,680
I don't know if I want to.
Yeah,

292
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:34,681
I definitely don't want to right now,
but if the problem is everybody has it 

293
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:38,750
and it's awesome,
you know,

294
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,980
I mean I would have always been tied to 
a phone just because it's so dope.

295
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,870
Like to have a phone.
That's an incredible thing.

296
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,770
I'd rather have a cyborg arm before I 
have a contact,

297
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,350
a cyborg arm.
You know what I mean?

298
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,460
But when you see the real thing about 
the sidebar ground,

299
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,690
that really freaks me out.
This is no bullshit.

300
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,430
It really does kind of freak me out.
I,

301
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,920
we watched this video once of a dude 
from Australia.

302
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,900
They got his arm and his leg bid off.
I think I've seen that exact shit.

303
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,910
It's amazing,
so this guy had no army,

304
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,930
no leg,
but he walked without a limp and his 

305
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:10,930
hands moved around and didn't move as 
good.

306
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,560
I mean it probably couldN't play piano 
or something like that,

307
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:15,130
but move pretty god damn good.
A lot better than the old ones that came

308
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:20,131
With the hook style old ones and I was 
thinking like this guy is still a 

309
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:21,580
person,
100 percent human,

310
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,760
but he has an artificial arm and an 
artificial leg.

311
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,810
Like what if,
what if the shark bit everything but his

312
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,870
head and they took his head and they put
it on an artificial body.

313
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,570
What would that be?
THat is that still a person.

314
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
I guess it's a person because you got a 
person's head,

315
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,590
but what if they said,
listen man,

316
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,890
this transfer of your head to this 
artificial body is not working that 

317
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,980
good.
Your body's rejecTing it.

318
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,130
You're head's rejecting the body,
but the good news is we can completely 

319
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,060
duplicate your brain and put it in this 
artificial head.

320
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,390
So to be like your brain,
except better because it's never going 

321
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:57,490
to get old.
It's not going to rot away like,

322
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,840
well,
are you a person then?

323
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,660
No,
because I think your soul is gone.

324
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:04,120
At that point.
I would like to believe that too,

325
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,440
but imagine if that's how people were 
essentially created in the first place.

326
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:11,050
Just what if they slow improvements,

327
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,010
what if they go,
okay,

328
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:18,011
we're going to take a snapshot of your 
brain right now because we're going to 

329
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,550
transfer it to this new body,
so anything after this point,

330
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,610
you know you're not going to remember.
So then in for like 10 minutes before 

331
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,750
they pulled the plug on this body,
you can just abuse the person that death

332
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,810
or even your body,
not the existential angst

333
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,460
dying and having no soul.
You're thinking about playing with 

334
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,460
someone ball

335
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,150
and you're 40.
Congratulations.

336
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,840
Speaking of cameras,
joe,

337
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,830
I just got one added to my car so it 
records everything.

338
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:48,831
Now that my car does and it does it on 
gps and then when you watch it on your 

339
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,890
computer,
it shows real time.

340
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:54,050
Google maps and a three 60 view almost 
of your car,

341
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,200
your front.
And that's pretty interesting.

342
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,140
Yeah,
it's called roadhog hawk,

343
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,160
hawk road hockey,
and what it does is you just put a 

344
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,820
memory card in there and it constantly 
records.

345
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,120
Where are the cameras?
The cameras like this little box,

346
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:12,470
it looks like a baby radar detector that
you just put a underneath your,

347
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,650
uh,
behind your rear view mirror.

348
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,150
So you just put on the windshield right 
there and you have to run power.

349
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:25,151
I just plug mine into my cigarette 
lighter and it connects to gps and it 

350
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,050
records on a memory card.
Where's the cameras?

351
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,250
The camera has a wide angle lens so it 
gets everything in your car,

352
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:36,251
the front of your car and it also gets 
sound and it attracts everything because

353
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,510
I was just tired of driving around 
hollywood,

354
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,150
like going to the comedy store every 
night and then,

355
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,740
and then like almost getting in car 
accidents,

356
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,630
crazy crack heads,
like jumping in the street,

357
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,310
like all this shit happening all the 
time,

358
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,370
like something's going to happen soon,
you know,

359
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,920
and I don't have this polluted.
People have to see this when,

360
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:51,530
you know,
in Russia,

361
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,750
that's when they had those,
uh,

362
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,610
those mediators,
they caught those.

363
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:59,611
That's how they caught him.
They caught him because those people 

364
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:01,631
have dash cams because apparently I'm 
like fraud and like that kind of shit 

365
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:04,510
like accident of fraud,
like super common in Russia.

366
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,870
Like they pull shady moves all the time.
So a lot of people have those little 

367
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,960
cameras on the dash to make sure that 
they could resolve disputes,

368
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,300
you know,
like there was a thing that was going 

369
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,300
around in California for a while where 
people were suing people.

370
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,670
They would get an accent on purpose.
A bunch of people die from it.

371
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,850
They'd get on the highway,
get in front of you and slam on the 

372
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,790
brakes.
So he slammed into him and this one dude

373
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:29,791
who was an illegal alien,
so it was like all the republicans were 

374
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,370
up in arms when he's the only one 
illegal.

375
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:32,890
Alien does something shady.
Everybody freaks the fuck out.

376
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,820
But this student done it a couple of 
times.

377
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,220
He'd done it a couple of times and that 
was his move.

378
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:41,560
That's way it made a lot of money just 
getting in front of people,

379
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:43,270
slam on the crazy.
Yeah,

380
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:47,620
but that's a risky fucking shit where 
you ain't got nothing to lose.

381
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:49,150
It's like fuck it.
Yeah,

382
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,880
I guess it's just they're playing the 
lottery and the promise land just very,

383
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,370
very strange.
That's the item that

384
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,160
item c right there is where you put the 
memory card in

385
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
and it's not that big.
No,

386
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,350
it is kinda like a.
It's hard to tell perspective wise,

387
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,200
it's like a cell phone size basically 
and he just like,

388
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,630
I can't even barely even see my mindset 
high hidden behind my mirror,

389
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,480
like a disposable camera.
It was probably the best way to describe

390
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,680
it.
It's like a disposable camera.

391
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,740
What's cool?
It does like a dvr loop,

392
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:21,741
like would they like a security 
companies do or where they have to film 

393
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:21,741
everything,
like a jewelry store or something.

394
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,750
It just,
when it gets to the end of the memory 

395
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:26,750
card,
it just goes back to the beginning.

396
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:26,900
Unless you pull it out and save the 
files.

397
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,280
Records over records,
everything over and over and over,

398
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,100
long before people start making porn 
with those.

399
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,160
I know,
but you know what it's also great.

400
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Automatically turns on,
so if you give your car to the valet or 

401
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,031
something,
you could hear what they're doing to 

402
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,960
turn it around.
That's what I'm getting at.

403
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,070
That's all right.
SenD me link valet

404
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,660
porn.
Valets.

405
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,060
Blowing each other in your car won't get
onto your car.

406
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,370
You're like,
what the hell?

407
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,340
But I'm reviewing it right now.
I have a review.

408
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,420
What site now do you ever review?
Website?

409
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,970
Java lamps.com.
Oh,

410
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:05,720
that's good.
Yeah,

411
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,570
it's good.
Do you.

412
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,200
You stopped doing that for awhile?
Yeah,

413
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,830
I lost my amazon account.
Wow.

414
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,950
How does that work,
man?

415
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,870
Did you ever try to get it back?
Yeah.

416
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:19,871
I tried three times with my llc,
a social security number or whatever the

417
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:24,740
business id number tried with them,
so it was completely away from me.

418
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,100
I tried everything and finally they just
let me through because of this java 

419
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,810
lamps thing.
TheY did let you through.

420
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,380
They just finally did after about four 
years of not letting me do it.

421
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,220
Just because you changed the name of 
your website?

422
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,000
I guess so website and everything.
I don't know how annoying.

423
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

424
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,330
It seems like there was a weird thing.
It was like they're upset at you because

425
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:48,010
you're connected to porn.
Right?

426
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,050
Porn stars on desk squad meticulous.
Yeah.

427
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,530
There's nothing wrong with porn stars.
Nothing.

428
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,900
Nothing.
You just don't.

429
00:18:56,901 --> 00:19:00,020
They sell porn.
I mean if you go to amazon.com,

430
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:01,630
don't they sell porn?
Yeah.

431
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,430
VIbrators.
They sell hitachi's.

432
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,230
By the way,
did you see ms dot martinez,

433
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:09,920
our friend missy.
I killed tony with us a lot of times she

434
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,890
was on tmz because her hitachi blew up 
in her pussy.

435
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:13,920
No,

436
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,560
really blow up in airports.
You blow it up in her pussy and make it 

437
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,390
the equivalent to the mexican dudes 
slammed on his brakes on the highway.

438
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,720
It was.
Was it the vibrator equivalent?

439
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,040
What happened?
Is it to the breaking crash.

440
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,750
What happened is it starts sparking in 
flames and smoke starts coming.

441
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,320
Footage.
Did she start screaming?

442
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:43,910
Yeah.
The pussies that good.

443
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:46,200
That's why it's sparking.
No.

444
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,480
There's the hitachi though,
and what's weird is that this is not 

445
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:51,480
new.
There's nothing new about this.

446
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,280
If you look online,
there's tons of hitachi's blowing up and

447
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,080
a porn stars.
Yeah,

448
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:59,350
because it's the only vibrator that you 
plug into a wall,

449
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:04,351
so it's like it's like the dumbest 
because it's really for your back 

450
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:04,660
because it's supposed to be high 
powered,

451
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:09,661
but like girls are getting so numbed 
down there that they're using these 

452
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:12,691
hitachi's,
these high powered ones that just shave 

453
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:12,691
off my.

454
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,220
Oh my god.
They take things to the next level.

455
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,000
Just like when we were talking about 
bodybuilders have like the 19 sixties in

456
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:28,001
comparison to the bodybuilders it today.
I think it's the same way with like the 

457
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:30,260
way girls beat on their pussies.
Absolutely embedded in the old days.

458
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,090
Just a little spit and defenders need 
anything that didn't need anything.

459
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,520
Their vaginas.
We're super sensitive technology.

460
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:42,521
Fuck things up.
Soda doesn't fuck things up for us 

461
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:44,290
apparently if you don't.
If you don't have a for skin,

462
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,090
the head of your dick,
it's like kinda just abused.

463
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,380
So it's bouncing around inside your 
underwear and like having a force,

464
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:54,700
getting the reason why men are upset 
that they're not just the fact that it's

465
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,500
ritual,
genital mutilation,

466
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:01,501
that doesn't make any sense,
but also that it kills the sensitivity 

467
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:01,750
in your dick.
Yeah.

468
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,280
but yeah,
I mean that's great.

469
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,290
That's great.
You like you're addicted.

470
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,450
Look like clint eastwood and not like 
fucking ryan seacrest or somethIng.

471
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,420
That doesn't make any sense because 
you're beating the tip of your dick up.

472
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:17,421
I mean if you look at your data,
it looks like you're beating up your 

473
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:20,431
dick and it looks like clinics with 
today talking about clint eastwood from 

474
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:24,580
the fucking outlaw josey wales.
You're talking spaghettI westerns.

475
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,690
I'm talking about porch one.
The handsome clinics would not the crazy

476
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:31,390
looking old man.
Obama.

477
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,030
He talked to obama.
That was.

478
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,990
Do you remember?
Do you remember that shit that he did on

479
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:40,600
tv where you saddled bama down?
No,

480
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,650
you didn't see.
Watch It.

481
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,460
We'll pull this out dude.
Yeah,

482
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:47,170
we'll pull it up.
This was recent.

483
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,260
oh my god.
It was general presidential elections 

484
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,250
pretended to sit obama down onstage and 
improv.

485
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,220
It didn't have anything pointing to say,
but improv'd it.

486
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,900
It was so incredibly disrespectful.
It was so.

487
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,910
He was just pretending to have a 
conversation with sat him down below 

488
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,370
him.
He didn't just have a conversation.

489
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,660
He wasn't like pertaining to have a 
conversation with obama where they're 

490
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:11,660
looking eye to eye like men.
No,

491
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,780
he sat him down in a chair and started.
It was the strangest fucking thing ever.

492
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,860
This is it here.
yeah,

493
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:18,340
yeah,
yeah.

494
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,500
He was having that thing and they were 
talking about hope and change and they 

495
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:23,900
were talking about yes we can.
And,

496
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,580
and it was dark and outdoors and it was 
nice and people are lighting candles and

497
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,850
they were saying,
I just thought this is great.

498
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,460
I mean everybody's crying.
Oprah was crying.

499
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,530
I was even crying.
And then finally I haven't cried that 

500
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,361
hard since I found out that there's 23 
million unemployed people in this 

501
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:58,041
country.
Well,

502
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,940
he sat them down here.
Yeah.

503
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,880
To cry for discretion.
National.

504
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,430
I'm home tomorrow morning.

505
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,590
No,
you got to back it up because that's the

506
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:10,390
chair pushing down in the chair.

507
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,880
You were running for election.
No,

508
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:13,140
no,
no,

509
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,200
back it uP a little bit more now.
It may be time for somebody else to come

510
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,120
along and solve the problem.

511
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,940
So mr.
President,

512
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,390
how do you,
how do you handle a,

513
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,020
how do you handle promises that you've 
made when you were running for election 

514
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,010
and how do you handle,
how do you handle that?

515
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,180
I mean,
what do you say to people do.

516
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,950
You could just,
uh,

517
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,880
you know,
I know people,

518
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:56,060
uh,
people were wondering,

519
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,600
you don't,
but I know even some of the people in 

520
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,890
your own party who were very 
disappointed we did,

521
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,610
didn't close gitmo and I thought,
well I think get cash at closing gitmo.

522
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,860
Why close that?
We spent so much money on it.

523
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,010
Uh,
but,

524
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,690
uh,
I thought maybe it's an excuse a,

525
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,580
what do you mean shut up?
I thought it was just because somebody 

526
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:23,340
has

527
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,510
you.
Otherwise the whole thing worse.

528
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,110
Worse.
I remembered,

529
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,110
I remembered it being bad,
but holy shit,

530
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,230
I like how cnn like jumped to like the 
mtv camera where were there in the 

531
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,591
audience and saw shaky,
like to try to make it more like 

532
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,280
entertaining him talking to him.
So ridiculous.

533
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,150
What the hell is he doing?
He's being an old dude.

534
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,940
That's what he's doing.
Being an old republican dude.

535
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,880
Get all crusty,
conservative.

536
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,110
Not like then they don't like the youth.
The young of America.

537
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,390
Like yourself to that movie.
Didn't he just do that movie though?

538
00:24:58,391 --> 00:24:59,440
Uh,
what was it a.

539
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,620
Well,
he's like the movie and you were just 

540
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:06,620
talking about about the immigrant pissed
about people being on this porch.

541
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,610
Yeah,
I,

542
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,390
no,
it was named after,

543
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,440
but no,
el camino is el camino because he knows 

544
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,700
the grant.
You know the black keys,

545
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,630
the black keys have a cdl

546
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,480
called el camino?
Don't think so.

547
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:26,050
Yeah.
Yeah,

548
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,420
yeah.
El torito,

549
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,540
whatever it was outscored torino grand 
screener.

550
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:40,050
No,
I had a friend whose girlfriend had one 

551
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,050
of those cars

552
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,010
way back in the day.
That was a goofy ass car that was back 

553
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,060
in America.
Just made these houses on wheels.

554
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,750
They made a living room.
They just drove around and this big old 

555
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:50,750
fucking crazy american cars,
man.

556
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Yeah.
That was a movie about what it was like 

557
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:57,900
about immigrants,
wasn't it?

558
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,720
I don't know if it was people moving in 
his neighborhood.

559
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,190
I just remember seeing that in the 
preview,

560
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,090
seeing really pissed about kids being on
his porch yet.

561
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,190
But I mean I was sold.
I mean I wanted to see it.

562
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:11,810
I just never got around to it.
Maybe I'll check it out.

563
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,100
I think you've got better shit to do 
with being pissed about people being on 

564
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,130
phone.
He had a shotgun in his hand to.

565
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,120
Do you remember when clinics.
We did a reality show.

566
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,210
A lot of people don't know that clinics,
which wife was on a reality show before 

567
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,130
we got divorced.
He divorced her,

568
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,400
but she was on a reality show and it was
like some knucklehead chose ridiculous,

569
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:41,090
but he was.
He on episodes.

570
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Don't remember if he was on.
I never watched it,

571
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
but yeah,
it's one of those things where like the 

572
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,890
wife wanted to do it and he was like,
oh,

573
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,560
okay.
He finds himself with some ridiculous 

574
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,190
situation.
Have you ever met him?

575
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,340
No.
I always see him in burbank because I 

576
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,340
think he has a studio at warner 
brothers,

577
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,310
so he's always walking on the sidewalk 
out there and it's weird just driving by

578
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,350
glenn did.
That guy gets a path from for life for 

579
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,390
me,
for the unforgiven that I think it's the

580
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,620
greatest cowboy movie of all time.
Oh yeah.

581
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,190
That shit was like,
it was so realistic,

582
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,320
so dope.
That was such a good,

583
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,750
scary ass cowboy movie.
That was clint eastwood.

584
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,550
Its finest,
you know,

585
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,060
I just love how he's just like,
I don't live like that no more.

586
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,000
No movies.
Just like I'm not that guy.

587
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,670
I love it.
And then they just dragged him in.

588
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,200
Spoiler alert.
Oh yeah.

589
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:36,201
That's not tell him,
but he's like one of those dudes that 

590
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:37,350
becomes this old guy and then he becomes
like super duper conservative.

591
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,660
You know?
There's a bunch of those guys like 

592
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:42,660
cosby's a guy like that.
He's like super duper conservative now,

593
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,400
jon voight.
Yeah.

594
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,060
You know,
I mean that movie though is one of,

595
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,090
is one of my favorites,
especially morgan freeman to one of my 

596
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,090
favorite morgan freeman movie.
Fuck yeah.

597
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,960
Yeah man,
that was just a perfect movie.

598
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,100
Yeah,
just the way the women.

599
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,220
I don't want to give away the ending,
but the way it all goes down so much 

600
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,311
more likely than most of those stupid 
shoot 'em up movies that was much more 

601
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,310
probably like what,
how the way people would behave.

602
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,270
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

603
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:15,390
It was.
And it ended up getting messy in there,

604
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,830
but I like how I kind of just started 
off like real chill and you kinda just,

605
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,520
you know,
okay,

606
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,070
yeah,
I'm here.

607
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.
That was a fascinating look at the old 

608
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,000
west.
I was like,

609
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,821
it's almost like he did it,
like he did all those westerns back in 

610
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:31,821
the day,
like the good,

611
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:33,540
the bad,
and the ugly and fun movies.

612
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,530
But they weren't super realistic,
you know,

613
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,110
and I think as he got older,
I mean I'm just speculating,

614
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:43,260
but he wanted to do one more.
That really got it right,

615
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,500
like the way they make movies today as 
opposed to way they made movies back in 

616
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,400
like high plains drifter days.
Did you see true grit?

617
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,810
Yeah,
I saw both.

618
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,310
I saw the old one,
the new one.

619
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,020
It was not bad.
I knew what it was.

620
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,290
Not bad.
It was not a bad mood.

621
00:28:56,291 --> 00:29:01,291
I liked it.
It's just whenever you have a movie 

622
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:01,680
where you're redoing an old movie,
people are harsh,

623
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
you know?
I mean,

624
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,220
but,
you know,

625
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:07,380
I feel like it kind of brought some of 
that realness that,

626
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,550
you know,
unforgiven hand.

627
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,200
Yeah,
it definitely did.

628
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah,
there was doubt.

629
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,040
I mean,
it was a good movie for sure.

630
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,840
There was a lot of fun shit going on 
that movie.

631
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:19,100
But goddamn man,
remaking a john wayne movies hard.

632
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:19,860
Uh,
uh.

633
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,150
Yeah.
I mean,

634
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,440
you know,
hollywood,

635
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:23,850
they do what they can.
I mean,

636
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:24,810
it wasn't like,
you know,

637
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,540
most of the shit that comes out that 
gives me gurgitate.

638
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,820
It just kind of be hard to make movies,
man.

639
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,170
You know,
one of the beautiful things about,

640
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,450
do you write all your own lyrics?
Yes.

641
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,550
Thank god.
I'm blessed with that ability,

642
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:37,690
you know,
a lot of guys don't see.

643
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,750
Think of that.
Just think of,

644
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:43,790
think of that like how happy you are 
that you write on your shit and imagine 

645
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,560
this,
you're a one man situation.

646
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:47,140
You know,
if you want the kid cuddy experience,

647
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,200
you only go through one door.
There's no one else there so they'd go 

648
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,261
to you,
but you don't have to worry about the 

649
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,990
producer getting along with director,
get along with the actor.

650
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,780
The network has notes of studIo rather 
has notes about the script,

651
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,920
the screenwriter or wants to change this
and the actor wants to improv that.

652
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:12,410
You're managing it out with the fucking 
makeup lady who's fucking the 

653
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:12,410
hairdresser.

654
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,270
Everybody's doing blow after the sets 
closed down.

655
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,430
It's craziness,
man.

656
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,670
Making the movies go down that in music 
though too,

657
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,820
you know,
my career is just purely my vision and 

658
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:25,820
stuff.
so it's a different,

659
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,070
it's a little unorthodox.
And you know what most people do,

660
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,850
you know the average,
you know,

661
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,730
pop star,
It might be about,

662
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,090
you know,
six people involved just to get the 

663
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,090
album together.
You know,

664
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,290
somebody gets songwriter.
If somebody to get the producers in the 

665
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,420
room,
you know,

666
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:44,700
um,
and then there could be chemistry's off,

667
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,730
you know,
this person might not mess with this 

668
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,591
writer and this producer might not mess 
with this artist and there's all this 

669
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:51,810
going on and I'm pretty sure it gets 
messy,

670
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:56,811
but that's this.
I've just been blessed not to deal with 

671
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:56,811
that.
You know,

672
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:57,010
I have a,
I had an idea of,

673
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,090
you know,
what I wanted my career to be and I've 

674
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,090
been sticking to that goal,
that,

675
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,090
that plan.

676
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,610
What was the idea if you could give us 
like a one line of it?

677
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,850
Man,
I really just truthfully wanted to tell 

678
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,550
my story and hopefully it inspired 
others to not feel alone,

679
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,610
you know,
and understand that they can persevere 

680
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:16,610
through anything,
you know.

681
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,211
And at that time of writing,
I like to tell people I don't even know 

682
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:20,910
if I believed half of this shit.
I wrote,

683
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,900
you know,
like when I,

684
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,600
when I may pursue the happiness,
I was hopeful for happiness,

685
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:27,300
but I was in such a dark place at that 
song.

686
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,250
For me it was more of a nightmare.
More than,

687
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,920
you know,
supposed to be a happy,

688
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:34,080
uplifting song.
You in a dark place.

689
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,610
How so?
Well,

690
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:40,500
just like I think coming to terms with 
just the fame factor,

691
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,290
you know,
I always,

692
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,400
I always felt like I would get some type
of recognition,

693
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,460
you know,
I didn't know to what magnitude and you 

694
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:49,460
know,
people say like,

695
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:49,460
oh,
you know,

696
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,640
you know,
what you signed up for,

697
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:53,460
but like really don't,
you know?

698
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,680
And you kind of have an idea and you 
feel like,

699
00:31:55,681 --> 00:32:00,681
oh that'd be cool.
But like I didn't and I still to this 

700
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,280
day I don't look in the mirror and see 
myself how other people see me,

701
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,020
you know.
So I never,

702
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:09,021
I never could prepare myself for,
for what came and everything came so 

703
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:09,021
fast,
you know,

704
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,490
I had so that,
that brought on darkness.

705
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,910
Yeah.
Because I just,

706
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,620
I wasn't comfortable and then I had to,
you know,

707
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,480
I was in a place where all this 
pressure,

708
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:23,481
all of a sudden a to be something and to
deliver a certain type of quality and 

709
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,640
these are things that I've stepped up to
the plate and I was excited about doing,

710
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,560
but I didn't know that it would stress 
me out to that magnitude that it did,

711
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,230
you know?
Uh,

712
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,530
I just didn't know that many people will
be watching and paying attention or care

713
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:40,050
that much,
you

714
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,050
know,
what was the number one consequence?

715
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:48,850
I just think the end that I didn't see 
it being too too big of a consequence 

716
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,270
that I couldn't deal with losing a lot 
of my freedom.

717
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,190
But then I have a daughter,
you know,

718
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,670
I just worry so more about her now and I
just want her to have a normal life and 

719
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,910
I want her to,
you know,

720
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,860
have that opportunity and not,
not I think about it more now than I did

721
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:07,950
then,
you know,

722
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,250
right before she was born.
Yeah.

723
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,210
I'm sure.
Yeah.

724
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:12,440
I have children.
Once you,

725
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,710
when you have children,
it really becomes more about them than 

726
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,551
it doesn't even about you and a lot of 
ways the way you live your life is now 

727
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,540
always going to be like,
what's the best way for them,

728
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,120
and if it's not that way,
you're goIng to feel sick,

729
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,320
right?

730
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,220
You're going to feel like you're doing 
something wrong.

731
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,800
Exactly.
It's a weird situation.

732
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:35,801
When you bring people into this world,
you're responsible for little tiny 

733
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,640
people and you gotta you gotta teach 
them shit and raise them and.

734
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,780
Oh yeah,
no one.

735
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,020
It's really hard.
I mean,

736
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:45,021
no,
I wouldn't say no one because I think 

737
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:45,021
people are capable of intellectualizing 
it,

738
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:47,420
but most people have no idea.
I just put it that way.

739
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,300
How intense the love a person has for 
their kid is.

740
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,070
Yeah.
It's pretty intense.

741
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,470
Yeah.
I mean it's,

742
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,910
it's something that,
you know,

743
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:59,030
you have to have.
You have to have a child to experience,

744
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:00,080
you know,
you can't explain it.

745
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,800
You know,
it's,

746
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:02,690
it's just.
I mean,

747
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,300
my is man,
she everything.

748
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,570
It's also by like when you see kids that
are abused,

749
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,560
it's so extra disturbing.
yeah.

750
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,490
Because it's almost unimaginable who 
would do that?

751
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,450
Who would do that to anyone's kid and 
who would do that to their own kid?

752
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,430
It's just,
you know,

753
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,920
I've met people that have their parents 
beat them and it's a fucking weird place

754
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:26,921
to be,
to talk to someone who is the person 

755
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:29,501
they love more than anything.
beats the shit out of them when they do 

756
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:29,810
something wrong,
you know?

757
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,070
And there's a difference between a 
weapon and beating.

758
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,230
Well,
this adrian,

759
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,450
this nfl thing,
the guy who beat his kid with a stick,

760
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,170
you know,
the excuses that I guess like when he 

761
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:44,420
was young,
that's how they treated him.

762
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,320
That's how he was raised.
Like,

763
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,050
I don't know what the kid did.
That was so horrible.

764
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:49,190
How old was this kid?
You know,

765
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,610
I man,
I don't even be reading into that really

766
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,100
young,
right?

767
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,870
Like nine or something like that.
Well,

768
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,830
whatever it was,
when you know,

769
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:57,830
when they talk about,
they say,

770
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,140
well this is the way he grew up,
which is true.

771
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,140
But man,
there's gotta be a way to end that 

772
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,391
cycle.
You can't be beaten in kids with sticks 

773
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:07,391
in 2014 and everybody should know that 
by now.

774
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,890
I just think it's a cop out for people 
to use that as an excuse.

775
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,130
We like those hall was raised even like 
just with anything,

776
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,690
you know,
because that's just a cop out.

777
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,960
That's just somebody not wanting to 
change and grow with the times.

778
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:22,961
I mean,
if we could find any way to be less 

779
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:22,961
violent,
we should try it.

780
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:22,961
Yeah,
certainly.

781
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:26,981
Anything with these victims involved,
especially if the victim is a little 

782
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:27,130
kid.
Yeah,

783
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,290
and by the way,
if you get kids used to the idea that 

784
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,880
the person they love the most,
their parents is a person who's going to

785
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,940
beat them and hit them with things.
You are introducing violence into that 

786
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,911
kid's life at a very early age and that 
violence becomes a natural part of the 

787
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,300
world,
becomes something they expect.

788
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,660
That's why they say that people who are 
around their parents beating each other 

789
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,460
up are more likely to be involved in the
abusive relationships.

790
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,270
When they get older,
they say that kids,

791
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,490
people who are hit by their parents or 
people watched their parents hate each 

792
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:01,980
other and were hit by their parents even
worse apparently.

793
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,730
It's awful.
Yeah.

794
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,580
I mean,
who's to say?

795
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,230
I mean,
my mom spanked us,

796
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:12,231
you know,
but she had three boys to deal with by 

797
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:12,420
herself.
Majority of the time,

798
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,280
you know,
it's not like,

799
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,270
you know,
I,

800
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,310
I don't,
I don't,

801
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,380
you know,
look at my mom is a villain and you 

802
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:21,380
know,
but she didn't beat us.

803
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,770
I can't say like I've been beaten by my 
mom did some,

804
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,290
some hoe ass shit,
you know,

805
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,880
my mom reprimanded me and I deserve it.
You know what,

806
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,350
you're doing some sucker shit as a kid,
you know,

807
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,470
especially before you do it,
you know,

808
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,060
and you know that there's a,
a consequence that comes with that.

809
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:41,061
But I've never experienced that.
You know what I'm pretty sure a lot of 

810
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:45,000
people are talking about right now,
but just like thinking it's okay to beat

811
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,820
up on your kids,
but like my daughter's four and a half,

812
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,200
I haven't had to reprimand her in that 
way and I never will.

813
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,830
You know what I'm saying?

814
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah,
I do.

815
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,080
I think it's a different situation too 
when you've got a single mom dealing 

816
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,690
with young sons like shit can get really
unruly.

817
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,810
That's what I'm saying.
It's like holy.

818
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,380
But even.
But even with that it,

819
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,360
they weren't beatings so it's like a 
difference.

820
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,950
That is a big difference and that's,
that's something that people don't like 

821
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:14,950
to admit.
Right.

822
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,700
It's never good to beat your kids,
but if you're a young woman who's 

823
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,770
raising young boys and they don't 
respect you.

824
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Shit,
I got a yard yardstick and my mom had a 

825
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,310
yard stick,
which you hit on my ass,

826
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,500
but it never hurt.
She would smack and I'm like,

827
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,100
oh,
okay.

828
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:36,510
I deserve that rating.
Not like stripped down naked.

829
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,610
Now after you're out the shower,
catch you off guard,

830
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,250
you know,
take the yard sake.

831
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,430
It's aluminum,
get on fire until it's fucking hot.

832
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,230
I saw video of these fucking idiots.
One kid put an iron,

833
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,170
a hot iron,
a little lost a bet kid lost a bet.

834
00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:00,410
So You put a hot iron on his back like 
after mark left the iron mark life too.

835
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,900
IT's not going to most likely fucking 
some brand college kids,

836
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:10,901
man,
kids and kids today that are trying to 

837
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:14,691
make videos of all this shit too.
It's like half the thing that they're 

838
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:15,260
making videos while they're doing this 
stupid shit.

839
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:20,261
It's the motivation.
It's like let's show people how fucking 

840
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:20,261
idiotic we could be.
Verbal scholar,

841
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:21,180
we're lucky.
More people aren't.

842
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:26,181
That seems like people are telling 
themselves accidentally left and right 

843
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:30,051
trying to make these fucking videos.
You see that video and I'm not sure if 

844
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,661
it's 100 percent real or not,
but the girl boils water and in films 

845
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:36,040
hurt take this huge thing of boiling 
water and pouring it over a dude's head

846
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
and he's like,
there's pictures of him just.

847
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,020
He's been in the hospital with all these
burns all over his body from yet

848
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,530
just from the als ice bucket of boiling 
wAter.

849
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,870
Yeah,
totally serious.

850
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,740
I'll find it for you.
Oh my god.

851
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:53,730
People are so stupid

852
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,200
that it's probably real.
I don't know if it's real,

853
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,150
but I bet it's probably real.
People are dumb as shit,

854
00:38:58,151 --> 00:38:59,860
man.
Fuck man.

855
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:02,980
That saddens me.
Fuck,

856
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,900
that's not cool.
Yeah.

857
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:09,901
You can overhear some conversations that
will make you lose your faith in 

858
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,880
humanity if you imagine if you were 
there in their goofy ass back yard,

859
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:13,780
but thinking about throwing boiling 
water on this kid,

860
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,940
you'd be like,
you know,

861
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,370
dad is gonna.
Fuck You up for the rest of your life.

862
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,970
You're going to be covered in scars,
but that might as well be lava.

863
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:23,530
You idiot.
That's again,

864
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,620
like your life has changed forever after
that.

865
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah,
I mean it's a very least is going to be 

866
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:31,920
some pretty significant scarring,
right?

867
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,980
Boiled in water,
the medical bills for that,

868
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,310
you know,
just the pain suffering just for one 

869
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,310
stupid ass video where people can think 
you're an idiot

870
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
tissue on your face for the rest of your
life because of.

871
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,450
Oh,

872
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:45,870
so were these kids uh,
like where they reprimanded and.

873
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,090
yeah,
it didn't really get into that part.

874
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,610
It just showed the video of the girl 
doing it,

875
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:54,510
boiling the water and I'm doing it on 
them and then make a news.

876
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,620
No,
I think it made the news because there 

877
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,771
was a,
there was a photo of him later where 

878
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:00,771
he's just sitting there all burnt,
like bandaged up.

879
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:00,860
His whole body's off

880
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,710
fucked up.
Fuck man.

881
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,510
What is this desire to make these 
fucking goofy videos?

882
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,730
It's horrible in bullying now.
Has taken it to the next level because 

883
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,120
kids are all filming them.
Bullying people and then putting it 

884
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
online.
So now it doesn't mean bowling.

885
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,650
Bowling,
bullying,

886
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,020
bullying,
bullying,

887
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,930
price,
bullying.

888
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,670
I'm like,
they're going bowling.

889
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,680
They're going to go away.
I thought that was like a new thing 

890
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:27,680
where you like to roll in a fetal 
position.

891
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Pins.
I was really trying to figure out what 

892
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:32,800
you were saying,

893
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,840
but yeah,
but people are taking videos of them 

894
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,821
beating up other kids and then putting 
it online and sharing it around the 

895
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:42,331
class and stuff.
So now you just see these videos of 

896
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:42,331
these poor kids.

897
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:46,170
Well,
how are these kids not getting in 

898
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,170
trouble?
I mean can't they are now,

899
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,170
but

900
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,370
the acts are already being done.
Yeah,

901
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,190
we live in a weird times.
Weird times took where we were talking 

902
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,130
about earlier about people worrying 
about your google glasses,

903
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:59,131
recording them because they're recording
everything and kids are growing up with 

904
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:03,061
that.
It's like a part of a normal part of 

905
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:03,061
life,
you know?

906
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,050
When you,
when you first got into the internet,

907
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,260
would you say you were in your late high
school days when you really started 

908
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,670
getting into it?
Because that was,

909
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,420
I mean you're 30 now.
No computer except at the schoolhouse.

910
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,460
So that was the only time and then you 
couldn't really explore that much.

911
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:22,900
You know,
it wasn't much out there because.

912
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,650
Well there was stuff out there but I 
mean the teachers kept it restricted.

913
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:31,710
You know,
there were some sites you can go to and 

914
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:31,710
you know,
you couldn't,

915
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,070
you couldn't watch porn and stuff back 
then.

916
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,300
It's a big bummer.
Do that.

917
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,340
They can block stuff now in schools.
Right?

918
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:39,980
Do they block stuff?
They have to man.

919
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:43,400
I mean the internet is just so much more
on there now than there was back then.

920
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,100
But do they allow like porn sites,
like in dorms,

921
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,290
can kids get download porn?
Well,

922
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,840
I mean there's,
I mean jamie,

923
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,470
suddenly you have to go to a site no 
more.

924
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,840
Well,
Yeah,

925
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:58,841
I mean you don't,
but you could always just download it 

926
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:01,661
right from like a torrent.
Well you can just google porn and it'll 

927
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:01,661
be right there.
Right?

928
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:02,300
That's true.
Yeah.

929
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,190
But I just wonder like bundles,
tips,

930
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:09,191
guys.
What's your favorite camera?

931
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,530
Do I Look in the one behind?
You know,

932
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,380
it's right.
There.

933
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,330
It is,
right?

934
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,830
You're a natural pitchman for the 
internet.

935
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,100
The internet's official spokesperson 
man.

936
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:26,450
They need to hit me up.
Let's go.

937
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,820
So,
you know,

938
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,830
getting out of high school and then 
growing up like essentially like young 

939
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,320
teens,
twenties,

940
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,620
all that like being able to like get 
online at school and then being 

941
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,060
completely immersed,
like being a part of like interactive 

942
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,460
communities,
talking to people.

943
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,950
That's one of the first generations of 
musicians that's able to do that.

944
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,630
It's able to go directly from high 
school into communicating online with 

945
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:59,330
people releasing stuff online and then,
you know,

946
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,420
becoming a part of this first generation
means a bunch now there's like a lot of 

947
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,381
artists that are becoming really well 
known because of just interacting with 

948
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:09,110
people online.
Not even,

949
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,940
not even any music,
just being online and you know,

950
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,250
whatever happened in an identity on,
on,

951
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,280
on the internet,
you know?

952
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,600
Yeah.
There's that too.

953
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:19,370
Right?
That's something that people value about

954
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:21,050
you as well.
It's not just that,

955
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,610
you know,
they like music,

956
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,250
they like you,
they like to talk to you.

957
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,650
You know what I'm saying?
Like you've got a cool personality.

958
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:31,550
Like you're a cool guy,
you're a cool guy on social media,

959
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:33,440
you know you're yourself.
Yeah.

960
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:35,180
No,
I think that's important though.

961
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:40,590
I think it is my job and my calling to 
also show the world a different type of 

962
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,180
person in the position that I'm in,
you know,

963
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,340
someone,
you know,

964
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:53,350
it doesn't,
it isn't really big into conforming 

965
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:57,650
because of my job because you know,
the people around me because of the 

966
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,080
people I work with,
you know,

967
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,380
I always tell people I'm a human being 
first before anything,

968
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,640
you know,
you're born naked,

969
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,440
you go in a really nice suit,
you know,

970
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,940
and,
and everything that happens in between,

971
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:08,370
it's just madness.
And we figured it out along the way.

972
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,150
But you know,
it's really interesting how a lot of 

973
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,150
people just kind of like,
you know,

974
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,700
get this,
this blessing,

975
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,730
this job,
getting this business and they just get 

976
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,760
really caught up and I never want to.
I never wanted to be that guy.

977
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,950
And the beauty of twitter,
it's like first I was really against it 

978
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,430
because it's just so much,
you know,

979
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:27,330
unfiltered anus.

980
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:32,330
And I've learned to appreciate it.
Like literally I get a of competence 

981
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:36,000
just by looking at my feet and seeing 
maybe a couple of tweets that are like,

982
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:41,001
yo man,
keep doing it and I'm not necessarily 

983
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:43,821
doing anything right now.
I doN't have any music coming out but 

984
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:44,910
it's just a random tuesday and there's 
some kid in Minnesota that's like,

985
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:46,350
yo,
I fucking love you dude.

986
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,380
Keep going.
we're listening and I might have needed 

987
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:51,380
to hear that that day,
you know?

988
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,380
so like those kids don't know that that 
means that much to me in the.

989
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,120
And it does.
So like I wasn't really that big.

990
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:58,440
We're talking,
you know,

991
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,820
and having such a presence online 
because I was weird about it or not.

992
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,230
I got a grip over it.
It's no problem for me.

993
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:05,520
I love that I can,
you know,

994
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,310
just hit up a kid randomly and just make
their whole year,

995
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,950
you know,
just some competence in something that's

996
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,060
using it for good,
you know,

997
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:17,210
rather than me posting a picture of some
jewelry or some new thousand dollar 

998
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,250
sneakers I bought it doesn't do anybody 
any good other than being like,

999
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,420
damn,
I ain't got shit.

1000
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,230
You know,
and that's the reality that people 

1001
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:27,230
realized and then it's like,
well,

1002
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,710
I need to do what I gotta do so I can 
have what he had and I don't want people

1003
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:29,940
to think like that,
you know,

1004
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,890
like when I post I like the posts,
like,

1005
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:37,370
you know,
maybe my lactaid milk or does this come 

1006
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:41,000
from like lessons that you've learned 
watching other people and,

1007
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,040
but like the,
their behavior and you felt like the 

1008
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,040
shortcomings of their behavior once they
became famous.

1009
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,700
Oh yeah man,
I'm watching everybody around me,

1010
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,660
you know,
and I think and I,

1011
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:54,030
and I and I kind of use,
I want kids to look at me and understand

1012
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,350
what not to do.
You know,

1013
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:58,140
when I was dealing with my drug issues 
back in 2010,

1014
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,470
2009,
you know,

1015
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,630
I was heavy into cocaine and it was like
a big thing for me to go and it was like

1016
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,150
a really big thing for me and it was 
something that kept me level.

1017
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,100
It's something that I felt like I needed
self-medicating.

1018
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,810
And uh,
you know,

1019
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,520
you felt like cocaine.
Keppra level.

1020
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,040
Yeah man,
because I had this whole technique,

1021
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,430
I don't know if I even should get into 
this.

1022
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:26,340
I don't even want to talk about this and
you don't have to go run around and talk

1023
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,500
to do it.
You know what?

1024
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:32,501
Let's just say I got into like,
you know what I would call like a 

1025
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:33,180
trifecta,
which was,

1026
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,620
you know,
I will wake up in the morning,

1027
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,010
I would know,
do coke immediately,

1028
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:43,011
even before I had cereal,
breakfast and then I would have a beer 

1029
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:47,420
and then I would smoke weed.
So like I never wanted people to know I 

1030
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,800
was doing cocaine,
so the beer and the marijuana leveled me

1031
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:53,450
out in a way where I was able to walk in
the streets and talk and,

1032
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,540
and seem as though I was not anything 
but deep inside I'm just like z with my 

1033
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,130
face and just like,
yeah,

1034
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,600
that's right.

1035
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,730
You know,
but what it did for me,

1036
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,980
it completely numb to me.
I didn't care about anything and I was a

1037
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:11,910
robot,
but also with it being so numb,

1038
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,310
it allowed me to go out and meet my fans
and beyond the street.

1039
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:20,311
So when a twisted way it did,
it did a positive thing for me and 

1040
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:21,060
that's why I didn't see it as an issue 
and I was like damn,

1041
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:26,150
today I went walking in soho with no 
place to go and I was just high fiving 

1042
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,011
fans and shit.
Like it was just the most amazing 

1043
00:47:31,011 --> 00:47:36,001
experience,
something that I never get a chance to 

1044
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:37,951
feel because I'm just like such a 
recluse and I'm just at that time was 

1045
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:39,730
just weirded out when people recognize 
me and just didn't want to go anywhere,

1046
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:40,720
you know?
Yeah.

1047
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:44,260
That's an issue with suBstances that can
help you in some ways,

1048
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:48,880
but they're ultimately detrimental to 
your health or wellbeing or your ability

1049
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:49,900
to keep it together.

1050
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,790
Yeah,
I mean I abused it,

1051
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:57,090
you know,
it's not like the guy who like goes out 

1052
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,090
with his buddies and spring break and it
says like,

1053
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,090
yeah,
let's do a pump.

1054
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,640
And it said,
hey,

1055
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,420
cooL.
You know,

1056
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,480
those guys aren't real people in movies.
Everybody else is just too broke to go.

1057
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,280
They just don't have the amount of money
that it requires to be a fucking 

1058
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,490
fulltime head.
It was definitely expensive,

1059
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:13,990
man.
It was definitely expensive.

1060
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,040
But you know,
I um,

1061
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,200
you find like why you're doing it every 
day.

1062
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,660
Like was there a thing that made you 
stop?

1063
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Because that's usually there's,
you got caught and then people started 

1064
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,200
to know I did it.
Yeah.

1065
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,240
And it was like,
damn,

1066
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,380
now everybody knows I do it.
It's not cool anymore.

1067
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,650
Like it's only cool when no one knows is
a weird one,

1068
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:33,310
right?
Yeah.

1069
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:38,200
It's like I didn't really let you know,
I didn't let the public made me feel bad

1070
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:38,700
about it though.

1071
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,810
It was just kinda like,
fuck yes,

1072
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,270
I can't do that no more.
But then also my daughter was born so it

1073
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:44,430
was like,
you know,

1074
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,190
it was,
it was like to kind of life lessons back

1075
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,730
to back that I experienced in 2010 and 
you know,

1076
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,970
my daughter's birth and being arrested 
were those two things because I think I 

1077
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,190
had already started toning down on my 
cocaine use the beginning of that year.

1078
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,400
But then I was the king of like 
something tragic happened at or 

1079
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,300
something I felt was tragical stressful 
and then spiraling back into it.

1080
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:12,301
Just needing any excuse to be all right,
I'm going to go do cocaine now because 

1081
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:12,580
I'm set and I'm dealing with something 
and I don't know how to deal.

1082
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,790
Just like my way of copping out and 
avoiding my issues.

1083
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,510
Wow.
You know.

1084
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:18,970
So it was like a block.
It was like maybe a couple months ago by

1085
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,950
I'd be in Hawaii,
you know,

1086
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:25,951
working on some stuff with kanye and I 
never did cocaine or anything around 

1087
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:25,951
those guys.

1088
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:29,820
I was like my time to detox when I will 
be away because you're not if you do 

1089
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,620
coke,
coke with other people or alone.

1090
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,650
And I felt weird about traveling the 
world and every place I was at asking 

1091
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,640
people where the drugs was at.
So like it was something that I did,

1092
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,350
you know,
at home,

1093
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,930
at a certain time,
you know,

1094
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:43,900
and which was,
you know,

1095
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,080
I was able to kind of keep it together 
and go out and work on my music and be 

1096
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,350
into it.
I had a system,

1097
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:53,260
it was a weird six system I developed 
for myself,

1098
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:53,980
you know,
we're,

1099
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,980
you know,
I was able to be cool if I wasn't in New

1100
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,980
York,
but then when I was back in New York it 

1101
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:01,980
was on,
you know,

1102
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,100
because it was just like being at home 
in the apartment alone for hours on end.

1103
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,200
Just really just got me,
you know,

1104
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,170
and doing it just kinda like,
oh man,

1105
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,800
I could just put on leaky lee and just 
chill out for hours by myself.

1106
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,800
And it's all good.
It's interesting that the arrest made 

1107
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,320
you want to stop because you really was 
it because like the feeling like,

1108
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,360
oh shit,
have an event has taken place.

1109
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,530
Like this is obviously a big sign that 
I'm going down the wrong direction.

1110
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,650
I'm in,
I'm dealing with the legal system now 

1111
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:31,970
we're getting arrested and I was.
It was just more like,

1112
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,990
did.
This is not scott [inaudible].

1113
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,210
How in the hell did I let this become 
scott mess?

1114
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:46,850
HoW in the fuck do I got people looking 
at me like I'm not scott mescaline and I

1115
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:50,420
know what it was and I know how to fix 
that.

1116
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,070
And I went and I just,
It was just,

1117
00:50:53,071 --> 00:50:55,340
I didn't like how people were looking at
me at that moment in time.

1118
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:57,110
So they're looking at you like you're a 
coke fiend.

1119
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,450
Yeah.
Crazy cracked out dude.

1120
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,940
Like everywhere I would go it was just 
these looks and I was just like,

1121
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:03,380
man,
I just did a little blow

1122
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:11,650
y'all motherfuckers acting like y'all 
ain't never did a bump get outta here

1123
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,610
man.
Like it was.

1124
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,320
So I was like,
are you kidding me?

1125
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,420
People love to be sanctimonious.
Yeah.

1126
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,040
Yeah.
But,

1127
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,000
but that's the thing.
When it happened,

1128
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,070
I wasn't like,
you know,

1129
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,540
on,
you know,

1130
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,690
the next complex interview I did,
like I have a statement that I use this 

1131
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:32,881
camera.
I'm really sOrry to all my fans for you 

1132
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,970
guys knowing how I do cocaine now,
where I used to,

1133
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,260
I don't do it anymore.
Uh,

1134
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,660
I'm sorry if I let anyone down.
Fuck that.

1135
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,690
Fuck that.
It was really just like I'm dealing with

1136
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:42,970
some shit if you don't understand it.
I don't give a fuck.

1137
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:45,700
This is how I was surviving.
If I didn't do it,

1138
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:47,200
I would have blew my brains out.
Well,

1139
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:52,201
I like how you describe it to because 
you're very honest about the positive 

1140
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:53,110
aspects of the effects and I think 
that's super important.

1141
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:56,350
And this was my contract by the way.
This release.

1142
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,690
Sorry.
Don't worry about it.

1143
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,620
everything's a proper method.
You're very muffled.

1144
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,830
You're very honest about the positive 
benefits of it.

1145
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,860
Like people have this idea like you 
shouldn't talk about positive benefits 

1146
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,361
of any drugs,
whether it's harmless drugs like 

1147
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:17,430
marijuana or dangerous drugs like 
cocaine.

1148
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:22,170
He maybe even especially dangerous drugs
like cocaine because the reality of what

1149
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:25,650
you're saying,
your experience and the positive aspects

1150
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:30,651
of your experience,
it's like he's promoting drugs when 

1151
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,700
clearly you're doing just the opposite.
You're talking about how you needed them

1152
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:37,701
and use them and they helped you,
but the reality is it was because you 

1153
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,260
were dealing with an issue and it just 
helps mask the issue,

1154
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:45,290
but it did help him to lie and deny that
it clouds the issue for people dealing 

1155
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:50,931
with their own drug issues,
dealing with their current drug issues 

1156
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:52,200
or their past drug issues.
People aren't honest about it,

1157
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:54,240
man.
It puts people in this weird place where

1158
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:54,780
you don't mind.

1159
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,780
If I wasn't for fucking meth,
I would have never started this 

1160
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,151
business.
The reason why I'm doing so well is 

1161
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:02,151
because I got on like,
I mean,

1162
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:05,400
there's some people that can say that.
Probably the only reason why I could sit

1163
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:09,840
here and say that is because like,
I've been four years clean man.

1164
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:14,841
I'm not like running and I can speak 
about it candidly and it's not something

1165
00:53:15,271 --> 00:53:16,640
I'm weird about.
And uh,

1166
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:21,830
I've just grown so much since then.
And I also know that the more I talk 

1167
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,940
about it,
you know,

1168
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,830
the more it'll help somebody else who be
dealing with it.

1169
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:26,760
You know what I mean?
Definitely.

1170
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,980
You know,
when you're in that,

1171
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:33,981
it's probably just,
it seems like you can't get out of it 

1172
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,200
because it is like a thing,
you know what I mean,

1173
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:37,680
and cycle and you get caught up in it.

1174
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,360
And um,
you know,

1175
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,440
I just know is with kids listening to me
talk now,

1176
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:45,150
it's,
it could be helping a lot of people.

1177
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:48,930
I'm not like one of those people now 
that used to do cocaine and I'm like,

1178
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,120
oh,
you're bad if you do cocaine or cocaine.

1179
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:56,170
Spanish didn't do cocaine mean I don't 
promote any drug but I'm not judging 

1180
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:59,550
anybody if they do it,
but know it's not like a big deal.

1181
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:04,551
Like I did it and I just abused it in a 
way and it didn't benefit me.

1182
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:07,890
It didn't benefit scott.
I didn't like the person I was becoming.

1183
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,160
There's some people that could do this 
shit and they can live and do it in 

1184
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,160
moderation and it doesn't affect their 
lives.

1185
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,820
Like how it affected mine.
More power to them.

1186
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:18,510
They got super powers if you asked me,
but I just have that,

1187
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,510
you know,
it's a history of drugs in my family.

1188
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,480
It was like my blood was waiting,
I was like,

1189
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:25,240
yeah,
like,

1190
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,430
let's go and I know that about myself 
and I just had to make that choice.

1191
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,710
I had to make a choice and I think 
that's with anything,

1192
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:34,080
cigarettes and you know,
four months,

1193
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,540
five months done with now,
um,

1194
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,100
you know,
you just have to make a choice.

1195
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,880
And I made that choice for myself,
for my own health,

1196
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,560
my daughter for a future,
for my fans,

1197
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:44,500
you know?
Yeah.

1198
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:49,510
A bunch of people quit cigarettes.
[inaudible] the anthony bourdain quit 

1199
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,190
cigarettes because his daughter to just 
realize like,

1200
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,420
what am I doing?
Yeah.

1201
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,860
I mean,
for me,

1202
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:53,470
Like my,
my,

1203
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:58,770
my father passed away from cancer.
All my uncles passed away from cancer 

1204
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,880
and my father died when I was 11,
you know.

1205
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,910
So that was an experience for me,
uh,

1206
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,700
that kinda like traumatized me in such a
way.

1207
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,170
But I can't,
you know,

1208
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,970
when I got older I started to,
you know,

1209
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,310
do everything that my father was into.
Like my dad smoked newports.

1210
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,230
I started smoking newports 17,
you know,

1211
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,490
my dad's,
you know,

1212
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:19,050
he,
he loved mgd.

1213
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:22,170
Miller genuine draft.
I fucking drank mgd millage and draft,

1214
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,110
you know,
it was a tribute to him.

1215
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,170
No,
I just kinda was becoming my dad in a 

1216
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:29,170
weird way.
And,

1217
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:29,170
and you know,
it wasn't,

1218
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:34,630
you know,
it was like one of those things you 

1219
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:34,630
don't.
I don't know,

1220
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,241
I just kinda,
I never really had a relationship with 

1221
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:40,581
him,
so the only memories I have was just 

1222
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:40,581
this guy,
like,

1223
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:42,030
you know,
like this guy was just so cool.

1224
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:47,031
He had a cigarette and he had his beard 
and he was always awesome and he was 

1225
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:47,670
there for me as a man and up until you 
left,

1226
00:55:47,671 --> 00:55:48,660
you know,
uh,

1227
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,040
and I think I kind of got caught up in 
that and that's something that like,

1228
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,500
you know,
I can't say the image of my father 

1229
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:57,500
drinking and smoking is what made me 
drink and smoke,

1230
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:57,660
but I can't say it didn't.

1231
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,320
Right.
Do you think you took like comfort in 

1232
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:03,320
it?
Maybe like,

1233
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:03,320
I think maybe,
yeah,

1234
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,211
for sure.
I think everybody takes comfort and 

1235
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:08,211
smoking cigarettes.
It's like one of those things.

1236
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:12,490
Yeah.
That's the grand trick that cigarettes 

1237
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,591
pull on you.
Did they give you comfort in that need 

1238
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:18,801
to replenish?
Like you give you a little stimulant 

1239
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:21,770
from the nicotine and all the chemicals 
that are in the cigarette and then 

1240
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,800
you're so addicted to it that you have 
this weird when you don't have it and 

1241
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,551
then when you smoke it relieves that 
stress and you think that it's actually 

1242
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:34,171
calming you down.
But all it's doing is feeding the 

1243
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:34,171
dragon.
It's like a drug.

1244
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:34,171
it's anything.
Oh,

1245
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:38,760
it's a drug.
Nicotine is one of the craziest drugs 

1246
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,360
all time because there's legalist book 
and you could just get it anywhere.

1247
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,830
Like they presented in such a way where 
it's all cool but you know,

1248
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:45,910
and,
and that's another thing too.

1249
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:50,910
I don't come to my aunties.
Smokers either like friends come of my 

1250
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:51,280
house,
they smoke,

1251
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:56,281
I don't shush them outside.
And you know like you can smoke in the 

1252
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:56,281
house.
It's not that really.

1253
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:57,400
You don't mind people stinking up your 
house.

1254
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:01,870
There's on cigarettes bother me.
I smoked for a long time and you know,

1255
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,420
it's not like I got people chain smoking
in the house.

1256
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,530
Somebody needs a cigarette,
one or two school.

1257
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,390
I have friends that used to smoke and if
they smell it,

1258
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,380
they get sick and I'm cool with.
I'm cool with it.

1259
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I just,
it's more just like for people that 

1260
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,651
can't stand,
that there's people that might still 

1261
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:23,170
have an issue with the addiction,
but if I smell it or anything like that,

1262
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:23,980
it's kind of just saying,
oh,

1263
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,050
it's not for me.
It doesn't really bother me.

1264
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,480
You don't have a poll that doesn't pull 
you towards it.

1265
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,760
You don't want to smoke it again.
I mean I get,

1266
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:36,300
I can't say like occasionally,
and this is something that just will 

1267
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,110
forever happened because I was addicted 
to the shit,

1268
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,200
but like I can't say like after a meal,
a really good meal,

1269
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:41,950
I'm like,
oh man,

1270
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:44,410
a cigarette would be nice,
but I don't do that no more.

1271
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,730
So that's that.
And then I said,

1272
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,170
wow,
good for you.

1273
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:49,420
You know what I mean?
But I got hypnotized.

1274
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:52,360
So hypnotists.
Yeah.

1275
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:57,361
Yeah.
And do you remember them advertising 

1276
00:57:57,361 --> 00:57:57,361
you?
Yeah.

1277
00:57:57,361 --> 00:57:57,460
Yeah,
I remember because you have to,

1278
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,650
you have to receive the information,
you know,

1279
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,720
that he's telling you,
you have to really process what he's 

1280
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,530
saying because it's really a reeducation
of the dangers of,

1281
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:11,030
you know,
it's kinda like what we learned in 

1282
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,030
health class when we were in school as 
kids,

1283
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,500
you know,
it's no different except,

1284
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,710
you know,
over time the fear is not,

1285
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,360
you know,
as heightened as it was when we were 

1286
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:20,360
fourth graders sitting in the room.
But our teachers saying like,

1287
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,510
oh it does,
your lungs are nice and pink like this.

1288
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,540
Oh,
and if you smoke they're black like 

1289
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:27,540
this.

1290
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,290
It's not over time we see pop culture,
we see the james deans,

1291
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:35,560
we see everything going on and then it 
doesn't seem as dangerous.

1292
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:41,050
And,
and basically this guy reminds you of 

1293
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:41,380
the dangerous and kind of reboot you.
And it's like psycho shit.

1294
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:46,640
It is kind of.
And as an adult you take it a little 

1295
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,661
bit.
It's really funny just how the cycle of 

1296
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:48,661
life goes.
It's like,

1297
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:52,530
at my age,
I guess I was able to look at it in the 

1298
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:52,530
same way I saw it as a fourth grader,
you know,

1299
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,620
and just kind of realized,
oh,

1300
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:54,750
this is,
this is hurting me.

1301
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:59,860
Talked me through it.
They lie down on the couch and close 

1302
00:58:59,860 --> 00:58:59,860
your eyes.
They turn the lights down.

1303
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,640
Well,
I had him come to my crib,

1304
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:05,670
you know,
because I'm wanting to feel comfortable 

1305
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,670
and I had a knife there.
So if you tried any funny moments,

1306
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,860
but I'm just going to let you know,
touching me,

1307
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,830
I didn't know what was happening.
I had,

1308
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,890
I had to shake my pillow in case there's
a comedian that,

1309
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,420
a comedy store,
no bullshit.

1310
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,010
There was a comedian and used to go to 
the comedy that used to hypnotize

1311
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,880
women is.
His thing was that he was a comedian,

1312
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:30,881
but he also did some hypnotist work and 
like he would always hypnotized girls.

1313
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:36,490
And like I remember very clearly one 
time I was walking to the back of the 

1314
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:40,571
comedy store and he was talking to a 
girl and she just pulled her head away 

1315
00:59:40,571 --> 00:59:40,571
and she goes,
no,

1316
00:59:40,571 --> 00:59:40,940
I don't want you to hypnotize me.

1317
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,540
And I was like,
wow,

1318
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:46,120
it's true.
That is out there hypnotizing people.

1319
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,100
That's fucked up man.
So cool.

1320
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,080
When they do do it in your bed?
No,

1321
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,390
we were in the living room on the couch 
and you kinda just sits there and he

1322
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,620
don't sleep on your back.
Okay.

1323
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,940
So you fully stretched out pillow behind
her head.

1324
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,280
Just relaxing.
And then when they count you down,

1325
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,270
what does it feel like?

1326
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:10,830
It feel like you're tired as hell.
Like slipping into like,

1327
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,740
you know,
a dream system really relaxed.

1328
01:00:17,741 --> 01:00:19,090
You just really relaxed.
It's like.

1329
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,700
Had you been touch before this?
No.

1330
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,240
First time.
First time.

1331
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,210
Only time.
Only wants us at three times.

1332
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,040
Three times three and three separate 
sessions.

1333
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:32,250
Does their weeks apart,
does it feel different each time you do 

1334
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:32,250
it?
Or does it feel the same?

1335
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,040
No,
after the first time it's like he does 

1336
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,721
his thing.
It's like after the first one it's like 

1337
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:39,721
you don't,
um,

1338
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:40,120
uh,
you can smoke between.

1339
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,490
So it's like we did ours from tuesday to
tuesday,

1340
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:47,491
so they came that tuesday,
that whole week I was allowed to smoke 

1341
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:51,691
right after the first session,
after the first therapy session and the 

1342
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:55,681
hipaa hypnosis.
Then after that second week you're done 

1343
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:59,341
completely.
Then after that third week it's like 

1344
01:00:59,341 --> 01:00:59,590
kinda like reestablishing that.

1345
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:03,340
It's done and that's the final one.
But after that first one,

1346
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:04,390
it's like the final week.
Right.

1347
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:08,200
So to come out of that hypnosis instill,
you know,

1348
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,320
him telling me like I can still smoke.
I still had this urge to like,

1349
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,470
I don't know if I want to do that,
you know,

1350
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,050
like I was allowed to smoke.
He said it was cool.

1351
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,400
I remember like my first cigarette after
like the hypnosis,

1352
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,840
I waited like a couple of hours,
like I had the,

1353
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:30,930
I had the,
that urge but I wasn't so quick to jump 

1354
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,080
into it.
Why did he say he could smoke?

1355
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:33,500
What's the logic behind it?
You ask him?

1356
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,210
Just kinda like took to,
I don't know,

1357
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:41,410
to give it a minute to give you that 
last week too,

1358
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:44,050
just know that this going to be up after
because he tells you like,

1359
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:49,051
all right,
so just this last week you could smoke 

1360
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:49,051
and then after that second session 
you're done.

1361
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:53,530
So when you're going under and he's,
he's telling you I'm going to count you 

1362
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,230
down and then boom,
you're under.

1363
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:56,150
Do you remember the first things he said
to you?

1364
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,550
Like do you,
were you conscious of it?

1365
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,580
Yeah,
yeah.

1366
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,950
He's just basically,
you know,

1367
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,750
just talking about,
you know,

1368
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:09,230
the dangers of cancer and what it could 
do to you and how it's just nasty and 

1369
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:14,631
it's Poison and just everything you 
could imagine that we'll kind of put it 

1370
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:17,520
in a way for a human being.
Understand and get it like,

1371
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:19,470
okay,
this is dangerous because that's what it

1372
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:23,330
is.
I think the average person that smokes a

1373
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,330
doesn't see the danger in it like that 
because you might see,

1374
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:27,930
you know,
the,

1375
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:33,470
the old lady that's 80,
90 years old that's been smoking on her 

1376
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:33,470
days,
it looks like she's fine,

1377
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:33,990
you know.
And he'd just be like,

1378
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:38,991
well,
I'll probably be that lady or I'll 

1379
01:02:38,991 --> 01:02:39,150
probably be that guy or you know,
but the reality is you don't know,

1380
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,670
you know,
and it's like a gamble every time.

1381
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:45,030
and it's like literally I'm him just 
kinda,

1382
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:46,650
he'll give me scenarios too.

1383
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,130
And I don't even know how much I could 
reallY talk about because he,

1384
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,830
he sells this,
this is like a thing,

1385
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,720
you know,
you just really gives you examples,

1386
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:56,370
you know,
just like scenarios,

1387
01:02:56,371 --> 01:03:00,670
like simple example,
like if you knew someone was uh,

1388
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:05,810
you know,
if you were dating a girl and you knew 

1389
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:05,810
that,
you know,

1390
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,330
she was known for poisoning her 
boyfriend's putting poison,

1391
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,350
uh,
rat poison in her food,

1392
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:15,351
but there wasn't real approved.
But every guy she did it kind of got 

1393
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:15,351
murdered.
But hey,

1394
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,350
you know,
we're dAting her for awhile.

1395
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:19,650
And she said no,
she wanted to finally cook for,

1396
01:03:19,651 --> 01:03:22,870
you know,
you know,

1397
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:23,820
like,
what would you do,

1398
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,100
you know what I mean?
Like would you,

1399
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,620
if you knew for a fact that she was a 
killer,

1400
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,800
would you let her cook your food?
Would you let this person into your 

1401
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:33,800
house?

1402
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,620
No,
you would say I'm not fucking with the 

1403
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:36,620
chicken.
I mean guys stopped messing with a chick

1404
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,680
if she calls too many times,
like you know,

1405
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,230
like it's just kind of the reality of 
like,

1406
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:45,231
man.
Well anytime you've seen any obsessive 

1407
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:45,231
behavior,
anything dangerous people,

1408
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:47,010
but it's kind of just that reality,
like it's poison.

1409
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,010
It's going out your way to buy poisoned 
to put in your system.

1410
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,750
So you felt much more in touch with the 
reality of what it is.

1411
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1412
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:56,670
And so,
you know,

1413
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:01,671
I just,
I've seen there's been curious about 

1414
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:01,671
like what the state is like of being 
hypnotized.

1415
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,540
You don't feel,
you don't feel disconnected?

1416
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,680
No,
I felt like I was,

1417
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:09,681
I could have woke up at any minute.
I felt like if somebody or if you try 

1418
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:09,830
something,
I could have smacked the shit.

1419
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:14,831
Ain'T really worried about him trying to
y'all because just like you just like,

1420
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,790
you know what I'm saying,
if you've never done it hypnosis and you

1421
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:22,791
see in the movies,
it just seemed like you kinda like 

1422
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:22,791
vulnerable and,
and,

1423
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:22,791
and,
you know,

1424
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:27,201
I just,
I didn't know what extent that would 

1425
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:27,201
feel like,
you know,

1426
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:27,540
I didn't want to be like,
I know what you're saying.

1427
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,100
You know what I mean?
So did he ever.

1428
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:32,130
Have you ever seen like one of those 
comedy hypnotist shows?

1429
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:37,790
No.
You should go and check bark like a dog 

1430
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:38,310
or whatever.
Yeah.

1431
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:43,370
Yeah.
It's just one guy that does it 

1432
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:43,370
particularly.
Right?

1433
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:43,370
It's,
he's known for it.

1434
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:47,240
Well,
there's a bunch of people all over the 

1435
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:47,240
country to do it.
Oh,

1436
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:47,240
okay.
This is like a thing.

1437
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:47,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1438
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:47,910
It's a thing,
man.

1439
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:50,460
I've seen her.
When I was starting out in boston,

1440
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:52,530
there was this comedy club called 
stitches and uh,

1441
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:57,570
they had a guy named Frank Santos.
She did it there all the time and I 

1442
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,130
thought it was bullshit at first and 
then from being there all the time,

1443
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:00,840
I got to see all these shows.
I realized like,

1444
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:01,320
whoa,
no,

1445
01:05:01,321 --> 01:05:03,510
you can just hypnotize some people.
Oh yeah.

1446
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,820
And you get some dudes to come in their 
own pants.

1447
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,660
They would think they were having sex,
they would take care of sex on stage and

1448
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:14,661
they will be on the ground like humping.
And he would tell them when they were 

1449
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:15,150
gonna come and they would come and 
they'd be embarrassed and then they'd go

1450
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:16,200
and sit down.
Yeah,

1451
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:21,270
I'd be embarrassed.
It's like somebody with a ghost hand 

1452
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,451
coming.
They're jerking you off when you're not 

1453
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:24,451
noticing it.
It was so cool.

1454
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,430
Some people apparently are super 
susceptible to it,

1455
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:31,220
but he knew he knew when people were 
under and when they weren't under.

1456
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:33,850
That's why I was.
I'm always confused.

1457
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,380
Like you.
So you,

1458
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,440
you were coNscious but you were under.
Yeah,

1459
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:41,920
like he'll do things like um,
once you say yes,

1460
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,420
you know,
so he'll,

1461
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,150
he'll know to check and make sure that 
you're under or whatever.

1462
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:50,230
There's certaIn things that he'll,
he'll do like and I'm paying for it.

1463
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:51,040
So it's not like,
you know,

1464
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:53,920
I'm my lying right now.
It is under though.

1465
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:56,410
That's what's confusing to me.
What is that state,

1466
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,590
I guess between dreaming and awake?
I mean I'm definitely like the 

1467
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,200
understate is more just like a relaxed 
feeling.

1468
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:09,010
Not like sleep,
right?

1469
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,540
But it can be.
It can be,

1470
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:17,550
you know,
you could feel I could sleep because 

1471
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,520
you're breathing slower and that's what 
sleep is like,

1472
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:19,780
you know,
you're relaxed.

1473
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:23,080
And to us that's what sleep feels like.
Not that relaxed state,

1474
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:26,140
but your conscious conscious.
I hear him crystal clear.

1475
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,850
I'm not in deep sleep,
you know,

1476
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,500
it feels like it,
but I'm,

1477
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:33,880
I'm not.
I'm hearing everything clearly.

1478
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,420
I'm understanding him.
You know,

1479
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:39,580
a saw.
I'm not snoring here.

1480
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:42,790
It's not like it's not weird you feel 
president,

1481
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,100
but then you just are really,
really chill.

1482
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,350
So it's just basically like some weird 
middle state.

1483
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:52,410
yeah.
It's the in between of some shit that 

1484
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:52,410
happens that motherfuckers know how to 
do.

1485
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:55,990
like I've never experienced anything 
like it.

1486
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,890
What's the difference between one 
session one and session two,

1487
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:05,160
session three m,
I can't be the difference between 

1488
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:11,130
session one and session two.
I can say I can't really differentiate 

1489
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,510
between session two and tHree.
Are you allowed to smoke out?

1490
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,710
You're allowed to smoke after one or 
you'll have a smoke after two,

1491
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,660
after two,
you're done after two.

1492
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:19,800
You don't want to really.
I think that's when he actually like,

1493
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,870
I think too,
the difference between the first stage 

1494
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,870
and second stage,
the first stage,

1495
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:28,661
she doesn't really instill anything.
Like when you wake up from this you're 

1496
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:28,870
not going to be smoking cigarettes 
anymore.

1497
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,930
Like he doesn't say anything like that.
He's just educate you.

1498
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:32,400
And then it's like,
no,

1499
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:33,880
you're going to come back,
you know,

1500
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:36,430
and I'm gonna call you out from from 10 
all the way up to one,

1501
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:37,930
you know,
and count you up and cut you up.

1502
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,810
But he doesn't say,
he says like,

1503
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,970
you can smoke this week,
you know,

1504
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,870
and,
but after this you're going to be done.

1505
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,980
You know?
so like you come out of that first state

1506
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:48,880
just kinda like,
okay.

1507
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,950
But like I said,
I was hesitant to smoke.

1508
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:54,380
I really wanted to smoke.
But would it be something that,

1509
01:07:54,381 --> 01:07:58,570
that was something that stuck still in 
that first session that made me like,

1510
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,720
oh man,
is it is kind of gross,

1511
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,850
you know,
success rate.

1512
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,090
Did he say iT literally?
I mean,

1513
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,310
he says everybody does it,
but I know,

1514
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:14,830
you know,
I'm pretty sure a lot of people have a 

1515
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:14,830
hard time with it,
you know,

1516
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:15,800
it's not,
it's just you really in,

1517
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:19,090
this is what he says and anybody that I 
know that it's done it too.

1518
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,920
It's really just kind of like,
you have to be ready,

1519
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,600
you know,
in a weird way.

1520
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,600
You just got to be ready.
And I think that's with anything in 

1521
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,511
life.
I mean they tried to make it like this 

1522
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:32,511
thing,
like you've just got to be ready,

1523
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:32,511
but like anything,
marriage,

1524
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:34,490
you know,
even just dating someone or whether it's

1525
01:08:34,491 --> 01:08:39,491
a job,
you just got to make that choice and 

1526
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:39,650
just really want it for yourself to 
really commit,

1527
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:42,050
you know,
in and out.

1528
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,530
Really it costs money to like you spend,
you're paying this money.

1529
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:48,170
I mean,
it's like a waste of time,

1530
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,340
you know,
otherwise,

1531
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:54,341
you know,
and he's the type of person where even 

1532
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:54,341
though he's getting paid,
he's,

1533
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:56,370
he cares to do this passionate.
He devoted his whole life to this.

1534
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:57,540
This guy,
um,

1535
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,800
carrie gainer.
Uhm,

1536
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:02,720
I'm gonna give you his contact so you 
can,

1537
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:06,820
he has a twitter page and stuff and he 
does this whole thing where it was going

1538
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:08,420
to get bombed with dick pics right now.

1539
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,760
Coming in hot,
coming in hot bro.

1540
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:14,920
Just,
let's just say his name.

1541
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,270
It worked on my sister.
give his twitter page out.

1542
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,900
They'll get,
they'll get them hypnosis.

1543
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,200
Like my,
my sister got hypnotized and it worked 

1544
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:24,200
for,
for about a year.

1545
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,411
And then she said one day she just woke 
up and it was gone and she just started 

1546
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:28,411
smoking.
Carrie gainer?

1547
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,320
Yeah.
Wow.

1548
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,570
That's um,
what,

1549
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,130
what is this twitter.
You want to give it out?

1550
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,440
Oh yeah,
sure if you want.

1551
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:35,310
Yeah.
So find it,

1552
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,940
cause he's,
he's a dope dude man.

1553
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:39,640
He's the nicest guy.
He totally.

1554
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:40,930
As soon as I saw him,
I,

1555
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:43,360
I knew I wasn't going to have to shank 
them,

1556
01:09:43,361 --> 01:09:46,360
but you never know.
You never know joe rogan.

1557
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:48,910
I mean not everybody has the data that 
you have dude,

1558
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:50,470
where people just like not going to try 
it.

1559
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:55,250
They'll still try a session.
One involve chlorophyll.

1560
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:00,300
Tough for the squeeze.
The sweeter the juice is twitter is 

1561
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:07,291
carrie gainer a k e r r y g a y n o r 
carries one of those weird words that 

1562
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,490
dudes are still allowed to have,
you know,

1563
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,780
but it's a weird one.
He has a twitter for,

1564
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,430
for his,
his name,

1565
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:18,700
for his business name and a dude,
k e r r y.

1566
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,260
I mean,
it is,

1567
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,060
you can get away with it,
but it's strange.

1568
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:24,100
I think it's an irish thing though too.
Is it?

1569
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:29,370
Okay.
It could be that or it could be a 

1570
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:29,370
dominant wife.
Wishes she had a girl.

1571
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:34,650
Well,
I promised a promise you that it is not 

1572
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:37,441
what's going on.
He had a girlfriend in high school and 

1573
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:37,441
uh,
her,

1574
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,660
her mom had a boys name because the dad 
wanted a boy.

1575
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:45,250
So he named her a boy's name.
It was the craziest situation.

1576
01:10:45,251 --> 01:10:48,070
I've known people that have had that.
Yeah,

1577
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,660
for sure.
Those ugly though,

1578
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:50,560
because,
you know,

1579
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:55,590
she didn't get along with her parents,
like her mom did not get along with her 

1580
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:55,590
parents.
And uh,

1581
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,380
she always resented that her dad gave 
her a boy's name.

1582
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,720
That's creepy.
But you can just change it.

1583
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,100
Yeah.
But it was,

1584
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,990
it was like a love Missing thing.

1585
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,000
What was the name wasn't I want to say,
come on.

1586
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:12,410
I don't want to say let's make it mike,
but that's not as fast because girls,

1587
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:15,380
I didn't want to go named michael.
Now it's,

1588
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,330
it's my girlfriend,
my girlfriend from high school,

1589
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:19,260
his mom.
So I don't think,

1590
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,440
you know,
understood.

1591
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,980
Understood.
But uh,

1592
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:28,050
she's a nice lady.
But you could tell she wasn't really 

1593
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:28,410
into people.
Especially men.

1594
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,510
Yeah.
So it's the same name.

1595
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:36,730
Men with the same name.
She had this strange boyfriend for 

1596
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,441
awhile.
It's very weird wHen you see like how 

1597
01:11:39,441 --> 01:11:39,720
other people grow up and you see like,
oh,

1598
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:44,721
that's where that comes from.
like you get some weird thing about men 

1599
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:44,721
and then you go,
okay,

1600
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:45,480
let me see what's going on in your 
house.

1601
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,940
Oh,
let me see what's going on.

1602
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:53,020
A mom has a boy's name and this is her 
boyfriend and he's a mess.

1603
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,540
Okay.
Yeah,

1604
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,850
I see how it'd be weird about dudes.
It's science.

1605
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:01,851
It's not your fault.
It's like do it science in your own 

1606
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:02,710
house.
That's fucked up,

1607
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,220
man.
You know,

1608
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:08,240
that's the one thing when it,
when everybody judges people and 

1609
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,641
everybody does love to judge people.
The reality is not everybody starts off 

1610
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,680
in the same spot.
You know,

1611
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,350
some people get a shit spot in life,
you know?

1612
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,160
and then some people I think a bad spot 
or an an,

1613
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,290
an imperfect spot a lot of times 
motivates them.

1614
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,290
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1615
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:24,780
like that happened with you.
Oh,

1616
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:25,950
most definitely.
Yeah.

1617
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:29,780
And I think about it like I,
and that's what a lot of my,

1618
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,810
my,
my issue came through you,

1619
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:37,820
you know,
early on in my career I had this moment 

1620
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:41,181
where literally I had like security and 
a car service everywhere I went and I 

1621
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:45,630
just started to feel like richie fucking
rich.

1622
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,030
IT was just,
I was like,

1623
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:50,310
I got to chaperone.
It's like my mom has this person with me

1624
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:55,311
every where I go to make sure I don't 
get in trouble and then like she feeds 

1625
01:12:55,311 --> 01:12:57,960
my bank account as long as I'm good.
Like it just felt really weird,

1626
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,760
you know?
And uh,

1627
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:04,910
anyone coke he started to get on because
it was because,

1628
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:07,320
you know,
I came from a natural thing,

1629
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:08,580
you know what I'm saying?
It was kinda like,

1630
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:12,570
it was hard for me to like the way of 
life was just a different transition,

1631
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:13,290
you know?
Yeah.

1632
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:18,530
I would imagine that's got to be a,
that's a big leap to come from nothing 

1633
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:22,400
and then become a famous entertainers.
Wealthy is a very treacherous and 

1634
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,370
difficult path to,
to manage,

1635
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:26,910
I would imagine.
I think most people's motivation is to,

1636
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:31,940
you know,
and I can't say I didn't fall victim to 

1637
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:31,940
it was just kind of prove people wrong 
in a way.

1638
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,560
Oh yeah.
And that was a,

1639
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,120
I mean,
it wasn't anger that fueled me though.

1640
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,530
It was just more like,
okay,

1641
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:38,910
I'll show you.
Well,

1642
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:41,760
it's your own desire to determine 
self-worth.

1643
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:42,660
Right,
right.

1644
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:44,890
So it didn't,
it wasn't misguided.

1645
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,590
It was always just like,
okay,

1646
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:52,040
I'm doubted the odds are against me,
but I know what I'm feeling and this is 

1647
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,010
what I want.
Pink.

1648
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:55,140
Sign your hand and then you turn it into
a tattoo.

1649
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,360
Pink floyd.
Oh,

1650
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:58,160
okay.
Yeah,

1651
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:58,920
yeah.
I mean,

1652
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:04,050
I,
I like to feel like a early on in my 

1653
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:04,050
career I was,
I was pink a bit,

1654
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,130
you know,
putting up these walls and,

1655
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,040
you know,
and I kind of connected with that story,

1656
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,060
uh,
early on and,

1657
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,350
and you know,
I was,

1658
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:16,320
you know,
really into to floyd so much that it 

1659
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,961
inspired my sound.
A pink floyd and electric light 

1660
01:14:18,961 --> 01:14:18,961
orchestra.

1661
01:14:18,961 --> 01:14:23,940
Really ultimately elo wow.
Determine the sound scapes for my entire

1662
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:27,940
career with vinyl you to like listen to 
it on old vial.

1663
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,050
I,
um,

1664
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,300
I don't collect vinyls.
I know buddies that do,

1665
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,730
I have,
I haven't gotten into that,

1666
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:38,750
you know,
I feel like that is a hobby that I 

1667
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,820
eventually want to get into.
I'm not experienced,

1668
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:41,860
you know,
a lot of music that I,

1669
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,880
you know,
would love to on vinyl because I just 

1670
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,841
haven't gotten into that.
It's supposed to have a different sound 

1671
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:48,841
quality to it.
Right.

1672
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:50,080
Why release all my music on vinyl and,
and you know,

1673
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,110
all my album covers are designed for 
vinyl covers.

1674
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,430
Like,
and that's a lot of things that a lot of

1675
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,720
people don't know that.
but you know,

1676
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,550
I designed on my album covers for vinyl 
and,

1677
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,820
and for that presentation to be able to 
see the artwork and you know,

1678
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,900
have this,
you know,

1679
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,390
and be able to hear it in this certain 
quality.

1680
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:11,140
You know,
you can't play kid cuddy back in 1960.

1681
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:16,141
At least.
You can kind of get a little taste of 

1682
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:16,210
you.
So w we um,

1683
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,180
we mix for vinyl,
we do everything for vinyl.

1684
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,080
ultimately,
you know,

1685
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,240
we were not doing this shit for,
for,

1686
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,520
you know,
itunes and mp3s,

1687
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,320
you know.
Um,

1688
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:30,010
yeah,
the ritual is just getting the vinyl and

1689
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,830
then on their end.
Yeah,

1690
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,000
it's a thing,
what,

1691
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:36,640
that thing is rare today.
Like people don't sit down and listen to

1692
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:40,180
music together.
Like I'll like if a friend is in a car,

1693
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,180
I'll play him some shit.
like listening to this,

1694
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,770
check this out or if we're here in the 
studio,

1695
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:47,580
maybe I'll hook,
I got this bluetooth speaker thing it,

1696
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:52,590
hook it up to that.
But most of the time you doN't sit down 

1697
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,950
with dudes and just listen to music.
But I remember when I was a kid,

1698
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,720
my stepfather,
his friends,

1699
01:15:55,721 --> 01:16:00,721
they would,
they would put on an album and they 

1700
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:00,721
would sit down and listen to an album.

1701
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:00,940
Oh yeah.
You know,

1702
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:05,970
they would experience.
You would get the new one or whatever 

1703
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:05,970
the hell it was.
THey,

1704
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,540
I remember they had the new billy joel 
album.

1705
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:08,590
I was a little kid,
man.

1706
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,580
That was the,
it was a,

1707
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:11,710
the piano man.
I remember when it was new,

1708
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:17,700
they pulled that shit out.
I was probably like seven or something 

1709
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:17,700
like that.
And uh,

1710
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,530
they put it on the record player and 
everyone just sat around and listened to

1711
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:25,531
this billy joel album.
That's what people did back when there 

1712
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:25,531
was two tv channels.
And I have,

1713
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:30,060
I kind of imagined that's what my fans 
do and that's kinda like how I create 

1714
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,880
and a lot of people might not.
It's like,

1715
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,820
that's why when I released a single,
for example,

1716
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,640
it might be some weird shit that people 
are just like,

1717
01:16:36,641 --> 01:16:39,790
what is this?
But in the context of the story,

1718
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,400
when you consume the entire album,
that makes sense.

1719
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:47,940
You know,
because I don't really make records for 

1720
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:47,940
singles,
you know,

1721
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:48,640
I make.
I'm making an entire album here.

1722
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:53,641
This is a project.
What percentage of your music is 

1723
01:16:53,641 --> 01:16:54,780
listened to by products?
Something like 80.

1724
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:00,020
I think more than that.
I think 100 percent talking about the 

1725
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:03,500
moon again,
right?

1726
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,400
The fuck in,
right on,

1727
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:07,000
in there,
man.

1728
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,870
That's funny man.
But yeah,

1729
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,620
I think that,
that,

1730
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,510
that's what's missing it.
Mainstream music.

1731
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,970
I think everything is always moment to 
moment.

1732
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:18,971
Single,
the single who's got who or what record 

1733
01:17:18,971 --> 01:17:20,900
is not about like sitting down and 
having an experience,

1734
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:24,290
you know,
and I'm going to always create with that

1735
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,810
in mind and I think as long as I do 
that,

1736
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:31,811
I always have an audience because 
there's people like us that want that 

1737
01:17:31,811 --> 01:17:32,660
experience,
that want that feeling,

1738
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,600
uh,
to get the homies together.

1739
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:38,240
AnD even if we've all heard the album a 
trillion times,

1740
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:41,120
just to put it on from the beginning and
let it play,

1741
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,620
you know,
it's just dope,

1742
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:42,940
man.

1743
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,270
Nope,
nobody really does that anymore.

1744
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:47,580
Everybody's kind of like spotify this 
here at pandora and just skipping around

1745
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:48,740
and skipping around,
skipping around,

1746
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,930
and that's because music is designed 
that way,

1747
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:51,740
you know?
Um,

1748
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,170
but you,
you step into like,

1749
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,390
you know what we do,
the kids know.

1750
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,530
It's like,
okay,

1751
01:17:57,531 --> 01:18:02,531
you by kid cudi album,
you probably have your friends come 

1752
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:02,531
over.
It's a thing.

1753
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:03,890
It's like don't open it until I get 
there.

1754
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:10,300
It's a very big deal and I love that 
there's that type of ritual going on 

1755
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,420
because like,
I do it too.

1756
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:16,421
I go and I buy my own album when it 
comes out and kids see me in best buy 

1757
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:18,560
arguing,
like why is it in the front,

1758
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:22,490
but no,
I'm not doing this shit now.

1759
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:24,560
I don't talk to anyone and it's not in 
the front moving.

1760
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,750
Hell yeah.
Hell yeah.

1761
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:28,330
Legal.

1762
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,230
No,
I think there's digital terrorism but,

1763
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,580
but it's kind of like I look at it like 
this,

1764
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:36,890
if I'm not going out on a day,
I'm buying my album.

1765
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,910
You can't expect other people to do it.
You know?

1766
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:41,990
If I got to support my own self too,
and know that's hilarious.

1767
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:43,910
You're supporting your own self.
That doesn't even work that way.

1768
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:46,370
Just keep the money in your pocket and 
steal your own album.

1769
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:50,270
I really do believe where he really 
truly support yourself.

1770
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:55,340
Get caught shoplifting or album that so 
everyone would go.

1771
01:18:55,341 --> 01:19:00,341
That's a big story on tmz.
That's like you would be a front page 

1772
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,410
guy.
I'd be a be a,

1773
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:08,400
but you know,
like I really do believe that man.

1774
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,250
It's just like if You're selling some 
merge you,

1775
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,900
you gotta promote your merchant kids.
Got to see you wearing your own stuff.

1776
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,550
It's you got to let them know like,
hey,

1777
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:17,680
I'm done with this shit too.

1778
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,250
He's covered in his own murder,
never wears anything but death squad,

1779
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:27,251
tee shirts and death squad have to make 
my own closet business and make his own 

1780
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:32,291
crocs.
Croc is going to walk around and he's 

1781
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:36,160
going to become that guy.
I want to pair those Blue crocs with 

1782
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:36,160
white socks.
Kenny's on them.

1783
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,800
Would you ever wear crocs outside?
It's so weird that you said that job 

1784
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,760
went to the magic castle last night.
I knew I had to buy new shoes because I 

1785
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:48,170
don't wear dress shoes.
I just remember up there.

1786
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,090
Huh?
No,

1787
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,290
I got invited.
A lucky bastard.

1788
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,930
You really want to go to that just to 
see what's up.

1789
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,570
Just I,
I just drive by it every damn day.

1790
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:58,220
I want to know what's going on.
That'd be easy.

1791
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,770
Yeah,
I can get you gonna going.

1792
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:04,850
Okay.
But I had to get dress shoes and I was 

1793
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:08,261
joking with my girlfriend that I was 
just going to buy black croc so I could 

1794
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:08,261
use them other times than just dressing

1795
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:13,130
up and she thought I warm the whole time
because I had an old pair of crocs and 

1796
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:13,130
like these are what I buy.
And she's like,

1797
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:13,370
oh,
you know,

1798
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:18,490
he knows.
And then right before I left I switched 

1799
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:18,490
on,
but we had this whole thing last night.

1800
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,800
No,
crocs are great.

1801
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,970
Do you own crux jump?
No,

1802
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:22,920
no,
no,

1803
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,890
no,
but I mean I don't have any problem with

1804
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:30,891
wearing them.
I would wear them if there were that 

1805
01:20:30,891 --> 01:20:33,000
comfortable,
but I heard they're good.

1806
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:36,180
It's my walk outside and get the mail or
do something else.

1807
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:42,320
Either skate shoes or wear converse.
All stars.

1808
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,810
That's where I were.
Yeah.

1809
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:44,620
Yeah.
That's good.

1810
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:45,980
See,
I got these leather.

1811
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,840
Chuck's on.
Nice.

1812
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,760
they're comfortable.
I got these beeps Today.

1813
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,750
Oh,
those are nice.

1814
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:56,900
What are those?
They donate a couple of years,

1815
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:58,310
maybe five years old.
This came up.

1816
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,410
I liked it.
I liked the star on the side.

1817
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,480
It's pretty dope.
Skate shoes are probably the most 

1818
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:05,480
comfortable like them and like chuck 
taylors,

1819
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,470
those are all pretty much.

1820
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:11,830
I used to only wear vans and and then my
girl got me into wearing jordans and 

1821
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,440
stuff like that.
They're built.

1822
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:13,490
That's.
I get it.

1823
01:21:13,491 --> 01:21:18,491
Now.
They are the most comfortable shoe in 

1824
01:21:18,491 --> 01:21:18,491
the rural.
Welcome.

1825
01:21:18,491 --> 01:21:20,660
Welcome to the final.
You've got Jordan

1826
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,600
on mtv cribs.
Were you going to your house?

1827
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:25,970
You've got all these jordan's like 
stacked up around your place.

1828
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,020
Look at this right here.
Oh no.

1829
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:36,580
You son of a bitch.
Those are giant laser from back to the 

1830
01:21:38,631 --> 01:21:38,930
future.

1831
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,490
Is that what their phone?
Is it a.

1832
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,850
Those are the mags and nike max.
Are those comfortable?

1833
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,170
yeah,
they are man.

1834
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:47,110
It designed the shit out of those.
Yeah.

1835
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:52,690
Joe,
have you ever wear a pair of jordans or 

1836
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:52,690
any of those kinds of shoes?

1837
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,110
I haven't in a long time.
When I used to have a deal with nike,

1838
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:00,320
I used to have one of those things where
like when I was on newsradio that'll 

1839
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,410
give you free shoes and on fear factor 
too.

1840
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:03,790
They just send me boxes of free nike's.
Wow.

1841
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:06,110
But I just stopped.
I don't really do tv anymore.

1842
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:08,970
It'd be rude if I kept calling them the 
yellow so you know,

1843
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:12,690
I still need that shit.
What are you going to do with this?

1844
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:18,310
It's going to work out your shit.
but they had a thing where you could 

1845
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,310
call them and they would give you free 
stuff.

1846
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,650
Yeah.
But I,

1847
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,830
so they would give me a bunch of stuff 
that I wouldn't wear like white and red,

1848
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,940
like basketball shoes and be like I can 
wear these,

1849
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,440
but a lot of like cross trainers and 
shit,

1850
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:33,820
they have comfortable shit but I got 
into smaller sole things that have like 

1851
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,810
less.
You'll feel the ground more like chuck's

1852
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,700
like chuck taylors.
I liked that better.

1853
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:41,940
I can't perform in jordan's my discovery
recently.

1854
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:42,840
Really?
In what way?

1855
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:48,140
I just can't move.
I can't imagine that if you live on 

1856
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:52,641
stage combat boots,
I fuck with army boots with a cigar 

1857
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:56,970
hanging out of your mouth,
like fucking sergeant fury.

1858
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:03,690
It was ridiculous.
How about timberland's?

1859
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:08,740
Um,
I've seen people do it in all sorts of 

1860
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:08,740
sorts of footwear,
but for me,

1861
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,790
I'm moving around a lot and it's hard 
for me to move as quick and as nimble.

1862
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,860
Why is That?
With jordans I'm going to feel that were

1863
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:19,600
athletic shoes while I'm not like,
well first off I'm not like I don't have

1864
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:21,160
them laced up.
Oh,

1865
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:23,020
you know,
like I'm about to go play full court,

1866
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,430
you know what I mean?
So there's that,

1867
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:29,431
there's the.
So they're slIpping around just the 

1868
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:29,431
whole like,
you know,

1869
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:32,431
trying to be fresh thing about it.
So they're not like really being worn 

1870
01:23:32,431 --> 01:23:32,530
how it's supposed to be worn.
But then like,

1871
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:37,890
there's nothing like converse where it 
feels like you're literally dancing 

1872
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:40,891
barefoot,
like on your tippy toes from one end to 

1873
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:41,200
the stage to the other.
And that's literally,

1874
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:44,350
I find like the best sneaker for me on 
stage.

1875
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:49,380
Yeah.
Converse with the best for working out 

1876
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:49,380
too.
Like if you lifting with stuff,

1877
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,490
you just feel the ground with them.
There's very little padding but it makes

1878
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:55,720
you think like just dudes like julius 
erving and like back in the day where he

1879
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:58,900
used to wear those and actually play 
basketball games and um,

1880
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,450
that's incredible.
That's what they wore.

1881
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,480
Chuck taylors,
they would play a basketball game with 

1882
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,030
no protection basically,
you know,

1883
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,650
ankles were getting broken.
Oh,

1884
01:24:08,651 --> 01:24:13,651
they probably snapped.
But then again they probably developed 

1885
01:24:13,651 --> 01:24:13,651
tougher ankles,
you know,

1886
01:24:13,651 --> 01:24:16,240
like they grew up doing that.
Does that make any sense?

1887
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,250
Yeah.
Jamie shakes his head.

1888
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,620
He's a fucking physio,
vascular ankles,

1889
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:21,170
man.
I'm there.

1890
01:24:21,171 --> 01:24:23,710
Yeah.
Well it doesn't make sense.

1891
01:24:23,711 --> 01:24:25,960
Like if You used it,
it would get stronger.

1892
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,910
No,
like,

1893
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,160
like if you put too much bracing around 
it.

1894
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:31,740
Yeah.
Yeah,

1895
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:37,380
yeah.
I would imagine there's a letter right 

1896
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:37,380
there.

1897
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:37,380
You these two.
Joe's.

1898
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,920
Hello kitty.
Long and I'm on am my own camera.

1899
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,460
Okay,
I'll make sure he's on camera.

1900
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,910
We don't want the world now.
He smokes weed.

1901
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,170
So,

1902
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:49,990
we,
we got in touch because you reached out 

1903
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,040
to me on twitter out of nowhere.
Oh yeah,

1904
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,350
that was cool.
We was on twitter talking.

1905
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:56,710
Shit,
I love what you do joe.

1906
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,500

1907
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:01,660
Okay.
Hello everybody.

1908
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,970

right?
This is what you guys want to see.

1910
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:10,500
They want to see you shoot heroin bumps 
and the other one.

1911
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,750
Brian is a bunch.
There's a bunch in that one.

1912
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:15,190
Um,
Yeah.

1913
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,360
Do some bumps.

01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:28,660
I've never done.
I've never done coke.

1918
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,320
Well,
here's the thing.

1919
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:30,940
I don't think I'm ever going to get 
married.

1920
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:32,700
So beautiful.
This works out for.

1921
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:37,860
I remember saying that to get you to be 
gotten joe.

1922
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:43,830
I want to be gotten bro.
It's definitely better than not wanting 

1923
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:43,830
to be gotten,
been,

1924
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:44,980
gotten is better than wanting to be at.
Man.

1925
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:46,780
I'm joking.
By the way.

1926
01:25:46,781 --> 01:25:48,880
I just dicking around.
Everybody wants love.

1927
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:49,990
It's the truth.
Oh for sure,

1928
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:51,290
dude.
It's one of the weirdest things when you

1929
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:53,710
know somebody who just can't ever 
fucking get it right.

1930
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:58,980
They can't find somebody to care about.
like everybody knows this one girl or 

1931
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,430
one dude that just can't get a 
girlfriend or a boyfriend.

1932
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,190
There's always like the struggle.
They're always saying gold.

1933
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:03,770
They can't

1934
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,920
find anybody worth a fuck.
That's sad.

1935
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:09,620
Shit.
They can't find anyone to fuck.

1936
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,350
Fuck,
fuck.

1937
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:16,390
I mean almost everybody has lower your 
standards enough to find somebody 

1938
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,390
that'll fuck.
Yeah.

1939
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:17,390
That's,
you know,

1940
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:17,870
I mean,
I,

1941
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,520
I mean,
I'm not saying that I meet,

1942
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,650
I don't meet people that aren't worth a 
fuck,

1943
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:24,960
but it is hard to find somebody,
you know,

1944
01:26:24,961 --> 01:26:26,570
and,
and it's just,

1945
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,960
it doesn't,
it's no different whether you're a 

1946
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:31,960
celebrity or not,
you know,

1947
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,010
it's just hard to meet people and you 
don't.

1948
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,220
it's also,
it's hard to.

1949
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:40,610
It's hard to really,
I guess trust and believe,

1950
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:42,170
you know someone.
I mean,

1951
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:45,640
how well do you ever really know someone
you know and,

1952
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:50,750
and you know,
how long does it take to say that you 

1953
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:54,071
really know someone?
How do you know what somebody is giving 

1954
01:26:54,071 --> 01:26:54,071
you is really then,
you know,

1955
01:26:54,071 --> 01:26:54,071
it's true.

1956
01:26:54,071 --> 01:26:58,990
I mean,
there's definitely people that were 

1957
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:00,731
bullshit you and there's definitely 
people that have layers to their 

1958
01:27:00,731 --> 01:27:01,120
personality that you didn't imagine.
You just can't,

1959
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:06,310
especially if you cross them,
if you develop some sort of a feud with 

1960
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:10,331
them and you find out that they're 
willing to just go completely psycho on 

1961
01:27:10,331 --> 01:27:13,091
you and take shit to the next level and 
start banging on your fucking door in 

1962
01:27:13,091 --> 01:27:13,790
the middle of the night Screaming,
get that hoe out of there.

1963
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:15,330
Know that's me.
I,

1964
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,190
that's what you do.
That's your moving on.

1965
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:22,270
Totally.
Girl can be that guy mentally insane in 

1966
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,130
the course of a relationship.
Um,

1967
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:26,880
but no,
I feel you man.

1968
01:27:26,881 --> 01:27:27,160
It's,
it's.

1969
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,740
But I,
I,

1970
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,540
I like to keep a stance where it's like,
fuck that,

1971
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,150
you know,
I don't,

1972
01:27:33,151 --> 01:27:38,151
I don't need anyone but deep down,
like everybody wants somebody that's 

1973
01:27:38,151 --> 01:27:38,420
like a companion.

1974
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:43,420
You know,
there's somebody that's a best friend 

1975
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:43,420
and a teammate and I,
I kind of,

1976
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,270
you know,
will always want that,

1977
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:48,050
but it's not something that I'm like 
searching for,

1978
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:49,950
like I used to,
like it was for awhile.

1979
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,970
I was like,
I felt like that was the only way I can 

1980
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:54,970
get a certain happiness in my life,
you know,

1981
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:58,340
just come to terms with it and you 
realize that that's not the way.

1982
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,580
And you know,
I'm just very hopeful,

1983
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:06,610
you know,
that I'll run into somebody but it is 

1984
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:06,610
tough,
you know,

1985
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:06,610
and I,
and I made a lot of cool chicks,

1986
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:11,171
you know,
I meet a lot of cool tricks and you 

1987
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:11,171
know,
it's just for me,

1988
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:15,041
it's just really,
it's tough about being at the right 

1989
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:15,050
place and right time when,
you know,

1990
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:20,230
sometimes you're not in the right place 
in your own head to be a good person to 

1991
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,110
be in a relationship with.

1992
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,710
Yeah.
And that's,

1993
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,380
and I really do.
I feel like,

1994
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:26,510
you know,
at this time in my life,

1995
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:31,511
you know,
there's a lot of soul searching that 

1996
01:28:31,511 --> 01:28:33,671
scott needs to do.
Scott is talking about himself in the 

1997
01:28:33,671 --> 01:28:33,671
third person.
THird person.

1998
01:28:33,671 --> 01:28:33,671
Yeah.
Scott,

1999
01:28:33,671 --> 01:28:36,050
because I didn't want to admit that,
you know,

2000
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,460
so when I have to admit shit like that,
you know,

2001
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,490
flaws and all,
I have to step out.

2002
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,030
Scott needs to get his shit together.
I never.

2003
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,670
He was like,
I have to get my shit together.

2004
01:28:44,671 --> 01:28:46,970
It sounds so much worse.
Uh,

2005
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:50,390
jefferson starship man,
they said it back in the sixties.

2006
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:54,470
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?

2007
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,000
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
Yeah,

2008
01:28:57,090 --> 01:29:01,380
you better find somebody to love.
And I'm pitching Saying,

2009
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,160
I really

2010
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,160
feel like,
you know what I actually want to add 

2011
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,160
before I go into this,
how did you meet your lady?

2012
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,740
Like was it just like everybody says 
when you don't,

2013
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:12,870
when you least expect it.
Like was it at.

2014
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:17,460
I like to get you in my personal life on
podcast because I think people fixate on

2015
01:29:17,461 --> 01:29:22,461
other people's personal lives too much 
and it gets weird when people start 

2016
01:29:22,461 --> 01:29:25,581
talking to you in public about your 
personal life and you don't even know 

2017
01:29:25,581 --> 01:29:25,581
them.
Okay.

2018
01:29:25,581 --> 01:29:26,760
So I just found there's no benefit in 
doing that,

2019
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,520
but I just met her in a normal 
environment.

2020
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:32,610
I met her in a bar.
You can meet people.

2021
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,540
It doesn't.
It's like,

2022
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,800
where do you go?
Well,

2023
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:36,090
if you go there,
like people say,

2024
01:29:36,091 --> 01:29:41,091
oh,
you never meet somebody in a bar or you 

2025
01:29:41,091 --> 01:29:41,091
never meet somebody at a bowling alley.
Did you go to a bowling alley?

2026
01:29:41,091 --> 01:29:41,190
Yes.
Okay.

2027
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:42,930
Well then you could meet somebody at a 
bowling alley.

2028
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:48,470
People very.
It's just finding them and that's 

2029
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:48,470
what's.
It's not that easy.

2030
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:53,300
Finding the right combination of you and
them and you might be terrible to other 

2031
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:57,291
people.
Like other people might think like the 

2032
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,841
last thing I want is just crazy.
Scott motherfucker in my life right now 

2033
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:05,061
that it's of course,
sorry girls compatible with each other 

2034
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:10,850
and everybody wants to take that as a 
sign of rejection or a sign as a sign 

2035
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:10,850
of,
you know,

2036
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:14,310
your own lack of self worth or something
like that.

2037
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:19,311
But it's not that somewhere out there 
there's someone who enjoys your 

2038
01:30:19,311 --> 01:30:19,470
personality.
If you,

2039
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:22,200
if you're honest and you're nice,
like if you're honest with yourself,

2040
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:27,201
you understand your flaws,
whatever you're trying to do in this 

2041
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:27,201
life,
try to do it well.

2042
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:27,201
If you've got,
you know,

2043
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:28,770
you got a lot of positive energy about 
you,

2044
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,200
you could probably find somebody.

2045
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,320
You got to be worth finding.
Yeah,

2046
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:36,630
I got to get out the house.
JoE got to get out the house.

2047
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:38,600
That's step one.
Step two,

2048
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,620
I play a lot of xbox,
so that's my thing.

2049
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:46,510
And whenever you want to come over,
but you could either go deep or you 

2050
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:51,111
could get out of the house.
You could just go oculus rift and lived 

2051
01:30:51,111 --> 01:30:52,440
your whole life.
That's like common man.

2052
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,280
Yeah.
It's a neat character.

2053
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,320
A date in this other realm.
this kind of like her,

2054
01:30:57,321 --> 01:30:58,310
like,
you know,

2055
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,350
it's just my baby in this world.
She's hot as fuck.

2056
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:03,750
And then when you're done banger,
you pull her mask off and it's,

2057
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,590
you know,
is that.

2058
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,900
Well,
the thing is you can always power down.

2059
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:11,970
It's not something you got to deal with 
all the time,

2060
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:16,971
you know,
maybe maybe they get you like a 

2061
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:16,971
hypnotist just climb inside your head.

2062
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:20,580
I want the world to know that I'm part 
time a comedian when I,

2063
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:22,560
when I want to.
so there's some,

2064
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,720
a lot of sarcasm.
So just bear with us here.

2065
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,390
Kinda like,
you know,

2066
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,280
decipher most of it.
Yeah.

2067
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:34,281
You don't want them to take it.
Any of your quotes in because they come 

2068
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:37,701
from.
I come from a world where anything that 

2069
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:37,701
come out of my mouth is taken.
So literally.

2070
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:41,050
So it's like I want to make sure that we
understand we're dicking around here and

2071
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,240
exactly.
You know.

2072
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:47,241
And that's why I came here today because
I don't do interviews and I don't sit 

2073
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:49,230
down and talk to them because this 
shit's weird.

2074
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:54,260
You know,
people aren't cool now advIses coolest 

2075
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:54,260
joe rogan bro.
You know,

2076
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,460
so like a big fan.
Like I said,

2077
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:01,500
and I know you're talking about 
psychedelics and I saw something you 

2078
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,981
were talking about one time when you 
were talking about how you went into a 

2079
01:32:04,981 --> 01:32:04,981
one.

2080
01:32:04,981 --> 01:32:06,250
Is it one of those chambers isolation 
tank?

2081
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,830
Yeah,
and I was in a video I think.

2082
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:09,660
No,
I didn't.

2083
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,940
It wasn't video on brian made a video 
about it when I gave away my tank.

2084
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,140
It was like one of your best videos.
You own one bra?

2085
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:16,150
Yeah.
Well yeah,

2086
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:18,220
I own one now,
but I had another one.

2087
01:32:18,221 --> 01:32:20,020
My old one.
I gave it away online.

2088
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,590
So we had this thing get them.
Well you could buy them,

2089
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,370
buy them online.
Shit.

2090
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,640
Yeah.
I mean there's an order.

2091
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:28,720
There's a bunch of different companies 
but.

2092
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,260
Well we'll talk afterwards because will 
ask you where you live and then I'll get

2093
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:35,860
to tell your best option,
but the place that you want to visit.

2094
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,920
There's a place called the flOat lab and
it's in venice and the guy who runs it 

2095
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,830
is my friend crash.
He's actually been on the podcast before

2096
01:32:41,831 --> 01:32:45,760
and he's the master when it comes to 
float tank technology.

2097
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,760
He's the guy that really changed the 
entire industry because they used to be 

2098
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,571
like kind of home models that were like 
kind of flimsy and you know,

2099
01:32:54,641 --> 01:32:57,580
they would have all sorts of issues.
He fixed all the issues,

2100
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:00,370
changed all the filtration system,
made a much more durable,

2101
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:01,840
much bigger,
better insulation,

2102
01:33:01,841 --> 01:33:03,610
like he's turned them into these 
incredible,

2103
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:06,680
like complete next level devices.
That's,

2104
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:09,640
that's in California,
so the best places in California.

2105
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:14,820
If there's another place that's in 
austin that is probably right up there 

2106
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,450
and that place.
Fuck,

2107
01:33:16,451 --> 01:33:19,120
I forget the name of it.
I got it on my instagram feed.

2108
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:21,160
All this man.
I need all this information.

2109
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,560
Do you live in California?
Okay,

2110
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:25,750
well if you live in California then 
there's one place to go.

2111
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:26,980
That's the float lab.
Here's.

2112
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:32,010
If you look at the video and here's 
joe's isolation tank he had at his 

2113
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:32,010
house.
This is his old one,

2114
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:35,260
the amazon indians,
and he brought it back to them.

2115
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:38,500
I'm talking about the movie altered 
states,

2116
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,830
which is where I found out about 
isolation tank.

2117
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:49,130
It was like 11 or 12 years ago,
returns back into the box after double 

2118
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:52,170
filter.
On top of that,

2119
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:57,290
I also have this right here,
which is a an oxygen scrubber just like 

2120
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:59,130
they have at those oxygen bars.
Well,

2121
01:33:59,131 --> 01:34:00,420
this,
this little machine right here,

2122
01:34:00,421 --> 01:34:02,910
pulls oxygen,
pure oxygen out of the air,

2123
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:08,030
and it pumps it through this to where 
this gets it all gets pumped into the 

2124
01:34:08,461 --> 01:34:11,780
tank while I'm lying in it.
So I get pure oxygen,

2125
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,980
oxygen,
which is amazing for your mind anyway.

2126
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,950
It makes you feel very refreshed.
And then on top of that,

2127
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,040
I'm in this weightless body list 
experience where you and your thoughts 

2128
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:27,680
usually my experience it takes 20 
minutes is always be thinking about my 

2129
01:34:28,051 --> 01:34:29,850
life,
me thinking about my friendships,

2130
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:32,190
my relationships,
what the fuck

2131
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:37,330
you underwater.
So you just saId so much salt in the 

2132
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:39,310
water that when you lie in it,
you just float,

2133
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:44,400
right?
So you're like half your body's above 

2134
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,070
the water like this much and everything 
behind it is underwater.

2135
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,090
So like your ears are underwater so you 
can either wear earplugs if you want.

2136
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,890
I don't usually wear earplugs,
I just get in.

2137
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:54,530
But some people like earplugs,
you can just rent your ears,

2138
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:59,210
you float and you're in total silence.
What's the total darkness?

2139
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,430
Total darkness.
So it varies.

2140
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,590
If you feel like you're flying through 
space.

2141
01:35:03,591 --> 01:35:05,360
Like I recently got graham hancock into 
it,

2142
01:35:05,361 --> 01:35:10,361
he just did a couple of them.
THen that's his description of what he 

2143
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:10,361
said.
It feels like you're in space,

2144
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:13,400
you're flying because you're weightless 
and as you're lying there like floating.

2145
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:15,290
That's a.
That never happens in life.

2146
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:18,080
We don't feel like there's anything 
holding you down.

2147
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:23,230
You feel like you're flying through 
space and because the fact that you're 

2148
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:24,980
in this tank with no light coming in and
no sound,

2149
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,760
you have no like your brain doesn't have
any work to do.

2150
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:33,810
It,
doesn't have to worry about your 

2151
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:34,631
balance,
doesn't have to worry about moving you 

2152
01:35:34,631 --> 01:35:34,631
around or dealing with your environment 
in any way.

2153
01:35:34,631 --> 01:35:37,490
Nothing's coming in.
So this tank was created bY this guy who

2154
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:42,491
is a.
He's a pioneer in inter species 

2155
01:35:42,491 --> 01:35:45,370
communications with dolphins is.
It's really crazy guy called john lilly 

2156
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:49,900
and he did all these like really 
important studies with dolphins,

2157
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:53,020
like trying to teach dolphins,
human words,

2158
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:58,070
trying to communicate.
All the noises are so much different 

2159
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,070
than ours,
but he did a lot of it.

2160
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:00,980
While he's on acid.
He was trying to develop a bunch of ways

2161
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:02,810
to get outside of the influence of the 
body,

2162
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:06,910
like he was being very scientific about 
it and his ideas where he,

2163
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:08,600
he,
we used to have like a scuba tank.

2164
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:13,630
There was like,
you had a helmet on like one of those 

2165
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:16,630
25,000
leagues under the sea type helmet he 

2166
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:19,660
had.
I'm thinking like at first we were 

2167
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:19,660
talking about.
I was like,

2168
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:19,660
yeah,
fuck,

2169
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:22,570
that's what he used to have and he used 
to have it where it was like hooked up 

2170
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:25,010
where it was on a harness and you would 
be sorta just dunked in the water.

2171
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:27,200
So we'll eventually you forget about the
helmet,

2172
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:32,201
you forget about your body,
you just chill out and relax and the 

2173
01:36:32,201 --> 01:36:34,751
water was the same temperature as your 
skin so it becomes indistinguishable 

2174
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:35,600
after awhile.
Once he's got it dialed in just right.

2175
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,520
You don't want it too hot because then 
you can sweat.

2176
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,320
We don't want it to pool your cold in 
there and start shivering is a,

2177
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:44,960
goldie locks 93 and a half degrees.
It's like 93 and a half.

2178
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,330
Some people's 94.
So a,

2179
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:48,260
you should do it,
man.

2180
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:48,710
It's,
it's,

2181
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,330
it's amazing.
So you got to your crib.

2182
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:51,410
Yeah,
I have one.

2183
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,730
Could I come over and try?
Sure,

2184
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,650
absolutely.
Loved to.

2185
01:36:53,651 --> 01:36:54,380
Yeah,
absolutely.

2186
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:58,730
But if you wanted to get one for your 
house to crash definitely sells those.

2187
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:03,620
So I fEel like something that should be 
in every university,

2188
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:07,280
it's something that should be and just a
lot of people should,

2189
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:12,310
if they have the money or they have the 
time or a group of people get together 

2190
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,820
and invest in it,
it's so beneficial and it's a,

2191
01:37:13,821 --> 01:37:18,821
it's something that's just,
it's not thought of as being an 

2192
01:37:18,821 --> 01:37:21,281
important tool in your life,
but the ability to tune the whole world 

2193
01:37:21,281 --> 01:37:22,820
out and just float.
That's awesome.

2194
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,880
Oh,
you trip your balls in and out of it 

2195
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:27,880
because if somebody has to know,
it's real easy.

2196
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,300
It's real easy.
It's only 11 inches of water.

2197
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:35,710
So as you're lying there,
you mean you just stand up when you're 

2198
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:35,810
done and you just get out.
IT's nothing.

2199
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,070
I mean you,
you can't,

2200
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:40,850
you can't drown the waters.
11 inches and it's only six feet wide.

2201
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:42,740
Just you touched the sides with your 
hands.

2202
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:48,070
yeah.
You center yourself in the middle and 

2203
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,110
relax and when you do it,
you get more and more comfortable.

2204
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,730
Every time you do it,
the first time you do it,

2205
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:51,620
it'll be a little weird.
Like everybody's described.

2206
01:37:51,621 --> 01:37:55,770
It pretty much says what I always have 
said like the first couple times,

2207
01:37:55,771 --> 01:37:59,250
it's just about getting to relax,
figuring out how to relax.

2208
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:01,110
Once you've done it like a few dozen 
times,

2209
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:06,680
then it just becomes that thing you do 
just get in there and you just say that 

2210
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,520
for me is giant.
Whenever there's any issues that I'm 

2211
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:10,520
dealing with and he,
uh,

2212
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,060
any problems that I have maybe 
creatively even,

2213
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,290
you know,
I like to go in there,

2214
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:14,940
I'll go in there with jujitsu problems.

2215
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,300
I'll go in there with a try,
like try to analyze someone's movements.

2216
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:23,301
Like if there's a guy who like,
keeps catching me with a particular 

2217
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:23,301
submission,
I would,

2218
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:27,500
I would go in the tank and I would try 
to work out like the defense for the 

2219
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,230
submission in the tank.
Yeah.

2220
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:33,280
It would go with like a specific goal in
mind because it makes your brain like 

2221
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,580
supercharged because we don't like when 
I'm sitting here,

2222
01:38:35,581 --> 01:38:40,581
I got a super uncomfortable chair.
This is this thing called a saddle 

2223
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,230
chair,
a sally's swinging something chair.

2224
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:45,810
It's super uncomfortable,
but it's really good for your back.

2225
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:48,900
it makes you sit.
It makes you sit like an arrow,

2226
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,430
you know?
Um,

2227
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,110
but it's,
it's stupid.

2228
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:53,760
Uncomfortable men.
What was my point?

2229
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,110
No,
he was saying that like,

2230
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:01,580
I completely lost my point.
We picked up the soap to show the 

2231
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:01,580
fucking chair.

2232
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:05,660
But was I saying just before that,
none of you guys know I was listening to

2233
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:10,690
three people in this room.
That's a sure sign that saying it was 

2234
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,500
very ineffective because no one 
remembers that at all.

2235
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,820
I was falling short term.
Memory's a motherfucker man.

2236
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:20,440
that.
Well,

2237
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:21,970
where are you talking about?
I don't know.

2238
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:27,230
Oh,
we're talking about a sensory 

2239
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:27,540
deprivation because this,
this gives me a lot of sensory input.

2240
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:29,520
It's uncomfortable.
It's like pinching my dick.

2241
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:33,600
You gotta squeeze your legs together to 
sit up and when you're sitting in it,

2242
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:38,620
you're,
you're constantly kind of working out 

2243
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:38,620
your legs,
like you're pinching your legs together.

2244
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:42,240
It's the only way you can sit up as if 
that's the key to it.

2245
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,420
The key to it is it's uncomfortable and 
when you do sit like that,

2246
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:50,450
it activates your and it's actually good
for your back and it makes my back feel 

2247
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:50,450
great.

2248
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:52,020
It's amazing.
Let's do a three hour podcasts.

2249
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:57,021
My back doesn't fuck with me at all.
Whereas if I sit in a regular chair 

2250
01:39:57,021 --> 01:39:57,240
after like three hours,
I feel like tight.

2251
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:59,430
You know,
I feel like kinked up.

2252
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:02,970
This doesn't do that at all,
but there's a lot of sensory input.

2253
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:08,240
I think when you're dealing with like 
there's a keyboard in front of you or 

2254
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:08,360
did you see that light?
She,

2255
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:09,900
this clock.
YoU see all these different things.

2256
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:14,901
You're,
you're taking in your entire 

2257
01:40:14,901 --> 01:40:16,821
environment,
you're feeling the gravity of your body 

2258
01:40:16,821 --> 01:40:17,010
pulling the chair.
There's all these things that your brain

2259
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:22,011
is calculating and if there was some 
people next to you there were screaming 

2260
01:40:22,011 --> 01:40:24,741
and yelling,
it'd be really hard to pay attention to 

2261
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:26,601
what you're saying.
Like sometimes we do these podcasts and 

2262
01:40:26,601 --> 01:40:26,601
they'll be unloading trucks and we'll 
hear the trucks.

2263
01:40:26,601 --> 01:40:26,680
The background.

2264
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:29,640
Yeah,

2265
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:34,640
we're here.
The hydraulics and the engines and shit 

2266
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,250
and it's distracting.
It makes you wish that it would go away 

2267
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:40,250
because then you'd be able to formulate 
your thoughts without any resistance 

2268
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:40,250
with less resistance.
RIght?

2269
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:40,710
Well,
when you're in that tank,

2270
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:45,950
that is that,
that that's that state at its best 

2271
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,000
because there's nothing coming in.
There's nothing coming in.

2272
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:53,240
It's just your mind.
There's nothing coming in and when you 

2273
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:53,240
get to that place where there's nothing 
coming in,

2274
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,030
it's beautiful.
You just,

2275
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:56,950
you get a real chance to like go over 
shit.

2276
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:00,520
Creative stuff or personal stuff or you 
know,

2277
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:05,790
problems like if you play a game,
if there's anything that you do where 

2278
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:09,961
you constantly working on it,
like some guys play golf or some guys 

2279
01:41:09,961 --> 01:41:11,020
you can get in that tank and just think 
about all the various things.

2280
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:16,021
Various aspects of anything you're 
trying to concentrate on and it offers 

2281
01:41:16,021 --> 01:41:18,100
you this window of concentration.
It's just uNavailable any other way.

2282
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,350
I mean I definitely need to try it 
because I've heard a lot about it,

2283
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:28,410
but I never really knew what it was and 
I didn't really know how you would go 

2284
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:28,410
about doing it.
Super easy.

2285
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:30,070
Another thIng too,
it's like who do you ask,

2286
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:35,580
you know,
and that's with anything like right now 

2287
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,981
there's less of them than they should.
There should be all over the place and 

2288
01:41:37,981 --> 01:41:40,460
people are starting to open a business.
It can be a place where you just go,

2289
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:41,920
like they have,
um,

2290
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:43,660
they have them.
There's a bunch of them that are popping

2291
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:48,661
up.
There's a couple of them in California 

2292
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:48,661
but only a couple.
But I know that,

2293
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:52,930
um,
I know that the guys that run on the 

2294
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:55,051
map,
but thinking about starting one and I 

2295
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:55,330
know that crash is opening up a bigger 
one in westwood.

2296
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,780
It's just very under as far as like the 
amount of demand.

2297
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,680
It's very underutilized.
That demand is under tapped into because

2298
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:05,440
I think a lot of people would like it at
burbank.

2299
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:06,580
One's still there.
Yup.

2300
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:08,380
Soothing solutions,
which is in burbank,

2301
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:13,381
which is where I first went in like 2002
and I got hooked immediately.

2302
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:15,820
Like I,
I couldn't.

2303
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:21,030
I couldn't imagine that this was 
something that so few people were 

2304
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,030
talking about.
You got to try it,

2305
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:26,190
try it,
and then you were actually the first 

2306
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:27,721
person.
I might have heard about it in another 

2307
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:30,061
conversation too,
but you were the first person I heard 

2308
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:30,580
talk about it extensively in detail and 
it wasn't this video.

2309
01:42:30,581 --> 01:42:32,370
I heard you talking about it.
One of your podcasts.

2310
01:42:32,371 --> 01:42:33,730
Yeah.
I won't shut the fuck up about it.

2311
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,070
And people get mad when you have one.
I mean,

2312
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:38,410
it's not just that I.
I'm telling you,

2313
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:40,150
if you don't,
if you haven't tried it,

2314
01:42:40,151 --> 01:42:41,020
you don't know.

2315
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:44,110
I'm telling you for your own good.
If I'm beating a dead horse,

2316
01:42:44,111 --> 01:42:46,980
I apologize,
but you just wanted to.

2317
01:42:46,981 --> 01:42:49,480
Lucky sons of bitches that has one in 
his house.

2318
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:51,730
Any luck.
There's a lot of people that do.

2319
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:54,490
They do renovations to their house and 
do all these different things.

2320
01:42:54,491 --> 01:42:56,390
they spend a lot of money and there's 
don't.

2321
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,740
That doesn't even come into the realm of
possibility.

2322
01:42:59,741 --> 01:43:01,930
Like we've got to get a hot tub that's 
there.

2323
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,990
People love to get hot tub on.
Mike and sue got a new hot tub.

2324
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:06,700
What's just come on over and we'll go 
sit in the jacuzzi.

2325
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,540
Oh,
nice.

2326
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:11,500
What is this rania.
I was about five grand more bob and they

2327
01:43:11,501 --> 01:43:14,050
have these fucking stupid conversations,
but if one of them said,

2328
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:19,051
hey man,
I'm thinking about getting an isolation 

2329
01:43:19,051 --> 01:43:19,051
tank,
which is like you could get one for less

2330
01:43:19,051 --> 01:43:19,051
than now.

2331
01:43:19,051 --> 01:43:23,850
I think a company called zen float,
they make one that's like really 

2332
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:23,980
inexpensive.
I think it's like 1700 bucks,

2333
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:26,590
like the least.
The least expensive one.

2334
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,560
It's not the same as like crashes not 
even close.

2335
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:32,230
It's flimsy,
but it'll work.

2336
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:33,360
You know,
it's.

2337
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:36,820
I dunno,
I dunno how it deadens the sound anyway,

2338
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:38,980
but I guess being underwater deadens the
sound,

2339
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,660
you know,
maybe it works great.

2340
01:43:40,661 --> 01:43:43,450
Maybe it's enough.
I'm looking at is definitely better than

2341
01:43:43,451 --> 01:43:46,300
nothing.
The kids are talking about us on twitter

2342
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:47,860
a little bit.
Don't pay attention to that shit.

2343
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:48,790
No,
it's great.

2344
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:53,940
It's great.
It's being mean to you so you pay to 

2345
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:53,940
them.
They love it.

2346
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,710
Of course they do.
They love us.

2347
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:55,670
Pistol.
Fuck you up though.

2348
01:43:55,671 --> 01:43:57,430
You can't be doing that while you're 
doing a podcast.

2349
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:01,970
We never get to talk.
We'll be doing no talking on here.

2350
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,500
Kicking it.

2351
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:06,160
I wonder what how you feel right now?
You can't worry about that shit,

2352
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:07,670
man.
Can't trust them.

2353
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:11,930
Can't trust them with your thoughts.
Dawn of the dead.

2354
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,300
You got a dog dead shirt.
Yeah,

2355
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:15,770
man.
That's a dope fucking horror movie.

2356
01:44:15,771 --> 01:44:18,460
That was scary as shit.
Oh yeah.

2357
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:23,530
When that movie came out and they were 
going through the mall when the zombies 

2358
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:25,460
were wandering through the mall to 
people don't know all these people today

2359
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:30,461
that are so spoiled because we've had 
about a billion fucking zombie movies 

2360
01:44:30,461 --> 01:44:32,240
back then with dawn of the dead was 
around when that first movie,

2361
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:35,570
that movie first came out.
That was a game changer that make people

2362
01:44:35,571 --> 01:44:37,380
shit their pants and I think that that's
like,

2363
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:42,580
you know,
I'm a big walking dead fan and you're 

2364
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:42,580
walking just so like,
you know,

2365
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:42,580
like

2366
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,170
greg nicotero who's just like a,
you know,

2367
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:46,580
special effects,
lagging,

2368
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:49,460
you know,
did a lot of the earlier special effects

2369
01:44:49,461 --> 01:44:50,810
in these movies,
you know,

2370
01:44:50,811 --> 01:44:55,811
and just to see walking dead and see 
like just how they use real practical 

2371
01:44:55,811 --> 01:44:57,140
effects and so on.
The gore is just so real looking.

2372
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:58,550
Yeah.
So sick man.

2373
01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:01,160
I'm just a horror movie fanatic,
man.

2374
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:06,161
I,
I've just been obsessed with horses 

2375
01:45:06,161 --> 01:45:06,161
since I was a kid.
yeah,

2376
01:45:06,161 --> 01:45:09,130
me too.
The only thing that bugs me about the 

2377
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:09,200
walking dead is uniformity of their 
slash or sounds.

2378
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:15,110
What do you mean somebody up when 
they're killing people and stuff,

2379
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,580
you know,
where they're hacking up zombies.

2380
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,210
The sounds are all the same.
You know what I'm saying?

2381
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:24,470
A lot of variety and the sounds they 
make when they cut open their heads,

2382
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,970
man,
they get gruesome.

2383
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:28,760
It's always like,
it's always the same coach.

2384
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:31,310
you know what I mean?
It's like the cat sound.

2385
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:32,930
Every time somebody throws something out
the window,

2386
01:45:32,931 --> 01:45:36,680
it's always the exact same,
like super exaggerated.

2387
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:38,360
Two,
I would just like a little realism,

2388
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:40,670
like sometimes when you hit someone in 
the head with a bat,

2389
01:45:40,671 --> 01:45:45,671
it doesn't make the best sound like 
sometimes you just graze them and it 

2390
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:47,630
doesn't have that,
that same every time.

2391
01:45:47,631 --> 01:45:51,110
It's like it's got a bat.
The bat specialists,

2392
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:52,670
you know,
you just know well,

2393
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:54,620
I've seen a lot of zombie movies pro.

2394
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:58,360
I know if done correctly.
It makes it different.

2395
01:45:58,370 --> 01:46:01,880
Sounds like the best was 28 days later 
in my opinion.

2396
01:46:01,881 --> 01:46:04,380
That's the best movie of all time.
Shannon,

2397
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,650
did you see the second one?
That was fun.

2398
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:08,750
That was really cool.
It was great.

2399
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,970
Twenty eight weeks later.
That was great to look.

2400
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:11,870
It was.
There was.

2401
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:15,560
There was a difference in the zombies 
were scary as fuck.

2402
01:46:15,561 --> 01:46:19,250
they ran at you and they could bite you 
and if it got in you,

2403
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:24,300
you would instantly turn.
You know that there were some wild 

2404
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:24,420
scenes.
that scene.

2405
01:46:24,421 --> 01:46:28,310
Spoiler alert with that chick chops or 
boyfriend up with the machete.

2406
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,590
She.
He got bit and she goes and she looks at

2407
01:46:31,591 --> 01:46:31,910
me.
He goes,

2408
01:46:31,911 --> 01:46:36,911
no,
and she just starts attacking adam with 

2409
01:46:36,911 --> 01:46:36,911
a machete.
That is dark.

2410
01:46:36,911 --> 01:46:37,610
It's real life.
Fuck.

2411
01:46:37,611 --> 01:46:40,790
yet is joe rogan the test with real live
zombie life?

2412
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:45,650
It's not real life.
It's in my eyes is real life.

2413
01:46:45,651 --> 01:46:49,100
Joe.
That was a fucking great movie,

2414
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:51,120
man.
That was a great horror movie.

2415
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:51,950
You didn't.
So you're,

2416
01:46:51,951 --> 01:46:54,090
you're into like the special effects 
guys and everything.

2417
01:46:54,091 --> 01:46:55,190
You know who they are.
I just,

2418
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,670
I just,
I'm into like,

2419
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:00,840
you know,
art and now look at that as an art form.

2420
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:04,230
That's how those guys do is just,
is sick.

2421
01:47:04,231 --> 01:47:07,230
It takes a certain level of expertise 
and taste and uh,

2422
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,440
you know,
I,

2423
01:47:08,441 --> 01:47:13,441
I'm just a fan of that.
Anybody that can do a horror movie with 

2424
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:15,150
no cgi,
I mean bravo and then still be funny and

2425
01:47:15,151 --> 01:47:17,340
believable.
It's like or tv show or anything.

2426
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:18,570
It's,
it's,

2427
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:22,410
it's not easy.
You know how it's really hard.

2428
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:26,340
These guys like pat mcgee is the guy who
did the werewolf out there.

2429
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:29,100
Just the walked in.
I was like,

2430
01:47:29,101 --> 01:47:30,300
okay,
okay.

2431
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:33,260
I know I'm in the right place,
the rick baker where,

2432
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:38,270
well from american werewolf in london 
and one of the beautiful things about 

2433
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:40,911
that movie was that there was no.
cgi was all rick baker's creation and 

2434
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:42,210
they had to show it to you in these 
little flashes.

2435
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:45,240
They couldn't just show you so much of 
It like they do today.

2436
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,950
Like now.
Yeah,

2437
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:51,951
the monster's look way better for sure.
But they're showing you too much.

2438
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,890
So in showing you too much.
It's actually,

2439
01:47:55,910 --> 01:48:00,910
it actually looks shittier.
Like there's a lot of monster movies 

2440
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:01,050
where like one of the weird things about
monsters,

2441
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:05,990
like a real monster movie is you see 
them so briefly before they kill you,

2442
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:06,870
you know,
it's like,

2443
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:08,220
oh jesus,
and then you're dead.

2444
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:12,510
I can sort of represented that in 
american werewolf in london.

2445
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,210
But you saw that thing for like a frame 
to frame it.

2446
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:21,580
You were shitting your pants.
The guy was running to the subway and 

2447
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:25,041
there's a brief,
like couple of frames where the 

2448
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,700
werewolf's at the bottom of the 
escalator and it's down there and he's,

2449
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:29,400
he's traveling up and he sees the 
werewolf starting to make its way up the

2450
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:34,401
escalator and shit in his pants,
just a couple seconds and it's gone and 

2451
01:48:34,401 --> 01:48:34,401
it's like,
god damn it.

2452
01:48:34,401 --> 01:48:37,400
It's so much better than showing people 
like a cgi,

2453
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:41,380
like those movies that are kind of fun.
Underworld,

2454
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:46,080
that was kind of underworld movies,
but they were will hour of screentime.

2455
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,150
There's A wearable if you get used to 
seeing it.

2456
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:51,720
It's like,
you know,

2457
01:48:51,910 --> 01:48:55,080
if you can tease the audience and build 
up that anticipation,

2458
01:48:55,081 --> 01:48:55,680
it's like,
you know,

2459
01:48:56,350 --> 01:48:57,930
because you can,
you know,

2460
01:48:57,931 --> 01:49:02,931
do the cgi and make you know,
the monster look more present in the 

2461
01:49:03,181 --> 01:49:04,080
scene.
you know,

2462
01:49:04,081 --> 01:49:07,010
it's kind of like the people aren't 
thinking about that.

2463
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:09,690
Give it to them in doses,
in some movies have done it,

2464
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:10,680
you know,
dope.

2465
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:12,690
Like I liked cloverfield.
I thought that was sick.

2466
01:49:12,691 --> 01:49:15,870
I was,
the new godzilla I thought was dope.

2467
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:18,300
I wasn't mad at it.
It was fun to watch,

2468
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:21,180
kept surviving,
bummed me out a little bit.

2469
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:24,120
I was just like,
this motherfucker has the worst luck.

2470
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:29,121
yet the best luck ever.
He keeps getting these cataclysmic 

2471
01:49:29,121 --> 01:49:29,490
situations that keeps getting out with a
bandaid.

2472
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:36,290
Everybody else is dead.
This fucking dude rises from every 

2473
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:36,700
brushes himself off.
We got to fight god's.

2474
01:49:36,701 --> 01:49:41,701
Oh,
he's not freaking the fuck out that a 

2475
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:41,701
bridge.
Just missed it.

2476
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:41,701
I know.
He's like,

2477
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:46,341
we gotta get godzilla.
Could've saved my family and get 

2478
01:49:46,341 --> 01:49:47,160
godzilla stone seen it.
Oh my god.

2479
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:52,200
Is it the.
It's worth seeing just for the end 

2480
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,181
scene,
just for the fight scene between 

2481
01:49:54,181 --> 01:49:54,181
godzilla and the other monster.

2482
01:49:54,181 --> 01:49:55,360
That's prettY dope.
I wasn't expecting that.

2483
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:00,600
That was pretty dope.
And then it reminds you that like 

2484
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,540
godzilla is really about godzilla.
Godzilla is a hero movie.

2485
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,260
It's like godzilla is a hero.
Godzilla is a hero.

2486
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,870
So it's king kong.
Those are here in movies like you can't,

2487
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:09,580
you can't.
They're not scary movies.

2488
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:11,530
Like it's not like a monster movie,
like king kong.

2489
01:50:11,531 --> 01:50:13,330
You only see them in brief second.
It wouldn't work.

2490
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:18,600
Like that's one of the main problems 
with like special effects and a movie 

2491
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:22,231
like king kong.
It's like it always had to be special 

2492
01:50:22,231 --> 01:50:23,170
effects from the 1930 movie.
Like you got to see him all the time.

2493
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:28,830
It's not like this monster you briefly 
see for a second and then it gets you 

2494
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:30,720
like the original alien.
I mean,

2495
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:35,730
but that's the shit that aliens is 
always going to be a classic and 

2496
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:37,530
original one was the best because you 
put all these sought.

2497
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:43,460
I think they all were kind of like that 
though because in the environments that 

2498
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:46,921
they were at,
it was just so fucking shady like 

2499
01:50:46,921 --> 01:50:49,590
spaceships and.
Well the second one was pretty fuckIng 

2500
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:51,250
dope.
That was a James Cameron one aliens.

2501
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:56,400
But it was different than the first one 
because the first one you barely saw 

2502
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:56,920
that fucking thing.
Barely saw it.

2503
01:50:57,190 --> 01:51:02,190
It was always sneaking by the time they 
signed it would be on them and it would 

2504
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:03,220
kill them and that'll be it.
And then the second one,

2505
01:51:03,221 --> 01:51:04,900
they're everywhere and they're just 
shooting them and killing them.

2506
01:51:04,901 --> 01:51:07,450
Like they kill them so much easier.
The first one,

2507
01:51:07,451 --> 01:51:10,750
it was like this super intelligent thing
that was sneaking up on you.

2508
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:16,200
It was like some super genius alien and 
the second one it was like this trailer 

2509
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,630
park aliens and there was a million of 
them and theY were all idiots.

2510
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:22,600
There were all idiots.
Like the first alien was brilliant,

2511
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:28,060
so clever and sneaky to go or a new 
where people were going and it would be 

2512
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:33,120
ambushed them.
It would hide and then the second movie 

2513
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,250
there were all dumb.
There were just jacking them.

2514
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,210
They would just run into a room and kill
four or five of them.

2515
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:41,820
The third one was my favorite.
Really would rock the rock was.

2516
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:44,320
He's a nice guy,
man.

2517
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:49,321
I met that dude once to show them like 
one of those a talk show type things 

2518
01:51:49,901 --> 01:51:52,570
back when he was doing that show.
He was cool as fuck.

2519
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,530
yeah,
he seems cool,

2520
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:55,790
very frIendly,
but he was a bad ass in that movie.

2521
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:58,120
He was the only person that ever seen in
that whole franchise.

2522
01:51:58,121 --> 01:51:59,940
Go toe to toe.
That's right.

2523
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:03,340
Go toe to toe.
Wasn't winona ryder in that one too?

2524
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:05,710
Was she in the fourth one?
How many of you?

2525
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:09,190
I know that one was.
He was in the third one,

2526
01:52:09,191 --> 01:52:09,850
right?
Am I right?

2527
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:12,610
I think so because that was the one she 
killed herself.

2528
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:14,990
She had the babies.
Had the baby.

2529
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:21,230
Yeah.
I'm just wanting to kill the baby and 

2530
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:22,100
that was the one that was the one where 
he was down there.

2531
01:52:22,101 --> 01:52:25,950
But the score up with the dude because 
he ran out of ammo was like,

2532
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,760
is that all you got?
Was like fighting them.

2533
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:28,900
Yeah,
that's right.

2534
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:31,480
So fucking g.
Yeah,

2535
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:34,440
that didn't end well though for him,
but you know,

2536
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,170
hey,
hey,

2537
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:38,560
we don't make movIes like that and we 
don't make it.

2538
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:41,110
But he is poppy like in a horror movie 
of.

2539
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:45,290
I wouldn't even call it a horror movie.
I was like more like a spy know throw.

2540
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:46,910
The first one was a horror movie.

2541
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:47,670
Yeah,
but did that,

2542
01:52:47,671 --> 01:52:49,610
that third by the third one?
It was just more like a.

2543
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:52,520
It didn't come off more.
It was more like action insight by.

2544
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:55,760
But that was the only time I've ever 
seen in that franchise,

2545
01:52:55,761 --> 01:52:58,270
if we dare called har,
where you know,

2546
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:04,120
you know,
the black character goes out in such a 

2547
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:04,120
way where it's like,
you know,

2548
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:04,240
fuck that.
And you know,

2549
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:05,900
going out,
swinging like tits,

2550
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:08,180
some shit like that.
Come on like an alien,

2551
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:10,560
like dude,
like come on joe rogan.

2552
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:13,310
You would not,
you would not score up with no alien.

2553
01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:14,780
Like yeah,
we do.

2554
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:17,500
Do you just like shit your pants?
Yeah,

2555
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,710
exactly.
Let it eat you.

2556
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:20,530
Exactly.
It's happening.

2557
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:24,620
So like if a puppy talk shit to you,
you're like,

2558
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:27,160
what?
That's what it's like,

2559
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:32,910
you know,
that's what the alien is life with a 

2560
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:32,910
person through pito.

2561
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:34,010
Yeah.
And then it became aliens vs predator.

2562
01:53:34,011 --> 01:53:36,250
It's like,
what the fuck is you to.

2563
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:41,240
It's a slow degradation from like one of
the greatest horror movies of all time.

2564
01:53:41,241 --> 01:53:45,500
I really scott masterpiece to like this 
preposterous.

2565
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:47,030
Just action,
fun film.

2566
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,680
I mean they're fun.
I didn't watch that though.

2567
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:50,870
I watched the alien versus one of them.
One of them,

2568
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:56,080
I remember there was more than 1000 of 
them I didn't know tournament every 

2569
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:59,480
year.
How many aliens vs predators know?

2570
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:00,830
If I had to guess,
let me guess.

2571
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:04,310
I want to say this.
Three or 4 million predators.

2572
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:06,290
Don't believe this.
I remember there was one.

2573
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,260
There's only to get the fuck out of 
here.

2574
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,410
I'm not buying that.
Maybe it was a tv show.

2575
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:13,430
No,
no.

2576
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:14,390
There was movies,
man.

2577
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:16,880
There's transformers,
transformers,

2578
01:54:16,881 --> 01:54:19,250
movies.
Where there three w four.

2579
01:54:19,251 --> 01:54:23,470
If you count the cartoon.
Three year four.

2580
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:29,450
You got the touch.
Isn't there a new one that's coming out 

2581
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:29,450
or something?
That's alien ware.

2582
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:30,370
That's the one that just came out.
That already came out.

2583
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,840
The marky mark one that's been in gone 
already?

2584
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,350
Yeah.
Not so good.

2585
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:37,550
Wait.
No man.

2586
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:39,050
You gotta bring back side of the boat?
Yeah,

2587
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:41,110
he's crazy.
But he knows how to fuckIng sell shit.

2588
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,960
Ass robots.
Formers are there.

2589
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,750
There's,
there's the original one piece.

2590
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,800
The new ones.
There's three.

2591
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:49,850
Okay.
All right.

2592
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:51,830
The one that just came out with mark 
wahlberg.

2593
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,480
That's the third one.
How many aliens?

2594
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:56,530
Racist predators.
Is it just too too?

2595
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:58,410
It looks like,
wow,

2596
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:01,070
I would have assumed there was more,
man.

2597
01:55:01,071 --> 01:55:01,970
I ain't even know.
I mean,

2598
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:07,270
what was the alien resident?
That was the one that was for dna.

2599
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:13,930
They somehow or another got her dna.
They cloned her and it was weird cause 

2600
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:17,920
it's happening back.

2601
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:20,870
And then there was the atheist movie,
which was weird as fuck too.

2602
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:22,430
I wonder if they're going to do another 
one.

2603
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:23,750
I think so.
Oh yeah.

2604
01:55:24,330 --> 01:55:26,600
Prometheans could have been.
I don't know man.

2605
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:27,770
It's hard.
Like we said,

2606
01:55:27,771 --> 01:55:29,780
like the idea of putting together a 
movie,

2607
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:32,280
just the idea of getting all those 
people together.

2608
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,940
I enjoY it.
I mean,

2609
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:37,110
it wasn't the perfect saifai movie.
It wasn't the original one,

2610
01:55:37,111 --> 01:55:40,160
but I enjoyed it.
I thought it was fun and I love the idea

2611
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:42,550
behind it.
The idea of like,

2612
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:45,730
that's he introduces his dna into the,
uh,

2613
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:50,731
the new virgin planet by taking some 
horrible poison that breaks them down 

2614
01:55:50,731 --> 01:55:53,820
and he dies,
falls into the water and then slowly but

2615
01:55:53,821 --> 01:55:57,900
surely a natural course of evolution 
grows out of his dna.

2616
01:55:57,901 --> 01:56:00,600
And that's how people are created.
That's fascinating to me.

2617
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:01,410
I mean,
it was,

2618
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,180
I mean,
I ain't never seen no shit like that.

2619
01:56:03,230 --> 01:56:04,830
So I,
I entertained it,

2620
01:56:04,831 --> 01:56:05,910
I enjoyed it.
Well,

2621
01:56:05,911 --> 01:56:10,911
I think that ridley scott is brilliant 
and I think he's probably been thinking 

2622
01:56:10,911 --> 01:56:13,090
about this for a long time before he 
created this and I don't know who,

2623
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:18,170
who wrote the screenplay,
but I would imagine all of them have 

2624
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:18,170
been thinking about this for a long 
time.

2625
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:22,851
Like if you were goiNg to like the right
way to introduce life into another 

2626
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:23,490
planet,
It'd be like just get a planet,

2627
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:27,600
doesn't have any life and you just 
inject some something,

2628
01:56:27,650 --> 01:56:32,650
you know,
some d and if it's a body especially 

2629
01:56:32,650 --> 01:56:35,571
that breaks down that bodies also got 
all sorts of bacteria and weird shit on 

2630
01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:39,771
it and that's going to come out when it 
dies and the bacteria starts eating his 

2631
01:56:39,771 --> 01:56:40,720
flesh and will they be able to transmit 
and,

2632
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:45,800
and,
and go to plants or other plant matter 

2633
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:45,800
that's on this planet.

2634
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,580
Is there some primitive life that it can
cling to?

2635
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:50,070
And,
and more with some sort of a virus.

2636
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:52,920
So like,
like diseases change people,

2637
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:58,190
you know,
diseases can probably change all sorts 

2638
01:56:58,190 --> 01:57:00,291
of other things.
Viruses and bacteria slowly mutate and 

2639
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:02,120
morph out of this one body that comes.
I mean how much,

2640
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:07,220
how far can a body go for body rotted if
there was a planet and that planet had 

2641
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:12,630
no biological life and he brought a body
and he just threw it there.

2642
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:18,770
All it has plant life.
Is it possible that that could somehow 

2643
01:57:18,770 --> 01:57:22,461
or another have enough fuel from eating 
that body and figuring out how to 

2644
01:57:22,461 --> 01:57:26,570
subside off plants,
that they would figure out some sort of 

2645
01:57:26,570 --> 01:57:29,721
a way to,
to become a viable life form on a 

2646
01:57:29,721 --> 01:57:32,941
planet.
Is that outside of the realm of 

2647
01:57:32,941 --> 01:57:33,600
possibility that stoner talk?
is it.

2648
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:34,810
I mean,
I mean,

2649
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:35,310
I don't know.

2650
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:38,710
I mean how is the biggest too?
I don't think it's too crazy even.

2651
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And then if some other dude landed on 
that same planet and then got sick from 

2652
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,780
this bacteria that was created by the 
body that was left behind before then he

2653
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:53,781
takes it back to his plan.
Everybody gets fucked up and they all 

2654
01:57:53,781 --> 01:57:56,271
die.
And then the planet where the bacteria 

2655
01:57:56,271 --> 01:57:56,790
was,
that bacteria is figured out how to form

2656
01:57:56,791 --> 01:58:01,290
a civilization and as wifi and they've 
spread out and become.

2657
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:04,440
People call themselves humans.
Yeah.

2658
01:58:04,441 --> 01:58:09,441
If you get too high you can think some 
really stupid shit and you can talk 

2659
01:58:09,441 --> 01:58:09,441
about it on a podcast like I just did.

2660
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:14,460
But everybody's fascinated by that 
subject of aliens.

2661
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:19,461
The,
the idea of aliens creating people like 

2662
01:58:19,461 --> 01:58:22,341
a movie like prometheus's.
Because I mean Like it's entertaining 

2663
01:58:22,501 --> 01:58:25,320
that kind of play with that idea,
you know,

2664
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:27,090
for a minute.
Yeah.

2665
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,580
It's entertaining to think that 
someone's gonna come visit to.

2666
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:32,490
I mean everybody loves aliens.
Yeah.

2667
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,530
I mean even given except predators,
if you live in an.

2668
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:40,560
I don't fuck With aliens at all.
If you lived on an island somewhere and 

2669
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,120
you're by yourself just there,
just you sitting around.

2670
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:45,560
Maybe you've got a dog,
you sit on this island,

2671
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:47,190
you got plenty of food,
but your board is fuck.

2672
01:58:47,191 --> 01:58:49,120
Just looking at waiting for someone to 
come.

2673
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:52,000
Someone.
anyone just let me see a light.

2674
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:57,360
Someone.
I think that's kind of what's going on 

2675
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:57,360
with us.
It's like,

2676
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,540
yeah,
we have each other,

2677
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:03,810
but the reality is we're on some weird 
round boat that's bobbing around in the 

2678
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:06,340
universe and we want someone to come 
visit us.

2679
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,230
What is this?
people like us are like,

2680
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,450
hey man,
most of these people suck.

2681
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:13,990
Can y'all come down here and fuck with 
us?

2682
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:19,000
Come take us where you teach us your 
ways,

2683
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:21,070
but,
but a lot of people don't suck.

2684
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:26,071
RIght?
I think the real thing is figuring out 

2685
01:59:26,071 --> 01:59:28,351
how to make less people suck and 
figuring out how to way to accept to 

2686
01:59:29,831 --> 01:59:31,680
accept people for things they've done 
wrong to.

2687
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:34,600
I just think is love man.
Lot more love.

2688
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:39,630
Do you need that in the world?
And it ways to do it without it being 

2689
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:39,670
signed and so silly,
you know?

2690
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:44,850
Um,
it's just something that people need to 

2691
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:44,850
do internally,
you know?

2692
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:46,990
Yeah.
It seems like an easy thing to say,

2693
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:48,010
right?
All you need is love.

2694
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:52,780
But it's like,
you know what it's like to be hopeful is

2695
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:53,640
a good thing.
You know?

2696
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:56,680
It's a super valuable to everything.

2697
01:59:56,950 --> 02:00:01,950
If you're not hopeful you got nothing.
You don't mean just your attitude 

2698
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:04,990
determines your success in a lot of your
endeavors in life,

2699
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,880
your attitude,
your approach that you take to it.

2700
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,160
It's whether or not sam harris fucked me
up,

2701
02:00:09,161 --> 02:00:09,970
man.
I had this dude,

2702
02:00:09,971 --> 02:00:14,971
sam harris on the podcast and he was 
talking about determinism and it's the 

2703
02:00:14,971 --> 02:00:19,921
idea that no one has free will and that 
basically everything about your 

2704
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:21,400
personality been formed by your 
interactions with your life experiences,

2705
02:00:21,401 --> 02:00:22,840
your dna,
your genetics,

2706
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:27,580
your neighborhood that you grew up in 
and that that's just no matter what,

2707
02:00:27,581 --> 02:00:30,630
you do,
an inescapable and that there is no free

2708
02:00:30,631 --> 02:00:32,680
will.
Like every decision you make is based on

2709
02:00:32,681 --> 02:00:34,360
all the shit that's happening to fate is
your fate.

2710
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:36,460
Well,
it's not even that you in your destiny.

2711
02:00:36,461 --> 02:00:41,461
I mean it's sort of been determined by 
your past experiences and the chemical 

2712
02:00:41,501 --> 02:00:46,501
interactions with those past experiences
and that you're on a path and that path 

2713
02:00:46,501 --> 02:00:47,170
is like almost undeniable.

2714
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:51,010
Which is a.
It's a weird sort of a semantic argument

2715
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:56,011
to its because man,
what's going on when you decide did not 

2716
02:00:56,011 --> 02:00:56,560
do coke anymore?
What's going on?

2717
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:57,760
When you decide,
you know what,

2718
02:00:57,761 --> 02:00:59,560
that's it,
I'm not smoking anymore,

2719
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:00,760
what,
what is going on?

2720
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,860
Because part of me wants to say,
hey,

2721
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:08,130
scott did some powerful shit.
He stepped up and he uses willpower and 

2722
02:01:08,681 --> 02:01:13,681
he uses intelligence to realize that he 
was on a bad path and that's an 

2723
02:01:13,681 --> 02:01:16,860
admirable thing to talk about because it
inspires people who might be on a bad 

2724
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:19,540
path themselves to kind of like catch 
your,

2725
02:01:19,570 --> 02:01:24,570
your momentum and you know,
and give them confidence and it gives 

2726
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:26,050
them confidence hearing you today with 
your shit together.

2727
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:28,510
All cool as fuck.
And think about you being,

2728
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:30,250
you know,
this guy who was doing coke all the time

2729
02:01:30,251 --> 02:01:32,280
and didn't like it.
That's um,

2730
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:36,010
I feel like there's gotta be something 
there that made you do that.

2731
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:38,920
I mean,
this idea of pure determinism is really.

2732
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,170
And I get it.
I totally get it.

2733
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:47,770
I just wonder how much of a personal 
choice is just what it,

2734
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:52,610
what is the force that makes a person 
decide to do the right thing?

2735
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:58,450
Well,
I think it goes back to what we were 

2736
02:01:58,450 --> 02:02:02,261
talking about before.
If you kind of start from one place 

2737
02:02:02,261 --> 02:02:03,800
where you know,
you gotta make your own way,

2738
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:06,250
it just kind of makes it a little bit,
you know,

2739
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:12,720
it just,
you savor it a little bit more and it 

2740
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:12,720
means more when you get it,
you know,

2741
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:14,570
because you had to really work in a 
cheap something,

2742
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:17,900
you know.
But my whole thing is when I was a kid,

2743
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:24,250
I was immediately looked at as someone 
who wasn't gonna amount to shit.

2744
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:27,610
So like,
you know,

2745
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:32,750
they started talking about starting from
the bottom.

2746
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:37,751
That's the bottom.
When motherfuckers look at you as a 

2747
02:02:37,751 --> 02:02:37,751
human being and be like,
oh he,

2748
02:02:37,751 --> 02:02:37,751
he's not going to amount to anything.

2749
02:02:37,751 --> 02:02:38,540
But they know that's what teachers,
you know,

2750
02:02:38,541 --> 02:02:39,620
that's what your peers,
you know,

2751
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:42,020
that's what certain people in the 
neighborhood may think of you,

2752
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:43,700
you know,
because of whatever,

2753
02:02:43,730 --> 02:02:45,170
whatever reason,
whatever.

2754
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:49,670
You know what I'm saying off just you 
just being in a certain environment,

2755
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:53,270
you know.
So you already had that against you,

2756
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,010
right?
And then you,

2757
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:58,850
you don't want to conform.
You don't want to be a statistic,

2758
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:04,600
you know.
And that's kind of like what my thing 

2759
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:04,600
was,
you know,

2760
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:07,510
I just didn't want to be another nigga 
out here last and shit and do you know 

2761
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:07,510
what I'm saying?
Like,

2762
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:08,420
and,
and that was,

2763
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:13,250
that was what I,
I made that choice at that time,

2764
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:13,990
you know,
and,

2765
02:03:13,991 --> 02:03:18,991
and I knew that me making that choice 
will help other people see that they can

2766
02:03:19,401 --> 02:03:21,890
make the choice because I was also 
inspired by,

2767
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:26,950
you know,
some people that were in my space that 

2768
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:26,950
weren't falling into other shit.

2769
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:28,040
It might've been like one of my homies 
that was like,

2770
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:31,490
you know,
in the sports and like,

2771
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:36,920
you know,
get good grades and play sports and 

2772
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:36,920
wasn't caught up in some shit.
And I was like,

2773
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:37,430
man,
this dude got some goals here.

2774
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:43,040
You know,
I might not be in the sports but this 

2775
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:44,450
dude right here has some type of goal 
cause he don't want to turn up like this

2776
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,780
because we got that option too.
Right.

2777
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:47,840
You know.
So it's like,

2778
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:49,530
it was just a lot of things I was able 
to.

2779
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:52,220
Then I was the youngest of four.
So,

2780
02:03:52,221 --> 02:03:57,221
you know,
I was able to just kind of be young and 

2781
02:03:57,221 --> 02:03:59,861
look at my older siblings and kind of 
learn what not to do and that's kind of 

2782
02:04:00,351 --> 02:04:05,351
why they use that whole,
like I'm your big brother phrase in my 

2783
02:04:05,351 --> 02:04:05,780
music because I feel like,
you know,

2784
02:04:05,781 --> 02:04:10,781
even when mistakes I've made that big 
brother is supposed to do like I'm 

2785
02:04:10,781 --> 02:04:12,380
supposed to to make some mistakes so you
can learn,

2786
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:17,470
you know,
and then those kids will learn and then 

2787
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:19,111
they'll make their own mistakes.
Then there'll be a bunch of other kids 

2788
02:04:19,111 --> 02:04:19,111
that are learn,
you know,

2789
02:04:19,111 --> 02:04:19,510
it's like a system,
you know it.

2790
02:04:19,930 --> 02:04:21,890
And I kinda like,
you know,

2791
02:04:21,891 --> 02:04:23,930
I liked that I'm that person,
you know,

2792
02:04:23,931 --> 02:04:26,720
I like to take that,
that whole big brother thing too,

2793
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:27,410
that,
you know,

2794
02:04:27,411 --> 02:04:32,411
to the full extent into the music.
But I really believed that I had the 

2795
02:04:32,411 --> 02:04:36,731
odds against me in such a way.
And I also just felt like everybody 

2796
02:04:36,891 --> 02:04:38,220
thought I was a loser from

2797
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:42,090
day one.
That was tired of feeling like that.

2798
02:04:42,091 --> 02:04:43,920
I was tired of people looking at me in 
that way.

2799
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:48,480
And I want it to finally find whatever 
it was that was my own,

2800
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,520
my calling to prove that,
you know,

2801
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:53,850
because I tried everything else.
Do you think that in some ways,

2802
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:58,880
like coming from a troubled background 
is like almost a gift because it gives 

2803
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:01,620
you that burning fire or do you think 
it's like a double edge sword because it

2804
02:05:01,621 --> 02:05:06,621
gives you that gift,
but it also gives you like this whole 

2805
02:05:06,621 --> 02:05:06,930
that sometimes is difficult to keep 
filled.

2806
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:09,270
Um,
do you know what I'm saying?

2807
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:10,470
Oh no,
I see what you're saying.

2808
02:05:10,471 --> 02:05:13,350
But it's hard to say because everybody's
circumstance is different.

2809
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:14,640
You know,
like,

2810
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:18,260
it could be somebody who came from money
that's still got the same like,

2811
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:23,930
you know,
dna and teachings that my mom gave me 

2812
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:24,300
because they just have really good 
parents except they came from money,

2813
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,860
like it don't really matter.

2814
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:30,860
You know what I'm saying?
And it could still be drugs in the 

2815
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:33,471
suburbs.
Niggas still be all these things that 

2816
02:05:33,471 --> 02:05:33,471
one can get caught up in,
in the suburbs,

2817
02:05:33,471 --> 02:05:34,260
you know,
anywhere else.

2818
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:35,770
So like,
I,

2819
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:37,140
I,
it's hard to say,

2820
02:05:37,390 --> 02:05:39,990
you know,
I just had and this,

2821
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:41,610
and another thing I was talking to 
somebody about,

2822
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:46,740
you know,
because know I was raised,

2823
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:51,770
when I think of strength,
I think of a woman I was raised by my 

2824
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:51,770
mom,
you know,

2825
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:54,200
and that is something that I,
you know,

2826
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:59,270
she's someone I always will look up to 
how she just sacrificed everything and 

2827
02:05:59,270 --> 02:05:59,270
took care of us,
you know,

2828
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:04,041
on a teacher's salary.
And that for me it's like I got that 

2829
02:06:04,041 --> 02:06:08,060
role model.
Like somebody who like could have just 

2830
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:08,060
been like,
damn,

2831
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:12,321
I got four kids,
I need to be chasing the man and trying 

2832
02:06:12,321 --> 02:06:12,321
to find some man to come take care of 
us.

2833
02:06:12,321 --> 02:06:13,860
It was more like,
you know,

2834
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:16,110
I got married,
it didn't work out.

2835
02:06:16,111 --> 02:06:18,330
Now I just need to figure it out for my 
kids.

2836
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:21,300
You know,
like I just had that,

2837
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,050
you know,
and,

2838
02:06:22,051 --> 02:06:26,950
and I just kind of always looked up to 
my mom in that way and you know,

2839
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,110
I wanted to,
I didn't,

2840
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:33,200
I didn't want to be a failure to her.
I wanted to show her that I could be 

2841
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:37,020
great and be as strong as she was,
you know?

2842
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:38,120
That's beautiful,
man.

2843
02:06:38,121 --> 02:06:39,660
Yeah,
it's really a beautiful thing to say.

2844
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,190
That's a cool story,
man.

2845
02:06:41,191 --> 02:06:42,620
I love that.
I,

2846
02:06:42,770 --> 02:06:44,190
I just feel like,
um,

2847
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:49,730
there's a,
a certain amount of energy that people 

2848
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,280
get from wanting to prove other folks 
wrong.

2849
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:50,910
Yeah,
no,

2850
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:51,900
for sure.
For sure.

2851
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:53,070
And uh,
it can,

2852
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:56,100
it can help you in some ways.
It can certainly help you,

2853
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:59,610
but I think sometimes even like when 
you're talking about the benefits,

2854
02:06:59,611 --> 02:07:02,090
you had a cocaine,
like there's benefits to it.

2855
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:07,130
It's like you could say things and do 
things that ordinarily wouldn't be able 

2856
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:07,130
to do.
Well,

2857
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:09,960
this the motivation of,
of like proving people wrong.

2858
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:11,640
I'll show you,
you know,

2859
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,400
you said I wasn't gonna be shit.
I'll show you.

2860
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:18,700
Like you get to a certain point in time 
that could kind of play against you to 

2861
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:18,700
right.
Yes.

2862
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:21,240
It could backfire because then it 
becomes it for me,

2863
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:27,180
it becomes like an.
And I definitely did my last album.

2864
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:32,181
I did my arm before last with that,
an angry I'll show you,

2865
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:35,250
like full,
like villainous energy,

2866
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:38,110
you know,
and I was able to make some really great

2867
02:07:38,111 --> 02:07:40,790
records,
but it was the most aggressive music I'd

2868
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:45,810
ever made and some of it was the most 
aggressive and a lot of levels,

2869
02:07:45,911 --> 02:07:47,660
not even in the meanwhile,
but just like,

2870
02:07:47,690 --> 02:07:51,510
you know,
just the music itself and that benefited

2871
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:52,350
the,
the,

2872
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,970
you know,
what I set out to do,

2873
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:57,040
it all benefited,
you know.

2874
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,410
BuT um,
I didn't,

2875
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:04,000
it wasn't the normal way I went about 
making an album so it was weird,

2876
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,650
you know,
and,

2877
02:08:04,651 --> 02:08:09,651
and it was something that I took a step 
back with afterwards and then drop the 

2878
02:08:09,651 --> 02:08:09,651
second album was like,
all right,

2879
02:08:09,651 --> 02:08:10,600
this one's not.
So um,

2880
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:13,690
I don't really feel like I'm,
I'm like going,

2881
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:15,300
you know,
up against the masters,

2882
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,900
like I really have something to prove 
here.

2883
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:22,090
This is more just like about like just 
being at some type of peace,

2884
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:27,270
you know,
and just having things sorted out once 

2885
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:27,270
all the madness is all done and just 
kinda dislike.

2886
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:28,320
Now it's just like,
right,

2887
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:29,460
right.
You know,

2888
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:34,470
and that's why I did indicat another 
satellite flight because I feel like in 

2889
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:36,070
the cup was me just figuring out how to 
produce,

2890
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:41,520
you know,
and make records and then satellite 

2891
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:43,351
fight was me having it mastered and 
finally putting together something that 

2892
02:08:43,351 --> 02:08:44,450
was just like fine tuned,
you know,

2893
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:49,890
but to,
in a different structure where I have 

2894
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:49,890
like some instrumentals and then you 
know,

2895
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:54,200
you know,
the kind of like interludes and then 

2896
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,860
records that just completely formatted 
in different ways.

2897
02:08:57,370 --> 02:09:00,640
Maybe not the three verse two hook 
formula,

2898
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:03,730
maybe just one long verse in one outro 
and you know,

2899
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:08,760
maybe know who get all,
maybe no drums for the first minute and 

2900
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:08,760
30 seconds,
but there's like wraps,

2901
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:11,470
you know,
just experiment and then try and things,

2902
02:09:11,471 --> 02:09:13,510
you know,
not that I had that expertise.

2903
02:09:13,511 --> 02:09:14,770
We're creating a record,
you know.

2904
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:16,180
Did you ever,
um,

2905
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:20,710
listened to the brand new heavies?
I know some records here,

2906
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:24,130
the brand new heavies did this rap thing
where there,

2907
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:26,080
god was trying to remember the name of 
it.

2908
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,640
Um,
there's a,

2909
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:31,450
but it was along those lines like very 
experimental.

2910
02:09:31,451 --> 02:09:33,550
And this is like back in the early 
nineties,

2911
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:38,970
they did like kool g rap did one of them
and it did it like some like actual 

2912
02:09:40,481 --> 02:09:44,140
music behind it.
It was pretty interesting stuff.

2913
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:46,090
But I remember that and I remember 
thinking like,

2914
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:49,510
man,
like why don't more people do weird shit

2915
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:50,110
with music.

2916
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:52,600
Like how many people are thinking the 
way you're thinking?

2917
02:09:52,601 --> 02:09:53,680
Like saying like,
okay,

2918
02:09:53,681 --> 02:09:58,681
how about we just do no drums for like 
the first minute and a half and then 

2919
02:09:58,681 --> 02:09:59,930
just start rapping and then the drums 
kick it.

2920
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:02,760
Like these kinds of things where you 
just like coming up with a,

2921
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:06,010
like just a different approach.
Slightly different entry.

2922
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:11,160
I think people are just a little scared 
that they'll lose the audience's 

2923
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:14,050
attention,
which is the very real fear.

2924
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:14,980
It's,
I get it,

2925
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:18,200
you know,
it also goes back to what I was saying,

2926
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,460
I've just been blessed with a family 
that like,

2927
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:23,680
you know,
it's into what I'm doing no matter what,

2928
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:24,560
you know,
uh,

2929
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:27,100
and that's,
that's just dope,

2930
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,390
you know.
But the average artist,

2931
02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:29,950
no,
theY can't just experiment.

2932
02:10:29,951 --> 02:10:32,110
And this fear where they might not sell 
records.

2933
02:10:32,111 --> 02:10:34,340
And then that's bad for business and 
this is a business,

2934
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:35,770
you know,
um,

2935
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:37,190
so,
you know,

2936
02:10:37,290 --> 02:10:38,980
um,
it's,

2937
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:41,270
it's understood why most guys don't 
really do it,

2938
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:43,070
you know,
I would like to see people do it.

2939
02:10:43,071 --> 02:10:45,020
I feel like there's,
that's not an excuse.

2940
02:10:45,021 --> 02:10:50,021
I feel like there's a way where people 
can be a little bit more creative and 

2941
02:10:50,021 --> 02:10:50,870
push the envelope a lot more with the 
music,

2942
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:52,680
uh,
where it fits in,

2943
02:10:52,681 --> 02:10:53,430
in a,
in a,

2944
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:56,360
in a way that makes sense.
And it's true to their,

2945
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,170
their art.
Um,

2946
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:00,440
in their formula.
I feel like,

2947
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:05,480
yeah,
there's always a way to try something 

2948
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:07,010
new and be innovative and bring 
something different to the table

2949
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:12,060
if anybody wants to check out that.
That brand new heavies that I was 

2950
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:12,580
talking about,
it's called heavy rhyme experience.

2951
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,040
Uh,
and it was the brand new heavies.

2952
02:11:15,041 --> 02:11:17,980
It was 92 way back in the day when I 
was,

2953
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:22,170
I was living in New York and my friend,
goddammit,

2954
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:23,980
trying to remember his name,
stand up,

2955
02:11:23,981 --> 02:11:25,390
comedian told me about them.
He goes,

2956
02:11:25,391 --> 02:11:27,460
you gotta listen to this shit.
These guys are doing some weird stuff.

2957
02:11:28,090 --> 02:11:31,860
They did a duel with kool g rap.
They did a,

2958
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:36,490
one of them with a gang.
Starr was pretty bad ass that,

2959
02:11:36,491 --> 02:11:40,570
a bunch of different collaborations.
So like jazz singers was like,

2960
02:11:40,571 --> 02:11:41,830
rap,
like serious,

2961
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:46,660
like best of the class back then.
Hardcore rappers rapping over their,

2962
02:11:46,661 --> 02:11:48,220
uh,
their ride or their music.

2963
02:11:48,221 --> 02:11:49,240
It was pretty cool.
My law.

2964
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:54,100
Yeah,
but your point about having the fan base

2965
02:11:54,101 --> 02:11:57,190
that allows you to fuck around and 
practice and take chances.

2966
02:11:57,430 --> 02:11:58,630
That is huge,
isn't it?

2967
02:11:58,631 --> 02:12:01,470
Like this ability that you know,
they,

2968
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:05,490
they like you as a person as well as 
like your music so that.

2969
02:12:05,491 --> 02:12:07,180
And they want,
they want to see where you go with it.

2970
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:08,800
You're always going to do your best.

2971
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:11,130
No,
it comes from a pure place to know.

2972
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:14,840
I'm like,
they know me as the top table,

2973
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:19,920
say no,
I'm just trying to make some cool shit 

2974
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,661
that they can connect with and that's 
the extent every time it doesn't go 

2975
02:12:21,661 --> 02:12:23,310
beyond that and the minute it tries to 
just starts to get frustrating,

2976
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:26,440
like start thinking about a radio record
to please somebody at the label.

2977
02:12:26,441 --> 02:12:31,441
Then it gets frustrating.
If I started thinking about this and 

2978
02:12:31,441 --> 02:12:33,601
that,
this and it gets frustrating if I keep 

2979
02:12:33,601 --> 02:12:33,601
it just based on like,
amen,

2980
02:12:33,601 --> 02:12:37,980
this sounds gnarly and let's make sure 
we not too trippy and it's make sure 

2981
02:12:37,991 --> 02:12:40,450
it's not to this and not do that.
But uh,

2982
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:43,900
effortless combination of everything all
at once,

2983
02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:44,880
you know,
and,

2984
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:48,700
and,
and that's really what these past couple

2985
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:53,700
of years for me have been like just 
mastering that technique is a producer 

2986
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:56,460
and um,
you know,

2987
02:12:57,190 --> 02:13:01,120
really,
really just going all out creatively and

2988
02:13:01,121 --> 02:13:06,121
just trying new things because I also 
internally don't feel like I have 

2989
02:13:06,121 --> 02:13:07,530
anything else to prove,
um,

2990
02:13:07,870 --> 02:13:08,740
as a musician.

2991
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:12,520
But I,
I have that itch,

2992
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:14,050
you know,
like I need to create.

2993
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,080
I feel like that's like working out for 
me.

2994
02:13:18,490 --> 02:13:22,390
It's like doing reps and stand mentally 
fit,

2995
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:23,930
creatively fit,
you know?

2996
02:13:23,931 --> 02:13:26,650
Um,
so when it comes time to do an album,

2997
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:29,860
I got some new powers I've acquired in 
the past year,

2998
02:13:29,861 --> 02:13:30,580
just like,
you know,

2999
02:13:30,581 --> 02:13:34,550
from just dicking around in the studio 
for a couple of months is going everyday

3000
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:37,080
making beats.
Whether I'm in the studio for five hours

3001
02:13:37,081 --> 02:13:39,540
or two hours,
I'm making something I'm making at least

3002
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:44,400
like on average I make about in the 
studio,

3003
02:13:44,401 --> 02:13:47,790
I'm making at least two to four beat 
today.

3004
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:50,550
And when I say beats,
I'm talking about completed,

3005
02:13:51,370 --> 02:13:56,370
sequenced instrumentals that I could 
make records are so,

3006
02:13:56,551 --> 02:14:01,551
like not just some sit.
I started a little bit and then it's 

3007
02:14:01,551 --> 02:14:01,551
kind of cool and I'll get back to it 
later.

3008
02:14:01,551 --> 02:14:03,870
I have probably like a baker's dozen of 
those in one session,

3009
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:06,600
but I'll have like four that are 
officially.

3010
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:10,020
Like all these jams are dope.
I'm going to sit and live with these and

3011
02:14:10,021 --> 02:14:13,320
see what comes up.
So when you sit down to write music,

3012
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:18,350
do you,
do you sit down and do you have an idea 

3013
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:18,350
in your head or do you just let it come 
to you while you're there?

3014
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:20,590
Like how do you know how to start?
Um,

3015
02:14:21,670 --> 02:14:24,710
it,
it comes different every time.

3016
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:25,780
It doesn't,
um,

3017
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:31,520
it depends.
It can be a baseline that I'm thinking 

3018
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,641
of that inspires me or it could be me 
not have anything in my mind.

3019
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:39,240
And just going through the sounds a or 
it could be like,

3020
02:14:39,470 --> 02:14:43,080
you know,
a rhythm I heard or you know,

3021
02:14:43,081 --> 02:14:45,180
anything,
it could be a movie I'm watching,

3022
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,210
I like to,
you know,

3023
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:48,630
produce while I'm watching movies with 
the sound off,

3024
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:50,640
um,
in,

3025
02:14:50,641 --> 02:14:52,560
that kind of helps me with scoring,
you know,

3026
02:14:52,561 --> 02:14:54,220
when I get into the scoring and you 
know,

3027
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:56,040
doing that as my next step.

3028
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:59,910
I want to get more into scoring movies 
and sound design.

3029
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:02,550
Um,
but it's all,

3030
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:07,580
for me,
it's all just experimentation and just 

3031
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:09,300
seeing what happens and you know,
it's not any pressure.

3032
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:14,390
And when you hear a beat,
like when you're making a beat and 

3033
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:14,390
you're creating it,
you hearing lyrics.

3034
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:15,740
Are you hearing?
Yeah,

3035
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:19,710
I'm hearing.
I mean here's,

3036
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:21,090
you know,
when I,

3037
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:24,690
when I'm hearing something I hear a 
completed right?

3038
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:30,530
So when I'm starting to record and I 
feel like I got some of my or I saw 

3039
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:33,490
like,
I feel like in this back to what you 

3040
02:15:33,490 --> 02:15:33,490
were talking about because you know,
I feel like,

3041
02:15:33,490 --> 02:15:34,110
you know,
time doesn't really exist.

3042
02:15:34,111 --> 02:15:37,650
So an hour from now it's happening right
now.

3043
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:40,470
Right.
So there's songs that are created that I

3044
02:15:40,471 --> 02:15:45,471
haven't made yet,
so when I'm in the studio I feel like I 

3045
02:15:45,471 --> 02:15:48,531
have this small like peek into this 
other world and this window that I can 

3046
02:15:48,661 --> 02:15:53,661
hear the song,
but it's my job in the present to find 

3047
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:55,120
the pieces to make it so.

3048
02:15:55,560 --> 02:16:00,560
And sometimes it might come out exactly 
like what I'm hearing and sometimes it 

3049
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:00,720
might not,
but it's never,

3050
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:05,890
it's never really spot on.
You're not just here glimmers of what 

3051
02:16:05,890 --> 02:16:09,830
the song completed sounds like until 
it's completed and then it's just 

3052
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:12,711
everything's perfect.
But that's how I can sit there and 

3053
02:16:12,711 --> 02:16:12,711
listen to a mix and be like,
something's off.

3054
02:16:12,711 --> 02:16:13,970
Because in my completed version,
you know,

3055
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:17,460
it's like a coloring book.
Every record starts off in one way,

3056
02:16:17,461 --> 02:16:22,461
just blank and I'm just filling in all 
the colors and then there's one color 

3057
02:16:22,461 --> 02:16:22,461
still missing.
You know,

3058
02:16:22,461 --> 02:16:24,630
that's what's happening in the final,
in the ninth end.

3059
02:16:24,631 --> 02:16:25,890
And you know,
when we're mixing the album,

3060
02:16:25,891 --> 02:16:28,950
I mean there's still some colors that 
just not in there yet.

3061
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:29,980
And then I'm going through

3062
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,980
sounds and I find the colors and 
everything's full and I'm cool or I 

3063
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,740
might not find the exact color,
but some close enough I'm fine.

3064
02:16:36,110 --> 02:16:41,110
And like that's literally where it's at,
where you have to make the executive 

3065
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,110
decision,
like,

3066
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:45,361
all right,
I'm done with this or I'll be sitting 

3067
02:16:45,361 --> 02:16:46,690
for another two weeks trying to sit with
this mix because I'm really anal about 

3068
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:47,410
it and if I don't just back away and let
it be,

3069
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,460
you know,
we'll never hear any news.

3070
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:52,210
That's a fascinating insight into the 
creation of music.

3071
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:53,440
So I don't,
um,

3072
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:56,490
I don't know anYbody that does that 
like,

3073
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:01,560
well where they could tell me about the 
entire process from the beginning to 

3074
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:01,560
end.
So it's interesting to get a window into

3075
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:03,970
that world because I always wondered,
I always wondered,

3076
02:17:03,971 --> 02:17:06,640
like,
I know jj never writes his lyrics down.

3077
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:07,960
It keeps them all in his head.

3078
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:10,510
Do you do that or do you actually write 
them down somewhere?

3079
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:13,900
I'm not.
Sometimes I'm sometimes.

3080
02:17:14,070 --> 02:17:16,510
I mean,
a lot of hooks are in my head,

3081
02:17:17,050 --> 02:17:22,050
but I need to write certain things down 
to make sure I'm making sense.

3082
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:26,320
I used to do a lot of my earlier stuff 
just off the dome,

3083
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:27,640
just freestyle and shit,
you know?

3084
02:17:27,641 --> 02:17:30,160
And sometimes that works good with 
melodies.

3085
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:35,161
I do that a lot.
I'll go in there and just flows and try 

3086
02:17:35,161 --> 02:17:38,140
different things like that and melodies.
But it's really just a combination.

3087
02:17:38,141 --> 02:17:39,810
It's never the psych,
you know,

3088
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:43,730
always like writing off the dome,
like some ballots out.

3089
02:17:43,731 --> 02:17:45,130
Right?
Completely off the dome.

3090
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:47,290
You know,
I don't need paper for a ballot,

3091
02:17:47,291 --> 02:17:50,160
but like turn off the dome.
Yeah,

3092
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:52,090
that's a great term.
I'm gonna use that from now on.

3093
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:57,270
Whenever there's a joke that I have this
written down anywhere it's going to be 

3094
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:57,270
offered dome that that was the end.

3095
02:17:57,270 --> 02:18:00,250
I feel like that it kinda like,
you know,

3096
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:02,080
gets people to understand that this is 
something,

3097
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:05,080
this,
this spontaneousness of it,

3098
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:10,140
you know.
Is that some turn that rappers use all 

3099
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:10,140
the time or is that your term off the 
dome?

3100
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:12,440
Is that yours?
Yours.

3101
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:17,800
I like to say I know the guy came up off
the dome.

3102
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:22,390
It's a very popular phrase amongst it 
all came out of kid company.

3103
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:24,920
I'll take it.
They get.

3104
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:28,060
I'll start spreading that rumor.
You're essentially you're open,

3105
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:29,740
whatever.
Which way ever comes.

3106
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:34,741
You just show up,
you show up and you put in the work you 

3107
02:18:34,741 --> 02:18:34,741
put in the work creating to be to put in
the work,

3108
02:18:34,741 --> 02:18:35,410
come up,
coming up with lyrics,

3109
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:40,650
whatever way it comes up,
whether it comes up all in your head 

3110
02:18:40,650 --> 02:18:42,860
when it comes up,
writing it down on paper and the 

3111
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:44,971
sessions are really me and my engineer 
in and occasionally I have like my 

3112
02:18:45,701 --> 02:18:50,701
brother from another mother,
dr jean is coming through who was in a 

3113
02:18:50,701 --> 02:18:52,540
band that I came up with a couple of 
years ago that you know,

3114
02:18:52,650 --> 02:18:57,650
we kind of just put together because we 
wanted to try something outside of the 

3115
02:18:57,650 --> 02:18:57,650
world.

3116
02:18:57,650 --> 02:18:58,240
We were already making music in,
you know,

3117
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:01,390
it's,
this sessions are really small.

3118
02:19:01,391 --> 02:19:06,391
It's not like I got 20 dudes in there.
They're kind of sad sessions were really

3119
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:08,650
sad and probably not sad.
Why?

3120
02:19:08,660 --> 02:19:11,870
Always wondering,
I feel bad for me like,

3121
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:15,180
oh got nobody in town.
But then,

3122
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:17,500
but then like,
you know,

3123
02:19:17,501 --> 02:19:19,630
like I'm in there like a mad scientist.
Like,

3124
02:19:19,631 --> 02:19:20,590
you know,
I'm inventing,

3125
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:21,850
it's not like,
you know,

3126
02:19:21,851 --> 02:19:24,710
an inventor don't get 20 motherfuckers 
in his lab.

3127
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:26,590
Why he invented shit niggas is still is 
shit.

3128
02:19:26,710 --> 02:19:27,480
or they'll,
you know,

3129
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,930
rack focus and you know,
distract him.

3130
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:35,150
He got.
I find that when you have your friends 

3131
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:35,150
in the studio,
you got,

3132
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:35,150
you know,
a couple guys on worldstar,

3133
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:39,860
couple of guys on twitter,
a couple of guys over here and 

3134
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:39,860
everybody's talking about what's going 
on over here and what's going on in here

3135
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:40,490
and you're trying to write this song.

3136
02:19:40,490 --> 02:19:41,330
You get distracted.
You like,

3137
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:43,050
what happened all hell naw,
that's funny.

3138
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:44,140
Bunny,
next to you know,

3139
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:46,700
it's two hours have gone by.
You still working on this record,

3140
02:19:47,210 --> 02:19:52,210
you had some last.
But when you came to the studio for is 

3141
02:19:52,210 --> 02:19:52,210
not done yet.
Right?

3142
02:19:52,210 --> 02:19:56,350
You know,
and there's money being spent and it's 

3143
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:56,350
time.
Time is of the essence.

3144
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:56,870
This is what we hustled and worked hard 
for.

3145
02:19:57,530 --> 02:19:58,610
You know?
And I have to,

3146
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:00,370
I had to remind myself is like,
man,

3147
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:03,590
this has turned into a fucking party.
Like we're here for work.

3148
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:07,070
So I also have this like really gnarly 
work ethic.

3149
02:20:07,071 --> 02:20:09,080
Like,
cause I've been working since I was 15.

3150
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:12,830
My first job was wendy's.
I remember why I wanted to work.

3151
02:20:12,831 --> 02:20:17,831
It was because I wanted my own shit.
I was tired of asking my mom for stuff 

3152
02:20:17,831 --> 02:20:21,370
and also didn't think it was fair to ask
my mom for stuff because I know we 

3153
02:20:21,370 --> 02:20:21,410
didn't have much.

3154
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:26,600
So you know,
I just at work for me is always like one

3155
02:20:26,601 --> 02:20:28,260
of those things that's very important.
Yeah.

3156
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:31,490
But like there was also some jobs that I
didn't fucking take seriously,

3157
02:20:31,491 --> 02:20:33,320
like american apparel,
you know,

3158
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:36,320
where I was coming in late and I didn't 
give a shit.

3159
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:41,350
And then like when my boss fired me,
like he took me to this office and kind 

3160
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:41,470
of told me.
And,

3161
02:20:41,890 --> 02:20:43,430
and when he said he's like,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

3162
02:20:43,431 --> 02:20:43,850
I was like,
yeah,

3163
02:20:44,330 --> 02:20:45,010
I figured that,
you know,

3164
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,140
because I didn't give a fuck,
you know,

3165
02:20:47,150 --> 02:20:48,950
it was like,
now I can go to the studio.

3166
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:54,140
Well it's probably work and like work on
my craft and then maybe find a better 

3167
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:54,710
paying job.
You know,

3168
02:20:54,711 --> 02:20:57,440
it doesn't have me in the fucking 
basement of some buiLding,

3169
02:20:57,441 --> 02:20:59,300
you know,
sweating my ass off for clothes.

3170
02:20:59,390 --> 02:21:01,610
Everybody says you should always do your
best at every job you do.

3171
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:04,970
A champion in life as a champion and 
everything they do.

3172
02:21:04,971 --> 02:21:07,330
So if you're going to mop floors,
do your best to my peers,

3173
02:21:07,390 --> 02:21:10,490
my the fuck out of floors.
That's great on paper.

3174
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,590
But the reality is when you're a young 
man,

3175
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:14,720
it's sometimes it's good to fuck off at 
something.

3176
02:21:14,721 --> 02:21:16,610
So you know,
you don't ever want to do that again.

3177
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:19,400
They fire you and then you learn and 
there's some,

3178
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:21,560
there's some value in that.
It's unfortunate,

3179
02:21:21,561 --> 02:21:26,561
but we don't all learn the best way.
Sometimes we got to get fired from 

3180
02:21:26,561 --> 02:21:30,371
american apparel.
At least I didn't get fired for like 

3181
02:21:30,371 --> 02:21:33,900
stealing something.
I got fired for being a shitty 

3182
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:36,251
landscaper,
scalp and people's lawns that fuck 

3183
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:41,340
somebody's emotions and that would hurt 
my feelings if somebody just was like 

3184
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:41,660
the word around town that I've been,
you know,

3185
02:21:41,661 --> 02:21:43,610
my main bread and butter I've been 
doing,

3186
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,650
investing my life in shitty yet.

3187
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:52,380
Yeah.
I wasn't invested in being atlanta 

3188
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:52,970
mayor.
Not toddler boy landscaper.

3189
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:53,960
Yeah,
I know.

3190
02:21:53,961 --> 02:21:54,800
I know what you're saying,
man.

3191
02:21:54,950 --> 02:21:59,950
It says there's a completely different 
thing when you're creating your own 

3192
02:21:59,950 --> 02:22:01,190
stuff when you're working for yourself,
then it's like a focus,

3193
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:04,130
like an obsession almost type focused.
Like the laser beam.

3194
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:06,230
I love that term.
The lab too.

3195
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:08,240
That's one of my favorite terms for the 
rap,

3196
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:10,970
the rap world.
They love talking about being the lab,

3197
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:14,360
creating material who are like an 
inventor scientist,

3198
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:15,710
you know,
and it's,

3199
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:20,980
it's kinda like I treated and every 
sense of the word in every sense of 

3200
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:21,230
that,
that,

3201
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:22,370
that,
that,

3202
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:23,650
that term.
I asked him,

3203
02:22:23,651 --> 02:22:26,430
no lab.
It's like where I'm working,

3204
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:31,550
it's working and almost don't like 
playing around and in the studio like 

3205
02:22:31,550 --> 02:22:33,990
that,
like because it is a place for work,

3206
02:22:33,991 --> 02:22:36,120
it is an office,
especially if you're trying to write,

3207
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:38,340
if you're trying to write things there 
too as well.

3208
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:43,340
He tried to write lyrics and dudes are 
all jumping around and not even know 

3209
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:45,030
what if I'm not even just me sitting 
there and I might not have an idea yet.

3210
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:47,430
even if I might just eating silence.
Right,

3211
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:47,970
right,
right.

3212
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:50,160
I might just need fucking silence for a 
little bit.

3213
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:50,980
Yeah,
I don't,

3214
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,080
I've never been to any sort of a 
recording studio where anybody was doing

3215
02:22:55,081 --> 02:23:00,081
anything like serious like that.
But I would imagine it's very difficult 

3216
02:23:00,081 --> 02:23:00,570
to avoid the party.
It's like,

3217
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:05,571
hey,
we're in studio and guys come to visit 

3218
02:23:05,571 --> 02:23:05,571
you come on by,
come to visit.

3219
02:23:05,571 --> 02:23:09,021
We did that.
So it's like I did that now I've been 

3220
02:23:09,031 --> 02:23:14,031
doing that since like 22,
23 going to studios and having those 

3221
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:19,071
moments with the buttons because in the 
beginning it's like you want your boys 

3222
02:23:19,071 --> 02:23:22,251
around.
So I kind of got that out of my system 

3223
02:23:22,251 --> 02:23:22,251
and now it's like,
all right,

3224
02:23:22,251 --> 02:23:23,730
30 year old scott goes with studio by 
himself.

3225
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:25,710
He's got his book bag,
he's in there for maybe five,

3226
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:28,200
six hours and then he goes home.
That's smart.

3227
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:30,780
You know what I'm saying?
And then friday night,

3228
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,720
you know like in,
in,

3229
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:36,330
in bed by like 11,
1130 kapow fucks her.

3230
02:23:37,610 --> 02:23:38,670
That's beautiful.
Yeah,

3231
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:39,320
yeah,
yeah.

3232
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:41,220
No may man.
That's how you get shit done.

3233
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:46,280
That is how you get shit done.
I'm just cycle those music videos 

3234
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:46,830
though.
When they show the recording studio,

3235
02:23:46,831 --> 02:23:51,831
it's always a giant table.
There's like all those little switches 

3236
02:23:51,831 --> 02:23:51,831
that nobody understands.
Maybe you mixing board.

3237
02:23:51,831 --> 02:23:54,950
Everybody's everybody standing in front 
of all the switches and then everybody's

3238
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,580
partying.
Everybody's in the background,

3239
02:23:56,581 --> 02:24:01,581
having a good time.
But that could also be when the album's 

3240
02:24:01,581 --> 02:24:01,581
done and they're celebrating it because 
that's what also happens.

3241
02:24:01,581 --> 02:24:06,500
like when I'm done with the say that's a
finished maybe eight songs and I feel 

3242
02:24:06,721 --> 02:24:10,110
like I've got the album like and I just 
need maybe a couple more jams.

3243
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:12,600
You start inviting people to come here.
What you got,

3244
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:16,940
so you have those moments too,
so you might see that happen and,

3245
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:21,950
but,
but there's a year and a half of just 

3246
02:24:21,950 --> 02:24:22,620
studio by myself before that happens,
you know,

3247
02:24:22,621 --> 02:24:27,621
like I don't really.
And maybe a case that had one or two 

3248
02:24:27,621 --> 02:24:27,621
friends,
you know,

3249
02:24:27,621 --> 02:24:28,390
maybe some one of my director friends 
or,

3250
02:24:28,391 --> 02:24:29,910
or um,
my fellow actors.

3251
02:24:29,911 --> 02:24:33,960
So I just kinda want who have never 
really got a chance to be in the studio,

3252
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:36,570
come by and just see,
get to experience,

3253
02:24:36,571 --> 02:24:41,571
but they're not in.
They're distracted me there just 

3254
02:24:41,571 --> 02:24:41,780
watching and paying attention and want 
to just be a fly on the wall,

3255
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:43,350
see how it works.
Yeah.

3256
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:46,310
Well a lot of people are really curious 
about it because it's a,

3257
02:24:46,311 --> 02:24:51,311
it's almost a sort of a mysterious type 
of creativity if people aren't involved 

3258
02:24:51,331 --> 02:24:53,220
in.
Especially the creating of music is such

3259
02:24:53,221 --> 02:24:55,400
a cultural,
uh,

3260
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,460
it's such a cultural influence.
So sort of powerful Influence like music

3261
02:24:59,461 --> 02:25:01,430
has.
It inspires people.

3262
02:25:01,431 --> 02:25:03,660
Like when you listening to music at the 
gym,

3263
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:08,930
it can make you work out better.
Like you put your headphones on and you 

3264
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:13,101
play some awesome songs.
You don't give a fuck that you're on 

3265
02:25:13,101 --> 02:25:13,101
some stupid stamp machine,
like a hamster.

3266
02:25:13,101 --> 02:25:14,160
He just keep going.
Yeah.

3267
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:16,740
And the music you,
you liked the music so much.

3268
02:25:16,741 --> 02:25:18,930
you get into it and it's only,
it's in your head,

3269
02:25:19,170 --> 02:25:24,170
drowning out everything else.
Sometimes you don't realize how heavier 

3270
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:24,170
breathing until you know,
you

3271
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:25,390
take the earplugs out,
you're like,

3272
02:25:25,391 --> 02:25:27,040
holy shit,
be getting it in.

3273
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:32,140
Working here.
It's because of nothing else like hits 

3274
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:33,310
you like that.
Like people's words.

3275
02:25:33,311 --> 02:25:38,311
They don't sustain that way.
You can't like read incredibly 

3276
02:25:38,311 --> 02:25:39,760
passionate essay and it sustains you 
through a workout like that.

3277
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:44,260
Like it needs to be just something that 
like this.

3278
02:25:44,261 --> 02:25:46,390
Nothing like music in that respect.
It has,

3279
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:48,400
it has an impact that very few things 
do.

3280
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:53,790
So that,
that process of creating it is always 

3281
02:25:53,790 --> 02:25:57,120
fascinating and mysterious to people 
like me that don't have any musical 

3282
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:57,120
talent at all.

3283
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:57,710
Yeah,
I see it.

3284
02:25:58,370 --> 02:26:00,210
Um,
I,

3285
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:03,860
I just approached it in a different way 
because I'm just,

3286
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:07,660
I do feel like I'm just,
every time I'm in the studio it's like,

3287
02:26:07,661 --> 02:26:09,050
um,
me just,

3288
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:14,080
you know,
trying to create the uncreated and it's 

3289
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:16,040
a very private thing sometimes,
you know,

3290
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:18,800
I want to,
I want to be able to,

3291
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:20,750
you know,
have my privacy when I do that.

3292
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:21,960
Right.

3293
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:22,550
Yeah.
No,

3294
02:26:22,551 --> 02:26:23,450
I totally.
Do.

3295
02:26:23,451 --> 02:26:28,451
You do all your writing and everything 
and the studio or do you sometimes sit 

3296
02:26:28,451 --> 02:26:28,451
at home?
Oh,

3297
02:26:28,451 --> 02:26:28,790
it comes whenever,
man.

3298
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:31,970
I'll be in the shower.
Do you have any of the shower?

3299
02:26:31,971 --> 02:26:33,080
I'm thinking of some shit,
you know.

3300
02:26:33,210 --> 02:26:35,960
Do you ever use that a note app on the 
phone,

3301
02:26:35,961 --> 02:26:37,370
on your phone?
Were you talking to it?

3302
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:39,240
I'm recording memos.
Yeah,

3303
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:40,330
a lot.
A lot of the time.

3304
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:41,720
Not even that.
I mean the note app,

3305
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:42,980
you know,
you can talk to it

3306
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,890
had a voice recognition.
No,

3307
02:26:44,891 --> 02:26:45,310
no,
no.

3308
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,330
I just kinda see if I'm recording 
something,

3309
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:49,810
some melody.
I'm thinking of something,

3310
02:26:50,130 --> 02:26:55,130
I'm not thinking of wraps like days.
It's less about that now and it's more 

3311
02:26:55,130 --> 02:26:59,801
about like,
like just melodies and coming up with 

3312
02:27:00,051 --> 02:27:05,051
songs and structure.
You want to hear the sound and then the 

3313
02:27:05,051 --> 02:27:05,690
lyrics come next Because the music is 
just going to tell me what to say,

3314
02:27:05,970 --> 02:27:07,370
you know?
Wow.

3315
02:27:07,430 --> 02:27:10,040
That's fucking wild.
That's so cool.

3316
02:27:10,041 --> 02:27:14,780
Now how much of your creation is done 
under the influence of marijuana?

3317
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:19,250
Man,
I don't smoke to create.

3318
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:22,280
I've come up with a lot of shit sober 
sometimes when I'm fresh.

3319
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:27,310
Waking up in the morning,
like sometimes the most ideas at like 

3320
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:27,310
8:00
AM.

3321
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:27,310
Sometimes people say that

3322
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:30,820
writers like Stephen King I believe does
all of his writing in the morning.

3323
02:27:30,821 --> 02:27:32,770
I think he doesn't like nine to noon 
every day.

3324
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:34,350
Yeah.
It's like man,

3325
02:27:34,351 --> 02:27:38,320
I'm fresh in the morning with something,
some melody and it usually comes,

3326
02:27:38,321 --> 02:27:41,880
is walking through the house making 
breakfast and you know,

3327
02:27:42,190 --> 02:27:44,520
uh,
it can be whenever dropping a deuce,

3328
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:49,580
you know,
I come up with just melodies here and 

3329
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:53,151
there and I record them all if something
really catches me because If I don't 

3330
02:27:53,151 --> 02:27:53,151
record them immediately then I lose 
them.

3331
02:27:53,151 --> 02:27:53,820
So I,
you know,

3332
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:57,050
I got to record them somehow,
but it's,

3333
02:27:57,051 --> 02:27:58,220
it's very,
um,

3334
02:27:58,430 --> 02:28:03,430
I'm always,
I'm always thinking about music as much 

3335
02:28:03,430 --> 02:28:05,990
as like I like to deny it and go shoot a
movie and shit and,

3336
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:08,610
you know,
I always think about music.

3337
02:28:08,611 --> 02:28:11,610
I'm obsessed with the idea of just 
making,

3338
02:28:11,670 --> 02:28:15,540
you know,
the most beautiful songs that like,

3339
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:20,590
you know,
really make people feel some type of 

3340
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:21,150
comfort or some type of understanding 
because the world is so fucked.

3341
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:22,070
And

3342
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,750
uh,
you know,

3343
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:25,970
I just really am obsessed with that 
idea.

3344
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:27,800
I think I'm always going to be 
anomalous,

3345
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:30,020
just trying different,
different ways of doing that.

3346
02:28:30,021 --> 02:28:30,590
You know.
Uh,

3347
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:33,350
we did the rap shit,
we did the rock album.

3348
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:36,440
Now I'm just trying to be disliked weird
instrumentalist,

3349
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:42,460
you know,
and I don't really know when that's 

3350
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:42,460
going to be,
but I'm just really,

3351
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:43,940
I guess in the process learned not to 
produce better too,

3352
02:28:43,941 --> 02:28:47,480
which is something that I've been trying
to.

3353
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:52,740
I always want to be better.
So it's good to be learning and getting 

3354
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:57,071
better as I'm creating.
Do you do any other things other than 

3355
02:28:57,071 --> 02:29:00,371
music?
Do you have any other hobbies or things 

3356
02:29:00,371 --> 02:29:02,651
that like I'm also get locked into a,
I like design and sometimes like a,

3357
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:06,650
I wouldn't look at myself as like a 
fashion designer,

3358
02:29:06,651 --> 02:29:09,620
but you know,
if an opportunity comes around I'll do a

3359
02:29:09,621 --> 02:29:11,850
collaborative to you like design 
clothes,

3360
02:29:11,851 --> 02:29:12,650
like clothes?

3361
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:13,570
Yeah,
like I've done a,

3362
02:29:14,410 --> 02:29:17,600
about five t shirt collaborations with 
bathing ape.

3363
02:29:17,740 --> 02:29:19,400
Um,
I used to work there.

3364
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:21,380
That was my last job before I got 
famous,

3365
02:29:21,381 --> 02:29:26,381
you know,
so like I have roots back in New York 

3366
02:29:26,381 --> 02:29:30,770
and that was pretty much one of those.
The only job I've really kept in touch 

3367
02:29:30,770 --> 02:29:31,900
with and you know,
that I went baCk to and,

3368
02:29:31,901 --> 02:29:34,250
and you know,
did some things for the fans.

3369
02:29:34,251 --> 02:29:37,060
So you just seemed to creating shit.
It doesn't,

3370
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:38,720
you know,
it really for me,

3371
02:29:38,721 --> 02:29:41,750
I'm starting to write a little bit more.
It's just staying creative,

3372
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:46,810
right?
Like realized like a book or like blog 

3373
02:29:46,810 --> 02:29:46,810
entries.
Like what do you mean?

3374
02:29:46,810 --> 02:29:50,210
Like a tv show or tv shows,
horror movies,

3375
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:55,300
ideas I've had in my head for awhile.
I'll just start jotting them down and 

3376
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:56,480
you know,
just everything right now.

3377
02:29:56,481 --> 02:29:59,750
It's just me expressing whatever comes 
to mind,

3378
02:29:59,770 --> 02:30:00,260
you know,
uh,

3379
02:30:00,410 --> 02:30:02,840
anything that creatively strikes me.

3380
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:03,380
Yeah.
See,

3381
02:30:03,381 --> 02:30:08,381
that's a dream job for people to be able
to just come up with things all the 

3382
02:30:08,381 --> 02:30:12,611
time.
Let's work on creating your entire day 

3383
02:30:12,611 --> 02:30:12,611
is spent mostly just concentrating on 
creating.

3384
02:30:12,611 --> 02:30:14,110
I'm not doing anything with those things
yet,

3385
02:30:14,111 --> 02:30:15,590
but it's,
it's stimulating,

3386
02:30:15,591 --> 02:30:18,020
you know,
it doesn't mean that I'm gonna have some

3387
02:30:18,021 --> 02:30:21,740
tv show tomorrow or anything or it's 
just for me,

3388
02:30:21,741 --> 02:30:22,130
it,
it,

3389
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:24,260
it just,
it's stimulating,

3390
02:30:24,410 --> 02:30:25,020
you know,
and,

3391
02:30:25,021 --> 02:30:28,090
and shit knowing me I'll fuck around and
my right,

3392
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:29,230
the next shit,
you know,

3393
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:34,640
like something that yet or something 
that could lead me to some showing who 

3394
02:30:36,501 --> 02:30:38,290
knows,
but um,

3395
02:30:38,530 --> 02:30:40,300
and it probably also helps you,
your,

3396
02:30:40,301 --> 02:30:42,230
your creativity and the other areas as 
well.

3397
02:30:42,231 --> 02:30:43,760
Right.
but then on top of that,

3398
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:46,340
I was the king of being like,
oh,

3399
02:30:46,341 --> 02:30:47,480
I have this idea,
but nah,

3400
02:30:47,481 --> 02:30:48,590
that's not for me.
Or no,

3401
02:30:48,591 --> 02:30:49,310
I couldn't do that.

3402
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:50,840
Um,
music is my thing.

3403
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:51,530
No,
I couldn't do that.

3404
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:56,920
So now I'm past that.
Now there's nothing if it pops into my 

3405
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:58,130
mind and I can fucking do it because I 
thought about it for a reason.

3406
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:04,000
So now it's just about finding time for 
certain projects and I'm not no rush.

3407
02:31:04,251 --> 02:31:06,310
You know,
I worried about being pigeon holed,

3408
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:11,320
you're saying no,
I think I think I've done enough strong 

3409
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:14,561
arm and let me get my space as an artist
where I can kind of do whatever I want 

3410
02:31:14,751 --> 02:31:17,960
now at this point she reached out to me.
I just want us to be good though.

3411
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:18,960
Like,
don't get me wrong.

3412
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:23,660
I'm always feeling like I'm vulnerable 
to make some bullshit though.

3413
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:28,760
I don't feel like I'm invincible.
and I think a lot of artists do get to 

3414
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:28,760
that point.
They feel invincible.

3415
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,540
Like I am very capable of making some 
weak shit.

3416
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,440
Y'all motherfuckers don't hear it,
you know,

3417
02:31:33,450 --> 02:31:38,450
and he asked because I'm sitting there 
and making sure that this is not weak 

3418
02:31:38,450 --> 02:31:38,550
shit.
Scrapping the ones that are and,

3419
02:31:38,551 --> 02:31:40,800
and,
and working on the ones that started off

3420
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:41,910
week,
but you know,

3421
02:31:41,911 --> 02:31:44,700
making sure that they were where they 
needed to be before you heard it.

3422
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:46,610
Um,
do you have the other,

3423
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:48,120
like you gotta know when to abandon 
them?

3424
02:31:48,270 --> 02:31:53,270
Oh yeah.
You all know when that abandoned some 

3425
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:53,270
shit immediately and certain feelings 
you get,

3426
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:54,550
you know when some shit is the right one
and when it's not this guy.

3427
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:56,730
There's jokes like that too.
Very similar.

3428
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:57,750
Yeah,
very similar.

3429
02:31:57,810 --> 02:31:59,200
Some of them you just gotta let go.
Yeah.

3430
02:31:59,270 --> 02:32:04,270
And you can't infer songs is,
it's much more emotional to let go some 

3431
02:32:04,270 --> 02:32:08,781
shit that you like because it might be 
on the right track to being something 

3432
02:32:08,781 --> 02:32:08,781
gnarly.

3433
02:32:08,781 --> 02:32:09,900
Like she put it on the shelf.
Maybe say key visited.

3434
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:11,610
Yeah.
I go back every year.

3435
02:32:11,611 --> 02:32:13,690
I go back and listen to the shit that I 
made the year before.

3436
02:32:13,691 --> 02:32:14,980
Do you categorize them?
Do you,

3437
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:17,580
do you make notes or do you use.
They're all numbered.

3438
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:20,130
Just number.
you just say you go back and you go,

3439
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:21,810
okay,
this is from 2013.

3440
02:32:21,811 --> 02:32:23,810
Let me just listen to what I was doing.
MY uh,

3441
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,070
my engineer,
I'll just tell him,

3442
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:27,660
pull up everything and we'll just listen
to things one by one flag.

3443
02:32:27,661 --> 02:32:30,270
The ones that are good and are there 
ones that You know,

3444
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:35,480
because that's the thing,
you always got to give yourself a break 

3445
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:35,480
and uh,
it's always good to listen to stuff with

3446
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,010
fresh years.
I find uh,

3447
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:39,050
And also,
uh,

3448
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:42,960
to just gIve you your,
your brain a break because for me,

3449
02:32:42,961 --> 02:32:46,440
I'm sitting in the studio for hours 
listening to the same old shit,

3450
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:47,730
like the same old beat,
you know,

3451
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:48,840
that you're workIng on,
you know,

3452
02:32:48,841 --> 02:32:53,040
so it's kinda like you need to back off 
of second and like I like to,

3453
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,270
you know,
work on a record,

3454
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:57,390
bounce him,
whatever,

3455
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:58,740
you know,
bouncing means,

3456
02:32:58,810 --> 02:33:01,780
kinda compressing all those sounds to 
one track to make that mp3.

3457
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:07,320
That's what you bounced out a fire,
that's what you guys get on your ipod is

3458
02:33:07,321 --> 02:33:09,780
a bounced down file of all of all the 
files.

3459
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:15,740
So I bounced down everything everywhere.
The ones that I feel like we're close to

3460
02:33:15,991 --> 02:33:19,320
being finished or reasonable enough for 
me to listen to and write to.

3461
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:22,740
and um,
I won't listen to him that night.

3462
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:27,820
I'll wake up the next day and while I'm 
making breakfast I might listen to them 

3463
02:33:27,820 --> 02:33:28,530
that with fresh ears and I'll be like,
aw shit.

3464
02:33:28,531 --> 02:33:29,580
Most of the time it's like,
whoa,

3465
02:33:29,730 --> 02:33:32,280
this is dope.
Because the night before I'm just saying

3466
02:33:32,281 --> 02:33:33,240
hi,
this shit sucks.

3467
02:33:33,241 --> 02:33:34,160
I don't know,
I'll listen to it tomorrow,

3468
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:35,200
you know,
because I've been in our.

3469
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,280
I've been in the studio for hours by 
myself and I don't have nobody to tell 

3470
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:40,280
me like,
yo,

3471
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:44,751
that shit is fresh.
It's just me and my own expertise and 

3472
02:33:44,751 --> 02:33:44,751
just like right now I think this is all 
shit,

3473
02:33:44,751 --> 02:33:47,080
but I'll bounce it down and I'll just do
it tomorrow,

3474
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:49,560
see how I feel,
and almost every time I do that,

3475
02:33:49,561 --> 02:33:53,520
if I bounce it down it's like dope and a
lot of this shit can be for someone else

3476
02:33:53,521 --> 02:33:54,060
and not for me.

3477
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:57,450
Do you?
It's the thing about music too,

3478
02:33:57,451 --> 02:34:02,451
it seems like when,
when there's a song that I really like 

3479
02:34:02,451 --> 02:34:03,750
at any genre,
it's like I really like it.

3480
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:06,150
I like it at first and then I started 
really liking it.

3481
02:34:06,151 --> 02:34:11,151
When I keep hearing it,
I hear it a bunch of times and as out 

3482
02:34:11,151 --> 02:34:11,151
here,
like the fourth or fifth time.

3483
02:34:11,151 --> 02:34:11,730
That's what I'll really get into it.
Yeah,

3484
02:34:12,190 --> 02:34:14,520
and it's interesting how music does 
that.

3485
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:17,980
Like there's,
there's songs that you need hear a bunch

3486
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,290
of times.
That's why people don't like new shit.

3487
02:34:20,590 --> 02:34:25,590
Like at the rolling stones go on tour.
Like they let her play those fucking 

3488
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:26,170
classics.
Nobody wants to hear some weird shit.

3489
02:34:26,171 --> 02:34:28,750
Even writing keith,
they may,

3490
02:34:29,170 --> 02:34:30,760
I learn,
I learned the hard way,

3491
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:33,580
you know,
you go out and you do coachella and it's

3492
02:34:33,581 --> 02:34:36,540
like alright,
I got fucking coachella to do this.

3493
02:34:36,550 --> 02:34:38,680
Come with the hits,
let's give them this,

3494
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:40,210
give them the joints.
Didn't want to hear you know,

3495
02:34:40,211 --> 02:34:42,250
I'm not going to go out and coachella 
and be like,

3496
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:47,280
alright guys,
so I know you guys know these songs as 

3497
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:51,181
they are produced on the album but we're
doing them all tonight and I'm doing 

3498
02:34:51,181 --> 02:34:55,150
them all in different key so they won't 
even be formatted how you remember him.

3499
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:58,870
But I promise you,
you have me tonight on this stage for at

3500
02:34:58,870 --> 02:35:02,950
least an hour and a half and it's just 
the worst show ever,

3501
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:03,290
you know?

3502
02:35:03,400 --> 02:35:05,920
Yeah.
When you go and do a new show,

3503
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:10,980
like if it's totally new thing.
Do you do or smaller clubs you fuck 

3504
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:11,830
around with like rock clubs?
Were you talking about like,

3505
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:14,900
like if you're gonna work the first time
you're going to do a,

3506
02:35:14,901 --> 02:35:19,780
a live perform any of your new material 
tour tour.

3507
02:35:19,870 --> 02:35:22,180
Because the tour is like,
for me it's the fan club,

3508
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:28,020
you know,
I could go up there and fumble is many 

3509
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:28,020
times I want all night and my fans are 
just like,

3510
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:33,270
it's all good.
This clubhouse right where you're 

3511
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:34,000
supposed to fuck up,
you know when you go and do coachella,

3512
02:35:34,001 --> 02:35:36,760
there's no time,
there's no time to fuck up.

3513
02:35:36,761 --> 02:35:39,550
Everybody's watching.
It's like the clubhouse.

3514
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:40,900
We dick around.
It's like,

3515
02:35:40,901 --> 02:35:42,810
you know,
when a comic goes to like the,

3516
02:35:43,050 --> 02:35:43,660
the,
the,

3517
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:44,410
the,
the,

3518
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:47,710
the um,
the club used to do standup at before he

3519
02:35:47,711 --> 02:35:49,560
blew up because he knows those people.

3520
02:35:49,580 --> 02:35:51,910
He could be himself there and can try 
new jokes.

3521
02:35:52,410 --> 02:35:53,610
You know,
that's the same deal.

3522
02:35:53,770 --> 02:35:55,810
That's how I approach tour.
You know,

3523
02:35:55,811 --> 02:35:57,820
I don't let press in unless they buy a 
ticket.

3524
02:35:57,821 --> 02:36:02,821
You want to come to my show and fucking 
buy a ticket because most of the time 

3525
02:36:02,821 --> 02:36:05,761
you get the press,
their ticket in their writing and 

3526
02:36:05,761 --> 02:36:07,411
talking shit.
You're giving motherfuckers a free pass 

3527
02:36:07,411 --> 02:36:07,411
to come see your shelter.
They can talk shit.

3528
02:36:07,411 --> 02:36:07,620
It's like,
no asshole.

3529
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:09,530
You want to talk shit about my show,
you're going to pay for it.

3530
02:36:11,210 --> 02:36:13,720
Can't get any attention unless they talk
shit.

3531
02:36:13,721 --> 02:36:15,550
That's a,
that's a big issue with folks.

3532
02:36:15,580 --> 02:36:16,520
But it's like a,
like,

3533
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:18,430
you know,
whatever the case may be,

3534
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:24,120
I'm going to make you work hard to get 
in there to talk shit because it is a 

3535
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:29,011
fucking membership.
It's like the only people I want in my 

3536
02:36:29,011 --> 02:36:30,370
concert of people that really give a 
shit about what we're doing as artists,

3537
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:31,480
you know,
and,

3538
02:36:31,481 --> 02:36:32,980
and,
and you know,

3539
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:36,220
understand me as a human being,
you know,

3540
02:36:36,221 --> 02:36:38,800
so say a very psychedelic point of view.

3541
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:39,430
Yeah.
I mean,

3542
02:36:39,431 --> 02:36:41,920
because it is at the end of the day like
we were talking about before,

3543
02:36:41,921 --> 02:36:43,630
it's all an experience,
you know,

3544
02:36:43,631 --> 02:36:43,850
and,
and,

3545
02:36:43,870 --> 02:36:48,870
and show is even more so because it's 
bringing the songs to life and I'm 

3546
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:51,090
there.
It's like a play theater.

3547
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:52,310
Like I'm out there,
I'm,

3548
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:52,980
I'm,
I'm,

3549
02:36:53,050 --> 02:36:56,320
I'm the showman for tonight and I'm 
taking you to a place.

3550
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,510
It's kinda like leave your worries 
behind.

3551
02:36:59,550 --> 02:37:04,550
Yeah.
It's like I don't really want kids to 

3552
02:37:04,550 --> 02:37:07,460
know the average hip hop show.
It's like you see your favorite artists 

3553
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:08,800
come out at best performing it hits.
They're almost there but you can't touch

3554
02:37:08,801 --> 02:37:09,640
them.
But it's just dope to,

3555
02:37:09,790 --> 02:37:11,350
to know that you're in the same building
with them.

3556
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:14,020
And then that's the end of it.
And that's what you take.

3557
02:37:14,021 --> 02:37:14,650
It's like man,
it was,

3558
02:37:14,930 --> 02:37:16,810
we were in the nosebleeds but it was 
really nice.

3559
02:37:16,870 --> 02:37:20,090
Was there tonight would that my favorite
rapper or whatever.

3560
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:24,140
This shit with me.
It's more therapy.

3561
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:27,180
I'm confessing some things through song.
You see me,

3562
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:29,060
you know,
confess These things.

3563
02:37:29,540 --> 02:37:32,510
You see the emotion as unperforming,
you know?

3564
02:37:32,511 --> 02:37:37,511
And then there's kids out there that are
connecting with it in such a way where 

3565
02:37:37,511 --> 02:37:37,511
it's like,
man,

3566
02:37:37,511 --> 02:37:40,810
I already connect with this dude,
but he's performing it in such a way 

3567
02:37:40,810 --> 02:37:43,721
where he means it even more.
He's singing it in a way where he means 

3568
02:37:43,721 --> 02:37:45,140
that even more in this environment,
you know,

3569
02:37:45,141 --> 02:37:47,510
it's like,
it's a different experience.

3570
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:50,120
And I love giving people that 
experience,

3571
02:37:50,121 --> 02:37:55,121
you know,
I love connecting with them in a way 

3572
02:37:55,121 --> 02:37:55,121
where,
you know,

3573
02:37:55,121 --> 02:37:58,870
everybody at that concert is paying 
attention and they're there because 

3574
02:37:58,870 --> 02:37:58,870
they,
they,

3575
02:37:58,870 --> 02:38:00,400
they want to experience something.
Right.

3576
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:06,700
You reached out to me about people 
asking questions about psychedelics 

3577
02:38:06,770 --> 02:38:08,850
fielding questions about psychedelic.
Yeah.

3578
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:10,700
Yeah.
What was the,

3579
02:38:10,910 --> 02:38:12,650
what was the motivation behind that?

3580
02:38:13,070 --> 02:38:16,150
Uh,
just I saw a tweet from a young man,

3581
02:38:16,170 --> 02:38:20,510
he hit me up and he was just simply 
asked me,

3582
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:21,890
uh,
you know,

3583
02:38:21,891 --> 02:38:24,540
how much you should take some shrooms.
And I,

3584
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:25,910
I don't know,
I was just,

3585
02:38:26,330 --> 02:38:27,080
I just saw it.
I was like,

3586
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:28,580
oh,
okay.

3587
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:32,150
I gave him a response and I didn't think
nothing of it.

3588
02:38:32,151 --> 02:38:34,120
But then I saw a lot of people responded
and I was like,

3589
02:38:34,130 --> 02:38:34,890
oh,
this is cool.

3590
02:38:34,891 --> 02:38:37,400
And other people were asking me 
questions and then I was like,

3591
02:38:37,401 --> 02:38:40,430
holy shit,
this could be bad,

3592
02:38:41,430 --> 02:38:43,250
could be really bad.
But it's like,

3593
02:38:43,251 --> 02:38:44,950
you know,
what the imu,

3594
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:49,960
big brother's shit,
like if they're gonna do drugs and they 

3595
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:50,750
want to know about,
at least asked me to come to me,

3596
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:52,280
you know,
I'll give you the,

3597
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:53,580
the real shit,
you know,

3598
02:38:53,980 --> 02:38:56,330
you want them to ask.
Somebody asked me,

3599
02:38:56,480 --> 02:39:01,480
um,
and that's kinda how I looked at it and 

3600
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:01,480
it ended up being this thing.

3601
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:06,400
But then I know that you talk about 
psychedelics and you have specifically 

3602
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:09,521
talked about dmt because I answered the 
question about dmt and that's why I was 

3603
02:39:09,521 --> 02:39:09,521
like,
man,

3604
02:39:09,521 --> 02:39:10,870
we should talk about this with joe,
you know,

3605
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:14,390
because I know that I,
I mean I can't sit down with anybody and

3606
02:39:14,391 --> 02:39:16,400
talk about dmt.
Even some of my friends,

3607
02:39:16,401 --> 02:39:21,401
I've told them that I've done it and 
they have like looked at me in a way 

3608
02:39:21,401 --> 02:39:21,500
where it's like,
you know,

3609
02:39:21,501 --> 02:39:22,280
it's like,
whoa,

3610
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:25,270
you did.
It's a game changer man.

3611
02:39:25,870 --> 02:39:30,870
But that lets me know that there's 
people that don't understand it and 

3612
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:33,521
they're not educated about it.
And so they just kind of hear these 

3613
02:39:33,521 --> 02:39:33,950
stories and that's also why I was like,
man,

3614
02:39:33,951 --> 02:39:38,951
it would be dope to if we just sat down 
and talked about it and educate some 

3615
02:39:38,951 --> 02:39:39,860
people because I just know it's,
I mean,

3616
02:39:39,861 --> 02:39:42,080
even some people are scared of acid.
It's a scary thing,

3617
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:47,320
you know,
I tell people I remember this is a true 

3618
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:47,320
story.
Um,

3619
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:47,540
I hope so.

3620
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:51,950
This is kind of like one of those 
things.

3621
02:39:52,210 --> 02:39:54,410
I'm not throwing this kid under the bus,
but,

3622
02:39:54,411 --> 02:39:55,550
you know,
it's just a reality.

3623
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:57,320
Um,
I was at coachella,

3624
02:39:57,321 --> 02:39:58,400
we were backstage,
ran random,

3625
02:39:58,401 --> 02:39:59,960
the wiz khalifa,
uh,

3626
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:03,830
you know,
I see him often and he was telling me he

3627
02:40:03,831 --> 02:40:06,020
was doing shrooms or whatever and 
experiment with shrooms.

3628
02:40:06,021 --> 02:40:06,800
And I was like,
oh man,

3629
02:40:06,801 --> 02:40:08,270
you should do acid.
And he was just like,

3630
02:40:08,271 --> 02:40:10,310
no.
I was like,

3631
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:15,330
oh man.
It's like the training wheels are 

3632
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:15,330
fucking psychedelics and shit,
you know.

3633
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:15,330
And it's likE,
he's all,

3634
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:16,290
man,
I'm fucking with that though.

3635
02:40:16,330 --> 02:40:19,760
Just you can just tell that it was just 
maybe,

3636
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:24,570
maybe he might've known somebody who had
a bad trip or he heard some bad things,

3637
02:40:25,080 --> 02:40:28,420
but like there was like fear and I was 
like,

3638
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:31,710
oh man,
it's just people.

3639
02:40:31,740 --> 02:40:35,550
People are kind of like taken back when 
you say you do acid sometimes.

3640
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:37,410
And even when I talk about it on 
twitter,

3641
02:40:37,411 --> 02:40:38,280
people would be like,
whoa,

3642
02:40:38,281 --> 02:40:39,660
chill.
You want some other shit?

3643
02:40:39,661 --> 02:40:40,770
and it's like man,
like,

3644
02:40:42,210 --> 02:40:47,210
I mean,
well that's the one would be really 

3645
02:40:47,210 --> 02:40:47,210
crazy.
Yeah.

3646
02:40:47,210 --> 02:40:48,900
But I don't.
You can go crazy drinking too much.

3647
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:49,760
Yeah.
It's.

3648
02:40:49,761 --> 02:40:53,790
So I don't really.
You've never had a bad trip on acid.

3649
02:40:53,850 --> 02:40:58,850
Yeah.
But it wasn't because of me was because 

3650
02:40:58,850 --> 02:41:01,530
I let some other motherfucker come into 
the situation that wasn't ready with his

3651
02:41:01,531 --> 02:41:03,240
shit,
you know,

3652
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:08,260
you know,
some people come in and try to act like 

3653
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:08,260
they do this and don't do thIs and you 
know,

3654
02:41:08,370 --> 02:41:13,370
you have situations like that.
But I've heard bad trip and you got 

3655
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:14,870
dragged along because you gotta you 
gotta make sure everybody's cool and you

3656
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:15,510
want to,
you know,

3657
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:16,730
help people out.
You don't want to leave,

3658
02:41:16,731 --> 02:41:21,731
nobody abandoned and I feel like that's 
the big thing with psychedelics is if 

3659
02:41:21,731 --> 02:41:23,220
you're doing it with people,
no matter if you know them well or not,

3660
02:41:23,221 --> 02:41:25,980
you don't want to really leave nobody 
hanging,

3661
02:41:25,981 --> 02:41:27,730
you know,
and you want to write.

3662
02:41:28,150 --> 02:41:30,870
You want to try to find that common 
ground because everybody tripping,

3663
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:32,000
you know?
And it's like,

3664
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:38,140
you know,
everybody at the end of the day we're 

3665
02:41:38,140 --> 02:41:39,240
tripping and it's scary because somebody
gets to be like one minute he was trying

3666
02:41:39,241 --> 02:41:39,990
to kill me.
What?

3667
02:41:40,370 --> 02:41:43,110
No,
think back.

3668
02:41:44,310 --> 02:41:49,310
I've never had no shit like that and I'm
pretty sure people have dealt with that 

3669
02:41:49,310 --> 02:41:49,310
though.
You know,

3670
02:41:49,310 --> 02:41:49,310
that's the thing.

3671
02:41:49,310 --> 02:41:52,030
But acId is always the hardest stories.
Like we were talking about pink floyd,

3672
02:41:52,390 --> 02:41:53,980
like the dude from pink floyd,
which,

3673
02:41:53,981 --> 02:41:55,760
which one of those guys went fucking 
crazy.

3674
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:58,720
What the fuck's his name?
Jeremy.

3675
02:41:59,170 --> 02:41:59,950
Jeremy.
You don't know.

3676
02:42:01,090 --> 02:42:06,090
Yeah.
One of the dudes from pink floyd went 

3677
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:06,090
fucking crazy.
that's what shine on you.

3678
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:09,511
Crazy diamond was about him.
That song was about him going fucking 

3679
02:42:09,511 --> 02:42:10,300
crazy from doing too much asset.
Hold on,

3680
02:42:10,301 --> 02:42:11,560
shine on you crazy.
Diamond.

3681
02:42:11,620 --> 02:42:16,620
I know part of the information,
I don't want to quote like I know it 

3682
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:16,620
all.
Yeah.

3683
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:17,740
In wikipedia days,
the man.

3684
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:19,690
Yeah,
it was written.

3685
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:21,100
Okay.
Shine,

3686
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:21,970
shine on you.
Crazy.

3687
02:42:21,971 --> 02:42:26,110
Diamond is a nine part pInk floyd,
nine part pink floyd composition,

3688
02:42:26,111 --> 02:42:29,230
which is what andre waters,
Richard Wright and David Gilmore,

3689
02:42:29,470 --> 02:42:31,300
and it's attributed to former band 
members.

3690
02:42:31,301 --> 02:42:33,760
Sit barrett.
Syd barrett was the one who went bond.

3691
02:42:33,761 --> 02:42:37,090
Nan was allegedly allegedly,

3692
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:40,890
but that album cover was,
is so fucking sick too.

3693
02:42:41,010 --> 02:42:43,080
Shaking his hand and dudes on fire.
Yeah.

3694
02:42:43,170 --> 02:42:44,850
Yeah.
So fucking gnarly.

3695
02:42:45,090 --> 02:42:46,710
For real.
Yeah.

3696
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,700
He,
um,

3697
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,950
apparently,
I don't know if that's true,

3698
02:42:50,090 --> 02:42:55,090
the whole lsd thing,
but through the it says this is the 

3699
02:42:55,090 --> 02:42:56,870
wikipedia.
It says throughout late 1960 for um,

3700
02:42:57,270 --> 02:42:59,540
for barrett,
for syd barrett throughout ninth,

3701
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:04,580
late 1967 in the early 1968,
barrett's behavior became increasingly 

3702
02:43:04,580 --> 02:43:09,351
erratic and unpredictable.
Partly as a consequence of his reported 

3703
02:43:09,351 --> 02:43:11,380
heavy use of psychedelic drugs.
most prominently lsd.

3704
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:16,590
Many reports described him onstage 
drumming one cord through the entire 

3705
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:20,671
concert or not playing at all.
Had a show at the fillmore in san 

3706
02:43:20,671 --> 02:43:22,840
francisco during a performance of 
interstellar overdrive.

3707
02:43:22,841 --> 02:43:27,841
Barrett slowly detuned his guitar.
The audience seemed to enjoy such 

3708
02:43:27,841 --> 02:43:30,370
antics.
Unaware of the rest of the bands.

3709
02:43:30,670 --> 02:43:35,670
Consternation interviewed on the pat 
boone showed during the tourist sids 

3710
02:43:35,670 --> 02:43:39,301
replied to boone's question was blank 
and totally mute stair according to nick

3711
02:43:40,091 --> 02:43:41,100
mason.
Nick,

3712
02:43:41,140 --> 02:43:46,140
what?
Sid wasn't into moving his lips that 

3713
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:46,140
day,
so he was just.

3714
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:49,180
He was just going.
He was just going.

3715
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:52,900
He was my hero.
He went out there for whatever reason.

3716
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:54,340
I mean,
I don't use my hero.

3717
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:55,910
Yeah,
he might've lost it.

3718
02:43:55,911 --> 02:43:57,100
Shit.
who knows?

3719
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:59,080
Or he might've just got tired of was 
like,

3720
02:43:59,110 --> 02:44:01,070
fuck this probably.
Yeah,

3721
02:44:01,071 --> 02:44:06,071
probably on acid all the time and just 
couldn't realize he was quitting pink 

3722
02:44:06,071 --> 02:44:06,071
floyd for acid.

3723
02:44:08,490 --> 02:44:12,220
That new girl shoes is still.
He was still in that old relationship.

3724
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,860
well,
we were talking about cigarettes earlier

3725
02:44:14,861 --> 02:44:19,861
and in a world where cigarettes are 
legal and they kill half a million 

3726
02:44:19,861 --> 02:44:22,950
people in this country alone every year,
it's preposterous to think that we're 

3727
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:25,840
too much of a group of fucking babies to
deal with psychedelics.

3728
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:29,020
We need like centers,
we need centers,

3729
02:44:29,021 --> 02:44:34,021
we have educated people with degrees and
understand that the human body doctors 

3730
02:44:36,040 --> 02:44:41,040
who could administrative people can take
care of people and have them in these 

3731
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,860
really comfortable environments where 
people go and they they,

3732
02:44:42,910 --> 02:44:47,910
they have the possibility in a 
professional setting of experiencing 

3733
02:44:47,910 --> 02:44:51,751
these things and that should be a part 
of normal human culture because you've 

3734
02:44:51,751 --> 02:44:52,900
benefited from it.
I've benefited from it.

3735
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:58,140
Brian has kind of benefited from it.
Debatable as he holds up the cigarettes.

3736
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:01,710
Camels smokes.
Camels.

3737
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:03,130
Camels.
Silly bitch.

3738
02:45:05,660 --> 02:45:06,760
Do you think you can get hypnotized?

3739
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:11,400
I don't think hypnotized or I don't 
think I can get hypnotized now to smart.

3740
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:16,820
Yeah,
I think I would just think about it the 

3741
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:16,820
whole time.
Overthink about ira.

3742
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:16,820
This guy's trying to hypnotize me right 
now.

3743
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:17,810
I could hear his voice.
All right.

3744
02:45:18,210 --> 02:45:18,570
I don't know.

3745
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:20,080
I think.
I think.

3746
02:45:20,650 --> 02:45:24,160
I think you could do it bro.
They say iowasca is one of the best ways

3747
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:29,460
to quit.
Iowasca supposed to be like a really 

3748
02:45:29,460 --> 02:45:31,150
good way to quit smoking with anything.
If you want to wake up and I'm alive,

3749
02:45:31,151 --> 02:45:32,800
thank god,
but you go through it,

3750
02:45:32,801 --> 02:45:35,980
you go through the journey and it's just
so self examined.

3751
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:38,710
Tory.
Even the regular dmt trips I've had,

3752
02:45:38,711 --> 02:45:42,070
they're intensely self examine it,
like the,

3753
02:45:42,090 --> 02:45:47,090
the,
the insight that you have in your own 

3754
02:45:47,090 --> 02:45:47,090
life and your own world,
your own mind.

3755
02:45:47,090 --> 02:45:47,810
It's just,
it's,

3756
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:51,640
it's scary because it's so.
It's so clear.

3757
02:45:51,641 --> 02:45:53,680
The clarity.
So bizarre.

3758
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:54,970
It freaked me out,
man.

3759
02:45:54,971 --> 02:45:55,460
I'm,
I'm,

3760
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:57,830
I'm not gonna lie,
not done.

3761
02:45:57,831 --> 02:45:59,920
You know,
I've done my fair share of asset.

3762
02:45:59,930 --> 02:46:01,900
You know,
I'm big on psychedelics.

3763
02:46:02,390 --> 02:46:04,210
Dmt,
some next level shit,

3764
02:46:04,211 --> 02:46:09,211
but I've had nothing like this.
And you try to explain

3765
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:13,910
it and you can't because there's nothing
you could just know.

3766
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,690
You can't find the words to explain 
sometimes what you see,

3767
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:19,290
uh,
you know,

3768
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:21,500
you a little bit more educated about it 
than I am.

3769
02:46:21,501 --> 02:46:23,060
You could probAbly find the words,
you know,

3770
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:27,050
like sometimes you fucking talk like a 
scientist and she following like,

3771
02:46:27,051 --> 02:46:28,110
but you know,
bullshitting.

3772
02:46:28,590 --> 02:46:30,290
But you know,
at the same time,

3773
02:46:30,291 --> 02:46:35,291
like for people that might not be 
educated and still hard for me to,

3774
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:37,820
you know,
put the words what I saw,

3775
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:40,760
but you know,
the reality is,

3776
02:46:40,761 --> 02:46:45,290
is what you're seeing is everything 
literally melt down and reconnect,

3777
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:50,000
deconstruct and reconstruct around you 
and your eyes are wide open.

3778
02:46:50,690 --> 02:46:52,580
and it literally,
for me,

3779
02:46:52,610 --> 02:46:54,170
that was the only thing that freaked me 
out.

3780
02:46:54,171 --> 02:46:59,171
The fact that my eyes weren't closed,
but my environment was completely 

3781
02:46:59,171 --> 02:47:03,971
altered immediately,
almost before I could even exhale all 

3782
02:47:03,971 --> 02:47:05,780
the smoke before I was even leaning back
on my couch.

3783
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:10,960
I mean the room rearranged itself and 
became something else in it.

3784
02:47:12,770 --> 02:47:13,880
I felt happy.

3785
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:18,710
Graham hancock has a very fascinating 
way of looking at it and what he thinks.

3786
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:23,890
The way he described it to me,
I never heard anybody describe it this 

3787
02:47:23,890 --> 02:47:23,890
way before,
but it made total sense.

3788
02:47:23,890 --> 02:47:28,210
He said,
everyone says you're taking drugs and 

3789
02:47:28,210 --> 02:47:28,220
it's distorting your perception of 
reality,

3790
02:47:28,221 --> 02:47:29,420
and that's what you're saying.
he goes,

3791
02:47:29,750 --> 02:47:34,750
that is a possibility.
Another possibility is that like a 

3792
02:47:34,750 --> 02:47:37,880
telescope needs to be tuned in to see a 
far off star.

3793
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:42,200
That what you're doing by taking this 
chemical that your brain already makes,

3794
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:47,150
you're tuning into something that's 
ordinarily impossible for you to see and

3795
02:47:47,151 --> 02:47:51,230
that there is this dimension that is 
around you all the time and it is filled

3796
02:47:51,231 --> 02:47:56,231
with intelligent entities and he said,
we must consider that that is also a 

3797
02:47:56,481 --> 02:48:01,481
possibility and that is a fascinating 
way of looking at it because we really 

3798
02:48:02,421 --> 02:48:07,421
don't know what's happening and the 
people that aren't blown away by it or 

3799
02:48:07,421 --> 02:48:10,721
just the people who haven't done it.
If you've done it and you're not blown 

3800
02:48:10,721 --> 02:48:10,721
away by it,
I don't understand.

3801
02:48:10,721 --> 02:48:14,720
You know,
maybe There's supposedly some people who

3802
02:48:14,750 --> 02:48:19,750
don't have a reaction to dmt.
There's a small percentage of people 

3803
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:20,990
that try it where nothing happens.

3804
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:27,720
Went two separate occasions where a 
first time it didn't work for me and in 

3805
02:48:30,221 --> 02:48:35,221
the second time it did.
Was the first time bad stuff or do you 

3806
02:48:35,221 --> 02:48:35,380
just not think the first time we didn't 
administer it?

3807
02:48:35,381 --> 02:48:40,381
Right.
And then the second time it was 

3808
02:48:40,381 --> 02:48:42,180
downright.
The second time it was the second time 

3809
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:45,300
was also I hit it extra hard because I 
was a mistake.

3810
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:50,311
It's going to work this time,
so I had this really like I'm at man,

3811
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:52,420
man.
You know what,

3812
02:48:52,421 --> 02:48:53,080
that shit was crazy

3813
02:48:53,430 --> 02:48:56,160
story is the same as yours almost.
It's,

3814
02:48:56,230 --> 02:48:59,260
it's slightly different in that I did it
the first time I did it.

3815
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:03,910
I was pretty fucking profound,
intensely profound and I thought I'd hit

3816
02:49:03,911 --> 02:49:05,790
the center of the universe.
I thought I'd.

3817
02:49:06,150 --> 02:49:08,010
And then the second I did it,

3818
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:13,010
I blew way past that spot to some 
complete new place where there was no 

3819
02:49:13,081 --> 02:49:14,550
avoiding it,
no denying it.

3820
02:49:14,551 --> 02:49:16,170
And I went,
oh this is it.

3821
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:21,480
And then that's the spot I've been kinda
going to pretty much every time since 

3822
02:49:21,480 --> 02:49:25,131
then.
But the first time was unbelievably 

3823
02:49:25,131 --> 02:49:25,140
profound.
Way more profound than anything else and

3824
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:27,370
I didn't really even get all the way 
through me.

3825
02:49:27,371 --> 02:49:28,800
I didn't,
I haven't been through yet.

3826
02:49:28,970 --> 02:49:30,420
Like that world that you're talking 
about.

3827
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:34,920
Like I haven't went,
like I couldn't even get out of whatever

3828
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:38,790
was happening in that room in my house 
because it was.

3829
02:49:39,270 --> 02:49:41,130
I don't know if I want to keep your eyes
open.

3830
02:49:42,070 --> 02:49:43,290
I,
I,

3831
02:49:43,380 --> 02:49:48,380
for the most part,
my eyes were wide open because I was so 

3832
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:48,380
intrigued that like,
yeah,

3833
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:50,830
I've seen a bunch of shit around you.
Yeah.

3834
02:49:50,831 --> 02:49:54,600
But then when I closed my eyes and I got
over that,

3835
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:58,490
then I was a whole nother experience and
that was this tunnel like thing and then

3836
02:49:58,500 --> 02:49:59,010
it was dark.

3837
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:00,900
It was more,
some evil shit happen in there.

3838
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,210
It didn't freak me out too much.
But you know,

3839
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:06,810
because I know like that's another thing
people like as long as you,

3840
02:50:06,811 --> 02:50:08,350
if you see some shit that might freak 
you out,

3841
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:10,410
this remember you are on drugs,
you know,

3842
02:50:10,411 --> 02:50:15,411
lIke some shit,
you know or you're seeing demons for 

3843
02:50:15,411 --> 02:50:15,411
real.
Yeah.

3844
02:50:15,411 --> 02:50:16,360
But they can't harm you,
you know,

3845
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:20,730
just sit your ass still don't fucking 
move and you'll come back hopefully.

3846
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:22,500
Hopefully.
Hopefully.

3847
02:50:22,590 --> 02:50:27,300
But this was more just like some,
some weird shit happened and I didn't go

3848
02:50:27,301 --> 02:50:32,301
down that rabbit hole too far.
I'm just kind of opened my eyes back 

3849
02:50:32,301 --> 02:50:32,670
open and just kinda still shit was 
weird.

3850
02:50:33,570 --> 02:50:38,570
But I kid you not joe,
as soon as I was kinda like I'm all 

3851
02:50:38,821 --> 02:50:39,960
right,
I'm over this.

3852
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:43,800
Then I came back and it was kinda like,
well,

3853
02:50:43,950 --> 02:50:48,950
I could describe as like an overlapping 
a little bit of that world in reality.

3854
02:50:50,130 --> 02:50:53,760
Still a little haze of it where there 
was shades of the other world.

3855
02:50:54,210 --> 02:50:56,670
It was almost like I saw a face in the 
corner of my room,

3856
02:50:56,671 --> 02:50:58,680
just kind of dipped back off until the 
walls.

3857
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:04,160
Yeah.
I saw like these kinda like spidery 

3858
02:51:05,161 --> 02:51:08,310
things kind of coming out and my grammy 
and onto the ground.

3859
02:51:09,830 --> 02:51:14,830
But that's the thing though at this 
point in my room was back to being it 

3860
02:51:14,830 --> 02:51:15,840
being a room,
you know what I'm saying?

3861
02:51:15,841 --> 02:51:19,680
Like I was back to reality,
but it was like this,

3862
02:51:20,970 --> 02:51:21,720
this,
this,

3863
02:51:21,721 --> 02:51:22,830
you know,
the world was still.

3864
02:51:22,831 --> 02:51:23,430
It's like,
uh,

3865
02:51:23,470 --> 02:51:26,820
the echo from where I was at was still 
kind of in the room,

3866
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:29,550
you know,
and it hasn't worn off yet.

3867
02:51:29,580 --> 02:51:31,620
Yeah.
Well next time you do it,

3868
02:51:31,621 --> 02:51:33,720
don't do it that way.
We do it.

3869
02:51:33,810 --> 02:51:35,820
Just keep your eyes closed and let it 
go.

3870
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,260
Don't keep my eyes open.

3871
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:38,460
No,
I don't think so.

3872
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:41,270
Keeping the eyes open part is,
uh,

3873
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:43,110
probably fucking with you.
Oh man,

3874
02:51:43,111 --> 02:51:44,190
I was,
you know,

3875
02:51:44,191 --> 02:51:46,470
they say the best way to do it isn't a 
really comfortable.

3876
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:47,670
I mean I loved it though.
It was,

3877
02:51:47,700 --> 02:51:50,880
it wasn't absolutely positive,
but I didn't go to,

3878
02:51:51,630 --> 02:51:56,630
I didn't go to that world that you,
you said you were going to because my 

3879
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:56,970
eyes were open.
It was really just,

3880
02:51:57,180 --> 02:52:02,180
I was just so intriguing.
I wanted to spend crazy when I got done 

3881
02:52:02,180 --> 02:52:04,911
I wanted to paint everything I saw 
because I just had never seen that like 

3882
02:52:04,911 --> 02:52:05,890
that and I never want to paint.
Do

3883
02:52:06,610 --> 02:52:08,260
alex grey's paintings.
Yes.

3884
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:13,620
And that's the thing,
but I don't know if it was my shit was 

3885
02:52:13,620 --> 02:52:13,620
going to be like that because I didn't 
go to that world.

3886
02:52:13,620 --> 02:52:13,620
Right,
right,

3887
02:52:13,620 --> 02:52:14,630
right.
But just whatever you went to,

3888
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:17,110
it'd be different.
But like,

3889
02:52:17,111 --> 02:52:20,050
you know how you were saying like,
or some of those paintings are just like

3890
02:52:20,051 --> 02:52:22,330
some guy and it's like all this energy 
around it and so on.

3891
02:52:22,331 --> 02:52:23,440
These colors.
I didn't see that.

3892
02:52:24,070 --> 02:52:25,390
I didn't get to yet.
You probably.

3893
02:52:25,391 --> 02:52:27,820
Yeah.
Well most people don't get enough,

3894
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:29,080
you know,
let's just put it.

3895
02:52:29,081 --> 02:52:30,580
Like I said,
my first experience,

3896
02:52:30,581 --> 02:52:35,581
I thought it was pretty fucking amazing 
and it still wasn't nothing like the 

3897
02:52:35,581 --> 02:52:35,581
second one,
the second one,

3898
02:52:35,581 --> 02:52:35,581
I was like,
oh,

3899
02:52:35,581 --> 02:52:37,690
I get it.
That was rIdiculous.

3900
02:52:37,691 --> 02:52:42,691
I thought I was already there because 
what I'd seen was still so much 

3901
02:52:42,691 --> 02:52:43,000
different than reality.

3902
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:44,110
I was like,
wow,

3903
02:52:44,111 --> 02:52:49,111
this is the craziest thing ever.
But it was not even close to the actual 

3904
02:52:49,111 --> 02:52:49,111
craziest thing.
So you close your eyes every time.

3905
02:52:49,111 --> 02:52:49,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

3906
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:53,630
Never have opened my eyes before.
And what happened?

3907
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:56,410
She patterns everywhere.
It's like it's too much.

3908
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:58,840
I think there's the conflict of 
information.

3909
02:52:58,870 --> 02:53:01,450
There's the information you're getting 
from your eyeballs.

3910
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,100
There's two different trips.
Yeah,

3911
02:53:03,101 --> 02:53:05,370
and then there's what's going on in your
imagination or your mind,

3912
02:53:05,430 --> 02:53:10,430
whatever the imagination is not even to 
imply that it's not real or it's not a 

3913
02:53:10,430 --> 02:53:15,031
real experience that imagined the term 
imagination is a lot of negative 

3914
02:53:15,031 --> 02:53:16,060
connotations to it,
but whatever it's going on,

3915
02:53:16,061 --> 02:53:17,530
when you got your eyes closed,
you're not.

3916
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:19,540
There's no physical objects in front of 
you.

3917
02:53:19,541 --> 02:53:21,640
You've seen all this stuff happening in 
your,

3918
02:53:21,960 --> 02:53:24,100
in your visual field with your eyes 
closed,

3919
02:53:24,400 --> 02:53:25,540
but you're not,
you know,

3920
02:53:25,660 --> 02:53:27,370
there's,
there's nothing you reach out and grab.

3921
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:32,370
So that's why I'm saying imagination,
but whatever you're doing when you're 

3922
02:53:32,370 --> 02:53:34,990
doing that is real and I don't know what
it is that I don't know what the fuck is

3923
02:53:34,991 --> 02:53:36,670
happening,
but it's real.

3924
02:53:37,130 --> 02:53:38,590
Do we're out of time.
Oh man,

3925
02:53:38,630 --> 02:53:40,650
it's over.
We did three hours dissolve by.

3926
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:42,670
Thank you.
Really appreciate it.

3927
02:53:42,671 --> 02:53:47,671
And I think it was cool for people to 
get a unique insight into your creative 

3928
02:53:47,671 --> 02:53:51,121
process and that was really powerful.
All the shit that you shared about your 

3929
02:53:51,121 --> 02:53:51,121
personal life and the coke and 
everything.

3930
02:53:51,121 --> 02:53:51,440
That was amazing,
man.

3931
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:52,420
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

3932
02:53:52,450 --> 02:53:53,290
So yeah,
anytime.

3933
02:53:53,350 --> 02:53:55,690
And a ladies and gentlemen,
that's the end.

3934
02:53:55,691 --> 02:53:57,310
He dirty fox.
So,

3935
02:53:57,311 --> 02:54:00,460
uh,
we will see you very soon.

3936
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:04,450
Many more podcasts this week and until 
then,

3937
02:54:04,451 --> 02:54:07,630
go fuck yourselves.
You guys much love to everybody.

3938
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:12,750
Big kiss.
That was awesome.

3939
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:16,850
We definitely.
