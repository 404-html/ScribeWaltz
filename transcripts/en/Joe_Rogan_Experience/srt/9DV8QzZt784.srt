1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm not geeked by this. Just
so you know. Do, do, do, do,

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,960
do waiting.
I'm not a fan.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,530
Russell Peters is it were
live ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,570
the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:17,430
This episode is brought to
you by audible.com if you
have never used audible.com

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,070
and you're in your car every day and you,
you,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,060
you were commuting every day you're on
a bus or a plane or whatever the fuck

8
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,750
you're on,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,460
you are missing out on an
awesome opportunity to be
entertained is like a lot of

10
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,070
time. You can, you can learn shit
when you're on a plane. You know,

11
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,800
if you're stuck on a flight for five
hours instead of just staring at the seat

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,790
behind you gave yourself an audible
books son, go check that shit out.

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,791
And one of the craziest things about
audible is their new application for the

14
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,070
kindle fire and it's called whisper sync.
And the way it works,

15
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:48,630
it's really fascinating shit.

16
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,170
The way it works is you
read the book and if you're,

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,360
you're done reading it at a certain point,
you stop it.

18
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,310
It syncs up with your smart phone.

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,490
And then there's a companion audio book
that plays it while you're, you know,

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,460
in the subway or whatever you're
doing, so you can read the book. Uh,

21
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,890
and then when you're in
your car and you're driving,

22
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:11,780
you could have the book read to you from
the exact spot where you left off. It's,

23
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,600
it's amazing.
And it's done with professional actors.

24
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:19,260
So it's not like when authors read their
own books, audio books or the ship,

25
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,200
but don't ever get an audio book where
Stephen King rain reads his own books.

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,650
It's fucking terrible.
Oh my God, it's awful.

27
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:28,950
And then he grabbed the sword
and stab them in the heart.
It's like, it's so like,

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,390
he's such a shit. Act as a shit voice
just doesn't work. It doesn't work.

29
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,110
You got to, Dj's are like that. Do you
had to give that shit up to the, uh,

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,260
professional actors, but his, um,
his writing is fucking fantastic.

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,280
We're all too also brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com and, uh,

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,500
if you listen to this
podcast at least once before,

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,700
you know what the fuck I'm selling. Okay,
go get yourself some bringing pills, son.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,140
Go to go get some Alpha brain or some
shroom tech or any of the supplements that

35
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,280
we sell over it on it.

36
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:01,140
We are trying to sell you the finest
performance enhancing legal substances

37
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:05,640
available. And uh, when I say that it's,
it's not like steroids. What's brain tech?

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,320
What is brain tech? It's another
one of those. There's all, no, no,

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,630
it's called Alpha brain alphabet.
There's a,

40
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,810
there's another one called neuro one
that I've taken before that said Bill

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,770
Romanowski stuff. All of these things
are essentially the along the same lines.

42
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:24,771
There's a whole series of nutrients
that have been shown to have a positive

43
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,720
effect on cognitive function.
What does that mean?

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,700
It means that you can remember things
better statistically provable. You can,

45
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,600
you can solve problems quicker.
There's, there's certain things,

46
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,370
especially like the
memory one is a big one.

47
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,090
Certain things that have been proven
by some of the ingredients are in Alpha

48
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,670
brain and it's not like we figured it out.
Like there's,

49
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,900
there's a shit load of nootropics for
sale on the Internet and I would encourage

50
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,900
anybody who's interested in
these things to Google it there,

51
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,800
there's very little negative,
uh,

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,950
attached to the idea of taking nutrients.
It's not,

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,350
you have to worry about it like Ambien
or something that you can get hooked on.

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,580
It's nothing along those lines.

55
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:07,570
It's just vitamins and all it's
doing is giving your brain's all the,

56
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,930
all the essential nutrients that it needs
in order to function clearly. I mean,

57
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,400
your brain,
your body,

58
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,110
the whole system runs on nutrients and
most of us are living very nutrient

59
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,130
deficient lifestyles. It's
just unfortunate, but it's
just if you have, you know,

60
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,730
the average American meal, you're,
you're not going to get what you need.

61
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,540
There's a lot of shit out there that you
need, especially from fresh vegetables.

62
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,580
You need a lot of green leafy vegetables,

63
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,950
but you also need vitamins and
supplements too. It's like,

64
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,640
it ensures that your body gets the
optimal amount, amount of nutrition,

65
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,250
even if you're eating healthy,
it does make a difference.

66
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,310
One of the things that I tell you about
on and all this shit that we sell,

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,330
all the supplements have a 30 30 pill,
90 day,

68
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,270
100% money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the product.

69
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,040
Now let's trying to rip you off anything,

70
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,710
any of this shit that we sell is
all stuff that I've already used.

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,980
It's all stuff that is been proven
like with a long history of human use.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,810
A new mood is one of those. It's a
five HTP supplement. What five HTP is.

73
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,740
And at first learned about this through
Neal Brennan and he was telling me who's

74
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,100
taking it. It's a Serotonin,
serotonin boosting supplement.

75
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,100
It's essentially the building
blocks for Serotonin.

76
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,530
And when you take five HTP,

77
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,020
you can actually increase your
brain's production of it. Well,

78
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,540
this new mood has both five HTP,

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,280
which turns into Serotonin en El
Tryptofan, which turns into five HTP.

80
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:32,280
So there's like a slow release method
of a, of distributions. And what's that?

81
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:36,310
Make it get sleepy? The trip defense?
No, no it doesn't. No, it's, you know,

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,970
everybody thinks that like when
you, um, LGH l trip to fan,

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,590
it's like everybody thinks it's that part
of Turkey that makes you sleeping. No,

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,860
you ain't like a fucking pig.
That's what makes you sleeping.

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,730
Your body's shutting down. Like there's
nothing that makes you that sleepy.

86
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,860
That sleepy comes from
being a fucking Slob,

87
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,520
Jamaican food nuts now to
anything high caloric man,

88
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,870
anything with a lot of fat in it.

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,770
It just hits that wall inside your
body and your body goes, God damn dude.

90
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,630
Seriously. That's what makes
you tired. I mean, I guess it,

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,280
it'll and it'll stabilize you a bit.
Um,

92
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,690
zinc and magnesium can help
you sleep a little bit.

93
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:13,180
Melatonin can help you sleep a anyway,

94
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,920
go to a on it.com it's o and it.

95
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,080
Use a code name Brogan and save
yourself 10% of any and all supplements.

96
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,170
All right. Dirty bitches.
Boom. Strap the fuck in

97
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,990
Russell Peters and make some mass to Mike

98
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,340
are up in this bitch.

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,520
What happened
today?

100
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,430
Joe Rogan podcast.

101
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,203
We're back here.

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,820
Nice House and Death Squad studios
where we have awesome Internet and shit.

103
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:49,050
Electricity,
dangerous electrocution style,

104
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,850
1940s electricity.

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,270
You stirring shit the bed today for
some reason I'm using an old version.

106
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,100
I use dreams, so hopefully it's,
Oh really? Oh that's what happened.

107
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,770
I don't know. Every time I
launch Ustream and just crashes,

108
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,950
so I'm using an old version that it's
not doing that mix master Mike. Yes.

109
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,570
Welcome aboard, sir. Thank you very
much for coming down to the podcast.

110
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,720
We really appreciate it. Yeah, I'm
stoked. Yeah, and when we talked about it,

111
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,890
when Russell Peters found out about
a Russell Peters being the true music

112
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,390
Aficionado,
true Dj that he is really,

113
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,180
I had to come down here and join.
I did. I was very geeked about it.

114
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,830
Red Band mentioned it
last week and I was like,

115
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,290
I have to be there when mixed matched.
I'm like,

116
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,530
is there and your friends or introduce
yourself to those people. My name is mark.

117
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:33,800
Happy to be here. Thanks for
having me. Mark. What do you
do, mark? Uh, mix master.

118
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,310
Mike and I worked together. I booked them
for shows. I'm actually from Vancouver,

119
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,030
so we flight,

120
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,690
I flew down here for those you who've
been on a podcast for the first time.

121
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,850
Keep it together, keep it together,
shoot them. It's not get crazy. So, uh,

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,250
thanks for doing this man. Of
course, man. What is this a,

123
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:53,000
your app you have for your, uh, your
iPad. You have a mixed mastermind. Yes.

124
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,040
Mix Master Mike. It's called
wheel's a steel, um, w e w.

125
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,220
H. E. L. Z. So those
that want to tap it in,

126
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,730
it's a two turntables and the mixer on
your iPad. So you could take it, you know,

127
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,450
you know,

128
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,200
sometimes you know you don't have access
to real turntables and mixers and stuff

129
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,270
and you got maybe 50,

130
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,380
50 people over and they want
a dance break. Open your Ipad,

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,680
get the little mini adapter,
plug it into the stereo. And

132
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,790
so you cut it off.
You could do,

133
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,820
you could do a do a whole
party out of you off your iPad.

134
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,910
It actually reads your iTunes library.
Holy Shit.

135
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,620
And you can do some crazy shit with it.
Like,

136
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,111
so the,

137
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:39,111
the power of these things now is sort
of caught up with what you're capable of

138
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:44,180
doing with like regular DJ equipment.
Not Quite, not quite but close.

139
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,350
But this,
this

140
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,730
should pacify the Dj for the moment
until they get to the real date.

141
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,670
But you can actually DJ with it.
It's crazy.

142
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,340
Now is there like lessons,

143
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,640
is there a tutorial or anything where
someone learns how to Dj like that or

144
00:07:57,641 --> 00:08:00,310
someone learns how to mix?
Well there's, there's a

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,700
little easy pathways pathways on here.
Like there's,

146
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,110
there's like little scratches that I did
on here where you just hit one button

147
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,250
and there's like four different scratches
as like the scribble, the laser,

148
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,820
the baby and the drag.
So I'll go down it and this is a scribble

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,140
and does the laser does
a baby and does a drag

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,570
and so, so that's how, those are the
sounds subs yet. But that would be good.

151
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,081
Yeah.

152
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:32,980
You have to do is you show people how
to do that or are you just by pressing

153
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,210
those buttons,
it makes those noises.

154
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,430
You figure it out on your own type
thing. How did you learn? For me,

155
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:44,170
I mean this was back in
[inaudible] 87 and um,

156
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:49,130
I watched, uh, well I was around a lot of
music. My, my uncle has had an extensive,

157
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,780
a record collection and he's played
Jimmy Hendrickson me all the time.

158
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,850
Jim Jimmy Hendrix,
p funk or something

159
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,930
by Jimi Hendrix. Like I was like, Whoa, I
want him to play the turntable like that.

160
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,520
And so I got a turntable and I'm
just basically mimicking my heroes.

161
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,800
Wow. You know what you, what
really fascinates me about Djs,

162
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,890
about the art of deejaying is
that this is something that was,

163
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,600
that never existed. Just a, you know,
50 years ago, whatever it was that this,

164
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,480
this is something that really sort
of manifested in our lifetimes.

165
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,960
And we saw guys like,
like I still amount of it,

166
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,410
I don't understand the electronic
music world and DJ world.

167
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,560
It's like we're really kind of shocking
to me when I see like this ts guy,

168
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,490
horrible. I had no idea.
We talked to us for advice,

169
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,720
they just bounded knuckles.

170
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,980
But you know what, as Dj's mix
master Mike and all these other guys,

171
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,390
they aren't really allowed to say these
things. Right, right, right. Like,

172
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,920
like they all come to me and they're
like, oh, I'll say it right now. Okay,

173
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,930
let them know Mike. No, no. I
mean, I met yesterday. He's,
he's a cool dude. I'm sure.

174
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,670
I'm sure he's a great guy,
but whatever.

175
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,310
My point was like all
this didn't exist before.

176
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:05,720
Like I didn't know that this guy was so
enormous and I was in Vegas and there

177
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:10,721
was like something at a a casino and
this dude that I know who's this a super

178
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:15,060
billionaire character, he
owns like a businesses. He's
always front row with UFC.

179
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,600
He's friends with the owners,
really real character.

180
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,400
But he's telling me how
they're going to cts tone.

181
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,360
He's performing in front of 50,000
people. I go, who the fuck is ts toe?

182
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,170
He was like, are you kidding me?
You don't know who to ask though,

183
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,200
is this guy's like on the party scene,
the international club scene.

184
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:27,800
You know what I mean?

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,660
So he tells me about this Dj guy and
internationally he's Jayke whatever he is,

186
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:33,920
man internationally,

187
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:37,690
this guy's fucking gigantic
and he's doing these 50 Hyundai

188
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,140
20 million partner or third was at
30 20 or 30 million a year. Yeah.

189
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:41,670
Something like that.

190
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,330
Pressing all of that shit. Okay. I'm
not comparing that to being a DJ,

191
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:50,160
but all of this electronic Lee created
stuff. This didn't exist before.

192
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,710
None of it exists before. No. Amazing.

193
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,720
It started off the right way and
then in between where the right way,

194
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,010
well let's start it off
and, and uh, you know, with,

195
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,650
with the house music which came out
of disco and then the djs would, um,

196
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,150
they would just play records and mix it
back in the day, like in the 80s. I mean,

197
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:12,230
I'm, I remember buying house
records as early as 86, 85, 81 86.

198
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,750
Wow. And you know, and we would mix
them right there and now they just,

199
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,890
and then there was djs.

200
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:23,360
I would go see like Roger S and a bad
boy bill and all these guys and they were

201
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:27,410
all was so hyped to me that when I go
see them I'd be bored out of my fucking

202
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:31,340
tree. And I was like, why am
I so bored? They're not doing
anything. They were just,

203
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,030
they would press their
own records so they,

204
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,310
they would have shit that you
wouldn't have and then, uh,

205
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,050
they would just play them
and they'd make some,

206
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:42,800
but they were so boring because they
didn't do anything. And I was like,

207
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,240
and I was already into deejaying then
and I was like sitting there and they'll

208
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,180
do anything.

209
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,300
You mean like she would just mix the
records but they would mix them. I mean,

210
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:53,290
which I appreciate them at least
mixing the vinyl live in of me.

211
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,590
But they would play songs you didn't
know and they wouldn't play anything that

212
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,550
was intricate are fucking cool. You'd be
like, well these are just songs you made.

213
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,384
Huh?

214
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,860
So it was their own shit.
A lot of the times I play their own shit.

215
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,910
Do you dislike all electronic music?
Is that why you said no,

216
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,660
I like electronic music
and not a lot of it,

217
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,710
but I mean the good shit
that's out there as good shit.

218
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,000
When you say though that
it started off good,

219
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,540
but now it's not what's the deejaying
started off the right way with the right

220
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,200
intent.

221
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,200
So the deejaying went from that to
creating your own noises and music,

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,590
which is fine,
which is fine,

223
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,220
but these guys are getting paid
to quote unquote Dj and they just,

224
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,600
it's the literally the equivalent to
somebody paying money to see you Joe and

225
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:38,480
you go onstage and you put on a video
of yourself when you point at it.

226
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,410
That's a pretty good idea.
Exactly.

227
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,050
I'm going to do that from now on and
kind of that's the way to do it in mass.

228
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,930
Like all the pressure of fucking
live for forming man. Yeah.

229
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,650
It's just like literally like,
hey man, I see what I did there.

230
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,750
That's kind of a funny way looking at it,

231
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,440
the pressure of live performing is
the thing that fucks with people.

232
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,570
One of the other points is that
just the equipment that the djs use,

233
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,460
so the house djs use what are called CDJs.

234
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,970
So they actually put cds into

235
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,290
now wait,
nowadays they don't even,

236
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:14,230
because the new CDJs have a USB plug,
an MP and they show but to jump drives,

237
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,110
you pop it in and then

238
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,270
so then they just press play literally.

239
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,320
And that's the whole show would stand
in the fist, a fist pump and, and they,

240
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,840
and they literally, and they fucking
congratulate themselves the whole set.

241
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,880
There'll be two of them are
wondering, I'm like, oh my God,

242
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:30,930
you're not doing anything.

243
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,750
But he's pointing at him like he's
doing some really good at that.

244
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:36,420
I could do that. I could fist
pumped the shit out of a show.

245
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,530
But you know the music.

246
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,730
But the music is a reflection of
the audience too as you look at it.

247
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,840
And it's suspect because I don't know,

248
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,160
I got nothing against homos or
anything like, no, but I'm just saying

249
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,010
some of the music can be
just that statement alone
will be a meme till the end

250
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:57,844
of the time.

251
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,890
Nobody but [inaudible] some of that
music is kind of Kinda Kinda in that

252
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:06,200
direction. Kind of ecstasy
driven I think more than gay.

253
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,000
And now you know what Tsos fan comes from.
It's like a bunch of those people.

254
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,170
I mean,
you know nothing.

255
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,530
No, actually he's not
even in with those people.

256
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,330
Those people have more sense than the,

257
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,570
than the masters that listen
to Tsa though. And I would say

258
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,640
um, well I didn't want to come off
like people that like that guy,

259
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,021
I'll get you out of this whole,

260
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:27,730
don't worry if you meet those
guys at a bathhouse. Yeah,

261
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,220
no Amanda.

262
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,770
But the UFC actually I know the guys
did all that. Like that guy. I Dunno.

263
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,740
I guys that like, yeah, I don't know.

264
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,320
I don't know his music
to be honest with you.

265
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,110
I've only heard like one thing on
the Internet. I was like, okay,

266
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,183
it's just not my shit.

267
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,260
We live in a world of sheep nowadays and
nobody has the common sense to try and

268
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,340
figure out what's good.

269
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,010
Is that it or is it just different?
No,

270
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,550
there can't be. It's, it's,
it's global, this thing.

271
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,000
And now nobody can really tell
me that that shit is really good.

272
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:02,840
It's just what's hot and this is
what this is like, oh, this is what,

273
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:06,620
this is what we should like. They're
just fucking sheep. Like back in the day,

274
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,080
you would have to search
out what you wanted to like.

275
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,070
Do you think that's the case
with all this electronic music?

276
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,810
Not On, well, a lot of
it like people, you know,

277
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,550
try to be different or whatever
and you know I, and then they're,

278
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,503
they're failing at it.

279
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,440
I got to re re very respectfully disagree.

280
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,450
I've produced shows for Armin van Buren
who is actually the number one DJ in the

281
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:32,340
world over at ts though.
The guy is big and you press play.

282
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,750
Yeah, absolutely. He's depressed. I
remember when he used to Dj. Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,670
That was Armand Van Helden. Oh, okay.

284
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,320
The van Helden use held in. Is this
another one? What's the other guy's name?

285
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,450
Van Buren. Yeah. That's ridiculous.

286
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:49,720
You can't be Ben held in the field
of God's Van Buren got a year apart.

287
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,360
So crazy.

288
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,930
But the argument is that
these guys actually produce
their own music, you know?

289
00:15:55,931 --> 00:16:00,430
So for example, like we, when
I work with Mike, he brings,

290
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,800
he scratches in his own mixes
using vinyl and using Serato.

291
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,430
Camera's on my hands. Yeah.
Just so they could watch. Yeah,

292
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,610
he has sets where he just
creates a musical scratch.
Like where's on your hands?

293
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,580
It's sometimes you went on with, with
the, with the beach boys. I had a finger.

294
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:20,840
Can you mean like an oh wow.
Spotlights.

295
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,870
So you know, just on the
insurance, so that my show too,

296
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,250
we have cameras right on the turntables.
So I'm,

297
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,280
so people see that as a live performance.

298
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,130
Art is not something that
you're painting a picture,

299
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:36,690
you're really painting your audio, Pitney
picks out and you're doing it right.

300
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:37,524
And exactly.

301
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,590
And if he wants to change his mind as to
what song he's playing, he can do that.

302
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,440
Yeah. How much of your set
list is improvised and how
much of your, I mean you're,

303
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:49,050
you're completely in control.
A lot of it's improvised.

304
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,550
That's something that you just
don't get from one of those two.

305
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,830
Yes. That was the other guys. It's
programmed and it's program to,

306
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,570
to coincide with the music.

307
00:16:57,571 --> 00:17:00,810
So really all they're paying money
for is a light and laser show.

308
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,540
So the person who should be making
the money is the fucking lighting guy.

309
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,990
Exactly.
Isn't it funny though,

310
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,450
that like with every generation,

311
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,400
the generation of today gets shit
on by the previous generation.

312
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,510
I mean, just the fact that you're
in like old school Dj Jan. Okay.

313
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:22,650
Just stop and think of that. Because like
in the eighties and the seventies when,

314
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:23,311
when,
you know,

315
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:27,030
when rock was king and when like the
Allman brothers and people were in a

316
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:28,380
Leonard Skinner and shit like that.

317
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,740
And then the 80s came along and deejaying
came along and people were like,

318
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:36,390
look at this fucking new ridiculous
shit that's not music exam. You're like,

319
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:40,380
listen to this new shit where they just
press play. That's not fucking music.

320
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:41,760
While you're not playing records,

321
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,350
it's like every generation gets
shit on by the previous generation.

322
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,010
That's, I mean, it's, it's, it's
the, uh, the evolution of man.

323
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,180
It's funny though, like we're the old
guys shitting on the, the new, uh,

324
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:57,900
the new breed. I went to see it like,
I can understand, like, you know, I,

325
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,730
I take it back to before it got
digital and the house Djs, you know,

326
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,430
like, uh, uh, like, uh,
all those other guys,

327
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:09,210
Paul Van Dyke and fucking all
those guys out of England.

328
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,960
I never liked the shit they played,
but at least they played it.

329
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,740
You know what I mean? Yeah. Right, right.
It's not about what they're playing.

330
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:20,340
It's about the fact that people are
paying money for these people to not do

331
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:24,510
anything. But isn't there an
art to creating that shit?
There's most certainly is,

332
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,130
right? No. There's a lighting guy who's,

333
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,850
there's honestly a choreographer
to their sets who, who says,

334
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:32,760
here's what I'm going to do for
you. Right. But the music itself,

335
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,360
it has nothing to do with the music.
The music all sounds exactly the same.

336
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,420
So it doesn't really mean exactly.
So, well, most of them are producers,

337
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,110
producers that want to be Dj's. Oh,
really? Yeah. They figure, okay,

338
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:43,891
we're making the music,

339
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:48,420
so why don't we try to learn how to Dj
and it just doesn't, Huh? Isn't. Yeah.

340
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,540
People, when someone creates
dope electronic music,

341
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,700
when there's one like beat that you hear,
that's really cool. That is a creation.

342
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:00,300
Yeah, absolutely. That's made it is sick.
It is. Yeah. So that is like someone,

343
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,620
someone created that. Yeah, that's
not right. That's not the problem.

344
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:09,120
The problem is passing yourself off
as a DJ. Yeah. And you're not DJ.

345
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,140
That's what might be called themselves.
Let's call them an electronic musicians,

346
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:14,040
let's call them that.
Right?

347
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,800
If they're standing up playing the
music in front of you, I'm impressed.

348
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:20,430
But that's the thing would you would, you
can't do that with that stuff. So what,

349
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:23,190
what could they do if they're
going to do a live show, say, Hey,

350
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm going to just put my shit on.

351
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,910
I'll be back later to say
thanks and good night. Hey Go.

352
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,430
We just press it and walk off.
Why would they,

353
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
what are they going to
do when they're on stage?

354
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,970
I mean they kind of have to
do this and like pop and shit.

355
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,120
It created it all before.

356
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:39,720
So it's a weird sort of
hybrid of performance.

357
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,340
Our end we thing they're not even
doing this.

358
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:48,150
Like make Harrison Ford's and being in
front of the screen and an Indiana Jones

359
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:51,960
movie like flexing every time
Indiana Jones kick some ass. Joe,

360
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,880
do you ever see this,
uh, this video of Mike,

361
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,990
this is getting kind of give an example.

362
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,960
How does that compare to like
electronic music? We don't see it.

363
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,930
We don't see anything.
Yeah.

364
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,513
What about

365
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,940
ladies need capital?

366
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,443
That's good.

367
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,160
Oh boy.

368
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,650
Don't stop getting giddy.

369
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,330
Made a face to face just
to see how you can quit.

370
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,820
That's my favorite move because
it looks like you're doing a lot,

371
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,200
but you're really just one beat behind.

372
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,160
You're going to look like you're doing
okay for the folks at home. One move.

373
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:42,880
Is that, what is it? Boy, he was drugged,
but here he's juggling right there.

374
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,830
He was always good at juggling.
That was this.

375
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,040
I think that was your
strongest point. Right? Gotcha.

376
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,920
Did you say that was your favorite
thing to do? What is explained?

377
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,580
Juggling going back and forth with the
same record and making a beat with him,

378
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:59,290
making it my own beat and
kind of remixing it. And you,

379
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,310
what was the competition that you won?

380
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:05,700
Like a bunch of years in a row and they
wouldn't let you in or anymore? DMC? Yeah,

381
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:09,000
it was the DMC. What's the
DMC first I won the, uh,

382
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,220
the new music seminar in New York,

383
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:14,980
battle for world supremacy and in
92 [inaudible] the battle for world.

384
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,910
So this was like the
biggest battle in hip hop.

385
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,920
Like this is where you
battled the cream of the crop.

386
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,740
Who did your battle that you're
in? I, I battled, um, rock raider.

387
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:27,630
I battled Dj Honda from Japan. Japan?
Yeah. And how do you guys battle?

388
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,080
How does that work? It's a five
minutes to you. Five minutes for me.

389
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,350
And then the audience insights audience.

390
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,980
Do you base it on how loud the cheers are?
Wow. So how intricate the routine was?

391
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,860
I mean, how do they judge? Like how's the
audience judge? Well, the judge is judge.

392
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,780
Judge. Okay. I'm just
saying like, do they,

393
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,260
is it because the audience cheers the
loudest for you? No, no, no. It's,

394
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,190
it's actually about skill.
I could hate judges.

395
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,350
That was the last year of
a seminar, wasn't it? Yeah,

396
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,630
it was the last year and then yet we
were just up there then, you know,

397
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm just like, you know, clowning
and you know, facial and you know,

398
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,830
I'm kind of like flipping off and the
whole thing and people like that. So yeah.

399
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,700
So you want how many years in a row?
Three and then they said you'd done yeah.

400
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:09,510
And then DMC, DMC decided to
make us judges. Oh really? Yeah.

401
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,340
We were ready to defend
for the fourth year.

402
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,390
And it was that rock steady
djs or was that just, it was
just me and Cubert. Yeah.

403
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,020
Why did they decide to make you a,

404
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,760
that seems like that would be Kinda
cool to have like a store of the Lance

405
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,260
Armstrong of Dj and that just
fix it keeps dominant. No,

406
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:25,710
because then there's guys like
Mike and Cubert that create,

407
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,390
they create sounds like that
other djs go, fuck. All right,

408
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:33,900
I'm going to try that. And then like
they've created between you and Kubrick,

409
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:37,800
you guys created fucking crabbing
and flaring and crabbing and flaring.

410
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,110
You're saying a lot of shit that
no one knows what you're saying.

411
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,140
And like these movies didn't exist before
these guys. Do you know what I mean?

412
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,090
Well, yeah. While
practicing, we name names on

413
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,610
the different scratch techniques and so
we came up with like a hundred scratches.

414
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,150
Wow.
And we named them all with the orbit,

415
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:57,650
the crab that the infamous tweak scratch
I did for the Beastie boys. And, and,

416
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,533
and it just said,

417
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,290
it's just like a log of things that you
memorize and what is it like when you're

418
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,970
scratching,
what is it based on?

419
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:08,180
Is it based on the sounds that are
actually on the record? Like do you know,

420
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,970
like different records are producing
different sounds. So you know,

421
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,700
like where to scratch it
and you have to like it,

422
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,020
it's a different kind of
needle too, right? Yeah. Yeah.
It's the [inaudible] seven.

423
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,410
I mean, there's different
sounds. I do love the 40 footers.

424
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,470
These needles that are designed just for

425
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,880
again, his crew. Are you
a scratch pickle? Yes.

426
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,580
Fuck you talking about scratch.
They're trolling us, Brian.

427
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,590
We have to stand up for ourselves now.
Fuck this man. His crew. Easy sign.

428
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,790
I'm not going down without a part of
the ISP. So fucking scratch pickles.

429
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,190
The invisible scratch pickles

430
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,420
touched the scratch pickle Joe touch it.
So did you guys come back and

431
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,590
does judges and we did. Yeah, we did a
final performance and then on our way,

432
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,710
that's how they should do with them.
I may have like champions become judges.

433
00:24:58,711 --> 00:24:59,221
I get bit,

434
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:03,270
you'd get a much better reading on
who actually won fights then you do.

435
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:06,540
The way it's set up now, the way it's
set up now, there's some people that are,

436
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:11,070
judges are just, it's just mind boggling.
Is it the same way in deejaying?

437
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,240
Yeah. Oh, it definitely going to have
same way. Comedy competitions too. Man.

438
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:20,070
Miles are awful. God, those are discussed.
All was bad. Ugh. It's so subjective.

439
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,550
I've seen a comedy competitions
where the guy who won,

440
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:27,190
like you would just stand back and go,
what the fuck are they saying man?

441
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,720
Well, it's the whole, yeah. Cause
it's art at that point. Right.

442
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:34,380
And art is so subjective. I mean you who
knows what the fuck that judge was into.

443
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,460
Yeah. You know what they can and most
of the time judges are failed comics or

444
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:39,530
whatever.
Yeah.

445
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,310
Failed Martial artists that they hit
the bitterness into it. Right? Yeah.

446
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,700
And there's some that aren't some of the
great, some that are legit. Some of the,

447
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,580
you know, especially in a MMA,
there's some great judges.

448
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,210
There's no doubt about it. It's just
a few standouts that really suck.

449
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,320
I always have names that pop into mind
when it comes to bad boxing judges,

450
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:02,190
you know? Yeah. You hear
their name it there at the
beginning. You're like, oh fuck.

451
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:06,380
Not that part. I'll be surely,
surely Patricia Sharman.

452
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,730
Oh Jesus.

453
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,140
Not again. Yeah. Did
that the packout fight,

454
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:13,350
we were talking about this off
camera before we started. Man,

455
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,820
that was one of the worst knockouts
ever for like an all time. Great.

456
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,760
Yeah. That was a, that was devastating.

457
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,210
That reminded me of when
Hearns knocked out Duran.

458
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,540
Remember how he fucking ice
them in the second round?

459
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,560
Yeah,
but he didn't,

460
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,050
he staggered them before that and then
put them away with one punch and face

461
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:30,880
planted them.

462
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,880
But this was like one shot doom and he
had knocked him down at the same punch

463
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:37,900
like earlier around or early.
The,

464
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,200
that's something Freddie should have
said, you know, keep your fucking,

465
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,860
keep your hands up.
He didn't look the same.

466
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,130
You can,
you can't be like,

467
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,880
what is he a congressman or something in
the Philippines, black man born again,

468
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:55,410
Christian full time Gig as a congressman.
Too many things happening. Yeah,

469
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,720
but I don't think that had,
that was the fact. Right.

470
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:02,721
Here's what I think is my analyze what
I analyze the fight as he tells me shit.

471
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,850
If Desi, what are you telling
me? Shit. Yeah, so a nice,

472
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,130
he just showed us a picture of
Freddy Roach. He tells me, I mean,

473
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:12,170
you're getting that we're actually on a
radio show. No, exactly. I don't know.

474
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:17,120
I just, he just, what does he say, man?
He's gone bananas. Yeah, of course.

475
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,550
Going looks physically different to,

476
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,270
he didn't look as muscular and
there's what I think happened Joe,

477
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,990
and this is just me, I,
when you're fighting,

478
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,850
you hear the ten second bell.

479
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,620
And so I heard the ten second bell and
I know they heard the ten second belt,

480
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,350
right? He got knocked out with one
second left in that room. Right.

481
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,660
He was standing near his corner.

482
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,950
I honestly think he was getting them to
that corner and then he had counted it

483
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:47,310
in his head and figured he would just
walk around Marquez and walked it his

484
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:50,400
corner and he kind of just walked
right into a fucking right hand.

485
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,290
You got a little careless. He, I said,
hey, I think he miscounted and be,

486
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,290
I think he got a little reckless.
He just, yeah, he got reckless. He,

487
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,100
he'd missed a punch. Mean he was coming
forward. Uh, when, uh, mark has landed,

488
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,770
mark has landed perfect too.
That was like one of the best right hands.

489
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,890
It's like textbook.

490
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,090
Manny's head snapped back and you know,

491
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,180
to have a guy that's that good getting
knocked completely unconscious really

492
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:19,320
puts boxing in the light for us because
we never saw that with a lot of guys.

493
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,520
We'd never saw that. Even with Tyson,
he never really got knocked unconscious.

494
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,550
I Cindy's got beat up and beat down
and even the buster Douglas knock out,

495
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:30,750
which was like, I don't know how many
times it was like six years clean. Yeah.

496
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,090
And he was hitting him
on his way down to it's,

497
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,940
Tyson's still was conscious,
you know that guy's Chin was insanity.

498
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,290
But to see like an all time great
get flat lined. That's when like,

499
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,810
like Roy Jones against Glen Johnson.
That was horrible.

500
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,130
That was the first time
he got knocked out.

501
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,830
It was the second don Toyota
knocking on our harbor knocked out.

502
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,440
You know what Roy fucked up or Roy fucked
up his where he went all the way up to

503
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:58,070
heavyweight and then he tried to drop
the weight and go all the way down.

504
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,020
Tactical light heavyweight.
Yeah,

505
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,860
because your body does not want
to adjust like that. You know,

506
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:05,310
he got big when he fought John Ruiz.
John Ruiz.

507
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:09,630
He was a good solid two oh five two oh
six he was somewhere around there and

508
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:14,470
really muscular and moving great and
just looking beautiful. When he was born,

509
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,290
he boxed the shit out of John Ruiz and
he won a heavyweight title and then when

510
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,860
he dropped back down to light heavyweight,
he was getting fucked up man.

511
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,360
His body was just beaten up.

512
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,180
That weight cut was brutal
and when Tara knocked him out,

513
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,450
that was the beginning of
the end of his confidence,

514
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,480
the beginning of the end of his,
of his rap career.

515
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,660
Y'All must've forgot I
tried to. I did. Yeah. No,

516
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,060
I must've forgot body and had
records because I was unconscious.

517
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,100
Here's his rapping wasn't bad in that one
song wasn't bad. It wasn't good enough.

518
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,320
When he walked into the ring
and was wrapping, that was
awesome. It was good TV,

519
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,670
dude. There was a period of a
few years when Roy was on top,

520
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,360
whether it was no one that could touch
him, nobody. You couldn't even touch him.

521
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:05,470
I mean, it wasn't that early literature.
Vinnie, patsy ends and him fought.

522
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,680
It was the only round ever and
copy bucks history or patterns.

523
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,430
I never touched it. Not even
once. Didn't land one punch,

524
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,990
not out grazing. Hook to the body.
Nothing. Nothing. Couldn't touch him.

525
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:20,410
Couldn't get close. Yeah,
that's, he was incredible.

526
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:23,820
When he knocked out Virgil Hill
with a body shot, just stepped in.

527
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,130
I've talked to the liver, send them
to the body. He was unbelievable.

528
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,280
He was unbelievable. But
there's not, you know,

529
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,970
that that can only go on for so long.
That's extreme athleticism.

530
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,210
And he's a defensive defensive
fighter like Floyd is.

531
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,960
Can you imagine them to score
enough? I don't think there'd
be any hits. Well, the,

532
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,760
you know what it is.
For the longest time,

533
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:45,700
Roy was fighting real
smart and real scared.

534
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,770
And a lot of it was because of a Gerald
McClellan. When Gerald Mcclellan, uh,

535
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,100
got knocked out by nine, nine, Joanne
and in London, that was a ugly,

536
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,980
crazy fight.
And Gerald Mcclellan never recovered.

537
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,950
He had bleeding on the brain and
they still are basically, you know,

538
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:03,940
he's in a wheelchair and yeah, he's
fucked up and he's aligned. Wow. That guy,

539
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:08,200
Gerald Mcclellan when I was a
kid was the man. He was the,

540
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:12,760
the scariest guy in,
uh, I think it was one,

541
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,280
he was trying to make one 60,
I believe Macau and my man,

542
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,410
it was the middle weight fight wasn't
middleweight or was it because Nigel van

543
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,870
was a middle way, but we really should
have been fighting light heavyweight.

544
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:26,500
The kid was enormous and he was
cutting a lot of weight and they didn't

545
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:29,200
understand weight cutting
back then the way they do now.

546
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,740
And here's one of the things they do
know is that in the day they also your of

547
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:35,440
the day in the fight way and yes,
you're right. I think that was,

548
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:40,000
that was that then it was a postdoc who
cam, I think it was after Mcclellan even,

549
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,150
I think it was like a late mid to late
nineties where they started the day

550
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,660
before weigh ins. Now
knowing that, I don't think,

551
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,400
I don't think either.

552
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:51,520
Back then they were weren't
replenishing themselves with Ivs.

553
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,540
So what they found out is that all the
people that have had brain damage from

554
00:31:55,541 --> 00:32:00,100
boxing, all of them, it comes from the
lighter weight classes, not brain damage,

555
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:03,250
but deaths where they, you know, brain
hemorrhage, Allen, the guy inside the,

556
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,550
inside the ring, they found out that
that's on the lighter weight classes.

557
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,140
It doesn't really happen
with the heavyweights.

558
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,350
And the reason is that most heavyweights,
they don't have to lose any weight.

559
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,590
It's no weight limit, no weight on
it, and their hands are a lot heavier.

560
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:18,250
You're more likely to get knocked out
rather than beat up. Right, right, right.

561
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,230
And that's what people don't understand.
It's like,

562
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,750
it's not even the big concussions.

563
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,370
It's the continual blows, thump,
thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.

564
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,820
The ones that just kind of jar
your head a little bit. Yeah,

565
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,920
that's my soccer players get
brain damage. Yeah. That's,

566
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,300
that's kinda crazy that a fucking soccer
ball can give you brain damage that

567
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,190
flying at you. I know,
but how weak our brains,

568
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,770
Jackie soccer, Bach and Jackie,
really fucking soccer ball,

569
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,230
it seems like you should get it
hit a soccer ball with your head.

570
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,790
They need to make them at a nerf.
You've gotta think twice for you.

571
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:55,290
Headbutts somebody know you only get so
many of those and you're fucking chamber.

572
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,070
Yeah, they're banking on their
forehead on that one. Yeah.

573
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:00,500
How many headbutts do you have before
you start forgetting second grade?

574
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,080
You know,
we only have a couple of you going like,

575
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,670
well they always say if you're
going to get hit in the face,

576
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,080
tried to get hit in the forehead
because yeah, at least have a,

577
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,820
you have a plate blocking
your brain. Yeah. It's nice
and thick. It's a good spot.

578
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,530
If you can aim that spot right for
somebody who knows? That's what Tyson he,

579
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:16,310
you said he would eat a jab
on the forehead to get inside.

580
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,280
He would wobble his way in and then Bam,
take one on the forehead.

581
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,740
It t he would take one to give to.

582
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,600
Well his style was so unique too
because he was so short for heavyweight.

583
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,340
He's under six feet, which is so
rare to have arguably the greatest,

584
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:31,850
if not one of the greatest heavyweights
of all time. And he's, you know,

585
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:34,450
he's only like five, 11 or
five. 10 and a half. Yeah.

586
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,540
And he would crouch low and so they
had this big disadvantage and trying to

587
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:43,540
punch down at this guy, especially when
you spite and we'd gone to Rita. Yeah.

588
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,240
When did he fight with gonorrhea?
When do you find Berbick Tyler?

589
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,570
He had gone, he was burning.
Yeah. What's the matter?

590
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:58,260
Are you burning? That is so
funny. What did you do to Burbank?

591
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,660
Oh Man. Second round I became the
youngest heavyweight champion ever.

592
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,940
This physical freaks that will
along with like discipline,

593
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,160
like when you get a
physical freak like Tyson,

594
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,910
he was unquestionably a physical freak,
but you get a physical freak, right?

595
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,110
Like him.
And then discipline and focus as well.

596
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,510
Like it's like the young days of Tyson.

597
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,850
You don't keep that shit up
for a certain amount of time,

598
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,900
like the amount of Rpms
that guy was spinning at.

599
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,460
But if you go back to the
young days of Tyson, God damn,

600
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:30,050
what a scary animal that was.

601
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,720
To have a guy that it was
not just the physical freak,

602
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,820
but was also single minded,

603
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,230
completely focused monastic and his
lifestyle dedicated to being a champion.

604
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Those are just too hard to keep focus
after you get it to you, you'll just,

605
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,310
you want to enjoy the
fruits of your labor wars.

606
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,050
You're talking with custom motto.
Yeah.

607
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,260
While he was with customers
and Kevin Rooney, he was
doing well for a little bit,

608
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:54,830
but I don't think he ever
respected ruining the way
respected, respected Rooney.

609
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,850
Rooney was like a connection to costs,
but it wasn't the same guy. I wonder,

610
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,550
I wonder what happened if he had ever
got teddy atlas back in his corner.

611
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,860
Teddy and him didn't get along.
I probably would have wasn't terrible.

612
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,890
You Teddy pulled a gun on him because
Mike pushed up on his knees or some shit.

613
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:14,210
It was bad. Something bad. Yeah. It
got pretty crazy. Whatever it was.

614
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,950
Yeah. That was fucked up. Um, yeah. So I
don't think there'd be working together

615
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,710
on you and you all know.

616
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,300
So what do you guys figure fuck
doesn't work is fine or what?

617
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,733
I think he's done,

618
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,320
I don't know if you know tires
from boxing at least for a year.

619
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,120
I had called mark has before
that fight. Like I said, that's,

620
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,530
that's who's going to win. And I just
said, because Marquez seems pissed.

621
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,590
Yeah. He has something.
He actually, he's like,

622
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm not leaving until the judges and
you could just see it and there's work

623
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:47,160
ethic and the way the fucking look in his
eyes while he was training, I was like,

624
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,510
that guy is going to fuck packet.
You know,

625
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,600
his trainer is suspect for having a knife.

626
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,070
Nacho. Yeah. No, no, no,
no, no. That's the physical
training. You heard about that?

627
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,460
Well he was in the involved in the ball
code trial. Yeah. Turned state's evidence.

628
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,140
Exactly. The Victor Conte
Group. Oh Wow. Yeah.

629
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,280
The contact was torturing him all
week on Twitter. I was watching.

630
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,900
That was pretty interesting.
You know,

631
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:15,780
we had content on the podcast and he's
explaining to me how the whole ball code

632
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:19,350
thing went down. And uh, you know, he
said that if this guy's working with him,

633
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:22,010
he's doing roids yes. Period.
And if you look at them,

634
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:23,730
it's body looks fucking totally different,

635
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,160
but did according to Victor Conte in the,
uh,

636
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,730
the test that they give you in Nevada,
he said, those are intelligence tests.

637
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,220
He goes, those aren't drug tests,
right? He goes, if you're intelligent,

638
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:36,840
you pass him. Right? He's like, Damn.
Wow. Yeah. It's like Veda testing.

639
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,950
If apparently is like voluntary
anti-doping association,

640
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,560
they come to your house random times.
You never know when they're coming.

641
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,930
They might, they might not come for
a week. It might be there tomorrow.

642
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,050
You might need to ring your doorbell at
seven o'clock in the morning and wake

643
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:51,070
you up. You know, unfortunately
come and dress them yet,

644
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,180
which sucks for a fighter because
they need to Goddamn sleep.

645
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,580
They don't want to have to deal with when
you wake and their sleep cycle up and

646
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,540
taking blood out of them, that shit,
that shit, they should work out. I'm,

647
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:03,150
I'm down for the whole voluntary
aspect of it, but you can't do that.

648
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,860
I don't think you should.
You should be able to do that.

649
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,590
I don't know if they test blood or urine,
but if they do tell us blood,

650
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,230
I hope it's a small mountain because
these guys are training and then they just

651
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:14,190
show up to do that because some guys have
said no to it that aren't even on the

652
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,390
gr on juice.

653
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,960
They just don't want to deal with the
constant testing because they will,

654
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:22,500
they will wake you up. He was like,
he was, he didn't like the, uh,

655
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,810
well, uh, Rory Macdonald, Roy McDonald in
his last fight was talking about how the,

656
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:30,930
he did his first test and it was
annoying. They woke them up, you know,

657
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:34,620
and he was a, when you're your fighter
man, your sleep is fucking gigantic.

658
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,140
That recovery time is absolutely
huge. It's like a comic.
Yeah. So I mean, as long,

659
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,330
I mean, there should be a way that they
can do it where it doesn't interrupt you.

660
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,710
Okay. It doesn't mean you can't mask
it. You know, if you're doing steroids,

661
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,470
all right, and they say, we'd like you to
come in at three o'clock this afternoon.

662
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,100
There's no way you're going to clean
your system of steroids by three o'clock.

663
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,590
Yeah. So they should be able to
do that. Like where you know,

664
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,720
you come in when the guy's not,

665
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,570
or they should at least go to them when
they're in the gym or something. Yes.

666
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,100
Yeah. You just finished
training unlimited. That's
a great idea. But, but um,

667
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,990
the way they say it is that a guy like
mark has is what you could do is you

668
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,670
build them up in the off season,

669
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,500
you have them on all kinds of shit and
then you slowly taper them off and then

670
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,950
by the time the fight comes, he test
normal. He doesn't have anything,

671
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:23,040
but he has all the results of
all this stuff in his body.

672
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,150
He has all this thicker muscle and more
endurance and all this craziness and

673
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:31,230
they don't test for EPO. Epo Is this, uh,

674
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,620
that's the shit that the cyclists use
that makes your red blood cell count

675
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:38,770
higher. So it makes you carry
more oxygen in your blood.

676
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:41,740
It's very dangerous so you can get
strokes on it. Is that what lance did?

677
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,530
Supposedly.
Allegedly,

678
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,100
but I think he passed like
500 tasks or something nutty.

679
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,400
He was a bad motherfucker passing tests,

680
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,490
cancer and, but you know this, there's
guys taking all kinds of stuff.

681
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,850
I heard those guys like taken by Agra and
shit. Yes, you're right. You're right.

682
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:04,700
And taken by Agra is actually
a performance enhancing drug.

683
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,640
Enhances my performance.
Has

684
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,060
lifted his shoulders up automatically.

685
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,520
Multipurpose. Yeah, the
on the box. But it is,

686
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,830
yeah, the athletes use that.
Believe it or not, no joke.

687
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,920
Athletes use it for endurance,
for muscular endurance.

688
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,800
Something about it helps the blood
flow just like the same way it does.

689
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,750
Your Dick is a reason why it gets your
Dick hard like that. Okay, so it's an 80

690
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,490
but it also gives you us cold like
symptoms does it? Yeah. Park close up.

691
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:38,640
Plugs up your nose, nose and I
got a fucking giant one. So it's,

692
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,190
it's a pain in the ass. Perfect for
your face though. I think it's great.

693
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:43,680
You're a handsome devil.
Don't sell yourself short

694
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,340
Joe. You know, Russell at one
point in time, like if, if,

695
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,330
if he had to choose another career outside
of music or outside of standup comedy,

696
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:58,130
it would be deejaying. It's true.
You know, I started in 85 and uh,

697
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I had an SLB to hundreds straight tone
on a straight tone arm and they were belt

698
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:07,740
drive. Then I would scratch on them and
then the belt would stretch and fall off.

699
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,880
Yes. I used to put 75 cents on my needles
to make it stick. Yeah. I used to,

700
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:13,920
I used to, I stay at a
quarter, whatever do shows,

701
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:17,520
we do jokes and then spend a record then
do some more general because my two djs

702
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:20,790
are really dope, you know, spin bed.
Of course, that's one of my djs.

703
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:22,110
And starting from scratch from Toronto.

704
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:24,420
Those are my two guys and they
were on four turntables. Dope.

705
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,000
So scratch place instrumentals and spin
bad cuts acapellas over it and it's

706
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,540
pretty fucking sick cause they don't
rehearse. They just go out and play.

707
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,950
You should actually give him some shit,

708
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:36,930
talk on a vinyl like
fuck you blah blah blah.

709
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,180
Well they had and had them
scratch that they had,

710
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:42,630
they could just upload it to their Serato.
When you do stand up comedy shows,

711
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:44,260
do they play a background music?
No,

712
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,430
they play like when people are
walking in and they play me on,

713
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,320
they play me off and then they
play while people are leaving.

714
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,810
Maybe they should play in the background
while you're performing and you can

715
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:56,140
fucking like perform like a rant over
sending them to do the coolest music.

716
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,750
Henry Phillips in Doug. Stan hope did
that. Did you ever listen to that? Yeah,

717
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,520
that's my favorite of Doug's a cds.

718
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,640
I think it's something to take the edge
off. I think that's what it's called.

719
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,830
It's awesome man.

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,900
Because they caught this crazy groove
while they were doing it and Henry's

721
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,030
playing like was he
playing Acoustic Guitar?

722
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,400
He's playing acoustic
guitar behind it and uh,

723
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,950
Doug is talking and like
goes with the music.

724
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:24,220
Was it acoustic guitar was at
Piano Guitar, didn't Mitch?

725
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,480
Mitch Hedberg did one too with piano.
I can't remember.

726
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,980
I wasn't when I was in New York last year.
Jeff Ross had keyboardist on

727
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,980
beside them on still rolling. Yeah.
Yeah. Guys have done it. Yeah. The,

728
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,400
the one that I really liked though
is Stan hopes, Stan hope. And um,

729
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,730
that other dude, um, they uh, they,
they just do Henry Phillips. They were,

730
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:48,860
they were friends.
So like the music,

731
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:52,820
he knew what the bits where so he knew
like where Doug was going and like how to

732
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:56,780
ramp up and it was fun. It was like,
it made it cooler. It actually,

733
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,680
it actually aided it.

734
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,990
So you have a,

735
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,970
a new CD that's coming out or new download
tomorrow coming out that's completely

736
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:05,520
free.
It's on my website.

737
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,530
It's called the bolt one 17
mix. Is this your free time? Uh,

738
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:14,850
releasing like a free for everyone. This
is free. That's great. What's on it?

739
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,180
It's a just a bunch of craziness.
A Lot, a lot of scratching.

740
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,000
I, I like that. A lot of scratching.
What happened to DJ? Hurricane?

741
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:25,330
How'd you get his Gig?
Whose Dj?

742
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:30,000
Hurricane Kane was the DJ before I got,

743
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,550
before I got on. But he was
not a good teacher. Yeah.

744
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,920
Funny is when, you know,
the guys flew me out,

745
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:40,921
they knew me and I used to send the
boys like Dj videotapes and stuff and so

746
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,050
they were like, Yo, want to fly you
out to work in the studio? I'm like,

747
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,560
you kidding me? I mean, this is
my all time favorite rap group.

748
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:50,860
It's like joining fucking led Zeppelin.
You know what I mean? I was like,

749
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,723
fuck yeah.

750
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,960
So I went out there and stayed with them
for like a whole week in the studio and

751
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,720
did what we needed to do,
did 10 songs,

752
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,480
and then they pulled me into this one
room. We all sat in Florida was like, Yo,

753
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,730
we want you to be our DJ.
And I'm like, Holy Shit.

754
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,750
Then immediately I thought about a
hurricane. I'm like, what about her game?

755
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,320
He goes, oh, he's just a
rapper. Don't worry about him.
He loves, he loves rapping.

756
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:16,340
He's not a DJ. So, um,

757
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,370
the next day they sat around
this conference conference
table to give hurricane

758
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,960
a call and um, they, they reached
him on a four way. They go, hey,

759
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:30,010
and he's like three Amigos, what's
up? What's going on? Um, cane,

760
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,460
um,
we got this other guy and um,

761
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,540
we really like them and we want
them to be our DJ. He's like,

762
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:42,100
we're really, and he's like,
well, it's my birthday today.

763
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,280
Oh,
I called him on his birthday.

764
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,740
Oh Shit.

765
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,590
Happy Birthday.

766
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,020
Yeah. And it was like, that made me feel
real bad. I was just like, wow, how rude.

767
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,830
I wasn't in it to do what
I did, but you know, just,

768
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,940
it just worked out the way it is

769
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,490
sometimes you've got to do
what you gotta do though.

770
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:00,670
If you're in a band and it got shot.

771
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,600
L L used to have his DJ cut
creator who was not a good Dj.

772
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,820
And then on his like second album, he
brought in a guy named bobcat. Yeah.

773
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,920
Who was a good DJ,
but he kept cut critter or onstage.

774
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,800
But bobcat would do all the scratching
and everything. It was like,

775
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,980
this is my homie. I got to give him his
job. I got to kill him, keep his job,

776
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:24,630
but I need somebody can do this job. So
they had two people doing, yeah, two Djs,

777
00:44:24,631 --> 00:44:25,590
but only one would do something.

778
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,340
Wow.
Well that's pretty loyal of him.

779
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,750
Like he had the homie that wasn't
capable of doing what he wanted,

780
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,010
but he wanted to keep
them there cause you're my

781
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,850
homie. But I got another guy that could
do it too, but keep you on the side.

782
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,940
It was kind of confusing,
but he had two DJ's.

783
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,940
Jazzy Jeff told me a story
about when him and uh,

784
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,180
he was on tour with a ll and back in
like that around 87 or something and they

785
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:51,950
were in the hotel room and Jazzy Jeff
and Bob cat got into a little battle in,

786
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:55,320
in his room, a Dj battle
in the room, his room,

787
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,120
he was doing shit that like a bobcat was
really dope. So he could do everything.

788
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,820
But then Jeff had to step it up and did
some shit that he couldn't do and he was

789
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:03,540
like, all right, fuck it.

790
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,000
Can you imagine if he in the room next
to these motherfuckers and try to get

791
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:10,110
some sleep? They're having a DJ battles.
Well, I'm sure it wasn't very loud.

792
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,170
It's like what you guys have
like families to call right now?

793
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:17,670
Like we're on the road.
No Dj battle in the room.

794
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,450
That's hilarious.
How do you,

795
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,270
so when you DJ battle and you just like
one person will go and they'll go for

796
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:27,330
five minutes and the other person goes,
if it's like a friendly battle,

797
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,690
it's just like, hey, you guys can do a
cut. You try and copy each other's cards.

798
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,990
Okay. And then one guy will
get more intricate and you
be like, all right, fuck it.

799
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,060
You win. That's what happens. What
happens in the real competition.

800
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,970
It's like there's no friends
involve your friends on the outer,

801
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:45,240
but not when in it you can, you're
going to, you're getting flipped off.

802
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,290
You're getting personal,
personal. They got,

803
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,640
they got little phrases on their vinyl
that says, fuck you and your mother. Fuck,

804
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:57,360
fuck, fuck you and your mother and dead.
That's towards you, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

805
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:59,880
And they'll have just for that moment,
and they'll have your name,

806
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,680
they'll have your name, they'll say
it mix master Mike and you know,

807
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,790
really sucked or whatever.
Wow. It gets personal.

808
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,350
All they do that type of shit. And so
they turned comedy. It turns kind of calm.

809
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,800
You're like, people are laughing. Wow.
So did they make their own records?

810
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,670
Is that what it is? The
press, her own vinyl? No,

811
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:17,830
they would just find sound
bites from other records. Yes.

812
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,000
What was that guy in Denmark says?
Mix Master Mike on it.

813
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:25,020
You have to find like the right spot.
You can a Beastie boys song.

814
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,720
You could get a Beastie boys song.
Yeah, I think her name's, and this song,

815
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,130
that's one of my favorite videos
by the way of my favorite song.

816
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,350
Just how it's set up. My
Man Adam lesson piece. Adam,

817
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,050
how hard was that? Was that one of the
worst days of your life? Yes, I can even,

818
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,360
I know I couldn't function for three
months after that. You couldn't function.

819
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,380
I couldn't cause I mean Adam was the one
that I was calling and he was the one

820
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:56,430
that got me into the group.
How did you find out? Um,

821
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,340
I got a call from ad rock called me
in the morning and he said, you know,

822
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,390
Adam is gone. And I was like, fuck.
Did you just go? It just got real.

823
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,780
I knew, I knew he was suffering,
but I didn't know. I didn't know.

824
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:13,580
I did not understand what you were saying.
You met when Adam died. Yes, I did.

825
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,890
I did not understand. I thought you were
still talking about joining the group.

826
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,320
That's what I've, sorry.
No, no, but you know,

827
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,690
you mother fuckers are not
clear or yeah. Um, having a PR,

828
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,850
a close friend, you,
you'll lose them like that.

829
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,130
It's such a weird thing just to know
that someone can just not exist anymore.

830
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,210
But I was, that was, that was Vernon
Forrest for me. Yeah. When he got shot,

831
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,140
I was all fucked up. You knew Vernon
really well? Yeah, it was, uh,

832
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,520
it was one of my best friends. Yeah.
I was pallbearer at his funeral. Wow.

833
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,950
He always seemed like a nice guy.
He's a fucking awesome dude.

834
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,750
And he had Shane Mosley's number.
Man. That was a crazy little,

835
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,763
it's funny,

836
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,850
there's like certain fighters that even
though like you look at boxing math,

837
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,320
he say, well Shane Mosley beats this
guy and that guy beats Vernon. Yeah,

838
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:02,050
there's no, there's no logic beat
Vernon. It doesn't work that way.

839
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,260
You know Vernon just had
chains number. Yup. It's crazy.

840
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:10,220
He like Jane couldn't beat him.
Just like how my cas has was,

841
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,300
you know, pack yellow, at
least beat him a couple years

842
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,850
packet has the ability to beat mark has,

843
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,160
he just has not really
well decisively done it.

844
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,910
First of all,
the test has an iron jaw.

845
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,200
His jaw is made out of fucking steal
that guy. It takes a tremendous po.

846
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,240
A lot of Mexican fighters just
refuse to go down and yeah,

847
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:31,180
that's also his heart in his
will as it was incredible too.

848
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:36,181
So like that his resolve inside the
boxing ring along with his power and his

849
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:40,870
ability to take a shot and then returned
fire makes it a dangerous fight for

850
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:45,010
pack. Yeah, because pack y'all
has those sort of brawling fights.

851
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,660
Pacbio gets in these,
you know,

852
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:48,970
these crazy fights where
he's like swarming on dudes,

853
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,780
which is how he ran into that right hand.
And he knew, he knew he had him hurt.

854
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,560
So he's coming after him as he
had him hurt worst time too.

855
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,010
The other thing is that people were
saying that Pacquiao, like, um,

856
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:05,020
becoming a born again Christian
might have a killer instinct.

857
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,890
Yeah. Well that too. And,

858
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:11,770
but also might've kept him from doing
some supplements that may be he used to do

859
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,510
and uh, changed his, uh, his
training style because of that,

860
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,460
because physically he
did not look the same.

861
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,690
He didn't look as muscular as he used
to look. You know, it goes with age too,

862
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:25,030
right? Yeah, absolutely. But
it could have been that also,

863
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:27,610
he didn't train the same way because
I remember before he had done,

864
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,720
he was going back and forth as to whether
or not he should do a strength and

865
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:34,630
conditioning. Like you felt like
doing strength and conditioning, uh,

866
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,210
helped us insurance. But then he felt
like it slowed him down a little bit.

867
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,800
I remember he went back and forth,

868
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,470
whether it was one or two fights where
he stopped doing the strength and

869
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:44,980
conditioning and just did like straight
box and workouts and felt like he had a

870
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,110
better result so it could be that too.

871
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,800
He also has a, I think he's going to end
up suffering from compartment syndrome.

872
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,880
What's that on your eye? Calves.
Cause he's got really muscular calves.

873
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:58,190
A lot of fighters with muscular calves
developed compartment syndrome and

874
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,800
because you're on the
balls of your feet so much,

875
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,870
your calf muscles are
so big and so strong,

876
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:04,390
they tighten up and they
seize on you and you,

877
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:06,470
it's really fucking painful your work.

878
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,010
Cause if you notice in between
rounds they were at Kaos camp. No,

879
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:11,860
but I'm saying they were
rubbing his calves in between
rounds where they really,

880
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,370
yeah.

881
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,600
Well I thought there was Marquez.

882
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,410
I think they're rubbing Marquez calves
because mark has has problems with his

883
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:19,710
calves. Cramping. He's had
that in previous fights.

884
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,540
Yeah. He's got boxers legs though. Marquez
Manny has like fucking athletic legs.

885
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,590
Yeah, he's got those giant prince
and I seem legs. Yeah. Crazy fucking,

886
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:27,980
that's where all the

887
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,050
power comes.
A lot of people don't realize that.

888
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:32,810
You look at a guy's power punching and
you think that it's all from his own

889
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:34,370
fucking crazy thighs and calves.

890
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,900
It's the guys who like Tyson
has kind of thighs and calves.

891
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:41,420
Fuck means that's where
we had skinny ass ankles.

892
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,350
Did he really tighten at some
skinny ass ankles? Really? Yeah.

893
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,310
How would you know I'm going to fight
mattress ankles. Come over here.

894
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,800
Let me see those games. You know
what? I got gigged by the way.

895
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,580
I was at the grove couple of weeks ago.
I bumped into Eddie Bravo. Oh yeah.

896
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,670
I got all nervous when I talked to
them. Really? Why? I don't know.

897
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,170
He's a nice guy too, but I just, you know,

898
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:04,190
I'm like cut to me as I'm a fan of things
that the man and I'm a genuine fan of

899
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,560
thing, so when I meet
people that I admire that I,

900
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,950
I know I can't do shit they can do right.
I automatically go, holy fuck. Yeah.

901
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,280
It's weird that someone
special still get a little,

902
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,460
a little star struck when you meet
someone. Cool. Yeah. That's strange.

903
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,990
When you did a David Letterman that
wouldn't that the check it out video, uh,

904
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:24,080
was that all one take or was it, did
you guys get that a few times? Cause I,

905
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,780
that was one of the most memorable uh,
videos where you, you, you started off in,

906
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:32,620
in the, in the studio and they
started off coming out of a subway.

907
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,740
That was all one take, one take for
real. And it was all in intake. Really.

908
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:40,080
Guys came in from the subway.
That is bad ass. Yeah.

909
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,900
So they were using wireless mikes
walking down the street. Oh my God.

910
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:45,670
That's incredible.
And this was one take,

911
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,650
one take and I can hear them
in my monitors. So I'm like

912
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,120
doing it as, as if there were there. Wow.

913
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,860
Cause I'm in the audience performing
by myself. I just awesome.

914
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,250
I always felt like I'm doing a Dj show
and then I got some guests that are

915
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:07,600
coming in. Wow. This is amazing. I never
saw this before. One of the best videos,

916
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,650
all your videos were always great,
like intergalactic,

917
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:16,651
your live videos that you always had
your own sense of creativity and what you

918
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:20,950
guys did that was so unique compared to,
you know, along with your music thing.

919
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:24,460
So you, and that's, that's what I think
he's really made you guys one of the best.

920
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,890
Well, you know, what are my real
love with the Beastie boys became,

921
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,220
uh, it came after you got to
fight for your right to party.

922
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,220
Like I thought that was cool. Like I
was listening to that shit in my, uh,

923
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,750
my kitchen with my sister stern,

924
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,090
her friends when we're in high school
were like, wow, like brass monkey,

925
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,320
what a cool fucking song.

926
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,520
But then I got ahold of Paul's
Boutique and I remember thinking, wow,

927
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:50,810
these guys are fucking crazy.
Like they're doing some freaky shit.

928
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,260
Like they went from being
like super duper mainstream.

929
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:56,820
You gotta fight spire.
Right?

930
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,110
They went from that to like to
like who they really were. Yeah.

931
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,710
It's the joint bow. Exactly. Yeah.

932
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,360
They had some really cool fuck.

933
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:09,890
As long as it got [inaudible] posts
were good cookie bus. This cookie.

934
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:13,220
Most bothered dude. Yeah man. Cause I,

935
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,910
I remember going fuck these cooky puss.
I was like cookie puss.

936
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:18,110
I like both things here.

937
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,400
And then how long did you work
with the Beastie boys for?

938
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:26,160
I was with the boys for 14,
14,

939
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,260
14 whole years. Yeah. Shoveling the
world and the studio just, you know,

940
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,150
that must've been nuts. It was
incredible. Those are the glory years too.

941
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,010
I remember walking up on stage and
seeing like 400,000 people. I'm like, Oh,

942
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,520
oh my God,
Germany.

943
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:47,520
Oh my room. And he asked
this boot fucking, that's
ironic. Then read Jewish guys

944
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,590
laying out in Germany.
I felt like

945
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,580
this little fucking Spec.
Oh my God.

946
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:56,190
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard
in my life. And I'm on and I'm like,

947
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,590
can all of these people here this shit?
I mean,

948
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,910
can they all hear this shit
or the speakers big enough?
Oh my God, that's amazing.

949
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:05,550
And um, yeah, that's the biggest
crowd ever. Like his biggest,

950
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,770
what's the biggest crowd anybody's
ever performed in front of it?

951
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,730
That's a half a million times.

952
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,640
All right. That sounds about right.
It's gotta be close to the most.

953
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:12,540
That was the most for me.

954
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:18,120
It's in one of those random places like
Brazil or our Australian or fucking

955
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,920
Josh showed me a photo of him on
stage that he took from the audience,

956
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,070
from the stage. Uh, he was
opening for Larry the cable guy.

957
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,650
Larry the cable guy
does football stadiums.

958
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,710
He just fucking football stadiums
and moved up, dude. I mean, you, you,

959
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,670
you can't believe how many fucking
people are there to see him.

960
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:40,020
And Josh took this barrier with
cad cam. Dude, football stadiums.

961
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,100
How many people are in a football game?
It was like 50,000.

962
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,740
He's doing 50,000 seat shows
that it was a sea of human

963
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,160
lievable. This was me in Brooklyn.
Wow. This month. Oh my God.

964
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:57,090
What the fuck is that? I did the,
uh, the Barclay Center. What,

965
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,480
how many people is that?
Uh,

966
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,720
that night was only like 14,000 or
something like that. Only 14,000. Fuck you

967
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,070
humble brag.
I say only because you know,

968
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,460
fucking Jaycee had played seven nights
for 20,000 feet, but still, dude,

969
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:15,800
you're a comic. You did
14,000 people. That is a car.

970
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,670
You didn't know whether your standards,
Michael,

971
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:23,310
you have a phone in front of you.
You should have googled his ass. Hey,

972
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:25,770
check this out. Here's the Germany
who lied to me. But it was like, yeah,

973
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:29,820
my mix master Mike is a big fan.
Oh Dude, this of course. No,

974
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,160
this Mike knows you do comedy.

975
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,610
This is nuts, man. That is

976
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,480
slide to the next one is
San Jose the next night. Or

977
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,070
God, dude, this is crazy.
You're doing these giant places.

978
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,480
How many people is in San Jose?
San Jose was like 10 God damn dude.

979
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,800
What is that like? It's awesome.
Chokes doing jugs for that many people.

980
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:53,410
It's gotta be different than
you and music for him. I mean,

981
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:54,430
I would think that it's,

982
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,030
what is the feeling like connecting
with that many folks and it's fun.

983
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,510
It's, you know, it's one of
those things I, you know,

984
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,500
that it's not going to last forever,
so you really fucking enjoy it. Yeah.

985
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,770
You know what I mean? It's
like, I know eventually,

986
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,640
probably sooner rather than later I'm
going to be back in theaters and then back

987
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:12,474
in clubs.
So

988
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,260
why do you say that? Why would
you, because you're going on here.

989
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:17,160
What are you talking about?

990
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,770
Well, no, you just, you know what you
gotta be prepared for that. You can't,

991
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,070
I don't want to expect anything from
the game. I was just happy to receive.

992
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,120
I should just happy what

993
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,410
you, what you're getting. I think
it's going to keep going, man.

994
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,160
I don't think it's going to
be any difference. Yeah. Here,

995
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,970
here they are in Germany. It just
to show you the crowd size of, uh,

996
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,980
of what it looked like. Watch they go
to a shot right here. That's right.

997
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:35,090
Take them off to this like,

998
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,730
oh my God.
That is just saying,

999
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,440
please, please do routines. Because like,

1000
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,920
Oh my God, for folks at home listening
to this and instead of seeing it,

1001
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:54,590
if you listen to him,

1002
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:58,350
B three, you can imagine this,
this sea of human beings,

1003
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,770
that's what 400,000 people looks like.
Wow.

1004
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,610
Because, because, because,

1005
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,490
wow. Do you enjoy doing the cuts to the
songs that you grew up listening to?

1006
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,560
Of course it's been fucking dope.
Um,

1007
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,250
what did the thing with those crowds
is you get pissed bottles thrown up on

1008
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:20,550
stage. Yes. Bottles. His bottles. Yeah.

1009
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:23,930
You guys common like it happens
all the time. It does happen.

1010
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:27,480
The guys piss in a bottle and they just
hockey if there's just how kit and it's

1011
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:30,390
supposed to be out of love and
it's like, how's that? Come on.

1012
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,080
Who said it's out of love? What we
do to get caught? The dude, the dude,

1013
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:38,000
the dude smoking hag.
Yeah. You're smoking hash.

1014
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:40,620
You probably least likely to throw
a bottle of pissed at someone.

1015
00:57:40,621 --> 00:57:44,280
You'd be like ultra sensitive and
paranoid. I'm like, damn, this fucking,

1016
00:57:44,281 --> 00:57:46,450
it's not going to work out for
me. Throwing this bottle. The Pis,

1017
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,100
what if they do some DNA tests on that
test? They'll start thinking crazy shit.

1018
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,610
You know what does my pet has a very
distinct, yeah, yeah. For diabetic.

1019
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:56,290
And what if you took a multivitamin?
Yeah. What is your asparagus eater?

1020
00:57:56,310 --> 00:58:00,000
And everybody knows it,
but to do scratching on the brass monkey.

1021
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:02,850
The actual scratches.
Yeah. With that song,

1022
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,730
I was getting so fucked up
out of my mind in high school,

1023
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,790
drinking big 40 ounces and whatever,

1024
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:13,590
MD 2020 to brass monkey and to be up
on stage was like weird. Like wow.

1025
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:18,030
You just let the government know that
you drank when it was illegal. Okay.

1026
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,810
Right there. You were retroactively going
to jail. You're going to be in trouble.

1027
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,670
They're gonna move to Canada,
MD, 40 40 mad dog, 2020 mad dog.

1028
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:29,330
2020 is strawberry farms.
That stuff,

1029
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,370
that's the shit that makes
you want to fight. Oh my God.

1030
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:35,310
I don't even know what that stuff
is. Oh, you don't? Oh, I'm Canadian.

1031
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:38,100
A friend of mine that is a mark.
No, I don't know what that is.

1032
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,130
If you have a beef with somebody,
this guy's letting go. Oh, nice.

1033
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,480
A friend of mine and I,

1034
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:47,070
we drank mad dog 2020 and old English
and watch superfly I those mom's liquor,

1035
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:51,810
like a breakdown of it. Look, yes,
yes. Alcohol, right. Whatever it is,

1036
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:54,540
it's designed to make ghetto.
People do terrible things. Exactly.

1037
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,940
It's designed for that.
That's what it does to you.

1038
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,220
It just complete and it's shoot like these
giant jugs of like shit beer that get

1039
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:06,600
you fucked up and it's designed
by the government. Exactly. Yeah.

1040
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,540
Makes you shoot loads in the people back.

1041
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:13,450
It's not a healthy bus dad in that
Cisco, I haven't had that. Oh yes.

1042
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,440
It looks that Cisco was this kind
of same thing. Yeah. Another,

1043
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,710
another form of 2020 where are you from?
You're from the bay.

1044
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,270
I'm from the bay area.
Yeah, from the Yarra. Yay.

1045
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,500
From the,
Yay.

1046
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,163
That's a,

1047
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,520
that's a terrible way to fucking go
out on the town on some malt liquor.

1048
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:34,530
That's a terrible way. It's a terrible,
terrible attitudes or approach. Reality.

1049
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:39,470
The mountain liquor was American beers,
so I never drank. I was 31 really?

1050
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,331
Yeah.
I never drank.

1051
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:43,540
I never did anything till I was 31
what made you drink at 31 what was it?

1052
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:47,410
There was a chick that was a, I was
in South Africa and she was like, she,

1053
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,750
she was asking me why I didn't drink.
I just said I didn't,

1054
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,380
I didn't like the taste of it. I didn't,
I didn't know I was a control freak.

1055
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,750
Right. And then I was like, why do you
drink? She goes, it makes me horny.

1056
00:59:55,751 --> 00:59:56,950
And I was like,
I'll have two of these plans.

1057
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,660
I don't want it to be horny
alone by that dot. Yeah,

1058
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:04,910
but it hurts and you to be confused.
Wow. This is what trunk feels.

1059
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,310
And I was the happiest drunk ever. I was
scared that I'd be a miserable drunk. And

1060
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,870
I think if you're a miserable drunk,
you were at Clinton real life.

1061
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,470
He just barely keeping it together.
That's what I was saying. Alcohol,

1062
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:16,060
just out your shitty personality.

1063
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,600
I mean I know a lot of people who are
actual alcoholics and they were real issue

1064
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:22,570
with not knowing what the fuck
they're doing while they're drunk.

1065
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,230
But for other people they get a little
buzz and just get country with you.

1066
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,050
They know what the fuck they're doing.
They have those thoughts all the time.

1067
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:30,130
They just don't entertain them.

1068
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,560
And then they can a couple of drinks
and then they say all this shit.

1069
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:36,760
They been thinking about you anyway and
you're like, you're gross. Giggle a lot.

1070
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,830
Like a fucking little girl.
I'm a sweetie.

1071
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:41,170
I want to hug everybody when
they're drunk. When I'm drunk,

1072
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,810
I want to be everybody's friend. I want
to make sure everybody gets a drink too.

1073
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,300
So I buy it by everybody and I'm
like, Hey, come on. What do you want?

1074
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:50,740
What do you do? Need Segura and Eddie
Bravo, we're in. We showed up in Sydney,

1075
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:52,190
we were there for the UFC and,

1076
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:55,690
and a cigarette and I had a show
and we were a day early. So we said,

1077
01:00:55,691 --> 01:00:59,490
what do you want to do? Let's go get
fucked up. We made a conscious decision.

1078
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,470
I'm like, my kids aren't here. I
don't have any responsibilities.

1079
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,460
I'm walking to the hotel. It's on the
same block. Let's get fucking hammered.

1080
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,610
So we went up to this bar and
literally just took over the bar,

1081
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,670
but everybody drinks. I spent
thousands of dollars. Everybody in the,

1082
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,970
I know you have,
I bought everybody in the bar drinks.

1083
01:01:15,971 --> 01:01:18,400
We just constantly round of drinks for
everybody you want to do you want to

1084
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:20,950
Drake mother Fucker, get away.
Give me a high five and we just,

1085
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:23,920
by the end of the night,
we were just hammered eating food.

1086
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:25,390
The whole evening was a blur,

1087
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:29,140
but one of those old school nights where
you just really go off like that and

1088
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:29,974
your planet.

1089
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:33,680
Yeah, it's fun. The only problem with
the next day, the next day might,

1090
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,650
my head was in a vice while I
was on stage. I was like, oh,

1091
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,350
I got fucked up on Friday
and not even that fucked up,

1092
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:41,970
but I got fucked up on Friday and I,
I,

1093
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,290
I ended up just not doing anything
Saturday night and watched the fight and

1094
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:48,200
drove back to La is what I did.
But you watching the in Vegas,

1095
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,200
I watched it at my house. I
couldn't get tickets. Yeah,

1096
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:53,600
you couldn't get any tickets. Right. I
wanted ringside and I was like, fuck it.

1097
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:56,810
If I, if I can't be ringside at that
fight, I'm going to watch it at home.

1098
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,550
If that's the one you
want to be there for.

1099
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:03,590
Are you going to be in Vegas for
July or December 31st 29 I want to,

1100
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:08,520
I want can I can, yes. Yes. That's why I'm
asking is the one I really am cause I'm,

1101
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:12,050
I'm scheduling a little squirrel and those

1102
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:15,680
You got it. Yeah. That's going to be a fun
one. Who's on that bill? Cain Velasquez.

1103
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,340
The Santos. Big Boys. Yeah. Yeah.
What you, what do you think? Well

1104
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:24,930

off and I'm not, that's a good or a bad.

1105
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,730
Well you had a big
fight though with Silva.

1106
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:28,530
He fought bigfoot Silva
and beat the shit out.

1107
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,410
He just ran through them like a
fucking hot knife through butter.

1108
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,390
It was beautiful. It was a perfect
fight for him. He like you literally,

1109
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:36,390
he just ran through them,
did everything perfect.

1110
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,950
But I think that cane already
has been knocked out by junior,

1111
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:43,170
so we know that junior can win.
We know that junior,

1112
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:46,410
if he connects with that haymaker
haymaker right hand like you did.

1113
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:47,520
We know that he can win.

1114
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:52,790
But the question is can junior deal with
canes pace if cane doesn't get knocked

1115
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:56,580
out in the first couple of rounds,
that's the real,

1116
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:00,810
the real plan for cane is to
drag jr until like the third,

1117
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:04,410
fourth and fifth round because
cane has ridiculous endurance.

1118
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,060
His endurance is just insane.

1119
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,440
Like he does conditioning drills
and he beats like lightweights.

1120
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,910
It's really nuts for God.

1121
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:15,300
It's 240 pounds that has
the kind of conditioning and
the pace that he could put

1122
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:15,780
on.

1123
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,200
So for him it's like imperative that he'd
get out of the first and second rounds

1124
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:23,250
and make junior slowed down a little.
Cause junior's slowed down in fights.

1125
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:26,670
He slowed down in the Roy Nelson fine.
He slowed down and fights.

1126
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,780
You can't slow down against cane cause
cane and the third round it's the same

1127
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:34,050
gas tank that he had in the first round.
So that's when it gets really crazy.

1128
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,640
If Cain forthright Santos has ground game,
it's very good.

1129
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:39,660
You don't ever see it.

1130
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,760
You don't ever see if it's because
it's not going to get a job.

1131
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:43,950
But also because it's
takedown defense is insane.

1132
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,750
It's take down the fence is fantastic,

1133
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,450
but the reason why it's
takedown defense as goods,

1134
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:50,880
because he fucking works
on it tremendously.

1135
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,710
He works on all the
aspects of his wrestling,

1136
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,700
not just the take downs but take
down defense and take down all fence.

1137
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:59,850
I mean he took down Shane Carwyn when
they fought and it was almost like to

1138
01:03:59,851 --> 01:04:03,480
prove a point and his and his
ground games as far as submissions,

1139
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:05,520
it's also top notch.
People don't realize it,

1140
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:09,390
but he's like a high level brown
belt, almost a black belt. He remains,

1141
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:12,840
you might've be black belt now I,
I'm not sure, but whatever it is,

1142
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,340
I get word from the people that have
trained with him like, and he's,

1143
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:16,800
and he's bad motherfucker on the ground.

1144
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:20,750
Like you just don't see it because he's
knocking everybody senseless, you know?

1145
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,940
And he's, he's so good with his boxing,
but he doesn't have any holes in his game.

1146
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,560
I mean, he's the fucking UFC
heavyweight champion. You know,

1147
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:31,830
you really can't get to that position
if you have any holes in your game,

1148
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,130
you know, and especially what
like three Carwyn suffered.

1149
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,560
I'm a little out of the loop on
what's, because a knee, right? Yeah.

1150
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:38,394
He tore his name.

1151
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:42,660
I was really looking forward to that
fight with him and now it's Carwyn has had

1152
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,670
a bunch of surgeries so far because
Carlin has been through a lot of like

1153
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,760
physical trauma,
not just in fighting but in football.

1154
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,950
He played football and uh,
you know,

1155
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:55,740
he said that's where the majority of his
injuries came from looking at all sorts

1156
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:58,250
of back problems.
And he had a,

1157
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,400
he had to get surgery to open up
his spinal column and he was still,

1158
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:05,650
when I saw him, it was like maybe
six or seven months ago and we were,

1159
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:08,490
we were talking about and he still
wasn't 100% and he's still, you know,

1160
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:10,800
like things are starting
to move better again.

1161
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:13,700
But he was in constant pain
before and it was a numbness,

1162
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,690
numbness in his hands and shit like that.

1163
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:20,200
And Kang had his elbow scope before the
Franklin fight. How far out? September.

1164
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:25,240
Wow, man. That's crazy. What
was that fight in October?
No, if I was in November.

1165
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,890
Whoa. So he played it just about six weeks
out. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they say.

1166
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:32,590
You can get back to full
training after six weeks.

1167
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:34,640
But for him like that wasn't enough.

1168
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,760
I bet he probably trained while I was
still sore. It's fucked. Telling me, hey,

1169
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:38,201
it was training.

1170
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:42,130
One of the Sore Anderson Silva defended
his title against Travis Luder five

1171
01:05:42,131 --> 01:05:44,170
weeks after he had knee
surgery on both knees.

1172
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:49,510
He had both his knees scoped and meniscus
and like barely trained and caught

1173
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:51,130
Travis Luder in a triangle.

1174
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,530
So it clamped down with his knees operated
on knees and elbow the fuck out of

1175
01:05:56,531 --> 01:06:00,450
him until Travis tapped. There's a lot of
guys that take crazy chances like that.

1176
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:02,620
And Anderson's followed
a fucked up rib to,

1177
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,230
well Anderson has like planning
a, yeah, do g all the way down,

1178
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:09,610
right? I mean, yeah,

1179
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,350
if you get a chance to watch that
guy in the next couple of years,

1180
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,890
you've gotta he got to go live,
folks.

1181
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,130
You gotta you gotta see this guy
before he retired? Dude, I had to,

1182
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:23,020
I had a chance to hold his
belt and really, you know,
really it was like, fuck,

1183
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:26,260
I'm holding his belt. Fuck
yeah. Wow. My favorite fighters,

1184
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:30,050
I mean there's Bruce Lee and then for
me there's Anderson Silva like Anderson

1185
01:06:30,051 --> 01:06:32,770
and this a lot. He's fucking
highly unbeatable. Fuck.

1186
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,790
He says what he does to guys
now is spooky. It's not even,

1187
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,890
it's not even fun to watch anymore.
The last fight,

1188
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:42,350
the last fight where he kept
going to the cage going, Oh yeah,

1189
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,920
you can get me right here.
Yeah. Or Stephan Bonner.

1190
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:48,010
He just picks back up against the
cage. It's like, come on, come on.

1191
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:51,640
Come on over here. And yeah, that's the
niche of the solar plexus. That's true.

1192
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,050
That wasn't nice.

1193
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,960
And he's done that to two people in a
row now and did that same knee on the

1194
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:59,150
ground to chill son and then
standing up to Stephan Bonner. Yeah,

1195
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,080
he's a master at driving.
It flexes.

1196
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,750
His body doesn't reflect the guy
you would think who's doing that,

1197
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,680
you know and bond or is not a walk over.

1198
01:07:06,681 --> 01:07:10,360
You know he's not well liked
Guy Anderson's really strong.

1199
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:12,520
He's a lot stronger than people
think and it's technique.

1200
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:16,660
It's fucking technique is amazing.
His technique and his reflexes,

1201
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:19,660
his speed and his ability
to cover distance.

1202
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,930
He can sneak up on you before you
even know what's happening and blast.

1203
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:26,700
You like his ability to close the
distance is really like inhuman or they're

1204
01:07:26,701 --> 01:07:31,140
going to try and make the Jones fight.
John Bones Jones. Yeah and Anderson.

1205
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,090
That's most likely cause it doesn't
look like GSP wants that right now.

1206
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:38,410
It looks like GSP a wants to defend
his title at welterweight first.

1207
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,760
And the other thing that GSP is thinking
is that if he goes up to one 85 he's

1208
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:45,070
not going to be able to
go down to one 70 again.

1209
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:47,020
Just like with Roy Jones
we were talking about that.

1210
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,070
You gotta be real careful about that
because once your body commits to a new

1211
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,430
size, it does not want
to go back. And like,

1212
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,280
especially over like a couple of months,
whatever you're training campus,

1213
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:00,220
you could have a real hard
time unless you're super,

1214
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:03,820
super disciplined about your diet from
the moment your last fight is to now

1215
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,290
you're going to have a hard time
cutting that weight cause you're,

1216
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,970
you're going to have to trick your body
into getting smaller. And if you don't,

1217
01:08:09,971 --> 01:08:11,680
you're going to be weak as fuck.
You know,

1218
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:15,320
so he wants to make sure that if
he goes up to one 85 that this,

1219
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,570
he's going to stay there.
Yeah. He's got to have,

1220
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:20,300
I think it should have two more fights
before he considers moving off. Well,

1221
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:24,170
I think he's got a fight. Johnny Hendricks
or Nick Diaz. Those are the two first.

1222
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:28,460
Johny Hendricks, the one with
the beard. Yeah. And that
crazy left hand. Yeah. Yeah.

1223
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,470
Johnny Hendricks. I think
nick and him need to settle
that Johnny Hendricks. Well,

1224
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,920
nick and him could settle that business.
That's very much a possibility. Um,

1225
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,760
I would definitely love to see that
fight. I would love to see that fight. Um,

1226
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,650
but I would love to see the
Hendricks fight as well.

1227
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,470
I would love to see DNS versus Hendrix.
You know,

1228
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:48,860
I think that's another
interesting too. Well, you know,

1229
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:51,140
I don't know if Nick Diaz should
have to fight an eliminator.

1230
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:54,920
I think if anybody should
get a title shot, it should
be d as if I had a gas. But,

1231
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,720
um,
I couldn't be mad at you.

1232
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,980
If you wanted to put together a
Diaz versus Hendricks fight Schick,

1233
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:04,190
that would be so sick. That
would be a sacrifice. God Damn.

1234
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:06,050
That'd be a great fight.
You know what else I want to say?

1235
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:09,260
I want to see conduit versus Rory
Macdonald. I want to see that rematch,

1236
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,070
especially after Roy called them out and
after the fight and you know, he said,

1237
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,900
you, you humiliated me. Like I said
it, it was crazy way so uncomfortable,

1238
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,140
but he wants to fuck him up so bad.
The kids lips are trembling. You know?

1239
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,910
I think that'd be a
really interesting fight,

1240
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,000
especially when you see how God damn good.

1241
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:30,730
He looked in that Bj fight his
combinations, footwork, shields, condit.

1242
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,640
Right. Um, when was this?
It's didn't knife fight.

1243
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:38,480
I don't want mine to be Mac.
Maybe pre UFC.

1244
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,080
They don't think so though. But
this is a Joe. What if Rory,

1245
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:46,540
what fought with fought Bj in his prime?
Um,

1246
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:50,120
would have been [inaudible] BJ's client
shirt. Certainly would've been. Yeah,

1247
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:51,320
they fought in a,

1248
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:56,321
I think they fought in rumble on the rock
before Jake shells and Carlos condit.

1249
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,720
Yeah. They know they did
fight. That's right. Yeah.

1250
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:03,920
Jake shields beat him by decision.
I think it was rumble on the rock.

1251
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,660
Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rumble on the
rock. Yeah. Jake beat him by decision.

1252
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:13,350
Jake's uh, quite a bit bigger,
uh, at, uh, well, you know,

1253
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:18,440
he fought a lot at one 85.
Actually, I want to take that back.

1254
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:20,120
I don't think he gets
bigger cause I think Carlos,

1255
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:21,650
if you wanted to confide
in [inaudible] 85 too,

1256
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:22,910
if he just bulked up a little bit.

1257
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,630
And Jake's not really a natural a
middleweight. I mean, he fought middle,

1258
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:31,490
he fought Dan Henderson. He fought,
uh, some, some Robbie Lawler guys.

1259
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:35,830
He's a small guy. You know, he's
a Vegan. Yeah. Yeah. I've been a,

1260
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,390
I've been a Vegan his whole life.
Really? Yeah. Vegetarian at least. Um,

1261
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,180
I mean sometimes he'll, uh, he'll
eat eggs I think. Um, and uh, maybe,

1262
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:48,590
maybe some, uh, some, uh, you
know, dairy or something like that.

1263
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:53,310
But for the most part he's at least a
vegetarian. He's a really nice guy. Yeah.

1264
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,770
He's a great guy. It's just like a really
fucking chill dude. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1265
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:00,830
you know, his, uh, his temperament,
like when you're around them,

1266
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:04,310
you would never imagine it'd be
so ferocious inside the cage.

1267
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:08,330
He just one of those guys that has this
unbelievable ground game, like his,

1268
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:11,150
his ground game,
his Jiu Jitsu is so fucking strong,

1269
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,520
but he can't make his striking like that.

1270
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,500
The levels are so different. He has
this like black belt level, ground game,

1271
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:20,700
like sick ground game,

1272
01:11:20,701 --> 01:11:25,020
and then he has this sort of blue belt
dish stand up game and you can't really,

1273
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,550
it's really interesting.

1274
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,270
Some people's bodies or what maybe
the athleticism that they have,

1275
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:34,970
whatever it is, it doesn't work for
striking. It's real weird, you know, like

1276
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:35,591
striking.

1277
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:40,360
And I always find striking in MMA a lot
different because he can't really plant

1278
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:41,740
your feet the same way,
right?

1279
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,930
So it's more impressive when
somebody gets knocked out in a,

1280
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:48,850
in an octagon for me because they
really had to fucking plan that shot.

1281
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:49,601
Right.

1282
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:52,450
As opposed to w w what Russell saying
for people who don't understand is you

1283
01:11:52,451 --> 01:11:54,910
have to stand in a different stance.
Uh,

1284
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:58,960
you have to stand like more square and
you have to always be worried to sprawl

1285
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:02,980
or to deflect any sort of take
downs and your leg got a check.

1286
01:12:02,981 --> 01:12:04,670
So you stand a little bit
of so many other things.

1287
01:12:04,671 --> 01:12:08,320
You've got to so many variables as
opposed to like a boxing stance where you

1288
01:12:08,321 --> 01:12:09,970
don't ever have to protect your legs.
You know,

1289
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:11,980
you just can't stay tight to your body.

1290
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,860
The problem with that is
when I watch boxing now,

1291
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:17,440
all I think about his leg kicks.
Just someone,

1292
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:22,170
some nasty motherfucker like Pedro Huizar
slamming us Shin into your leg there

1293
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:23,590
and Pedro, his uh, whew.

1294
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,250
That's at all the guys
I've ever seen kick guys.

1295
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,990
He's the one that scared me the most.

1296
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,100
Pedro his are used to kick dude's in
the legs. He used to just go, God Deli.

1297
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,650
You would like hearing them
inside and you're shooting.

1298
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:40,330
It sounded like a two wooden
sticks connected. It was horrible.

1299
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,940
It sounded like someone picked her head.

1300
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:46,570
Liberty fucking giant thighs are
two huge thighs. I've seen him.

1301
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:48,270
I saw him at the Beverly Hills Jujitsu,

1302
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:52,150
kicked the back to that mother fucker
kicks hard. It's not just like,

1303
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:56,140
it's not like you, I wonder how hard
that is when you see him kick a bag.

1304
01:12:56,141 --> 01:13:00,190
You know how much the bag weighs and see
the bag fucking intent from his giant

1305
01:13:00,191 --> 01:13:01,024
shins.

1306
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,470
It sounds like someone's hitting up a
big side of beef with a baseball bat like

1307
01:13:05,471 --> 01:13:09,940
right in me ass part. Just funk. He's,

1308
01:13:09,941 --> 01:13:13,510
he's the one that all the dudes I've
ever seen like kick anybody that that

1309
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:16,090
scared me and made me the most
uncomfortable watching it.

1310
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,240
So I see that in boxing.
No,

1311
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,260
it's just like see like why wouldn't
you just kick some of these legs?

1312
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,810
It's right there.
The real,

1313
01:13:22,811 --> 01:13:27,010
the most exciting striking would be a
professional moy Tai if they really get,

1314
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,300
if they got real money involved and
professional Muay Thai because like people

1315
01:13:31,301 --> 01:13:32,111
love the UFC.

1316
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:35,950
But quite honestly a lot of people liked
the striking aspect of it more than

1317
01:13:35,951 --> 01:13:37,210
they even like the ground aspect.

1318
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,390
Yeah.
I mean you know,

1319
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,070
but now we got this new generation
who grew up training everything.

1320
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,130
Yeah. And the first gen, the
first wave was I do this,

1321
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:49,670
you do that and now and then
those guys that, okay I did this,

1322
01:13:49,671 --> 01:13:52,430
now I'm learning that now
it's like I know everything.

1323
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,760
If you could get someone to bank roll a
top level Moyie Thai guy finding a top

1324
01:13:56,761 --> 01:14:00,090
level boxer and let the Moitai got kicked.
The boxer,

1325
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,310
you would see like people really open
their eyes as to how silly just circular

1326
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:08,320
boxing is. If you've got a
guy who is able to, you know,

1327
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,310
keep you off with the tape and then
slam a couple of leg kicks in, yeah,

1328
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:14,440
you got a useless leg by
the end of the first round,

1329
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:15,790
you can't move right anymore.

1330
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,670
It can't Bob and weave right anymore and
then he starts attacking the inside of

1331
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:21,490
your leg and he starts elbow and you in
the face and he's grabbing the back of

1332
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:24,730
the head and kneeing you and the body.
It wouldn't last like you have a,

1333
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:28,420
you have a couple of minutes to get off
good punches and hurt him. If you don't,

1334
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,810
he's slowly going to chip away at your
foundation and then you're, you're fucked.

1335
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,180
Like we were watching boxing.

1336
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:37,570
We're really watching a very
flawed method of fighting.

1337
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,980
It's a good idea if you're
fighting in a bar, if you don't,

1338
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,700
you don't want to kick somebody as
you weren't slippery shoes and shit.

1339
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,830
It's good to,
you know,

1340
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,780
to know how to stand up because if
you go to the ground with someone,

1341
01:14:46,781 --> 01:14:48,880
there's a whole group of people they
could all start punting you when you're

1342
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:50,780
down.
It's better to be able to stand up and,

1343
01:14:50,781 --> 01:14:53,200
and boxing is the best
way to get that off.

1344
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,730
But for like just a competition
of fighting, it's like man,

1345
01:14:57,731 --> 01:15:01,060
there's a lot of holes in that sport does,
you know if guy could take you down,

1346
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,280
I've forgotten kick your legs.
If a guy can elbow you,

1347
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,370
forgot can grab you and need
your body and your face.

1348
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,680
You're utilizing all your weaponry.

1349
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:11,710
But it's funny how it's
still like super popular.

1350
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,030
Like the watching of like the Marquez
fight in the pack can't fight.

1351
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,470
That was probably like the most
watched sporting event of the year.

1352
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:22,370
Packing on May 23 million
and mark has made six. Yeah.

1353
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,420
Just when you think that the
s the sport is going to limit,

1354
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,660
it's like people are still interested.
This still great fighters,

1355
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,300
this new wave of fighters.

1356
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:36,220
I mean obviously [inaudible] amazing
Broner could Canelo Alvarez. Yeah,

1357
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,530
that's a great, they talking
about making that fine. Oh my God.

1358
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:42,310
Cause he's do Canelo and um, and Broner
that owner, is that what the next fight?

1359
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,440
I think Bronner's. Got It. I
think Broner could outbox him,

1360
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:48,610
I think boners and hit him here. Is He?
I think Broner yeah. Is a lighter weight.

1361
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:54,320
Well what does Alvarez funny one 54 what
is 47 or 54 one of them will Alvarez.

1362
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:59,140
Let's find out. How about a Floyd
vs Canelo I floated out outbox him.

1363
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:02,530
Yeah, but that's all that's left
now. That man he got knocked out.

1364
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,850
I mean he's got not that many
big name fights man. Yeah.

1365
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:11,420
See this kid was born in 1990.
She's crazy.

1366
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:14,560
That Canelo's that's,
he's the little Hussein.

1367
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:18,720
He beats and he's a red headed Mexican.
That beats the fuck out of people.

1368
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:20,590
So that is so strange.

1369
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,850
What a weird fucking cat he is.
His father.

1370
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:26,530
And all of his brothers have dark hair.

1371
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:29,520
Yeah.
Somewhere there's an Irish family.

1372
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:32,260
His mother with a Mexican kid
once a month is a redhead.

1373
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,980
All the other brothers have dark hair,

1374
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:40,540
but his mom's a redhead and that's where
he got it from. That's amazing, man.

1375
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:45,910
That kid is a beast.
A beast with no neck.

1376
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:49,630
Yeah. He's the lightweight
champion. So he's one 35

1377
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,880
that's Canelo's one 35. Yeah, that's
Oscar's boy Oscar. Like I think, I mean,

1378
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:57,210
he's obviously going to grow out of that
weight is going to end up at one 47.

1379
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,670
Well,
it's a third [inaudible] 15.

1380
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,530
No, he's fighting. Well, I'm
sorry, let me rephrase that.

1381
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:06,330
He started out his first weight
class where you want a title. He,

1382
01:17:06,331 --> 01:17:09,860
uh, he beat the current IBF
lightweight champion. I fucked up,

1383
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,340
but he is, um, uh, fighting
as a welterweight now.

1384
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,280
And I think that's where Broner has got
to go because he can't make him wait

1385
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:18,560
anymore. He might've been fighting as a
welterweight his whole career, I think.

1386
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:19,910
I think, um, I'm incorrect.

1387
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:24,440
I think what it's saying that
his third bout of his career, uh,

1388
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:25,420
was uh,

1389
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,300
a guy who at this point in time is IBF
lightweight champion Miguel Vasquez.

1390
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,810
So Vasquez was welterweight and drop
down to light weight. They just,

1391
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:37,130
they phrased it funny. Um,
he's um, yeah, he's uh,

1392
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:40,730
he's only fucking, what
is it, 22 years? 22 years.

1393
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,720
That's ridiculous to be like
that high level at 22 years old.

1394
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:48,070
Our careers are older than him. Do you
realize that? Yeah, they are. Well I'm,

1395
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,740
my career is two years
older than this kid. Yeah.

1396
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,020
It's fascinating watching the young
people like this come up, these,

1397
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:57,140
this new new breed and he's a monster too.
He's a scary fucking kid.

1398
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,000
He had his kid gets dudes down,
you can take a punch to,

1399
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,020
it's like a fucking Wa walking.
I think he was,

1400
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:05,690
I think it was very gentle with
Moseley when he fought him. Really.

1401
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,960
I think it showed him a lot,
lot more respect than he should have.

1402
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,320
Do you think he's just being nice? Just
like, I really do think he's being nice.

1403
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:15,800
I think Delaware of, hey listen, Mosley
and I are partners. I'm a lot of things.

1404
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:18,800
Do you think you can not beat the
shit out of exactly. Just beat him.

1405
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:23,850
It was his last few fights,
man. Especially the, uh, the,
the Kermit citron fine. Oh,

1406
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:27,680
he beat the shit out of, he's a killer
man. He's a killer. He's a killer.

1407
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:31,710
That's a fucking hard way to make
it live it, man. That's a hard way.

1408
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:35,840
When you leave a boxing match,
like, um, did you see, um, uh,

1409
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:40,550
Berto and, uh, Guerrero fight great fight,

1410
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,980
but at the end of the fight when Burritos,
eyes,

1411
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:47,120
both eyes are completely shut and
you're at home going, fuck that.

1412
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,220
Fuck doing that for living.

1413
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,490
Could you imagine if Berto had been
more active instead of having that 14,

1414
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:55,040
15 months off? He wouldn't, I
think you could have squeezed,

1415
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,070
scraped that a decision. Maybe. I
mean, maybe even or not, who knows?

1416
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:01,800
But the bottom line is he was prepared
and Guerra was prepared. And Guerra,

1417
01:19:01,801 --> 01:19:05,270
I'll beat him. I mean, he's a beast
to, and you're talking about, um,

1418
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:08,480
Floyd versus core. Arrow
is a beast man. Um,

1419
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,720
I don't know if he can get in on Floyd.

1420
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:14,400
Floyd is just such a master box or I don't
think he deserves a shot yet. I don't,

1421
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:19,370
true desert beat the fuck out of
Berto like that. I think. I think so.

1422
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,860
I think, I mean, why should I
beat the fuck out of him? I mean,

1423
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,220
closer to decision than that. If Floyd
is going to be picking his fights,

1424
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:28,820
he should pick more competitive
fights. The surgeon, Sergio Martinez,

1425
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:32,930
that would be a great fight. My team
is a lot bigger than him. A lot bigger.

1426
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,900
You know, they're one 54 really
know Sergio can't really, I mean,

1427
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:40,760
he can make one 54 it's a
struggle. So yeah, Floyd,

1428
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,880
he doesn't cut any weight when he gets,
if he's fighting at one 54,

1429
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:47,990
he's not a big guy. Martinez as much
bigger than him. I think it'd be awesome.

1430
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,240
You get store or Shavez Martinez rematch.

1431
01:19:50,241 --> 01:19:53,960
I was at gray fucking fight the good
fight. Oh. Oh. When Chavez knocked,

1432
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:56,960
almost knocked him out. But
the 12th round Brown. Yeah.

1433
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:00,860
It was like Meldrick Taylor,
uh, uh, Julio, Cesar Chavez.

1434
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:04,760
Was that Chavez a fun when he beat the
shit out of her fucking ruined metrics,

1435
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:07,800
correct? Yes. He came out
with a couple seconds,

1436
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,240
three second last Richard Steele stopped
that fight and needing to rightly show

1437
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,540
fucking Meldrick Taylor was
never the same after. Yeah.

1438
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,770
But even though that, that was
like there was a brutal beat down.

1439
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,350
It was the, the, the,

1440
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:27,351
the craziness of the pack out knockout
it clips that like the seeing seeing pack

1441
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:33,060
on like face plant like that, that
was one of the most drum I was scared.

1442
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,540
I genuinely thought he was dead.
He could have been dead. Yeah.

1443
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:39,040
That was one of the most traumatic
losses I think I've ever seen. And Yeah,

1444
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:41,670
the only other Asian, they hit the
canvas like that was Ducote Cayman.

1445
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,670
He didn't even hit the, it's
like that back wilted. He wilted,

1446
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:49,800
he wilted over a barrage of punches and
then his head, that guy in the podcast.

1447
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:52,870
So I'm going to try to get boom,
boom. Manzini on the podcast. Yeah.

1448
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:57,800
My publicist says he knows him apparently.
He awesome fucking awesome. Man,

1449
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:02,160
Y'all watch that guy? Yeah,
he does. I watched that guy
fight a hundred times, man.

1450
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,810
I'm,
I don't know how many times a week,

1451
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:07,470
but when I was a kid was he from Rhode
Island reminded me of Pennsylvania.

1452
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:12,390
He was a bad mother fucker. But Youngstown
was he from Youngstown? Youngstown,

1453
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:17,040
Ohio. Oh yeah. Him and Kelly Pavlik
can't down because another one,

1454
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,180
their kids crazy.
He was supposed to fight ward,

1455
01:21:20,181 --> 01:21:24,180
but then ward ward got hurt and training.
Just recently. Andre Ward get hurt.

1456
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,320
That guy has the best right now. He's the
one of the best. He's, he's incredible.

1457
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:30,210
He's an incredible technician.

1458
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,810
That's the guy that Nick Diaz is doing
is a lot of his boxing work with. Yup.

1459
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:36,990
Do you have a lot of sparring with that
guy? You know, you wonder what Dee has.

1460
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:41,550
His boxing is so fucking sharp. We've
sparred Andre Ward. Dude, come on son.

1461
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:45,000
I'm one of the con fight Saturday. If
you want to go all, you really can't.

1462
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,970
I'm going to be in the UFC, UFC fight
that Saturday. Oh, Nelson versus, yeah.

1463
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:54,390
What time is the confines? What time's
it start? Um, probably it's in La,

1464
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:57,370
so I don't know. Oh, it's in La at the La
Sports are right here. Oh really? Yeah.

1465
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,790
And what's what's going on with Amir Khan?

1466
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,560
Was he to him and he's fighting
Carlos Molina and uh, he's,

1467
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:08,220
he's training that Andre Ward's Jim now
with Andres Virgil Hunter. Oh really?

1468
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:11,340
Yeah. So he left Freddy Roach.
Freddie? Yeah, he left Freddy.

1469
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,380
What did he desired Freddy?
He fired Freddy.

1470
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,930
What did he decide that Freddy was
given? Pack out too much tension. No, he,

1471
01:22:16,931 --> 01:22:21,240
I actually, he told me how it was little
bit of it, but Kahn told me, he said,

1472
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:23,880
you know, he called Freddy after and
spoke to him personally and said, right,

1473
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,440
you know,
we had a good run.

1474
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,070
I think I need to switch up my game
and learn some different things.

1475
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,450
That's not a bad idea,
man.

1476
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:34,590
Sometimes just doing that alone is
really good for a fighter. Just listen.

1477
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,850
He said he's been doing it.

1478
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,520
Learning things with Virgil hunter that
he never ever did in his boxing and

1479
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:39,930
fresh starts are so important,

1480
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,450
especially if you can have a fresh
start with someone who's got a different

1481
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:45,010
approach. You know, I know
like gray Maynard, uh,

1482
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:50,030
went from extreme coture to Aka and
he's very happy with doing that.

1483
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,780
Like it was a big, big, you know,

1484
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,420
big change for him who up to San
Jose to start training there.

1485
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:57,180
But apparently he's experiencing
some great results with that.

1486
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:59,670
I think anytime in your life
you make like a big change,

1487
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:04,410
you force your brain to start re examining
everything you do because the drive

1488
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:06,020
to work is the store

1489
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,210
you go to is different. You
know, everything's different.

1490
01:23:08,211 --> 01:23:11,650
Like it's almost like a little
fresh start is in your existence.

1491
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:16,330
That shit's important for
a creative person too. You
know, and boxing and spine,

1492
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:19,750
the May believe it or not is
creative because like you're,

1493
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:23,440
you're creating those combinations as
you're throwing them inside the cage.

1494
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:27,850
You can't become predictable.
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
And that predictability,

1495
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:28,883
even though people don't,

1496
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:33,070
people think of creativity as being
something that's always constructive and

1497
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:35,980
artistic and not destructive,
like kicking someone's ass,

1498
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,690
but really kicking someone's ass can
be creative because there's a lot too.

1499
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:45,720
There's a groove and a flow to like a
contest to like a guy attacking and you

1500
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:51,100
countering and you moving
and him reacting. There's
like a lot of orchestration.

1501
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:54,280
And when that's why like
a guy like Anderson,

1502
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,910
when he like leads guys
and he's sizing people up,

1503
01:23:57,911 --> 01:24:01,090
then all suddenly front kicks a dude in
the face and knocks him out like he did

1504
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:03,850
in the Vituro fight.
He saw like a movement.

1505
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,590
He saw that that's what happened
with Congo against rich. I'm rich.

1506
01:24:06,591 --> 01:24:09,080
Must've been watching his legs the whole
time and kind get with the right hand.

1507
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:09,920
Well also,

1508
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,340
rich should have never taken
that fight at that weight class.

1509
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:17,780
He hadn't fought in that
weight class since 2006 he
had to move up. Yeah, he was,

1510
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:22,460
no, he didn't move down. He had to been
a loser. Fuck load away. Wow. The looks,

1511
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,210
the photos of the, that
they got of him. Uh,

1512
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:29,240
entering into the Wayans were horrific.
He looked like he was in Auschwitz.

1513
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:31,760
I mean, it's crazy. It's
faced with so sucked in.

1514
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,130
He dehydrated the shit
out of himself for that.

1515
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:38,300
And that's one thing that's really hard
on your body and it's hard on your body

1516
01:24:38,301 --> 01:24:38,871
when you're 20,

1517
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:42,110
but it's really hard and your body when
you're 40 and Kang doesn't have to do

1518
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:45,020
that. Congress losing like a little bit
of weight probably. But Kang is like,

1519
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:49,460
one of those guys had fights like closer
to what he actually ways maybe it goes

1520
01:24:49,461 --> 01:24:51,740
up five, six pounds.
Well that's healthy man.

1521
01:24:51,741 --> 01:24:54,410
That's actually an intelligent
way to do it. Yeah. The um,

1522
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,480
the guys who cut a
tremendous amount of weight,

1523
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,780
they take a risk and they
also get sick a lot. Um,

1524
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,460
that's what happened with
Mike Swick this weekend.

1525
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:04,420
Apparently Mike's Wiki gotten
sick the week of the fight and uh,

1526
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:08,360
he just didn't look up self against
Matt Brown and Matt Brown was on fucking

1527
01:25:08,361 --> 01:25:11,360
fire and uh,
just chaos.

1528
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:15,980
Mike was a horrific chaos too.
But that if you look at that fight like a,

1529
01:25:15,981 --> 01:25:18,890
that's a perfect example.
Why like weight cutting can be tricky.

1530
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:19,933
Yeah.
I'm a big,

1531
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:23,330
I'm a big proponent of looking at whose
bodies dry when they get into the ring.

1532
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,840
That's, that's big too.
Always what I do, I go,

1533
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,160
who do you think's going gonna win over
here. Let me see them enter the ring.

1534
01:25:28,161 --> 01:25:28,994
And I'll tell you,

1535
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,450
unless I saw when I saw mark has walked
in the ring and go and he will and he's

1536
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:35,230
sweating like crazy. Right?
Yeah. I mean he's very hydrated.

1537
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:38,090
What, What's interesting about
the mark has packout fight though,

1538
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:42,000
is that I watched it, um,
with the Dana White and um,

1539
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,430
Sam tripling and while we were watching
it we were saying like, he, like mark has,

1540
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:46,750
is not throwing that many punches.

1541
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,660
Like he's like being like way more
conservative and his punch output was

1542
01:25:50,661 --> 01:25:53,380
economizing. Yeah. We were
wondering if it was that,

1543
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:56,740
and we also wonder if it was just the
fact that he put on all that extra muscle

1544
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:59,760
and he'd been doing, like they
showed him those a 24, seven,

1545
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,830
they showed all the of and how he was
trying. He was definitely in. Yeah.

1546
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:05,750
Well look if fucking paid off.

1547
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,540
He never knocked them out before
and then one punch flatlines him.

1548
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,260
I mean he never even knocked him
down before he staggered them. Yeah.

1549
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,580
Knock down a third round
and this one and then a,

1550
01:26:14,581 --> 01:26:18,180
that was a great knock down to was. Yeah,
but he didn't go after him after that.

1551
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,780
You notice that? Oh no, he took his time.
He didn't want to run into anything.

1552
01:26:21,781 --> 01:26:24,090
Look what happened.
Jackie out tagged him.

1553
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:27,810
Had Him hurt back peddling the whole time.
He could've,

1554
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:31,140
he could've stepped it up a little bit
cause he really just let him off the hook.

1555
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:33,810
Who knows when it,
well it worked out.

1556
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:38,130
No sense of being critical cause I
remember when I would train and my coach

1557
01:26:38,131 --> 01:26:40,770
would tell me, don't fucking step back
and admire your work. Get in there,

1558
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,833
watch it later.

1559
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,390
Does anybody that I compare when
I compare the great boxers is you,

1560
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:51,420
how would Russell Peters just handled it?
What my coach would tell me.

1561
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:58,320
I really don't think so. You know,
showing them a bitch way. A Yoda,

1562
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,440
Yoda. Do you think they'd pop?
Gail's done. You think that will,

1563
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,720
I don't think he's done. Do you think
you can come back from a knockout?

1564
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:08,640
I think he come back, no doubt. I
think it wasn't a war of attrition.

1565
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:11,460
He got knocked out and that's, that's the,
at least the easiest way to come back.

1566
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:14,770
Do you think about the amount of
blows and he's already taken though,

1567
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:18,320
like cause like that really has an
effect when you get KOD like that.

1568
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:21,350
And then on top of that you've had,
how many fights is he at?

1569
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:23,650
Is he had 50 plus fights?
Yeah. How many fights?

1570
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:27,480
About 56 think about how many
fights I guys had and all the,

1571
01:27:27,481 --> 01:27:29,150
the blows that he's taken in those fights,

1572
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:32,480
all the blows that he's taken and
training. There's gonna come a time or he,

1573
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,030
I think he's got about another
two years left on it. Yeah.

1574
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:40,510
I think he's very prideful. And he
did. It was embarrassing for him.

1575
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:42,250
Especially when he looks back at it.

1576
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,820
He doesn't want to go out and be
remembered like that. Yeah, he does it.

1577
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,050
He's such a nice guy,
man.

1578
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:51,260
It's hard to watch a really nice guy get
knocked out like that. Yeah. You know,

1579
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:56,500
he's such a sweet, no,
no mean bone in his body.

1580
01:27:56,530 --> 01:28:00,550
I mean, you know, um, it's
just that one matchup.

1581
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:03,550
It's too bad that him and Floyd never
fought, cause that would have been gone.

1582
01:28:03,551 --> 01:28:04,420
Damn.
Fascinating.

1583
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:04,990
Yeah.

1584
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:09,780
I always said Floyd was waiting for Manny
to get into a few more brawls and get

1585
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,920
work himself down and then, and then come
in and fight them and when real easy.

1586
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:14,630
Yep.

1587
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,030
Exactly what he was doing.
Look for, it's not stupid,

1588
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,210
but he fucked up with this one.
He should've taught,

1589
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,580
caught him right after that last
fight. Right after that, he, uh,

1590
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,700
he lost his title to Bradley. Yeah.
But the Bradley fight was bullshit.

1591
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,770
He won that fight.
It was one of the worst decisions.

1592
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:30,230
That was the worst decision ever.
That wasn't right. That was,

1593
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,810
he should have stepped in, right? Yeah.

1594
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,720
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe he has a mirror
match with Bradley now. Enough of this,

1595
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:37,730
let me get fuzzy. You know what, Bradley?

1596
01:28:37,731 --> 01:28:40,370
I don't know what Bradley's
doing and what his, yeah,

1597
01:28:40,371 --> 01:28:42,580
he's kind of fallen into
obscurity somewhere.

1598
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,440
I think when you get knocked
unconscious the way man, Manny did,

1599
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:48,200
I don't think you're even
allowed to fight for a long time.

1600
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:51,050
I think you have to wait
at least six months off.

1601
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,020
I think you had to take six months.
All Amir got knocked out in July.

1602
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,950
Not like that. Yeah, that's true. It's
different going to knock out. That's,

1603
01:28:57,951 --> 01:29:01,980
that's unconscious face down for 10 15
minutes. You know, people can say, oh,

1604
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:06,960
there's no difference. Concussions
and concussion. That is a severe case.

1605
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,700
That's a severe concussion.

1606
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:11,940
There's a difference between that and
getting rocked and the referee stops it

1607
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,090
because a lot of those guys are never
really out cold if you're, you know,

1608
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:18,180
and is it like people say that
like, well, there's no difference.

1609
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,330
Even though the the brain is,
if the brain's getting concussed,

1610
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,430
whether or not you lose
consciousness is no difference.

1611
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:27,330
I got to think that when your body says,
you know what,

1612
01:29:27,331 --> 01:29:32,130
let's just shut the consciousness down.
We need vital functions only.

1613
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,980
Let's keep this fuck
knowing where you are.

1614
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:39,030
I got to think that that somehow is
worse than just a regular concussion.

1615
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,570
Your bond is shutting off.
That shit can't be worse.

1616
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,330
And I don't know what kind of statistics
they've done on that medically,

1617
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:47,850
but just using simple logic,

1618
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:52,380
you would have to say that losing your
consciousness because of a punch is worse

1619
01:29:52,381 --> 01:29:55,860
than not losing your consciousness when
your brain has so much trauma that it

1620
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:59,160
shuts everything down and
there's no more thinking.

1621
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:03,720
That's got to be a bad sign. And
when that happens, like in a,

1622
01:30:03,721 --> 01:30:06,050
in a MMA fight, you know, I don't,

1623
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:10,710
you rarely see the guy again for like a
good solid six months because you need

1624
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:13,850
like three months of no head contact,
no nothing.

1625
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:18,270
And if you go back in the gym too soon
and you start boxing and sparring and get

1626
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:23,271
thudded and wobbled when you're still
recovering from that earlier concussion

1627
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:26,460
mean who knows how much shit
is going on inside your head.

1628
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:30,880
Who knows exactly who knows
what connective tissues
have been separated and who

1629
01:30:30,881 --> 01:30:33,660
knows what part of your brain's
been damaged? Who knows,

1630
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,090
who knows exactly what
the extent of it is.

1631
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:40,260
And if you don't take that time off
and let your brain really heal up.

1632
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,380
I have a friend who got hit in the head
with a golf ball and he said he wasn't

1633
01:30:43,381 --> 01:30:44,400
the same for six months.

1634
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:48,630
Oh, I have a, there was a kid who it's uh,

1635
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:51,800
a fan I guess. Well,
yeah, he's a fan. He, uh,

1636
01:30:51,801 --> 01:30:54,910
his family hit me up because
he was a 17 year old kid hit.

1637
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,580
He had diabetes and his friends and him
are going to play golf and he went to

1638
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:02,600
sit by a tree to go shoot as a insulin.
His friend shot the ball,

1639
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:07,720
it ricocheted off the tree and hit him
in the head and he'd say he was fine.

1640
01:31:07,721 --> 01:31:09,170
He walked away and then he just collapsed.

1641
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,940
And then he was in a coma for like two
weeks. When he came out of the coma,

1642
01:31:13,941 --> 01:31:18,140
he was in, he had full amnesia,
full, didn't remember his name,

1643
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:22,820
his mom, dad, nobody. Whoa.
So he went into um, wow.

1644
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:26,420
Rehab for the next, uh, three to
six months or something like that.

1645
01:31:26,421 --> 01:31:29,240
And so they could try and work
as memory back. And then, uh,

1646
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:31,670
before he had the accident,
he was a big fan of mine.

1647
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:36,170
And one day one of his friends came
over and put on my DVD and the kid

1648
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:39,980
remembered every fucking word out of my
mouth and I started crying when I got

1649
01:31:39,981 --> 01:31:43,260
the email and then I went
visited the Guy Cause uh, he, it,

1650
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:46,370
it started triggering back his memory.
Wow,

1651
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:51,310
that's crazy. A Golf Balk and make
you forget who you are. Yup. Yup.

1652
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,100
And it ricocheted,
it wasn't even like direct hit.

1653
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,600
And is that to to the temple or is that
like to the penal gland at where's that?

1654
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,010
It must have been right in the

1655
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,610
temple temple area. I think the
pineal glands in the middle somewhere.

1656
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:08,270
I don't think you really get
to that sucker. Right. It's
in the main, yeah, the, the,

1657
01:32:08,271 --> 01:32:10,240
the back of the head supposed
to be real dangerous.

1658
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:13,330
That's why strikes the back of
the head or in legal in MMA. Yeah.

1659
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:18,460
But what's interesting is a kick to the
back of the head when a guy standing,

1660
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:23,050
if your roundhouse kick a guy, a lot
of the impact is the back of the head,

1661
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:26,030
but that's legal and that shut
in your screen off right there.

1662
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:31,130
The neck kick, especially a
neck kicks in. A lot of boxing.

1663
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,900
I was trying to catch you and
you into right. Well the, yeah,

1664
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:36,160
you're kind of chopped down.

1665
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:39,760
Like Ernesto who style they
chopped down with that head kick.

1666
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,240
I remember that guy. That shit
goes over your shoulder. Oh,

1667
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,940
hang down your neck and night and night.
Speaking of Dutch fighters,

1668
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:46,774
what's Overeem?

1669
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:51,520
Overeem is fighting and a February
or January through December rather,

1670
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:55,930
December 31st that same card, the 29th
year coming to, yeah, 29th. I said 31st.

1671
01:32:55,931 --> 01:32:58,820
Jesus Christ. I can't get the date right
on New Year's eve moments. Yeah. It's um,

1672
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:02,050
I'm not even doing a New Year's eve
show this year. As a first year.

1673
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:05,110
I'm having a party at my house. If
you in a car, maybe I will do that.

1674
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:08,770
You're going to come. Um, shit's been
bed's going to be playing too. Yeah,

1675
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:10,400
I'll be playing. It's been,
it'll be playing guys.

1676
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:12,020
You're going to have djs at your Parnell.

1677
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:15,970
How SpaceX Steve Wonder
probably come play night.

1678
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:17,590
Stevie wonder even have to play.

1679
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:20,440
Do you know Stevie wonder and columns
if you want fucking throw down,

1680
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:22,810
but catering, I'm asking you a
question. This is Stevie wonder.

1681
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:27,160
The same Guy Dj Steve One at one at one
day. Oh, his name is Steve wonder. Yeah.

1682
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,870
That's ridiculous. You can't call yourself
Steve Wonder God does a Stevie wonder.

1683
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,180
How the fuck can you call
yourself Steve wonder.

1684
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:39,100
I think it's in honor of Oh and
honor. Um, how about the girl fights?

1685
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,880
Joe Ronda Rousey that's going to be in la.
In Anaheim.

1686
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:46,500
I like some of those girls Cyborg up too.
I like those girls with Cyborg.

1687
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:46,990
He's a beast.

1688
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:51,990
She's up to about one 55 solid is knowing
body fat ever going to beat Cyborg and

1689
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:54,640
no one's ever going to beat
it, right? Oh, who knows?

1690
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,620
They bring in an actual cyborg. Her
and Rhonda Rousey. Ronda Rousey,

1691
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:02,200
her and Rhonda Rousey would
be a big fight. But, um,

1692
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:07,590
right now the first ever UFC female fight
is the headlining fight in UFC one 57,

1693
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:15,190
which is a live from Anaheim.
It's Ronda Rousey versus Liz Carmouche.

1694
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,050
I hope I'm saying his name correctly,

1695
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:21,180
but Liz Carmouche is like the
first openly gay fighter, uh,

1696
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:24,160
competing in the UFC cause she's getting,
she's a lesbian.

1697
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:29,270
It was a big old lesbian
chicken ass, so, okay.

1698
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,650
Called chicken. Big Old Lesbian, right.
Yeah. Nothing wrong with it. It's not,

1699
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:37,190
but you know, she listens. She's a good
fighter. If you love policy, I love Pussy.

1700
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:41,860
Right. Liz loves pussy. Okay. So we're
on her team. We're on team puts it.

1701
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,960
She can't wrestle, but you
should see her box. [inaudible]

1702
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:51,280
was coming. It just took some time. Did
shoulders on it again to silo bitch,

1703
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:54,780
son of a bitch. Yeah. This, uh,

1704
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:59,930
January 20 or December 20. I did it
again. 29. December 29th garde is a,

1705
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,530
this is a good fucking guard. It's
junior dos Santos, Cain Velasquez,

1706
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:08,150
Tim Boetsch versus cost of
Phillipo. Okay. So that means that,

1707
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,180
um, oh, okay. Overeem is not on that card.

1708
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,450
Overeem is on the
February super bowl card.

1709
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,040
That's a career fucking card.
He's fighting big foot silver.

1710
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:24,220
That's Joe say Aldo versus
Frankie Edgar to sun.

1711
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,400
I like all though, dude,
that it is this, this card,

1712
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,980
Josie Aldo versus Frankie Edgar.

1713
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:36,340
Alistair Overeem versus Big Foot Rashad
Evans versus little nog and John Fitch

1714
01:35:37,221 --> 01:35:42,070
versus Damien Maia. Holy Shit.
If that's the Superbowl card.

1715
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,320
Yeah. If they don't get hurt,
that's the deal though. Please. No.

1716
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:50,010
Aldo reminds me of a,
reminds me of Cambooya does.

1717
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:52,590
He wasn't like that to me.
He's like the MMA gamble.

1718
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:57,150
Why did say that they look similar and
they both have that fucking crazy third

1719
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:57,430
world

1720
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:01,420
mentality. And then I made
a Cuban like Cuban. Yeah.

1721
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:04,690
Islander. Yeah. But you know, all
those obviously Brazilian, right?

1722
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:07,470
There's an intensity that people have.
They come from extreme poverty.

1723
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:11,480
It's pretty hard to match. You know,
that their shit is not bravado.

1724
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:15,370
It's fucking real. Yeah. You can
match it a little bit with, uh,

1725
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:18,020
with hard work and
discipline and you know,

1726
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,700
and just being focused and trying to win.

1727
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:23,240
But there's like a fucking real worry
that you have when you're not sure where

1728
01:36:23,241 --> 01:36:27,520
your food comes from. That's hard to
fuck with. Exactly. No, that's, I'm like,

1729
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:30,540
Roberto Duran Duran was so great.
Yep.

1730
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:35,210
Grew up in utter poverty and it was just,
they just walked through. He was really,

1731
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,360
really nothing else to
compare it to readily.

1732
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:40,710
Can everything you have is soft to
them. Yeah. You soft pitch. Yeah.

1733
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,150
Everything you do with soft to them.
Yeah. Whatever happened to big country,

1734
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:47,990
big countries fighting this weekend.
Big countries fighting management country.

1735
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,990
He's a bad month flops
sentiment I can do dude. Yeah.

1736
01:36:50,991 --> 01:36:53,720
He's fighting Matt Mitrione this weekend.

1737
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:58,700
This weekend is the finals of the
ultimate fighter. So, um, the, uh, the,

1738
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:01,970
the main guys are going to compete and
then there's a couple of a undercard

1739
01:37:01,971 --> 01:37:05,000
fights as well in the
main event is a mitre on.

1740
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:08,750
It was supposed to be
him versus Shane Carwyn.

1741
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:13,910
But Shane Carwyn, uh, got injured again,
fucked up his knee and mitre stepped in.

1742
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,880
Uh, I remember I texted mirror
after he fought Nelson. I
said, good fight. He goes,

1743
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,040
I go, that son of a bitch
wouldn't go down. He goes,

1744
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,690
I know my niece is
paying the price for it.

1745
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:26,480
It's the dude. No one has a chin like
Roy Nelson. He's that. He's an animal.

1746
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:30,220
He's ridiculous, which is a record
like 15 and 15 something like that.

1747
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,100
You can beat him. You're just not
going to beat him. Exactly what I mean,

1748
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:36,950
there's a lot of good fights on the
under car to a bunch of good fights.

1749
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:41,180
There's a big one is a pat
Barry vs Shane del Rosario.

1750
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:42,880
That's a crazy fight,
man.

1751
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:47,030
Shane del Rosario was a Moy Thai
champion world champion and Pat Barry is,

1752
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,780
you know, one of the best kick
boxers in MMA and that, that flight,

1753
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:53,000
he's going to be crazy in
the weight bearing has been
fighting lately. You know,

1754
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:56,130
he's going to go after him.
This is who won the ultimate

1755
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,350
fighter then this year or
who's in the final for that?

1756
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:02,460
Then the final fight is between,
uh,

1757
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:08,070
Smith and Ricci. Hmm. Those are the
two guys that made it to the finals.

1758
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:13,050
Apparently. That's what, you
know what? No, I'm sorry.

1759
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,820
Those guys are not that.

1760
01:38:14,821 --> 01:38:18,030
I don't think that's true because they
don't tell you yet because I think it has

1761
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:23,010
to air this week. Oh, I might be wrong.
I have to find out who's a, I don't know.

1762
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,360
I know if it's been set, I haven't
seen this week's episode, so I don't,

1763
01:38:26,361 --> 01:38:29,310
I'm not sure if they're hard to.
I was watching it on. Um, it's,

1764
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:33,870
the shows are hard to find. I have not
been able to label it down for a, I mean,

1765
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:38,760
lock it down for when fuck is on.
I don't watch anything when it's on.

1766
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,560
Everything I watch is on a DVR.

1767
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,260
Now you gonna Sneeze when he goes
about 200 kids not getting laughed at,

1768
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:45,990
laughed a lot of discipline as
an for a light to staring that.

1769
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:48,420
Isn't that a weird thing? You
get it. You're almost sneezing.

1770
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:51,930
Literally looking around for
a fucking light. The, um,

1771
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,350
the Dvr is the most incredible
invention of all time.

1772
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:57,780
I never watch anything
like when it comes out,

1773
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,220
sit through their bullshit
commercials pitch,

1774
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:04,140
I can fuck my fucking dvrs full of that.
Uh,

1775
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:07,710
what does it call to that universe?
Show that fucking Morgan Freeman how?

1776
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:10,820
Through the wormhole.
Yeah. All of that shit.

1777
01:39:10,821 --> 01:39:13,470
I have 20 of those on my DVR and
it's almost what I'm like, fuck,

1778
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:15,940
I got to delete some that and Louie,
I don't,

1779
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,510
I don't delete through the wormhole dude.

1780
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,150
Just cause if I come home baked from a
show and I want to fucking blow my mind,

1781
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,290
I'll sit there.

1782
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:25,110
I'll watch through the Rome wormhole
and then I'll go right to the isolation

1783
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:29,460
tank. That's mine. That's my
strategy. Just think about you.

1784
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,030
Just freak out. Just go in there
and break shit down. Freak out.

1785
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:37,260
Have you done that yet?
Isolation tank? No. You need
to do that. The murderers are,

1786
01:39:37,261 --> 01:39:41,400
you have one? I have one. You can,

1787
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:45,090
you could rent one. You know, you
can go to the float lab in Venice.

1788
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:47,940
They have a place you can go
and I think it's like 40 bucks.

1789
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:51,510
And how long were they need to be in
isolation for? Just an hour is great.

1790
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:56,520
First of all, even if you just want
to just for relaxing one hour's fine.

1791
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,830
You know, like I'll do it sometimes
in an hour during the day.

1792
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:00,560
I don't even like trip out.
I just go in the name,

1793
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:02,520
the tags because I'm ignorant to it.

1794
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,970
An isolation tank is filled with water.

1795
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,090
The water is heated to the
same temperature as the
surface of your skin and then

1796
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:14,091
there's eight to 1,800 to 1000 pounds of
salt in the water depending on how big

1797
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:15,900
the tank is.
I just got a new one.

1798
01:40:15,901 --> 01:40:18,990
The new one's a thousand now used
to be 800 pounds, salt water,

1799
01:40:18,991 --> 01:40:20,040
but this one has more water.

1800
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,920
It's like the kind of amount
of salt where you float. Yes.

1801
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,550
There's so much salt in it that you
lie in it. You're completely buoyant.

1802
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:30,420
You Bob up and down like a bomber
and you don't it. Once you relax,

1803
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:32,990
you don't feel the water because
the water's the same temperatures,

1804
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,480
your skin and just for relaxing like
there's never a time where you're that

1805
01:40:36,481 --> 01:40:41,220
relaxed where you have that much, that
much like tension relief from your body.

1806
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,980
It's an excellent source of
magnesium because the, uh,

1807
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:48,000
your skin actually absorbs magnesium
from the Epsom salts and it's like one of

1808
01:40:48,001 --> 01:40:51,390
the best ways to get magnesium into
your body. It's hanging in the Dead Sea.

1809
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:53,040
Something like that.
Sound like,

1810
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,750
but it's wake trippier because
you're in total silence.

1811
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:58,000
You close the lid on this thing.
You were in total darkness.

1812
01:40:58,001 --> 01:40:59,260
You don't see anything,
you know, feel anything.

1813
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:01,840
You don't hear anything and
it feels like you're flying.

1814
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:06,160
So your brain has no sensory
input. Nothing's coming in
and no signals that like,

1815
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:09,040
like right now we're sitting down.
You just a signal from your ass,

1816
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:12,250
you know that feeling the
chair and saying, man,

1817
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,860
Rogan and red van should get some
fucking better chairs in this bitch.

1818
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,490
They make my back sweat. Yeah,
we were going to work on it.

1819
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,380
We're going to get something.
The leather is,

1820
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:23,130
should we get those air on chairs or
those are the shifts. Those herb Herman,

1821
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,360
they'd give you some error.
You know,

1822
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:28,600
we got some good ones from the
office depot for the other studio,

1823
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:31,660
but we've got to replace,
there's an activator in the back of mine,

1824
01:41:31,661 --> 01:41:36,070
like an activator, like some Jheri
curl type shit. Activate who you see,

1825
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:39,070
you're in the hip hop world. Most
people would know Carol Hockey, Matt,

1826
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:44,050
but activator, unless they maybe
saw, um, what was that? Uh,

1827
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:47,450
the last dragon shogun.
A Harlem show gun.

1828
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,690
Bruce Leroy. Bruce Leroy. Yeah. Yeah.
Bruce. What happened to that kid?

1829
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:55,850
Bruce Leeway who was still fighting.
Still doing while he's very good man.

1830
01:41:55,851 --> 01:41:59,560
And he's getting better all the time too.
So there's the, that fight this weekend.

1831
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:02,800
Pat Del Rosario. Then there's
Jamie Varner versus Melvin Gallard.

1832
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:05,860
That's a great fuck. That's my fight.
Melvin's on a hit and mysteries.

1833
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,330
He was one of the past to now, right?
Yes. Um, you know, Melvin is a,

1834
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:14,190
he's super physically talented,
but uh, you know, he's,

1835
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:17,070
he's a bit of a wild child and
it's a fucking tough game, man.

1836
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,070
It's lost some fights. Lost the last
fight. Serone he's fighting tough guys.

1837
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:24,970
You know, you fight tough guys. You win
some, you lose some. The way he, uh, um,

1838
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:29,320
knocked out, um, fuck is
his name. Evan Dunham.

1839
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:32,260
We knocked out Evan Dunham was
fucking stunning. I chose you.

1840
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,600
What Gallard can do at
his best at his basket.

1841
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:36,730
Lard is one of the most
dangerous guys at one 55.

1842
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:38,140
He always reminds me because of the,

1843
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:43,180
I always get him confused with
a fucking another short, stocky,

1844
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:47,080
black. I used to have
blond hair, short, stocky,

1845
01:42:47,081 --> 01:42:51,260
black guy who used to have
blond hair. Hmm. Mellowing Lord.

1846
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,000
And I didn't know there was another
guy who looked just like him. He was,

1847
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:59,170
or he had big fucking Kevin around them
then. Yeah, that's what it was. Oh yeah.

1848
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:02,770
Well Kevin Ran, let's wait.
Bigger man. Random. Oh, was
the UFC heavyweight champion.

1849
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:07,420
But they look similar. I mean not,
not, you know, but there, yeah,

1850
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:10,000
cause it's like random in the champion.
I know he fought for the title.

1851
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:13,480
I don't think for the title.
He didn't win it. Right.

1852
01:43:13,481 --> 01:43:15,070
I don't think the title up for grabs.
Right.

1853
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:19,000
A lot of people thought he should have
won that fight. He got staff. Right.

1854
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:22,000
And no pictures. Yeah, it's disgusting.

1855
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,910
Pull those pictures up and
you never had staff like this.

1856
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,640
Kevin Random and let that staff
go for like a couple of years.

1857
01:43:27,641 --> 01:43:30,730
It looks like you've never seen staff
like this. This is the craziest shit ever.

1858
01:43:30,731 --> 01:43:34,450
You could see through his skin
to the actual muscle tissue.

1859
01:43:34,451 --> 01:43:39,090
He had giant holes in his skin.
Yeah, it's nutty shit ambulance

1860
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:43,720
and it's amazing the hospital right now
because he has staff in his stomach or

1861
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:48,080
something like that. Staff
is scary as fuck. Yeah,

1862
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:52,370
this is disgusting. Check it out.
Check these photos. That's disgusting.

1863
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:55,790
That look at that whole fuck his staff,

1864
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:02,260
when he lifted his arm up, you could see
through his fucking skin. You see what?

1865
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:06,430
You've got a whole, when you can with as
a shadow in a fucking staph infection.

1866
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:09,320
That's, I mean, I don't even know
how you fix something like that.

1867
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:13,260
Fix something like that. Like that's so
terrifying. The shit eats your body away,

1868
01:44:13,261 --> 01:44:14,094
man.

1869
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:16,490
You can fucking girl Nigga.
Then you can put your wallet in there.

1870
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,950
You can put your Dick in there.
Is that staff too? That's a heel.

1871
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:27,680
Oh my God, I got to go have
dinner with the family after this

1872
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:32,300
staff. Is it terrifying? Fucking thing's
fucked. Yeah. That immersive stuff.

1873
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:35,210
That's what's really scary is it
people are taking antibiotics,

1874
01:44:35,211 --> 01:44:38,150
they don't finish their
cycle. And so the, the, the,

1875
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,420
the by the bacteria that remains,

1876
01:44:41,421 --> 01:44:44,720
that survives the assault by the
antibiotics become super powered.

1877
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,770
It's like extra strong because
it's resisting being poisoned.

1878
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:53,020
So it develops into a stronger strain.
And so then people get it and they'll,

1879
01:44:53,021 --> 01:44:55,610
the antibiotics don't work
on it because it's a strain.

1880
01:44:55,611 --> 01:44:57,790
It's become resistant to antibiotics.
Right.

1881
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,560
So these poor fucking people that
get it, they're doomed. I mean,

1882
01:45:00,561 --> 01:45:01,880
you're in a life or death struggle,

1883
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:06,500
which with which should be easily
cleared up by, uh, antibiotics.

1884
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:09,980
Yeah. It's insanity. We're
living in, it's the human world.

1885
01:45:09,981 --> 01:45:13,820
We're living in my friend.
You get the knife and start carving.

1886
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:18,920
It's true. You could carve it, carve
it out, try to chop it right out. Yeah.

1887
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:20,990
But then, you know, it happens
at a melon school wound.

1888
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:24,860
You have an open wound and that stuff
is probably systemic by them. Any,

1889
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:27,680
any sort of infection that you have is,
it's going to go to that.

1890
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:31,310
That's the problem with staff, I believe.
Especially when it gets systemic,

1891
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:35,510
cause it like you can get it again, you
know, Shit's not good. It's not good.

1892
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:38,680
So when you play with Travis Barker,
you playing at the same time with him.

1893
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:43,480
I Jahid rums or Travis Barker.
I'm just laughing at the AEA segway there.

1894
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:46,720
Red Band. Well I'm just getting all these
people telling me like talk more about

1895
01:45:46,721 --> 01:45:49,300
deejaying.
So don't bring it to them ever.

1896
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:52,490
Well I was as a fan of mass gas,

1897
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,820
ask questions you want but
please don't ask questions.

1898
01:45:54,821 --> 01:45:59,040
So that's a question I know. Now
that's a question I asked. Uh, cause I,

1899
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:02,350
I see that you have some shows coming up
in San Francisco with Travis Barker and

1900
01:46:02,351 --> 01:46:03,930
I think he's a great drummer.
Yeah,

1901
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,960
Yep. Um, you know, a couple
months back and um, you know,

1902
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:11,950
rest in peace to, you know, Dj am, um,

1903
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:15,740
who that was their original thing
and they released a mix tape.

1904
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:20,130
You the Travis was play the drums
and Dj am was and that's kind of an

1905
01:46:20,131 --> 01:46:22,620
interesting style of doing it,

1906
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:26,880
like combining mixing with,
with live music.

1907
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,560
It's awesome. So when you passed
he called me up, he was like,

1908
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:33,880
I couldn't think of any other DJ and
we'll love to love to take you on a tour.

1909
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:38,070
And we went on tour together,
opened up for Lil Wayne and um,

1910
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,160
got this bus.

1911
01:46:39,161 --> 01:46:43,810
He actually bought a tour bus now so we
can go and do whatever the fuck we want.

1912
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:48,340
But we have two shows. We have
a, we have residencies in, in uh,

1913
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,250
in Vegas.
So we do shows twice

1914
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:54,570
a month. What's it like hanging
out with little Wayne crazy.

1915
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,380
Please tell me crazy.

1916
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:02,770
What is it like tell us
deposition, right? Yes. I loved it.

1917
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:06,780
The definition was hilarious.
No, he can't save. You can say,

1918
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,730
Whoa, I love it. What is
it like hanging out with,

1919
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:15,020
if you could get past like 20
people to get to him, you know,

1920
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:18,450
I guess it's worth it. He's
like really? Like, I dunno,

1921
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:22,800
I think he's on this mushroom skateboard
thing. Mushrooms or board thing. Yeah.

1922
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:25,320
What do you mean he's just switching
off all the time? You know what I mean?

1923
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:28,310
Like he does like different shit. He's
in the different things. It's Kinda,

1924
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:32,710
it's Kinda confusing cause
it's like you're, you're
this gangster rapper, right?

1925
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:37,200
But then you got all this type stuff on
and you're skateboarding tight stuff,

1926
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:41,310
tight pants, leggings. I don't
get it. Nothing against it, Wayne.

1927
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,590
You know what I mean? It's a
look, whatever, but it, it, um,

1928
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:47,770
are you criticizing little Wayne's
look and you're like, yeah,

1929
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:50,400
I don't understand the
jeggings and then the sagging

1930
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:56,160
jegging leggings, but they're jeans. Oh,
I don't like those, those skinny jeans.

1931
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:00,090
But they're worse. They're like fucking,
it's almost like, oh, fucking, yeah.

1932
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:03,840
It's almost like leotards with no feet.
I can't wear those.

1933
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,660
When I say I don't like those,
that's not for me. But, uh,

1934
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:10,360
if you've got a little skinny legs,
it's kind of a look. I hate when,

1935
01:48:10,361 --> 01:48:11,250
so I see people that are,

1936
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:14,330
even though you can't be even slightly
out of shape and where that, right. Well,

1937
01:48:14,331 --> 01:48:16,740
that's why you ain't him. Yeah.
Because I'm like, well I can't wear it.

1938
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:21,390
So that's like showing off your skinniness
for shorts flaunting it in fact.

1939
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,390
But my dude is definitely under
the influence of something

1940
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:29,640
of
statement.

1941
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:32,640
But my dude is definitely under
the influence of something.

1942
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:35,430
It's a combination of some shit.
I don't know because like,

1943
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,200
do you think that he's mean?

1944
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:40,890
He's constantly got to create new raps
and shit and constantly performing and

1945
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:41,700
touring.
You know,

1946
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:46,260
he probably wants a make
shit up constantly just to
keep his mind fresh and keep

1947
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:48,200
new ideas entering into it.
Of course.

1948
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,700
And I think that's when that person
will learn how to play that guitar.

1949
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:53,220
You know what?
I don't know.

1950
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:56,670
I don't even know how to
get to as a guitar and still
walk with a guitar all the

1951
01:48:56,671 --> 01:48:59,010
time.
Oh that's awesome.

1952
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:01,980
And so if you weren't confused really,

1953
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:07,040
he's like the fuck is that about like
walking around with boxing gloves on and

1954
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:10,770
I'd be Kinda Fun. Yeah, that's
right. Like what are you doing bitch?

1955
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,720
I became a big fan of his when he did
that deposition. That was awesome.

1956
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:17,100
It was ridiculous,
was great.

1957
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:21,630
Cause he was responding to some nonsense
way of talking that this guy had roped

1958
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:25,620
him into the system. I mean that's what
a deposition is. They talk to you legal,

1959
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:26,191
you know,

1960
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:30,180
they ask you these silly questions
and you know is your name and fracked,

1961
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:32,010
you know,
you know what he's fucking name is.

1962
01:49:32,011 --> 01:49:36,210
He's writing kind of stupid question.
Is that you ended up losing that case.

1963
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:41,520
Really? That was the one against the
acuity three ray was the case about,

1964
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:44,910
what was it about Quincy Jones?
His son was doing a documentary on him.

1965
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:48,190
And you made music with them. Right?
And what happened? What went wrong?

1966
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,480
I think it was about the rights to use
the music or he didn't like how he was

1967
01:49:52,481 --> 01:49:54,910
going to be represented.
Oh yeah.

1968
01:49:55,390 --> 01:49:59,110
He was trying to block it and then now
he had to give the deposition but he lost

1969
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:03,880
a well bitch. Oh well when you done
Margaret Gremlin, let's be honest,

1970
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:07,900
I. E. T. Let's listen to him.

1971
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,000
2008 I don't recall.
I don't recall that.

1972
01:50:12,001 --> 01:50:16,920
In the summer of 2007 you were
arrested in New York City following and

1973
01:50:16,921 --> 01:50:18,840
performance at the beacon theater.

1974
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:27,110
Do you recall that police in New York
City discovered a 40 caliber pistol on

1975
01:50:29,011 --> 01:50:32,820
you, on your person? I
don't recall that need.

1976
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:39,440
Did you recall that in late 2009 you
pleaded guilty to attempted criminal

1977
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:43,960
possession of a weapon out of her?
That

1978
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:48,830
I'd like to get it

1979
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:53,350
to the point where he says that you
can't save you the end of 2009 it was,

1980
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,610
I don't know if this is it.
I need,

1981
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:59,240
this is just as I call at eight months
this clip. I think it's just his,

1982
01:50:59,241 --> 01:51:03,860
all his, I don't recall know.
We don't need to see it,

1983
01:51:03,861 --> 01:51:06,100
but here's the funny one is good too.

1984
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:13,630
Hey, well that's not the
question. Like what's your name?

1985
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:16,760
He rushes.
That's a stupid ass question.

1986
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:21,740
You just saw me on a given an interview
with her. Okay, so that was he. Oh,

1987
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:24,350
did you perform it?

1988
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:29,351
The virgin mobile music fast
in 2008 with Kanye West?

1989
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:32,720
I don't know.

1990
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:38,210
I know I did for fun at this bad
as bitch birthday party recently

1991
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:42,903
thick.

1992
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:47,930
Isn't it something that you would remember
if you were album the Carter three

1993
01:51:47,931 --> 01:51:51,220
was the biggest selling
album of the year in 2008

1994
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:56,480
isn't as something that I
would remember that. Yes.

1995
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:00,440
Isn't that a personal
opinion type question?

1996
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:06,040
Question
the fuck.

1997
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:11,110
That's fine. I didn't know what a guy
would remember. If his memory sucks,

1998
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:14,480
how can he prove what someone's memories
like you know there's some shit that I

1999
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,710
ordered the stuff from your
website. I've met people, Bro.

2000
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:20,710
I've met people that I know I met before
but I cannot remember and I probably

2001
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:23,200
had a good time hanging out with
him. Like, hey dude, what's up buddy?

2002
01:52:23,201 --> 01:52:24,280
How are you friend?

2003
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:29,830
I pretend I know everybody when I meet
them just in case I always do just in

2004
01:52:29,831 --> 01:52:34,510
case. Oh memory. It's fucking
faulty as shit. It is fucked up.

2005
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:37,900
So that's why who a Reagan got away with
that shit during the country hearing or

2006
01:52:37,901 --> 01:52:42,670
the member with the, did you sell
weapons to Iran? It's like, fuck,

2007
01:52:42,671 --> 01:52:46,070
I don't remember. I really
don't remember. You can get away

2008
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,970
with that too when you get
old. Yeah. Damn. Just not,

2009
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:51,830
not feeling so I feel
so good with the memory,

2010
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,240
but if Reagan had been on Alpha brain,
then his shit would be suspect.

2011
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:59,900
Russell Peters checking his Twitter,
checking the Twitter,

2012
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,450
saying what they're saying. They're
saying, you fucking suck, dude.

2013
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:06,260
That's how you bullshit. True. They want
to live your life a little angry at you.

2014
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:07,600
Did you gather Russell?
They pitch.

2015
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:10,580
They're sick of listening to me instead
of mix master Mike is that people are

2016
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:14,590
saying that don't real. The real
DJ talk. You know it all isn't.

2017
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:19,520
Only the cunt would do that to you. Only
con would send that maybe to think it.

2018
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:22,670
Okay. I could see somebody thinking it,
but to say it to actually say it to you.

2019
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,700
Yeah.
You're responding only to cons.

2020
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:27,770
I don't respond or you just don't have
a good point. Why read it? Why let them?

2021
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:30,160
That's when you hear him. That's
when you unfollow. Unfollow.

2022
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:36,740
You got to block. I do. Black
people walking report as spam your,

2023
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:39,980
oh, that's good too. Because if
you don't do that, you're going to,

2024
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:43,010
you're going to have, you know, just
going to be inundated, but assholes,

2025
01:53:43,011 --> 01:53:45,650
especially if you're one of those guys
that are only responds to the assholes,

2026
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,680
then he got a problem. That's true, right?

2027
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:50,710
Dana white does a really good job of
that. He's ridiculous. He loves me.

2028
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:54,380
It's comedy for him. He loves
doing that. He gets crazy.

2029
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:57,770
I don't understand that shit. I
think it's silly, but he likes it.

2030
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:02,630
It's like it's fun for him. Whatever
joy you had a question for you. Okay,

2031
01:54:02,631 --> 01:54:05,360
Mike. Um, on FIFA fear factor,

2032
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,510
do you actually have say on what they eat?

2033
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:13,940
Like me? Oh, you have no.
Say if it was up to me,

2034
01:54:13,941 --> 01:54:15,890
they would have never had an eat
donkey. Common. We still be doing it.

2035
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:20,580
Did they get taught taken off already?
Yeah. Yeah. It's done. Donkey Kong.

2036
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:23,480
I'm actually happy it got taken off,
but if it was up to me,

2037
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:26,170
they would have never had to do that.
I would've said that's [inaudible].

2038
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:29,540
There's a couple of times, there's a
lot of crazy shit they did on that show,

2039
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:32,300
but I was down with almost
all of it except twice.

2040
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:35,960
There's two times one where they had a
ride bowls. I thought that was ridiculous.

2041
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:41,120
I, there was a crazy idea. Actual actual
balls and two, they had a drink come.

2042
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:46,100
I'm like, that Shit seems
wrong. Siemens wrong. Donkey,

2043
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:49,520
donkey come and donkey
urine. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

2044
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,610
It's actually cows ear and was
cows even donkey come for what?

2045
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:57,050
For 50 g's if ti no, a shot at
winning 50 gs. That's a shot.

2046
01:54:57,590 --> 01:55:01,430
Gave them 50 grand just for
drinking donkey comp. That
would at least make sense.

2047
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,220
But uh,
that was,

2048
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:09,620
I mean we did 148 episodes during the
first run and I think we did like seven or

2049
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:14,570
something, maybe eight during the
second run. But that was out of those,

2050
01:55:14,571 --> 01:55:16,970
all those episodes,
there was only twice where I was like,

2051
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:20,120
get the fuck outta here.
This is crazy.

2052
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:23,610
And the donkey come and the
bowls with the two riding a bull,

2053
01:55:23,611 --> 01:55:26,450
it's just ridiculous.
That is just a mechanical bull.

2054
01:55:26,451 --> 01:55:29,440
I can go with even a mechanical
bull, you can get fucked up, but uh,

2055
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:33,830
old below for your fall real bowls.
The way they launch you through the air,

2056
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:37,250
like you do not want to be a part
of that. You can do it. Yeah,

2057
01:55:37,251 --> 01:55:38,720
you can do it if you're a
bad mother fucker of your,

2058
01:55:38,721 --> 01:55:42,930
some Donald Cowboy Cerrone type dude and
you're like fucking getting, you know,

2059
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:46,410
flying through the air because he just
wrote a bowl because that Thursday night.

2060
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:49,110
Yeah, exactly. You
can't survive that shit.

2061
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:54,320
But the reality is that's a risk
where the reward is not worth it.

2062
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:58,850
Okay. First of all, you're not going
to win. Everybody gets thrown. Yeah.

2063
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:01,770
Nobody has ever written a
bolt to eternity. You know,

2064
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:05,340
you get on that bitch and you've got a
few studies tamed ones yet if you're a

2065
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:08,100
bad motherfucker,
you can last for eight seconds.

2066
01:56:08,101 --> 01:56:09,360
Just think of how ridiculous that is.

2067
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:13,170
Even 10 seconds is a bar that's way
too high. Most people can't do it.

2068
01:56:13,171 --> 01:56:17,010
So they give them eight
for the pros fucking pro.

2069
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:20,910
Only as eight seconds. That's
this new band on the show. What,

2070
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:23,700
how long did that stay on the show?
On the show that it was a,

2071
01:56:23,701 --> 01:56:27,150
the people who lasted the longest, that's
where it was. And what was the longest?

2072
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:31,510
Oh not long. Six seconds.
Five seconds. Just a lock. It
was just like he, you know,

2073
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,310
just, he just jumping up trays.
Not like a method to his madness.

2074
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:39,840
He just going crazy and if you judge it
right like the first time that you don't

2075
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:42,900
have to recover for the second time and
you get like an extra second depending

2076
01:56:42,901 --> 01:56:45,170
on, but I don't think people
did it more than a few seconds.

2077
01:56:45,171 --> 01:56:48,000
They didn't have the horns did they?
Yeah. Yeah. The horns or cap though.

2078
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:50,840
They have like a little cap on the horns.
But the bottom line is these,

2079
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:52,740
the stomping is what you
really have to worry about.

2080
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:54,750
Even we put chess plates
on them and helmets.

2081
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:57,540
You don't want to get stomped on the head
by a bowl when you're wearing a helmet.

2082
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:58,200
Okay.

2083
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,600
Cause I don't know how much it's really
going to protect your fucking skull.

2084
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:02,510
You could easily get a cracked
skull while you wearing a helmet.

2085
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:05,520
On a bull stomps on you and
they're just getting launched.

2086
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:08,940
Launched through the air.
There's a girl was 98 pounds,

2087
01:57:08,941 --> 01:57:11,970
his tiny little girl
and she got on the ball,

2088
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:15,960
they open the gate and the bowl with
the first buck just sent her flying off

2089
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:20,160
like a pillow, Bang, and she landed
like flat on her back and she was good.

2090
01:57:20,161 --> 01:57:23,040
All the wind knocked out of her and
everything else. Like you guys are crazy.

2091
01:57:23,041 --> 01:57:26,850
This is such a stupid, stupid,
stupid thing to make people do.

2092
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,170
But when you,

2093
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:31,740
when you have a whole bunch of people
like say if you're doing a show like that,

2094
01:57:31,741 --> 01:57:34,380
what happens is you got like,
there's 12 people there, right?

2095
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:37,740
And say a one of them is totally in
charge and the other ones are in charge of

2096
01:57:37,741 --> 01:57:40,560
creating this stuff and the other one is
the network and they all get together.

2097
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,930
What do you think? Wow, I think we can
do it. And you're thinking we'd do it.

2098
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,630
Then you bring the stunt guy over. Well,
you know, we've done it. I've done it.

2099
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:48,810
They can do it. No,
there's no voice of reason.

2100
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:51,930
There should be one guy who's like the
voice of reason. Well, all this guy does,

2101
01:57:51,931 --> 01:57:55,330
he has no vested interest in the show.
Just does yoga all day, you know,

2102
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,840
reads books and he'd come to him and,
hey man, we're thinking of doing this.

2103
01:57:57,841 --> 01:58:02,160
And the guy goes, no, you go, okay.
Okay. We went to the voice of reason.

2104
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:07,200
We were getting a little carried away. We
almost had him drink. Come cause me, man,

2105
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:10,750
look, I can rarely get chicks to swallow
my own coach. You got a fucking spider.

2106
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,180
I refuse to believe that.

2107
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:16,380
I think chicks lining up to
gobble you go there. There's,

2108
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:19,500
there's the hit and misses. You know what
the funny thing is about on the show,

2109
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:23,880
girls got a choice between come and and
Piss and girls were choosing Commonweal

2110
01:58:23,881 --> 01:58:28,500
rapists. They were like, it seems
like it'd be easy to do. Wow.

2111
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:32,370
In Europe it would be pissed and shit.

2112
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:36,240
But you're talking about German.
Oh, Germany when you were there,

2113
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:41,220
I think you saw too much with that
400,000 seat show. No, I'm, yeah.

2114
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,160
German porn will turn

2115
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,600
you off.
Porn if that's the first horse.

2116
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:47,890
Have you ever done DJ and with a a
like a full band, like a rock band.

2117
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:50,740
I mean instead of just
like drums with Travis.

2118
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:54,400
Have you ever done it with other assorted
instruments? Yeah. Joining with a,

2119
01:58:54,401 --> 01:58:57,790
with Tommy Lee. Oh yeah.
Yeah. But he's again though,

2120
01:58:57,791 --> 01:58:59,770
does Trump's right just jump me at him.

2121
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,520
But if you've ever done it with other
musical instruments like guitars and all

2122
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:08,330
that other shit, no. It's just saxophone
[inaudible] morning. It's kind of boring.

2123
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:13,690
Why is that? I mean it's just, um,
it's, it's just too traditional,

2124
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:16,720
you know what I mean? Oh
really? Yeah. For me, I mean,
you know, bands do their thing.

2125
01:59:16,721 --> 01:59:20,170
I kinda like them.
I like for them to shine on there.

2126
01:59:20,171 --> 01:59:22,900
But you could have like a good guy with
doing a guitar solo and then you copy is

2127
01:59:22,901 --> 01:59:25,180
cuts with the cut or
something. Yeah. For me,

2128
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:27,940
I got all these instruments and I
tried to mimic them. So it's just like,

2129
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:33,150
do you get into any other type of music
other than I'm a DJ music or like or hip

2130
01:59:33,491 --> 01:59:36,910
hop? Like what kind of
Shit? Indian shit. Indian,

2131
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:42,640
Indian Bollywood. A half an Indian right
here on the phone. One on the phone.

2132
01:59:42,641 --> 01:59:47,290
Robert's face Indian. She's
lucky shit. Hey, what kind of,

2133
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:51,360

2136
01:59:59,051 --> 02:00:02,620
but I've seen the guy I know each
time and pull that song up to nick.

2137
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,380
I think it's called tonight's just type
in dollar mainly? Yeah. Dollar men.

a bad motherfucker. Dude.

2144
02:00:31,621 --> 02:00:34,990
This is the happiest guy. You've got to
see him and he's doing this whole thing.

2145
02:00:34,991 --> 02:00:39,991
The video is fantastic because the video
is him with his crazy terbinafine and

2146
02:00:40,241 --> 02:00:42,070
he's fucking dancing up a storm.

2147
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:44,860
It's just all around you got busted
with white slavery by the way.

2148
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:49,750
I'm involved in some sort of fucking
slave trade operation. We'll, yeah,

2149
02:00:49,751 --> 02:00:52,850

went down or he got framed. But uh,

2150
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:56,560
have you found a Brian da
I'm looking at right now.

2151
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:59,920

We gave him that yesterday. Yeah.
M E H Harry go MDI to knock tune.

2154
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:10,143
Listen to this.

2155
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:14,740
Ah,

2156
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,590
sunrise,
beautiful Indian.

2157
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:23,620
Show me all the majesty architecture

2158
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:26,963
that looks like

2159
02:01:28,570 --> 02:01:31,280
it's like fucking
asteroids coming to space.

2160
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:39,510
And one of them is him
check guy out

2161
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:51,560
appearing everywhere in different
clothes from different asteroids

2162
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,120
or these dancing and singing to a south

2163
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:07,860
and he's a fat fuck.
Big Fat ass round face

2164
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:13,130
sculpted Justin Bieber tight in his gut

2165
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:19,160
and the he's lovable, clump, clumping,
lovable. I got to get it for you.

2166
02:02:19,161 --> 02:02:21,740
I have a dollar Mandy
doll. Oh No, you don't.

2167
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:25,220
In Toronto you can see there are my
mom's house or in one of my boxes in the

2168
02:02:25,221 --> 02:02:27,740
House leaders dancing.
It's so ridiculous.

2169
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:32,630
They made dolls of him and you push
the button and he did this leg,

2170
02:02:32,631 --> 02:02:33,860
his arms started moving and stuff.

2171
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:39,340
I love the song. I was obsessed with this
song for a couple of weeks. Hey Gang,

2172
02:02:39,341 --> 02:02:43,860
I'm sorry. I should definitely team up.
Uh, do you do wet like Ebony and ivory?

2173
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:47,660
Um,
don't you think the,

2174
02:02:48,990 --> 02:02:51,340
isn't that guy like he's
successful enough on his own?

2175
02:02:51,341 --> 02:02:54,310
I don't think it needs to bring dollar
Mindy into the mix. Yeah. Unfortunately.

2176
02:02:54,311 --> 02:02:57,380
Dollar never really caught on.
Not In the wide mass.

2177
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:01,390
He could have easily been like huge in
India. That's like just as good. Yeah.

2178
02:03:01,391 --> 02:03:05,560
That's like still a billion pixels and
style and at least a billion people still

2179
02:03:05,561 --> 02:03:08,710
like, yeah, he's easy. But isn't he
in trouble? Didn't he get in trouble?

2180
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:11,700
I don't know. I never heard that. Yeah.
There's something happened to him, man.

2181
02:03:12,030 --> 02:03:15,670
Did you, did you work on
the sound from way out? Uh,

2182
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:20,880
the in sound from way out know that that
was such a interesting album because

2183
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:26,290
it's a complete instrumental album and
I actually didn't think I was going to

2184
02:03:26,291 --> 02:03:28,630
like it,
but I love that album and uh,

2185
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:32,320
introduced me to a lot of different
artists that were similar like Midecky

2186
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:35,590
Martin and wood and things like that.
Do you enjoy, did you enjoy that,

2187
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:40,030
that album or it was one of my favorites.
Yeah, we played it a lot of it live.

2188
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:43,460
Wow. Yeah, it was awesome that, that's a,

2189
02:03:43,461 --> 02:03:47,100
that's one of the few cds that I still
always have in my CD collection cause

2190
02:03:47,101 --> 02:03:49,480
that's always a great CD just
to throw in as, you know,

2191
02:03:49,481 --> 02:03:52,550
like have you people over
exactly. It's timeless. Yeah.

2192
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:54,960
It's not so in your face it's right.

2193
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:59,150
The boys,
the remaining members having a plan,

2194
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:03,500
do they know what they're going to do now?
They're just laying low right now.

2195
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:07,070
Right. Just doing benefits,
trying to help the situation, uh,

2196
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:10,450
the family and just trying to
help the situation over in, uh,

2197
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:13,160
New Jersey and you go,
oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.

2198
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:17,060
The Sandy Hurricane Sandy that
they're doing that. They live there.

2199
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:21,860
They live in Manhattan. Yeah. Yeah.
Were you there for that? I wasn't, no.

2200
02:04:21,861 --> 02:04:24,950
I was on this side.
It must be some crazy shit.

2201
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:29,810
It was some crazy shit to see like New
Jersey and the boardwalk just gone.

2202
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,250
Yeah.

2203
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:35,150
It's weird to see those photos of like
the foundations of the house dude.

2204
02:04:35,151 --> 02:04:38,340
I mean you don't see that shit
here in America. It's like wow.

2205
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:41,100
Yeah. Well we haven't really
been around that long.

2206
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:42,520
That's what's really hilarious.
Yeah.

2207
02:04:42,521 --> 02:04:45,390
We have this idea of like
what the weather does,

2208
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:48,150
but it's only based on like a couple of
hundred years that people writing shit

2209
02:04:48,151 --> 02:04:48,960
down.
It's true.

2210
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,440
You get more than three or 400 years
ago and like who the fuck knows what

2211
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:53,430
happened?
Exactly.

2212
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:56,700
Now you get like a couple of thousand
years ago when it regarding whether all

2213
02:04:56,701 --> 02:05:00,480
you have is ice core samples and that
gives you sort of a good idea if you drug

2214
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:04,230
dig holes in the right place but you don't
really know about like hurricanes and

2215
02:05:04,231 --> 02:05:08,270
shit. It's like, it's, it's hard to know
what kind of damage. Yeah. That's kind of,

2216
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:11,670
they know how cold it gets and no hot
it. God, they know certain storms,

2217
02:05:11,671 --> 02:05:14,940
but there's storms that have happened
that have just wiped out and completely

2218
02:05:14,941 --> 02:05:19,910
change entire ecosystems. One storm,
boom, everything's dead. It's,

2219
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:24,240
you know, we're lucky. We'll know after
the 21st we really have to worry about,

2220
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:27,510
it's not even storms we really have to
worry about as volcanoes and asteroids.

2221
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:30,880
Those are the two big ones. We haven't
experienced either one of those. Yeah.

2222
02:05:30,881 --> 02:05:34,000
And then that whole alignment is
coming too, right? Yeah. Dude,

2223
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:37,530
we're all going to die. No, I don't think
that alignment is, I don't think that's,

2224
02:05:37,531 --> 02:05:41,920
I think that's all bullshit. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. According to astronomers are,

2225
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:46,650
yeah. Like, um, what's his
name? Um, Neil degrasse Tyson.

2226
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:51,210
He says that it happens like on a
regular basis, like this, this alignment,

2227
02:05:51,211 --> 02:05:51,581
like it's,

2228
02:05:51,581 --> 02:05:54,720
it's what people are calling this
alignment with the center of the galaxy.

2229
02:05:54,721 --> 02:05:56,040
It's really just a misunderstanding.

2230
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:58,560
They don't really know what they're
talking about and it's sort of repeating

2231
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:01,680
some shit that somebody else said that
doesn't know what they're talking about.

2232
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:05,670
And it's like this the same sort of doom
and gloom mentality that led people to

2233
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:08,550
think that y two K was going
to kill us all. Exactly. Yeah.

2234
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:10,740
Because if there's no fucking electricity,

2235
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:14,460
you're going to have a hard time doing
shows because it's really hard to do

2236
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:18,180
shows as a DJ without electricity. I mean
you could have a fucking acoustic show.

2237
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:21,390
He could do standup comedy through a
toilet paper roll and get of a beatboxer.

2238
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:25,500
Yeah. What the fuck do you do?
And if the mouth, your scratches,

2239
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:31,080
air scratching. Yeah. I mean solar
flare, he didn't have to get,

2240
02:06:31,081 --> 02:06:34,320
so you going to have to solar power,
solar power DJ equipment.

2241
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:36,060
You're gonna need to come up with
a cut called the solar flare.

2242
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:39,780
What would that be like? Well there's
a flare and then there's like,

2243
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:42,120
oh there's a flare.
I would cause the solar flare.

2244
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:46,410
You would cause this whole front there's
a two click flare. What is a flare?

2245
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:48,090
How do you do a flare?
A flare is when you moved

2246
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:53,140
the fade or like a millisecond off
to cut the sound off in the middle.

2247
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:58,950
It's definitely gotta be displayed person.
But you know,

2248
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:03,740
there's certain scratches that put
together and there they work differently.

2249
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,030
Him and his crew created those.

2250
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,900
Who's the baddest motherfucker in
deejaying ever. Is there a consensus?

2251
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:10,380
Okay,

2252
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:12,290
it makes sense to you.
Does it mix master Mike?

2253
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:15,450
Are you the baddest motherfucker ever?
He says he's not even blinking.

2254
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:20,070
I have to say it was more of a, how dare
you ask me that? Well, I don't know.

2255
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:23,010
I mean I would say that's what,
that's his way of saying.

2256
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,120
There should be no question. Who's like
your number one rival? That's the case.

2257
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,860
My number one rival. Yeah. Like the guy
out there like keeps you on your toes.

2258
02:07:30,910 --> 02:07:32,780
What's my, was my partner, Dj Q,

2259
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:35,860
Bert. And um, he was kind of like

2260
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:39,670
the other side. I mean when I
first showed him this scratch,

2261
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:43,420
he turned into a monster and then
we used to battle and go at it.

2262
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,900
He beat me once.
I beat him once in a big battle.

2263
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:49,560
Do you think that that
scratching and this type of, uh,

2264
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:54,090
using records and shit is a transitionary
art form because like if everything

2265
02:07:54,091 --> 02:07:56,310
goes digital and everything goes from,
you know,

2266
02:07:56,311 --> 02:08:00,940
like solid state mediums to nonexistent,
do you think that this a,

2267
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:05,520
it'll be like actually considered
an instrument soon in the future?

2268
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:10,020
I think it should already be considered
the way certain people play it because

2269
02:08:10,021 --> 02:08:14,220
you really are playing it much like, look,
he use a guitar to make certain sounds.

2270
02:08:14,221 --> 02:08:15,900
He didn't really create the guitar,
you know,

2271
02:08:15,901 --> 02:08:18,900
you use the same strings
that everybody else uses.

2272
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:20,670
It creates a certain
sound and that's what,

2273
02:08:20,671 --> 02:08:22,590
and putting it all together
is what makes it beautiful.

2274
02:08:22,870 --> 02:08:27,120
Then taking music that somebody else made
with a guitar and it's on a record and

2275
02:08:27,121 --> 02:08:31,620
then creating, turning it into
something really different. Yeah. Yeah.

2276
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:34,680
What do you think of when you hear like
real obvious samples? They'll like, like,

2277
02:08:34,681 --> 02:08:39,390
uh, can't touch. This is like obviously
Rick James Super Freak, you know, like,

2278
02:08:39,391 --> 02:08:44,130
um, vanilla ice, ice, ice baby.
Obviously under pressure, you know,

2279
02:08:44,131 --> 02:08:45,240
it's like there's,

2280
02:08:45,330 --> 02:08:48,400
there's something that happens when
you have a song where it's like you're

2281
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:53,340
taking some classic hit and then
morphing it. It's like can cheat.

2282
02:08:53,341 --> 02:08:56,310
And a little beauty of it is to,
you know,

2283
02:08:56,340 --> 02:09:01,000
be a Ninja about it and smash it.
And what people don't even know it yet.

2284
02:09:01,070 --> 02:09:05,250
Obliterate it. We played some shit
and Russell Russell pulled out some,

2285
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:09,100
some things that we didn't even know.
What was it that you did that too? It was,

2286
02:09:09,101 --> 02:09:10,840
it,
it takes two to make a thing go right.

2287
02:09:10,841 --> 02:09:13,530
Well it wasn't all some song you
played and go ahead. That's from, yeah,

2288
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:16,020
it was like the beat. I was like, that's
from like, I remember what it was,

2289
02:09:16,021 --> 02:09:19,980
but he picks out like two or three
things that were smashed up together.

2290
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:25,020
You guys have like a educated ears, sorta
like a, some all Yang can tell wines

2291
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:30,080
j unit, you know, you have a connection
to I Dj Q, Bert you to Joe. Oh yeah,

2292
02:09:30,170 --> 02:09:34,670
yeah. He actually, he was the one that
does their run DMT, uh, uh, shirts.

2293
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,950
Yeah. That's hilarious. Have you,
has he checked into doing DMT yet?

2294
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:45,040
No, not you. A Mike. There were thoughts.

2295
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:49,760
There were thoughts of doing it, but
the thoughts never seen that. Oh yeah.

2296
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:52,160
The Guitar Ufo.
Okay.

2297
02:09:52,370 --> 02:09:56,930
What are you talking about? This guy,
a Cubert. His old partner made a,

2298
02:09:57,330 --> 02:10:01,610
a turntable, had a mixer built
into it and it was called a Q LFO.

2299
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:06,710
Ah. And then some guy took the cue
FFO and built it onto a guitar,

2300
02:10:06,711 --> 02:10:09,410
neck, everything. Oh
Wow. Where's, let me see.

2301
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:12,830
That's what the picture that's
Cubert actually on it. Oh Wow.

2302
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:16,820
It's funny because I went with Cubert that
day to go see the thing still. So I'm,

2303
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:19,770
I was there videotaping him,
um, cutting on it and stuff.

2304
02:10:19,950 --> 02:10:23,040
Super Creative. That run DMT shirt.
Brian. Yeah, he sounds Amanda.

2305
02:10:23,090 --> 02:10:25,380
It's a on this store,
so I'm guessing that's him.

2306
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:28,620
I don't know where I bought it from.
I bought it from somewhere online.

2307
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:31,680
I don't know if I bought it
from his store. I think he's
the one that created it.

2308
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,880
That's fascinating.

2309
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:37,060
What do you think about DMT,
Joe? How was your experience?

2310
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:42,380
How do I begin any crazy
patterns from the other side?

2311
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:46,170
Uh, well what it is, you know,

2312
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:48,960
it's the most potent
psychedelic known demand. Yeah.

2313
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:53,570
Basically it's like right up there.
This is a few other ones that rival it.

2314
02:10:53,630 --> 02:10:58,630
Salvia divinorum is pretty potent
and a so as a five methoxy DMT,

2315
02:10:58,791 --> 02:10:59,720
that's pretty potent to,

2316
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:02,660
it's actually even more potent I
think gram for gram than and and

2317
02:11:02,661 --> 02:11:05,600
dimethyltryptamine, which is
the visual effects, the empty.

2318
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:09,290
It's pretty life changing shit, man.
Just to know that it's possible.

2319
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,730
Just knowing that it's possible.

2320
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:15,200
It's sort of like really
puts your ear first of all,

2321
02:11:15,201 --> 02:11:20,201
your understanding of the universe into
perspective because you go through your

2322
02:11:20,241 --> 02:11:25,241
life and as your experiencing life and
doing things and traveling and meeting

2323
02:11:26,751 --> 02:11:27,800
people and going places.

2324
02:11:27,801 --> 02:11:32,210
You're a formulating a
database of possibilities like
these are all the possible

2325
02:11:32,211 --> 02:11:35,540
people that I can meet. These are
the possible scenarios. Oh my God,

2326
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:39,080
I'm in front of 14,000 people.
This is a possible event.

2327
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:43,280
Who would have thought and you accumulate
all these different experiences and

2328
02:11:43,281 --> 02:11:44,990
you put them into your view of the world.

2329
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:50,080
Then you do something like DMT and Dmt
is so strange and so gigantic and so

2330
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:01,960
impactful and odd and impossible
to describe and you know,

2331
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:07,430
using any words to try to piece
together the experience of,

2332
02:12:07,431 --> 02:12:12,320
of a full blown DMT trip. Is it
ridiculous? It's a waste of time. There's,

2333
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:13,550
it's inadequate.

2334
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:18,580
The words exist to describe experiences
that everybody has in common,

2335
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:22,670
whether it's large groups of people,
whether it's life or death or violence.

2336
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:27,950
Those words to describe DMT do not exist
and you have no frame of reference for

2337
02:12:27,951 --> 02:12:31,760
them. They have no point of reference if
you haven't experienced it. And that's,

2338
02:12:31,790 --> 02:12:36,110
that's weird to know that there's
something that's so different from regular

2339
02:12:36,111 --> 02:12:37,640
life that if you take it once,

2340
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:41,840
you never look at regular life the same
way again because the possibilities have

2341
02:12:41,841 --> 02:12:45,770
now changed because you know that a DMT
trip as possible because I would have,

2342
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:50,780
before I did the empty out
of never imagined that that
was available and that if

2343
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:52,010
it was available,

2344
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:55,310
it wasn't something that
was being discussed on the
front page of the New York

2345
02:12:55,311 --> 02:12:59,120
Times every fucking day where scientists
weren't getting together with world

2346
02:12:59,121 --> 02:13:02,060
leaders and trying to figure out
what it means, what it's doing,

2347
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:04,550
what it does to you,
why it changes your life,

2348
02:13:04,551 --> 02:13:08,030
how much would it benefit people to have
this experience? Should it be regulated?

2349
02:13:08,031 --> 02:13:11,510
Should it be understood?
Should it be encouraged?

2350
02:13:11,511 --> 02:13:13,960
Like what should we do with this stuff?
Instead,

2351
02:13:13,970 --> 02:13:16,360
it was like a secret and then instead the,

2352
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:20,000
the trippiest thing about it was what I
would talk about it and I would do like

2353
02:13:20,001 --> 02:13:22,910
videos about it and then people would go,
what the fuck are you tall?

2354
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:23,990
I never even heard about this.
I'm like,

2355
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:28,670
how is it possible that you're learning
about one of the craziest things that

2356
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:31,770
any human being has ever experienced ever
and you're learning about it from me?

2357
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,900
Like how is it possible that
no one's talking about this?

2358
02:13:33,901 --> 02:13:36,300
It didn't make any sense.
I didn't understand it.

2359
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:39,570
And then you find out that your own
brain makes it and then you find out that

2360
02:13:39,571 --> 02:13:43,110
it's also in a million different kinds
of plants and then you find out that it's

2361
02:13:43,111 --> 02:13:46,830
super illegal and it's like
what is going on with our laws?

2362
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:51,690
What is going on with our system of
government where one of the most life

2363
02:13:51,691 --> 02:13:56,691
changing experiences you could ever
possibly have and it's illegal.

2364
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:59,820
Like you,
you can go to jail for it.

2365
02:13:59,821 --> 02:14:04,821
Like it's absolutely massively beneficial
to thousands and thousands if not

2366
02:14:04,981 --> 02:14:08,010
millions of people. And
it's illegal. We're in a,

2367
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:12,720
we're being run by madness.
That's what DMT lets me know.

2368
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:16,080
But DMT lets me know that we,
our system of government,

2369
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:19,650
the system that we're born
into is just fucking madness.

2370
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:23,310
The system of trying to stop people from
doing shit that you don't understand

2371
02:14:23,311 --> 02:14:25,800
and you've never experienced.
That's madness.

2372
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:29,970
Just that alone that opened me up to that,
to,

2373
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:34,740
to forget about what I've learned or
what I felt when I was having a DMT trip.

2374
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:38,910
Just the fact that someone who has never
experienced it tried to keep it from

2375
02:14:38,911 --> 02:14:41,700
you. Someone who doesn't understand
it and it never actually had it,

2376
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:45,090
is trying to tell you what
it is and trying to regulate
it and try to keep other

2377
02:14:45,091 --> 02:14:48,470
people from doing it. That just shows
you how crazy we are. Fucking man.

2378
02:14:48,490 --> 02:14:51,810
You function when you're on
it. No, no. You don't exist.

2379
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:57,120
It's the only drug I think that I've
ever heard of or taken other than a,

2380
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:02,370
against Salvia. It was supposed to be
very debilitating to your eyes are closed.

2381
02:15:02,371 --> 02:15:03,780
Yeah. Yeah. You close your eyes,

2382
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:06,810
you take it and you just fucking
vanish into another world.

2383
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:09,120
You literally go into a fairy world.

2384
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:14,490
He'd go into this weird world of extreme
lights and colors that shouldn't be

2385
02:15:14,491 --> 02:15:19,080
able to exist in patterns and
logos and shit. Yeah. What is it,

2386
02:15:19,081 --> 02:15:22,590
what's the craziest thing you've
ever experienced? Craziest, craziest,

2387
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:27,120
psychedelics? Anything.
Oh, fuck. Mushrooms.

2388
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:31,860
Just straight mushroom caps. Yeah. Um,
drinking orange juice with it. Yeah.

2389
02:15:33,450 --> 02:15:35,430
And waiting for Ufo to come

2390
02:15:37,450 --> 02:15:41,070
and they might come to actually
saw some Ufos and you know,

2391
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:45,000
I got my turntables out. I'm
scratching and I was, I was on one.

2392
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:49,440
You were on a Ufo while you
were scratching. I want it
to be, you want it to be?

2393
02:15:49,830 --> 02:15:52,470
Yeah. Fuck yeah. Maybe it's
just took a couple more grams.

2394
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:57,390
He would have been in it. Fire
in the sky. Well, it's like,

2395
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:01,980
that's the thing about
those hallucinations.
They're so God damn strong.

2396
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:04,860
Like the hallucinations that
you have while you're on a,

2397
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:08,490
any sort of visionary plant
like mushrooms, when you
take a large dose of them,

2398
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:13,470
it's almost like, is this a different
way? If I tapped into a different reality,

2399
02:16:13,471 --> 02:16:17,490
am I actually here and when I go back
to regular reality and I sober up,

2400
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:21,570
does that mean that this never happened
or is it that this does happen,

2401
02:16:21,571 --> 02:16:24,390
but it only happens when you're on
mushrooms, but it is real. That's real.

2402
02:16:24,570 --> 02:16:27,540
That's real. Yeah. It feels
real. It feels real. It is real.

2403
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:29,990
I don't think regular people who ever,
who

2404
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,830
have never tripped really truly
understand that sentiment.

2405
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:36,640
It seems like something that is impossible
to describe because when you come

2406
02:16:36,641 --> 02:16:41,560
back, it's just so still and so odd
and weird. Like what just happened?

2407
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:43,300
Is it still with me?
No,

2408
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:47,050
it's quiet right now and I'm
looking and I'm like, okay,

2409
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:51,100
I'm going to go with my
frigerator get some breakfast.

2410
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:54,010
Well that's the weird
thing is just knowing,

2411
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:57,190
having the knowledge that
that's available, you know,

2412
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:00,130
and Drussel you didn't drink
at all until you were 30 ones.

2413
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:03,400
You're pretty straight laced. You don't
fuck with anything, Huh? Just alcohol.

2414
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:07,390
You ever get a contact high from
hanging around? People like me? Um,

2415
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,870
I think I did once. I didn't, I,

2416
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:14,990
I just watched TV if we hotbox Greg
Fitzsimmons in here once sent that

2417
02:17:15,281 --> 02:17:19,540
motherfucker on stage and a
delirium. Nice. Yeah. I don't, I,

2418
02:17:19,541 --> 02:17:21,910
I've never been in here and that's really,

2419
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:23,950
I've been curious about it or anything.

2420
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:27,500
What if you met a hot chick and she said
she smoked weed and made her horny? Nah,

2421
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:31,810
really? I, you know, when I did, I have
tried it. Yeah. And I didn't like it.

2422
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:34,840
What didn't you like? I didn't
like the coughing. First of all,

2423
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:39,130
you have to try a vaporizer or eating it.
I have also done that.

2424
02:17:39,131 --> 02:17:42,670
I had a Brownie ones and I
did not like the way I felt.

2425
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:47,350
I was literally literally
clinging to the bed.

2426
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:51,340
It's not surprising space cookies.
And I did not like that. I was like,

2427
02:17:51,341 --> 02:17:54,220
I don't want that again. Yeah, they
can do some things to you, man.

2428
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:57,820
The body change your life. Yeah.
But you, but you like alcohol.

2429
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,770
I don't like alcohol. Not until you
were 31. That's true. Just keep, we try.

2430
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:07,870
We have a little, I've tried it and I
didn't really, I don't like to slow down.

2431
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:12,790
Ah, I need space. We'd need weed.
It makes you want to speed up. I,

2432
02:18:12,990 --> 02:18:14,920
I like, you know,
maintaining at this function,

2433
02:18:14,921 --> 02:18:17,620
but my brain working a little faster.
So then why are you drinking?

2434
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:22,780
Because my brain gets slicker when it's
drunk. Really drunk. I get buzzed. I,

2435
02:18:22,781 --> 02:18:25,450
I'm not, I'm not even
getting hammered, but uh,

2436
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:28,530
how do you feel like your brain is
slicker when it's, do you feel like my,

2437
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:29,820
I must lose your tongue.
Devil.

2438
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:31,820
Aye.

2439
02:18:32,350 --> 02:18:36,420
I, I can, I can, I can. I'm a Mac.

2440
02:18:36,421 --> 02:18:40,110
When I got some alcohol and weed. Holy
Shit. I'm happy with myself. This,

2441
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:42,960
this lady's right now that are ready
to take up that challenge like this.

2442
02:18:42,961 --> 02:18:44,970
This motherfucker talking shit.
It's true.

2443
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:48,590
I'm going to rub up on Russell
Peters next time I seen him. Please.

2444
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:51,280
He's very single now.
Well, very single. And uh,

2445
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:54,960
we'll be in Vegas December 29th.
Well, yes, I will be to you.

2446
02:18:54,961 --> 02:18:58,770
I'm going to get in on like the 28 so I
can go to a punk ass party on the 28th.

2447
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:01,680
Where's his party? I Dunno. He
just got some party on the 28th.

2448
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:04,140
You're going to wear tap out
clothes or no, no, I can't do that.

2449
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:08,410
I've told them, hey man, congratulations.
But I can't wear that shit.

2450
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:13,640
You can wear a Kangol hat though. I can
work angle Kango never went out of style.

2451
02:19:13,670 --> 02:19:18,050
They never went commercial. No, they
did. They kangols official like, yeah,

2452
02:19:18,051 --> 02:19:22,620
it's official like fishing.
It's like Adidas never goes
out of style. Yeah. It's,

2453
02:19:22,621 --> 02:19:25,190
it's become a brand,
a trustworthy,

2454
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:28,200
longtime brand Dutch never that out.
They couldn't,

2455
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:30,920
you couldn't keep it together
cause von Dutch morphed into Ed.

2456
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,860
Ed Hardy didn't it?
They couldn't keep it together.

2457
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:37,870
Even in Ed Hardy morphed into fucking
like von Dutch and Ed Hardy with both like

2458
02:19:38,241 --> 02:19:41,780
Krispy Kreme donuts. It's like you,
you gorge, you don't just have one.

2459
02:19:41,781 --> 02:19:45,940
You go crazy and then you flood the
market and then it's over and then people

2460
02:19:45,941 --> 02:19:49,670
are sick of it and then affliction came
in. Right? Yeah. It's all it, all it, all,

2461
02:19:49,671 --> 02:19:51,910
it all went bad after
that. I was, I was never a,

2462
02:19:51,970 --> 02:19:55,850
I guess you could say I just by fucking
five packs of Hanes Vnx and I'm a happy

2463
02:19:55,851 --> 02:19:58,610
man. Yeah. It's like the most
comfortable shirt ever. Right.

2464
02:19:59,030 --> 02:20:01,400
And then they're disposable, you
know, they get a little off guard,

2465
02:20:01,401 --> 02:20:04,700
this colored fucking throwing them out
or clean your house, you know. Dot.

2466
02:20:04,701 --> 02:20:05,720
Merera doesn't,
uh,

2467
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:09,680
doesn't ever pack socks or underwear and
just goes to a town than buy socks and

2468
02:20:09,681 --> 02:20:13,160
underwear and throws him out. That's
ridiculous. You can't, can't do that.

2469
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:16,610
Charlie Murphy gets new shoes every
time he goes on stage. Oh, that's Eddie,

2470
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:19,770
Eddie Griffin. It doesn't, I think
Charlie Murphy does it too, man. Yeah.

2471
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:23,390
Eddie Griffin gets a white air
force ones every show. Every show.

2472
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:26,420
If it's a two show night, you
get two parents. Come on son.

2473
02:20:26,470 --> 02:20:29,480
I think it seems a little dated now
that you want the air force ones.

2474
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:33,950
What have you been paying attention to
this cat Williams meltdown. I didn't know.

2475
02:20:33,951 --> 02:20:38,280
I think there's a pool as to when
he's going to end it all. Thank Doug.

2476
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:41,270
Stan helps numbers. What's
he got a wonder? Yeah,

2477
02:20:41,271 --> 02:20:43,190
I'm standing on pass him in
the celebrity death pool.

2478
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,170
He has his own website and I zone
betting website or something like Doug

2479
02:20:46,170 --> 02:20:49,460
Stanhope Cause I think, I think somebody
told me, bitch, what's He mad at?

2480
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:51,110
I don't know.
Kat Williams.

2481
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:54,730
He's mad at everybody and just slap smack
your mother fuckers. The microphone.

2482
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:58,520
The other, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's smacking people, audience
members, and just squares.

2483
02:20:58,521 --> 02:21:01,580
Now he's not even hitting like we went
to target and just hit the cashier.

2484
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:05,630
He slapped him, he hit
his assistant, allegedly,

2485
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:07,760
I don't think it's a legendary dude.

2486
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:12,620
He hit a dude that works for live nation
allegedly and he's hanging around with

2487
02:21:12,621 --> 02:21:15,790
shook night. So she's probably like,
you know, like a pit bull shit. And I,

2488
02:21:15,791 --> 02:21:17,420
it's just like genesis,
what the fuck is wrong?

2489
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:23,630
You know,
it's sad for me to hear there's the,

2490
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:28,670
here's him just talking to
a target employee and then
like the guy has his hands

2491
02:21:28,671 --> 02:21:32,010
on his chest too. So you know, he's the
night like being threatened. Any worry.

2492
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:36,370
Mr. Williams. I'm a big fan. Yeah.

2493
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:40,940
And bams slabs right on the face and the
guy just slowly pulls out his phone and

2494
02:21:40,941 --> 02:21:44,480
calls the police while catches stares
at it up again. Let me see that again.

2495
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:49,310
Let me back that up. Well, it's,
it's, it's a security camera.

2496
02:21:49,311 --> 02:21:52,550
That's why it's so small.
Right. Let's see. He's a cat
talk much bigger than that.

2497
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:56,450
And then a Bam and it was a hard slap.

2498
02:21:56,451 --> 02:21:58,350
They're just better
videos out there and then,

2499
02:21:58,470 --> 02:22:02,930
then he just stands there and watches him
for a while and then he just rolls off.

2500
02:22:02,931 --> 02:22:04,610
And when it is a handicap cart,

2501
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:09,680
things that's drugs are not good drugs.
That's drugs.

2502
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:14,330
He's on a bad trip right now, dude. Yeah.
That's like, uh, he's, he's on a bender.

2503
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:15,920
You know,
it's,

2504
02:22:15,921 --> 02:22:18,200
you gotta be real careful when you're
talking to a guy like that and they do a

2505
02:22:18,201 --> 02:22:22,820
rational shit. So unfortunate because if
you go back to like his, his early work,

2506
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:25,980
you know, it's like a standup
work. I think he's hilarious. I

2507
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,910
love watching you drive the
pimp chronicles. Yeah. He's
so funny, man. So good.

2508
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:31,510
He was so funny.
I don't,

2509
02:22:31,570 --> 02:22:36,570
I hate to see someone who was really
good spiral and like that spiraling back

2510
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:41,130
hard, worse than anybody we've ever
seen. Worse Than Martin Lawrence.

2511
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:43,490
But wouldn't Martin just rented a traffic?
That was it.

2512
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:46,690
Do you have a gun on him and
something like that? Yeah. No,

2513
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:48,950
I didn't end up cat had a gun.
Katsman collar.

2514
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:53,550
W Cat's been covered a lot of things.
Like what is it about entertainers, Bro?

2515
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:57,990
I don't know, 14 years of the Beastie
boys. You must know some shit. Too much.

2516
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:00,750
Too much. All at once.
Too much all at once.

2517
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:03,780
They seem to have mellowed
out as whatever you need.

2518
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:09,240
Well, hello Mr. Schwartz. Come check into
your, uh, your room. Whatever you need.

2519
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:11,160
I'm telling you whatever you need.

2520
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:12,423
Is that what it is?

2521
02:23:13,070 --> 02:23:15,950
Whatever you need gave me that. Look.
Whatever you need, you need to him.

2522
02:23:16,690 --> 02:23:20,850
So is it just that you have, you're
the one calling all your shots? Yeah.

2523
02:23:20,890 --> 02:23:22,450
You have access to everything.
Definitely.

2524
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:26,200
What's the nuttiest shit you ever saw
on the road and nutty. Nutty as shit.

2525
02:23:26,201 --> 02:23:29,860
Like 50 fucking girls showing up
with a bowling bag full of coke.

2526
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:33,340
Like what's the nuttiest shit you
ever saw? Oh, the nuttiest shit. Well,

2527
02:23:33,341 --> 02:23:38,341
I did have a girl come and run up
to the stage and bite me on my neck.

2528
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:39,783
What

2529
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:42,760
she, she, she did will a smooth,
like though, she was like, Hey Mike,

2530
02:23:42,761 --> 02:23:44,890
how are you doing? I
got this record. I went,

2531
02:23:45,170 --> 02:23:48,140
sorry. Error. How hard she
bite you. Pretty hard. She on.

2532
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:51,990
She was trying to take a piece
of meat off. Yeah, it was
fucked up. I was like, wow,

2533
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:53,940
okay.
Did you fuck her and forget about it.

2534
02:23:53,941 --> 02:23:58,050
Did you fuck her luck in 1960
or something puncher? No,

2535
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:00,000
those girls been still
in since high school.

2536
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:03,150
This motherfucker fingered me in
the back of the car. I was like,

2537
02:24:03,151 --> 02:24:06,180
I don't want to be that guy, but
I got to go. Let's end this bitch.

2538
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:09,900
I got to go meet my daughter for dinner.

I'm going to deflect to Russell's want
to send this thing. Oh, you're right.

2557
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:21,630
You're not saying, oh Russell, please.

2558
02:25:21,631 --> 02:25:25,470
I'm all about all the shit

She always also say that Skullcandy
we're wearing his McMaster's.

2563
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:47,700
Mike says Skullcandy headphones
in. They're great headphones.
We love these. Yeah,

2564
02:25:47,870 --> 02:25:50,620
we didn't even know when I
came here and he gave me,

2565
02:25:50,621 --> 02:25:54,850
the ones that I'm wearing here are
special mix master Mike versions of the

2566
02:25:54,851 --> 02:25:57,730
headphones that he created.
It's funny because a,

2567
02:25:57,731 --> 02:26:01,330
the Skullcandy guys have been sending
us these we use in both here and at or

2568
02:26:01,331 --> 02:26:04,060
other studio. They're,
they're dope. We love them.

2569
02:26:04,061 --> 02:26:07,960
We use them for all our podcasts now. So
there you go. Free Plugs, skull candy.

2570
02:26:07,961 --> 02:26:12,280
We don't give a fuck. We ain't really
in this for the money bitch. Sort of.

2571
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:15,520
How do we give one of these bitches
away? Like this is a special, uh,

2572
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:17,600
what you're going to have to figure
out how to fucking send that shit.

2573
02:26:17,970 --> 02:26:22,270
We're not going to get around to doing
it. I don't have any headphones. Yeah,

2574
02:26:22,271 --> 02:26:23,860
that's what you do.
You give it away to Russell Peters.

2575
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:27,940
This is how I'm going
to give it to a recipe.

2576
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:30,460
I do need new headphones so
it works out really well.

2577
02:26:30,461 --> 02:26:33,570
And once we develop a
proper infrastructure, I'm
going to get started now.

2578
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:38,290
Fuck boy, you're older folks.

2579
02:26:39,310 --> 02:26:41,380
The odds of you getting it.
Let's be realistic.

2580
02:26:41,381 --> 02:26:45,430
There are probably a fucking million
to one. So Russell got it. Except it.

2581
02:26:45,550 --> 02:26:49,250
Deal with it and move the fuck on.
Goddammit. Is that desk squad stickers?

2582
02:26:50,250 --> 02:26:54,190
Triple m master Mike stickers.

2583
02:26:55,360 --> 02:27:00,100
Beautiful. Beautiful, powerful
mix. Master Mike in San Diego. No,

2584
02:27:00,101 --> 02:27:02,290
I'm not going to be in San Diego tomorrow.

and it also has, um, the uh,
