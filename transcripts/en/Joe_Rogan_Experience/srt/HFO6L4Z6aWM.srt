1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,960
I gotta make sure my shit is off.
I don't want to be that guy.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,990
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight,

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,740
but you already know this.
I've said this a thousand times.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,610
I've been using my fleshlight actually
for real for the last couple of week or

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,660
so. Allila yeah, I guess some night
by yourself or yeah, by myself.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,160
But I got that massage, that IC massage
stuff for your back. That makes it hot.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,430
Yeah, that makes her, it feels like,
no, it makes it cool. Like, like tingly.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,390
Anybody using that? What?
Yeah, that's the stuff.

9
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,190
Like that's like tiger balm or
something? Is that what you mean? Yeah,

10
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,390
it's the one that you just buy
it. Like the grocery store.
Is it lube? No, no, it's,

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,800
it's like massage oil for
the cold one on my dick.

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,510
And it doesn't seem like you
should do that. I've had,

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,500
I've used the hot one before while having
sex and it destroyed the girl's vagina

14
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:53,700
and it was the worst night ever. But the
cool one, you can get away. What happened?

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,890
Uh, I, I always thought for some reason
like massage oil and oil and all that,

16
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,130
you could just put it in the vagina.
You know,

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,870
like I just never really occurred to me
that the vagina, like it's a cabinet.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,230
The shine is just some shit you use
area you could put things. Yeah.

19
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:16,470
So like human tissue that absorbs
like toxins and chemicals. I know,

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,970
I know that now because she's
screaming her name, route or holding.

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,470
It went from like hot, sexy time to
fucking bitch ass time. But ouch.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,360
But the cold one you can
kind of get away with.

23
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,700
Like I've used the cold one on
a girl before and I, you know,

24
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,760
I just didn't tell her why,
why would you do this?

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,790
Cause I didn't know this
was back when I didn't know.

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,630
And I thought it was just lotion and I
used it and she never said anything bad.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,930
It was the hot one that got me
in trouble when you used it.

28
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,960
Like what was the purpose of
what we Berlin for Lube for?

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,980
She wasn't enjoying in the
ass and they're like, Oh hey,

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,270
I think that's even worse. Dude. Yeah.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,730
I think probably your pussy is a little
more durable than inside your asshole.

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,550
And we also used to always go ask the
pussy pussy to ass and never thought about

33
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,480
it cause I never thought
anything about poop.

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,590
Now that I've dated some porn stars,
they know everything possible.

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,590
That what they Ohio girls,

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,160
they don't know that just fucking
get infected and die. What happened?

37
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,030
So you could die from that dude.
You sticking point.

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,660
We know that now that's fucking wrong.
And they should train those Ohio,

39
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,840
Midwest people about this stuff.
Somebody should at least bring it up.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,290
It should be something you talk about
it because I think about that the vagina

41
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,700
is right next to the asshole and you're
barely telling them about putting it in

42
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,970
the vagina. Like had this putting
in the asshole ever even come up.

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,530
But yet in real life it comes
up all the time. Exactly.

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,250
It's fucking that school for you.
That's birds in it.

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,550
That's Horse Shit and well I'm glad
you never killed anybody with your poop

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,900
vagina antics.
I feel bad that you should feel it.

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,090
That's why I don't feel bad using the
code lube on my fleshlight. So, uh,

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,660
this cold lube, would you recommend this?
I mean, is this, this is a safe and yeah,

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,740
it's going to fall off. I keep using is
probably not safe, but it feels really,

50
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:04,710
really good. When you're your Dick's, like
on ice bar, it's throbbing, strange land.

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,620
Here's changed led and it numbs the
fleshlight even more. Don't do it.

52
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,590
They'll listen. Don't do not.
This is nothing we endorse.

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,830
I Dunno what adverse effects
that's going to have on your Dick.

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,900
You Silly Bitch for ladies and gentlemen,

55
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,630
the regular folks out there only use
like actual real sexual lubricant.

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,290
Schlub flesh lube is something
that the fleshlight cells,

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,380
fantastic stuff you don't need
to do. And you know, honestly,

58
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,550
now that I'm thinking about it,

59
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,940
I think you're only supposed to use water
based lubes and her flashlight because

60
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:34,660
they bill it like destroy
them. So I probably am fucking
up my bitch pretty bad.

61
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,230
Oh, what are you doing then?
Man, I'm destroying my flesh
that I got an extra one.

62
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,320
If you do but don't do it.
It's, it's a worthwhile thing.

63
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,930
You can keep one for years.
I know, but this is the chin,

64
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,500
a haze special additional and that
is drawing in a haze is butthole.

65
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,320
Does it ever a little signature on it?

66
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,020
She would ever have her
signature on her bottle.

67
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,890
That doesn't even fucking make sense.
I like to think you like,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,050
imagine if you're a piece
was like a signature like
so you know exactly who gave

69
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:05,410
it to you. She didn't came me. Did
you get fucking Joey Diaz? Herpes.

70
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,770
It's right here on your ass. Let
us the arteries. You fear her.

71
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,300
They should make death squad flashlights.
They would. I'm sure I forget guys.

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,460
Oh you mean like we should pose.
We did motor buttholes. Yeah,

73
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,440
but that's what I'm saying. You
have to pose for that. They have to,

74
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,150
they have to model your asshole.
Wow. That's to be down with that.

75
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
If we got a percentage of the flashlight,
those those girls make good money.

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,300
They do.
They make great money.

77
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,590
You're more than willing to let a
rubber version of your asshole would be

78
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,890
distributed all over the world. Why Not
Yours? Because you're silly. That's why.

79
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:39,340
Because what are some dude just gets
really into the idea of fucking you in the

80
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:43,900
ass because he's been practicing on your
flashlight and he dresses up like you

81
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,010
and he goes,

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,260
get your fucking tee shirt on right
now and if he had your little butthole

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,420
flashlight that would come so close to
completing the, that's all he needs. No.

84
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:57,421
All he needs is rufinol and to duck tape
and he's going to fuck you on video or

85
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,750
CIF.
Yeah.

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,280
I don't think you should be like sending
people the wrong message and the wrong

87
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:07,340
message clearly as you can fuck
my fake ass olive garden butthole.

88
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,460
Exactly.

105
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,330
which is how I got introduced to
the, uh, to the world of nootropics.

106
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,750
It's very interesting stuff in Roman ask.
He's got a very interesting story.

He was a,

from his football career

119
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,220
Well, good experience.
My Day Joe Rogan podcast,

120
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,860
my night all day,

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,073
my man,

122
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,390
my man got here and saw the whiskey on
the table right away, cracked it open.

123
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,300
We're not even looking at
2:00 PM and he was down.

124
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,540
I have to drink off my Vegas.
Is that what it is? Dude? How,

125
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,100
how bad was it for you?

126
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,140
What'd you guys go? What does the
fights, you've answered the fights. Uh,

127
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,860
it was awesome. And then, uh,
that night we went out to, uh,

128
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,790
we had 10 vice guys there and three of
them I got calls the next day because of

129
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,200
the limos had their wallets
and then three separate guys,

130
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,280
three separate cars and lost or won.
Wow.

131
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,950
Pocket pickpocket dudes
must thrive on that.

132
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,400
And they see those stumbling guys on
Monday morning that are barely together.

133
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:03,160
Yeah. So rack from the weekend. Well,
the, the, the car drivers were nice.

134
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,980
They were like, Hey, you know, I'll come
around and bring it back because why?

135
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,620
Right, right, right. They'd
be happy. They're going to
get a tip anyway. Yeah. The,

136
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,780
the vice, um, videos did you guys did
for Dan Hardee were fucking awesome, man.

137
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,520
That's really good stuff, man.
So it's really creatively shot.

138
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,980
It's intriguing.
The music was good.

139
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,650
The choices of when to put music
and when the puts, you know,

140
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:26,530
when to put no sound.
It was a really interesting man.

141
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,890
I thought I thought it was great and
I was out the whole scene where he's

142
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,470
driving. You know, I was
like, this is fucking cool.

143
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,360
I love Dan Hardee's and he's awesome.

144
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,940
He's a quite a personality
and I was really,

145
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,420
I love the other guy to
Duane Ludwig his opponent.

146
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,200
So it was hard to watch one guy, one
guy lose and one guy when it always is.

147
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:48,550
But it's nice to see Dan Hardee successful
yet. I love a story like that, man.

148
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:52,000
I love when a guy takes like this Jamie
Varner kid that fought this weekend.

149
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,130
Did you see that? Yeah, he
uh, went to small shows,

150
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,360
lost all his motivation,
um,

151
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,610
started getting beat by guys that should
never beat him and then all of a sudden,

152
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,280
uh, he just, for whatever reason,

153
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:06,200
and we'll have to figure it
out when he talked to him,

154
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,150
decided to get her shit together again
and just train like a fucking mad man.

155
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,360
They give him another shot in the UFC
and he just goes and knocks out Edson

156
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,320
Barboza. It was like one of the top 10
killers and 155 pounds in the world.

157
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,200
The last time Barboza was
in the ring was in Brazil.

158
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,830
We've fucking wheel kick Terry Edom and
the head and knocked him unconscious.

159
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,600
I mean, he's a dangerous, dangerous dude
and Jamie Varner fucked him up, man.

160
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,630
It was crazy. I'd love a story
like that. I love, I love, uh, to,

161
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,350
to just get it together. Now. It's
like one of my favorite things in life.

162
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,570
I love a guy who can keep it together,
but man,

163
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:40,110
I love a dude who loses it
and gets it back. You know?

164
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,560
That's fascinating to me and I'm
trying to think of a box of it.

165
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:44,850
Lost it and got it back.

166
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,390
It's not very many because of the
gorilla story is that, you know,

167
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,150
they had the boxing film recently. Uh,
both the old guy. Oh, that's pretty good.

168
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,810
The old time guy, like who had, he
had to fix his arm, but you know,

169
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,400
picking up the crates, it was that
guy. Which guy was that? Ah, fuck.

170
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,650
Now how long ago was this movie?
But 10 in the last 10 years. It's,

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,880
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Braddock,
Braddock. Yeah. Shit together.
I didn't see that. No,

172
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,950
I saw it like a clip of it and it
looks so hokey. Hollywood. I was like,

173
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,580
get the fuck out of there.
I hate when a guy who's got good,

174
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,530
like Russell Crowe gets stuck in a
movie like that. Like when you, you're,

175
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,140
you're using like one of the best actors
ever and you got them in this goofy ass

176
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:28,974
movie.

177
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,870
It's fucking fake ass boxing movie when
the guys throw fake ass looking punches,

178
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,103
you know,

179
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,070
there's not a whole lot of guys I've
ever pulled off like a real good fight

180
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,000
scene in a movie. It's hard.
It's hard to fake that shit.

181
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,500
That's the beauty of watching
it in real life. It's so crazy.

182
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,000
If you never seen it before, folks, you
owe to yourself for once in your life.

183
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,170
If you're a UFC fan to get tickets
and go to see a live event.

184
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:58,060
If it comes anywhere near you,
cause it's fucking crazy.

185
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,870
It's awesome when you're
right there too. I mean, I've,

186
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,920
I've been like inches away from
some of the craziest moments in,

187
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:09,240
in combat history, combat sports history
in the best seats. Believe it or not.

188
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,500
Or not floor.

189
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,550
It's about halfway up where you're almost
just a little bit over the top. Yeah,

190
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,950
you're right. You're right. The best
seats are not the most expensive ones.

191
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,570
The a above angles are great angle.
Especially like that first riser.

192
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:28,410
I think that's what it's first writer. So,
uh, what happened? You just kept going.

193
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,480
He just kept going all through Friday.
Author, Saturday, author Sunday. Yeah.

194
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,690
I came straight here.
Damn Dude. And he sleep,

195
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,230
um, in the limos, you know, we were,

196
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,070
we would pass out and then sort of keep
going. But yeah, a little bit of sleep.

197
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,510
Dude. I'm old now, so. Okay. You're
a fucking savage. You staring out,

198
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:50,010
they're going to wheels off,
man.

199
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,010
He's still going to wheels off the
tracks into the woods. You still

200
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,650
do it, Huh? Yeah. It's
fun, isn't it? Yeah.

201
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,040
I wished that alcohol
didn't have such a penalty.

202
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,750
So just steep penalty on your body. Yeah.
I love getting drunk. Yeah. You know,

203
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,130
I mean I'm cool. I'm really responsible
about it. I uh, I try not to do it,

204
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,690
you know, to a point of access
are though I don't ever drive,

205
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,410
but I do like it and fucked up.
That's why I like, like getting,

206
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:21,400
doing shots like in Vegas after a show
it's like let's just get fucked up.

207
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,350
You know where we were when the
last time and Eddie and Thompson,

208
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:27,010
Laura and I have got fucked up and
Australia. But like when Australia,

209
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,820
I got no responsibility. Let's can't
fucking blasted. Right. You know,

210
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,590
but damn the prices just ruthless on
your body. I'm going to be drunk still.

211
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:40,460
It was kind of drunk driving. Driving
here. What for real? For? Yeah, cause I,

212
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,340
I like woke up and went straight here,

213
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:46,060
so I feel like I felt like I was still
pretty fucked up from last night.

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,110
You really think that you could've got
pulled over and arrested? Probably not.

215
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,150
I probably would be fine, but it felt
like I was bugged still from last night.

216
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,470
Damn Dude, you're going wheels
off to both of you mother.

217
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,800
Motherfuckers putting me to shame.

218
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,430
Yeah.

219
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,750
I'm not putting you to the shame
when I anyway, can you just,

220
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,930
I don't know what I'm
allowed to say on there.

221
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,950
You can say anything about whiskey.
Don't say too much. Don't get crazy.

222
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,540
What are you gonna say? I was going
to say, you gave me something.

223
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,600
Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels.
Honey, he's my new thing.

224
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,540
Let's do shots of that. Is My
new thing. Delicious for poison.

225
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,200
As far as poison goes, it's the best top.
What's your, what's your poison man? Eh,

226
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,040
well I love Whiskey, but you know, I like
Shitty Irish whiskey. Like Bushmills.

227
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,840
Really?
That's kind of stuff you like.

228
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,940
The more expensive scotch is that more
tastes like Scott's, Scott's the socks.

229
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,180
I like to just drink it
all shitty whiskey. Really?
That's interesting. Is that,

230
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,300
is that common? I Dunno. I've,

231
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,460
cause I thought like the smooth stuff
was the stuff that was like really old,

232
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,650
expensive. That's really
smoky stuff. The I like Pete,

233
00:13:55,651 --> 00:14:00,120
which is Irish whisky. Tastes like Pete.
They boiled over peat bog. There's a,

234
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:02,280
the only time I've ever had
really good whiskey is a,

235
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:05,710
there was a guy named Josh Lieb. He was
one of the writers on Newsradio. Right.

236
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,430
A very funny guy. Very nice
guy. And uh, he was, uh,

237
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
just a really interesting character and
he was into like really old whiskey and

238
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,880
I, and I, I was like, how much
does that cost? And he was like,

239
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:20,490
it was like something saying like a
hundred dollars a glass or something like

240
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:23,850
that. But really I'm like, what
the fuck does it tastes like?

241
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:25,710
And he let me try some of
it. Cause it was like, wow,

242
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,610
that is a kind of a strange thing
to have created. It's a very,

243
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:33,600
a very distinct sort of taste. But I
wouldn't say it's good. Right? Yeah. No,

244
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,640
none of it's good. No, just cheap
whiskeys. Yes. The feeling of it is good.

245
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,900
Yeah. So, uh, where are you
coming back from, man? What's
the latest world travels?

246
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,730
Well, we'd been shooting
a lot, so we shot, um,

247
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,230
January and February and Afghanistan.
Whoa.

248
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,190
Which was seriously heavy

249
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,190
because we did a story on child suicide
bombers and so we got incredible access

250
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,580
to kids who actually were caught, uh,
before they could ignite their vests.

251
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,300
And then we met the senior Taliban guy
and in Qubole who is supposedly supposed

252
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,201
to be in Pakistan,

253
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,990
but we actually interviewed them and
Qubole and everyone's freaking out about

254
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:19,850
that because they didn't know he was
in Kabul. You sat down with this guy?

255
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,730
Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. What was that like?

256
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,640
It w he is a,
you know,

257
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,590
they don't have a good outfit
for sort of looking benevolent.

258
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,570
Like they look like he
looked like the devil.

259
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,990
He looked really bad and evil and uh,

260
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,420
I asked him about a child too.

261
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:42,290
So I bombing because they're using younger
and younger kids now because they get

262
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,520
past the checkpoint and uh,
he said, yeah, you know, he,

263
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,470
they actually admitted on air that
they were using children as suicide.

264
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,990
That's as transportation
devices for dynamite.

265
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,020
Wow. You mean that's, that's
the best way to describe it.

266
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,850
Transportation devices for dynamite name.
They've essentially said,

267
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,690
you know, not only were willing to
kill our own, we'll kill innocent.

268
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,670
Can we kill children to further
our agenda? That's scary shit.

269
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,600
That's fucking scary shit, man.
What's it like talking to that guy?

270
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,430
Um, well, you know, so he had,

271
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,460
he was arrested for kidnapping,
um,

272
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,450
westerners and UN people,
um,

273
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,660
and he had been in prison and then
somehow gotten out pat in Pakistan.

274
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,110
So the Pakistan, he said I'm out. And
then he had snuck back into Qubole.

275
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:40,680
So you're meeting a guy who's been
arrested many times for kidnapping and

276
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:43,890
Westerners for political means.
So that's weird too,

277
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,950
is you go out and he's surrounded
by his talent soldiers.

278
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,320
So he's got like 20 or 30 guys in
their courtyard, all sort of, you know,

279
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,040
checking you out and then if you say
anything wrong or do anything wrong,

280
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,910
then you, you know, they'll
just, they'll just take you away.

281
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:04,130
They don't give a shit. Right. So it
was a bit nerve wracking and he was,

282
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,760
he's a seriously bad dude.
I mean,

283
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:09,600
he was a commander and then we've had
Janine and then he became Taliban and then

284
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,820
was one of the senior commanders
when they were in control of,

285
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,000
of all of Afghanistan and then had
to flee to Pakistan, announced back.

286
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,860
Do they know who lend them out
and why? Well, the Pakistani

287
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,700
government has been sponsoring Taliban

288
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,620
almost,
isn't it incredible?

289
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,670
Then like they can get people into jail
over there and then they can just sort

290
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:37,210
of let them out. Really bad guys. And
people have tried so hard to capture

291
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,610
it.
Just they're resisting this whole idea.

292
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,910
Well it's also 100% corrupt.
I mean,

293
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,970
you can buy your way out of jail and
Pakistan buy your way out of jail in

294
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:52,410
Afghanistan. But if you're on the
right side of the Isi and Pakistan,

295
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,810
which the Taliban are, then you can
do whatever you want. Or the ISI.

296
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,330
We're the ones protecting been loud.

297
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,090
So what is, how does something like this,
I mean, whatever you can say about it,

298
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,710
how does something like this get arranged?

299
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,483
Well,

300
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,550
in Afghanistan we're lucky because it
was a guy named Sam Michelle who runs a

301
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,660
total news, which is the
sort of main news, you know,

302
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,140
pro western say news in,
in Afghanistan. And so he,

303
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,510
um, you know, had a lot of,

304
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,750
he ha he can get you sort of
see anybody in Afghanistan.

305
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,260
And so he got us in to talk to
the suicide bombers, the kids,

306
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,450
and he got us in to talk to
the secret police about that.

307
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:36,860
And he got us in to talk
to, um, the Taliban. Wow.

308
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,670
So you set up this meeting with this
guy and how long has the entire meeting?

309
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,050
Maybe an hour. So how long have
you were in his, in his presence,

310
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,520
the whole time you were in his presence
or just straight in and start get up?

311
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,890
How do you, how do you get out
of that kind of conversation?

312
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:57,110
That seems like a conversation that
should take a hundred years. Huh? A CG.

313
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,410
Do you have to tip toe when
you're discussing things?
Do you biting your tongue?

314
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,310
I had to ask him a lot of unpleasant
questions. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

315
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,510
Like how did you do that?

316
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,270
Well, you know, for example, I'd say, um,

317
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,450
you know, you were [inaudible] in general,
you know what it's like to lead troops,

318
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,400
you know, these people train to
fight. How do you feel about sending,

319
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,030
you know, six year olds, you know, to, to
be transportation devices for football?

320
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,890
And, uh, so you couch it in such
a way that like, you're a general,

321
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,500
because generally a lot of the
Taliban fighters themselves, you know,

322
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,190
don't, don't condone the suicide
bombing. But he did. He said, well,

323
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,240
he wouldn't answer it.
He said,

324
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,580
there's a past June saying there's a tiger
above me in a river below me. Like he,

325
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,730
like I'm screwed if I'd even scream
to her if I don't. So he wouldn't,

326
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,590
he wouldn't talk to us about it.
Wow.

327
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,660
How, how often are, they haven't
suicide bombs go off over there

328
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,990
about 200 times a year.

329
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,860
So nearly every day there's a suicide
bomb and they're getting more and more

330
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:09,440
effective. And uh,
it's, they just had the,

331
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,130
the, the first civilian
suicide bombs. So, you know,

332
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,280
and not, not military targets.
And it was a complete, does that,

333
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,240
they actually did a,
they had seven suicide bombers.

334
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,160
Not a lot of people maybe
know this in America,

335
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:27,480
but there was an empty building across
the way from the American embassy and

336
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:32,481
they have these seven suicide attackers
actually dressed in burqas with their

337
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:35,130
weapons under the workers
take over the building.

338
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,170
And they held the American embassy hostage
with like a full on fire fight in the

339
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:44,260
middle of Kabul for over 24 hours before
they could kill these seven dudes.

340
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,510
It was crazy. We have footage of it
all and it's totally fucking insane.

341
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,960
Holy Shit. Yeah. But the,

342
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,150
the what the Taliban guy says
and which is pretty interesting,

343
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:02,500
is that they used suicide attackers and
suicide bombers because that's what's

344
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,200
going to get America out. And
you go, well, you know, fuck you.

345
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:10,201
But in reality that's true because what
happened is America went into get al

346
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,430
Qaeda and the Taliban out of Afghanistan
and now our government is negotiating

347
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:19,030
with the Taliban to see exactly how
much power they'll have when we leave.

348
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,520
So you're like, okay, well Jesus Christ,

349
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,350
what a cluster fuck. Yeah. This,

350
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,520
none of this is being reported
in the mainstream news.

351
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,010
It's not being certainly not
being talked about like that.

352
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:37,110
You see Karzai's sits down with
Obama and they all seem to be, uh,

353
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,050
playing nice, nice with
each other. You know,

354
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,000
this is all what's going on behind
the scenes. Just, yeah. I mean,

355
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,730
it's been reported.
It's been constant suicide bombing.

356
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,390
It's been reported that they've
started to negotiate with the Taliban.

357
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,770
And I was surprised that there hasn't
been sort of more outrage because people,

358
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,480
I guess are so sick of the war, they're
just like, well, fine. You know,

359
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,630
they're negotiating with them.

360
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:03,540
But so whole reason negotiating
the United States is, and, and the,

361
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,930
uh,
NATO and what do they then negotiating

362
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,950
power when the Americans leave,
how much power they'll have,

363
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:15,490
how they're going to share power,
et Cetera, et cetera. Wow. Yeah.

364
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,830
Um, isn't that what the whole purpose of
this was trying to stop those guys? Yes.

365
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,780
And then they're negotiating with them
about how much power there yet. Yes.

366
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,490
So what does that mean?
That means we lost the war.

367
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,100
Americans ever gonna say we lost a war.
We were like, we were like that dude.

368
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:33,130
You could beat a dick in the dirt for
a hundred years. And we were like,

369
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,620
that wasn't even a war. It was a
conflict. It was a police action.

370
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,170
We will never admit that. We need, we
don't even have a bit, we lost Vietnam.

371
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,830
We pulled out of Vietnam. It's like
whatever got tired of kicking your ass.

372
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,350
This is a weird country, man. Yo Africana.

373
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,620
They for sure 100% loss.
Afghanistan. I mean, what did you do?

374
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,530
You know what happened? You went
in to try and get the Taliban now,

375
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,940
now you're negotiating to give them
power back, 10 years, all that money,

376
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:04,600
all those lives. And for
what? What's the end result?

377
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,460
Because actually when
you're there you realize,

378
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,920
oh the minute the Americans leave,
there'll be a civil war.

379
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,780
So it's going to be back in the, in the
exact situation of a civil war with a,

380
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,060
with a, a massive Taliban presence in
Afghanistan. So 12 years down the drain,

381
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,920
my God,
what a mess,

382
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,730
how horrible must it feel to the families
and people lost children over there.

383
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,240
And then you just realize this
whole thing was a cluster fuck.

384
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,570
The thing that gets me is just how does
anybody look at Vietnam and not learn?

385
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,690
How do we not learn?
It's like this is the same shit.

386
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,490
It's exact same shit.

387
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,330
We get manipulated into these
wars by my special interests.

388
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,280
And this is exactly what it is folks.
And you've been tricked

389
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,910
into thinking that this was some
fucking some justice mission.

390
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
You know,
it's madness.

391
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,440
What do you think they're over there for?
What's the,

392
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,190
what's the number one resource they're
trying to grab over there? Who?

393
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,940
The United States? Well, I
think they got into a war.

394
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,170
I shouldn't say the United States.

395
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,650
What I should say is the corporations
that are trying to, I think,

396
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,430
I think that a profit from it.
Look,

397
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,490
I think they had to go in because they
couldn't just go into a rock or rock was

398
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:20,330
about oil. Um, they couldn't just go
into a rocket. They had to say, well,

399
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:24,170
we'll have to go get the guys who did
this for nine 11 and then they went in,

400
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,960
but they could have gone in with a
surgical team. Got The guys that got out.

401
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:29,720
I mean, they don't have to take
over the whole country. Right.

402
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,830
Why do you think that they, they had to
say, we're going to go into Iraq as well.

403
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,710
Excuse me, Afghanistan
as well. Like why? Well,

404
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:40,300
because Iraq was a complete construct.
They made it all up.

405
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:44,560
It was 100% of their like they try to
tie Iraq with nine 11 you're like, well,

406
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,550
I just had nothing to do with
it. A rag, 100% to do with
w with oil, with oil. Well,

407
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:52,070
because they had the
manufactured why we went there.

408
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:54,410
They the at nine 11 was like yes,

409
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,830
they already had plans to go in there
before but not in would say yes, you know,

410
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,070
we're going to go in
there after all kind of,

411
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,900
but they knew that they had to
actually go to the place where it was.

412
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,510
They had to do the true thing so
that they could get what they wanted,

413
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,390
which was a wreck.
Oh,

414
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,940
so you feel like Afghanistan was
almost like a secondary operation?

415
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,500
100% whoa.

416
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,670
And then it became the primary operation
because it was such a cluster fuck.

417
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,150
Well, what about all the resources
that they keep finding over there?

418
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,280
Like they just found trillions
of dollars in minerals.

419
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:26,030
Do you think that that plays a part in
the, uh, idea to, to occupy it as well?

420
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,080
Maybe.
I mean,

421
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:31,790
I think that now what's happening is
Chinese companies are coming in as they do

422
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,470
because they're sort of, um, not blame
free, but there are sort of like,

423
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,310
oh we haven't been conflicted by this
conflict so they can watch like they've

424
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:43,760
done in Africa, you know, wherever
America sort of, you know,

425
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,940
piss people off or done bad things
and trying to just comes in and says,

426
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,910
oh we'll trade with you.
That's gotta be a trip man.

427
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,890
Cause America goes and sees things and
you know, for, for better or for worse,

428
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,900
let's try to fix it.

429
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,920
Then there's problems and then they put
sanctions on people and trying to just

430
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:03,600
says, I don't give a shit what you
do. Wow, you can do whatever you want.

431
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,960
You could just give me your
Tridium or whatever it is.

432
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:10,820
Wild China just rocks at game of Thrones
style. They go old school empire ways.

433
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,090
We don't impose any,
we got our own fucking problems.

434
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,290
We've got a billion people living on one
patch of dirt. And exactly. Wow. Yeah,

435
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,440
they'll always going to beat it.
A Americans with that attitude.

436
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,470
As far as business goes and
getting into creepy places,

437
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,930
they'll just sneak right in.

438
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,340
So there in Afghanistan you think
trying to get these minerals? Yeah,

439
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,590
well for sure.
And Chinese companies are in there.

440
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,120
I mean there's a lot
of companies in there,

441
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:40,121
but the problem is going to be stability
because the minute the Americans pull

442
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,950
out, it's going to be full on
civil war. So you can't really

443
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,080
go and get minerals on
people shooting rockets.

444
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,400
Now knowing what a cluster fuck it is,
knowing how crazy it is.

445
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:53,630
Was it like being over there? You
as a person, as an and outsider,

446
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,370
Canadian in facts out there watching
this fucking chaos and filming it.

447
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,780
Wait,
what was that like for you?

448
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,583
You know,
I,

449
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,050
I got on the plane to come home and I was
on my motherfucking drink now I was on

450
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:10,770
my iPod or the iPad and you know, it
was does, there was a plane, you know,

451
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:13,860
it was like soaring through the air and
you can see space and all this stuff.

452
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,560
And because when you're in Afghanistan,

453
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,760
it sort of feels like 5,000 years ago
because everything is sort of, you know,

454
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,000
these sort of mud huts and
it's sun baked and it does,

455
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,620
it looks like it has a lot
of, it looks like it hasn't
changed, uh, in 5,000 years.

456
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,030
So you, you're really sort of,
wow, this is maternity, you know,

457
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:34,140
this is the modern age,

458
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:38,310
this is the 21st century because we
have all these crazy things that you can

459
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:41,580
sort of tweet from Afghanistan
or whatever technology.

460
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,920
But then at the same time you have this,
you sort of devolution,

461
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,600
you know, where we're sending
kids to to blow our shit up,

462
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,740
you know, because it, it's
effective, you know? And so I was,

463
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,690
there's been a lot of what I've seen this
past year, this past year of shooting,

464
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,940
which is, it feels like half of humanity
is just going completely backwards,

465
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,663
you know,

466
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,010
now seeing that and then flying
back into New York City. What, what,

467
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,830
what the fuck does that contrast feel
like? Do you take these mad trips?

468
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,790
And I wanted to come home.

469
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:22,770
And you see what's possible at the apex
of civilization right now as far as like,

470
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:23,341
you know,

471
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:26,880
cities and in a place where he can go
safely and the place that doesn't have,

472
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,610
you know, guns and bombs blowing up
constantly. I mean, no wonder why they,

473
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,660
that's where the terrorist
attacks occurred.

474
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,630
Now wonder why that's where the
September 11th attacks occurred. Right,

475
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,970
for sure. I mean, it was, you know,
incredibly successful. You know,

476
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,630
when you fly in, you still see
that the twin towers out there.

477
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:47,900
And actually we started our peace with
that because we say actually the most

478
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:52,901
successful suicide bombing of all time
was nine 11 suicide attack because it

479
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:58,760
started the Iran Iraq war.
It started Afghanistan.

480
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,860
Um, you know, both of which are
still going on and you know,

481
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,820
completely polarized the world. And
it actually, suicide attacks were,

482
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,100
and when we did the research, it was a
few months ago, and I've had a few ales,

483
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:16,770
I don't quote me on the exact percentages,
but the percentages are insane.

484
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,480
It was like suicide attacks where three
to 5% of all terrorism before nine 11

485
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,660
and now they're like 97% of all Jesus
Christ because it's so successful.

486
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,690
What,
what is it like as a sane,

487
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:36,070
rational person traveling around to
the most fucked up places on earth and

488
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:39,940
seeing humanity at its worst? Wait,
what the fuck does that feel like?

489
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,970
That's a hard question.

490
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,650
You're such a nice guy.
You're such a jovial guy.

491
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,720
Every time I see you're smiling and
hugging people, you seem like such a,

492
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:55,721
a warm and friendly person for you to
get thrust constantly into these horrific

493
00:29:56,191 --> 00:30:00,120
situations where you get to see people
just handed the shitty it's fucking hand

494
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:03,240
of cards and the history of life.
Like here you are,

495
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,250
2012 the Internet's here. The fucking,
you know, the age of information is here,

496
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:12,090
but you're involved in some sort of
crazy religious war and people blowing

497
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:15,140
themselves up when they're six.
You were in the worst spot.

498
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,790
Yeah. Well, I mean you,

499
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,970
the reason why I'm happy is because
you're thankful for what you have.

500
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,290
When you see what uh, you know,
everybody else doesn't have,

501
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,180
well you happy before you did all this,
you, I'm a pretty happy guy. Yeah.

502
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,310
So it just enhanced your happiness
to see how fortunate you are and your

503
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,910
circumstances. Yeah. Fuck man, that's a,

504
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:41,911
that's a serious trip to be spending a
large percentage of your time on this

505
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:45,130
earth. Yeah. Seeing
the, the terrible spots.

506
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,120
Most evil like trying to fly into Hawaii
for the weekend and chill and you're,

507
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,640
you know what I mean?
You're spending your, your,

508
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,580
your job is to go to some of
the scariest parts on earth.

509
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,810
Yeah. Um, yeah.

510
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,720
It doesn't seem that freaky
at the time cause you just,

511
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:05,210
you want to get the story and like, yes,
we got into, you know, Somalia, you know,

512
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,320
we're going to hang out with
the pirates. They're like, yes,

513
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:08,640
we've been working on that for a while.

514
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,880
Did you guys go to the Somalia and
hanging out with the pirates? Oh my God.

515
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,390
And then you, but then you get in
there, you get in there and you're like,

516
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,290
you're nervous and you know, fucking,
you didn't think they would kidnap you.

517
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,480
Well we paid them to kidnap US cause
it's a, you pay the kidnapping fee.

518
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,010
So the kidnapping 15 grants.

519
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:29,640
So you pay them what they
would charge for a kidnapping,

520
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,630
but not to kidnap you. Well, yeah, which
is fine. I mean it's like the same. Well,

521
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:38,990
you know, grants seems pretty
reasonable, but that's all it is. Yeah.

522
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,790
But isn't it more for other people? If
they catch like some billion, we did it.

523
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,070
We did a bunch of shooting. We
shot a lot in Kenya with, uh,

524
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,170
with the, uh, sort of, you know,

525
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,390
refugees and we show it around Puntland
and now we're shooting in Mogadishu to

526
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:58,000
round it up. But, uh, it depends on the,
on the, I want to say it, but anyway,

527
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,240
so when you're there all you're
thinking about us, you know,

528
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,310
we've got to get the shot or we got
to get this and we've got to get that.

529
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,180
And it's only when you come back and
you're sort of having dinner somewhere in

530
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:09,150
there. Like, where were you? Oh, I
was with the pirates in Mogadishu,

531
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,580
US waste.

532
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,970
But you don't really think about it so
much at the time when a lot of people are

533
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,490
horrified about the Somali
pirates and they're like,

534
00:32:17,491 --> 00:32:18,660
this is a terrible situation.

535
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:22,530
But what they don't understand is that
those people really got fucked into that

536
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:24,810
situation where they had almost no choice.

537
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,170
The Somali pirates started out
when these Somalia soldiers would,

538
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,750
uh,

539
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,750
go after people who were dumping
toxic waste off their shores.

540
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,910
It was killing all their fish and
poisoning their people. And these are,

541
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,780
there were a fisherman's culture.
I mean,

542
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,860
could you imagine you're a culture
of fishermen and the, you know,

543
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:49,820
they don't have a history of going
after people and kidnapping people.

544
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,330
They're just trying to fucking make a
living and all of a sudden some assholes

545
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,710
are, you know, driving around their boats,
floating around a couple of miles out,

546
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:02,480
just dumping horrible shit into their
ocean and it's fucking up the whole ocean

547
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,410
and they get to see it right
before their eyes. They're the,

548
00:33:05,411 --> 00:33:07,580
the mother earth becoming,
you know,

549
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,750
poisoned the fish poisoning and
people getting poisoned and sick.

550
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,460
So they started kidnapping them.

551
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,580
They started kidnapping those people and
demanding ransom from these companies

552
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,010
that had poisoned their water. And then
they started saying, you know what?

553
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:22,100
Fuck it. Let's just kidnap anybody
drives by. That's what we do now.

554
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,430
And that's when it became those asshole
corporations that were dumping their

555
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:28,700
shit off the Somalia coast.
They made monsters. You know,

556
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,520
those people should be fucking
held responsible for a cleanup.

557
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,760
Just as much as they should be
responsible for a toxic cleanup.

558
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,400
They should be responsible for
cultural cleanup. You know,

559
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:40,070
if they could actually find out who
dumped all that shit and all the different

560
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:42,680
corporations involved,
it's probably a whole lot of them.

561
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,600
They could probably get a
fuck load of money out of it.

562
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,870
If the world had any code,
sort of a real court, you know.

563
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,720
Well, the problem is is a lot
of it was radioactive waste.

564
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,050
So it irradiated to see
in a radiated the beaches.

565
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,130
And before that the Chinese,
Japanese,

566
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:03,360
Portuguese and Spanish fishing companies
completely over fished it and then the

567
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,160
radiated it.
So they were totally fine.

568
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,400
It's actually a great movie
called the fishing without nets,

569
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,230
which is about that, about like they were
all fishermen and now there's no fish.

570
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:18,220
So they just take the same boat out and
then they, then they go, wow, we're,

571
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,130
we're working on a story in
there right now about, um,

572
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,180
the American government is financing,
sort of Islam is to extremists, you know,

573
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,860
to fight a Al Shabaab,
uh, who are, you know,

574
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,850
the bad boys over there.
And, uh, and so we're,

575
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,260
we're trying to figure out if that's true.

576
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,220
So the stories that American
government is funding,

577
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,510
funding Muslim extremists who are going
to fight these bad guys set up exactly

578
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:45,050
the same as what happened
in Afghanistan and Sophia.

579
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,600
And then they became the
talent. Jesus Christ. Yeah.

580
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,140
We just don't ever learn how,

581
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,860
but how does one fix this
mess that we're in? How does,

582
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,360
how does one put the world on its back,
you know,

583
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:03,420
straight on its axle or art in taxes?
Or does that ever happen? Does it,

584
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:07,680
it's just the way people roll.
We just fucking constantly involved in,

585
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,130
in chaos and love at the same time,

586
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:11,891
you know,

587
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:16,540
a lot of people meddle in other people's
stuff and then we would have to go in

588
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,370
and we have to save them and you're like,
you know,

589
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,700
we have to save them from whom
themselves, you know, like, oh, you know,

590
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,610
so Diane was such a bad guy
as opposed to who, you know,

591
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,340
just like drove Dale hurt. Like, you know,

592
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,000
so there's a lot of
geopolitics and you know,

593
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:35,920
sort of Geo political
gamesmanship has been,

594
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,960
you know, the, the, the cause
of a lot of these problems.

595
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:44,760
But now it's 99% always economics.
It's so if you look at, you know,

596
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:48,960
we have resource based wealth or you
know there's one in one in every three

597
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:53,190
countries and with resource based
wealth has a civil war every four years.

598
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:56,340
Whereas you know, the, the
remaining countries, you know,

599
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,640
don't have any civil wars or haven't had
a civil war for a hundred years. So the,

600
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:04,110
the, the, the percentages are insane. So
now like Afghanistan you were just saying,

601
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:07,650
but a lot of the African countries
now they're like, oh, you know,

602
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:12,130
rare earth metals that didn't used to
be worth money or no, and you know,

603
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,770
every cell phone so that,
you know,

604
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,450
the war in the Congo is now the 10th
bloodiest war in history and it's all

605
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:21,480
because of coal town, which is
needed to make our iPads and iPhones.

606
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,870
It's so ironic then at
the height of technology,

607
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,260
the iPad three front facing camera,
HD screen,

608
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,150
if you follow that all the way down,

609
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:35,350
there's an old African boy that's
picking out this mineral out of,

610
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,550
out of a hole in the earth. It's
really, that's that spectrum.

611
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,460
It's quite fascinating.
I mean, it's almost from,

612
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,390
I mean that spectrum goes back to just
the invention of tools and you know,

613
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:50,830
figuring out iron and shit and fake point
pulling stuff out of the earth all the

614
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:55,060
way to the height of technology. Where
are weird man, we are fucking strange.

615
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,650
Human beings are so bizarre.

616
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,180
How much do you look at life?
I mean your,

617
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:05,020
your experiences are far more extreme
than mine and most people on this planet,

618
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:08,590
I think. How, how do you, do
you look at this sometimes,

619
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,530
like it's a big work of fiction.
Do you look at life sometimes?

620
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:15,940
Like this is just fucking so nutty. It
doesn't seem like he can be real. I mean,

621
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:18,340
if anybody has seen
the nuttiest you might,

622
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,480
you might have witnessed some of the
nuttiest shit on earth and come back to

623
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:25,510
talk about, I mean you've,
you've got in one life,

624
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,400
think of all the fucking
places you've been.

625
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,810
Hmm.
Does it feel real?

626
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,070
But we always say,
they say about vice and what's the,

627
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,370
what's the political sort of stance
of I, so I said, we don't have one.

628
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:40,470
It's the modern condition is
absurd. There's the, you know,

629
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,450
the absurdity of fucking this mudder.
It's crazy. Like it's fucking nuts.

630
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,890
And then when you go out and
see exactly how nuts it is,

631
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,620
it keeps getting crazier
and crazier and crazier.

632
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:54,770
So these get bigger stories
are more insane. You know,

633
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:58,220
we were just shooting in Karachi,
which is a completely failed city.

634
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,580
They have a hundred plus
kill killings a night.

635
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,330
You can hire a killer there
to kill someone for 10 bucks.

636
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,610
Actually we rode around with one
of these contract killers and uh,

637
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,200
it was, it's just shocking.
The contract killer. Yeah.

638
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,360
What the fuck is that? Like? Well,

639
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,990
Saroo salary and my partner did that story
because I wouldn't have asked as long

640
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:24,740
and doing that story in the garage.
He, uh, why wouldn't you Lawson?

641
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,380
Well,

642
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,380
I'm karate is run by gangs by like Haqqani
network who are Taliban related sort

643
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:38,830
of mafia gang family. And then
they have, you know, various, uh,

644
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,950
Baluchistan gangs and then
they have, you know, uh, the,

645
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,590
the heroin trafficking gangs and they're
all fighting each other continually.

646
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,880
It's insanely violent and you know,
and basically you can't,

647
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,040
if you're Caucasian, you
can't sort of, no, there's no
tourists there, for example,

648
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,610
which there's no reason for you to be
there. It's just complete wild west show.

649
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,690
It's so hard for people
in Pasedena to believe

650
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,860
driving around in Pasadena that this
coexist on the earth at the same

651
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:11,410
departments. The after
picture. It's like, yeah,

652
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,930
escape from New York, isn't it? I mean,

653
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,790
Karachi is bigger than New York and
it's just where we're part of the world.

654
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:22,590
Is it against Pakistan? But it's on the,
on the, on the ocean and it's, it's uh,

655
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,880
it's, it's, it's a huge city and
it's just complete fucking anarchy.

656
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,020
Complete fucking,

657
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,740
Whoa, whoa. It's a war. It's a war zone.

658
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,920
How many millions of people live
in this area? My 18 to 20 million,

659
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,560
but all just going crazy. 18 the 20
million people live in wild west.

660
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,210
How do we not know about this? How do we
not know about this? That's incredible.

661
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,230
People know that crotch is bad, but
not like, like you described it,

662
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:50,520
you described it like a movie.

663
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,120
Steven Spielberg decided to make a
movie about that and told you that that

664
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,870
city's going down right now on earth.
You'd be like itch.

665
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,690
It is nothing I had know about that.
It isn't movie. I mean you don't,

666
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,520
you think that that's something
that would be like really,

667
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:07,020
really popular if no one
ever talks about that.

668
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,740
If they made a movie right now about
that part of the world described the way

669
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,590
you describe it,
like a,

670
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,170
like some crazy horror movie
about civilization gone wrong.

671
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,250
That's what it is. A Mad Max reality
that's existing coexisting right now.

672
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,060
Just as big as New York.
We'd go get no way.

673
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,730
You know what I mean?
We'd go no way.

674
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,480
Yeah. Yeah. Karachi is complete chaos.

675
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,400
It's scary as hell. Scaries Pakistanis
are like, well, no one goes there.

676
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,440
Well you go there. No one goes there,
but 20 million people live there.

677
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,800
That's crazy. Just shit burning
in the streets. People pop up up,

678
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:44,670
people getting killed.

679
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,050
It was like running gun
battles of the streets.

680
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,210
So you, you couldn't go. So you said, uh,

681
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,780
what is it you're your correspondent
look like? Sort of, she's Pakistani,

682
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,930
she's pack. It's he, he,
oh, he is Pakistani. He's

683
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,260
also snuck into the gun markets,
a Taliban gun markets.

684
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:07,370
When the Americans said that the war was
over and the Taliban were coming across

685
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,240
into the Northwest Frontier province
and getting a thousand handmade guns,

686
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,320
they make their own guns by hand.

687
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,350
That was like little kids
make the guns and a thousand.

688
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,020
We're going over every day. And
we're like, well, if the war's over,

689
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,770
why is there are a thousand girls
across the border every day.

690
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:26,210
And so when we broke that
story, that was solution, he uh,

691
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,570
he just went back to Pakistan and his
story of Karachi is fucking insane.

692
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,250
He's got unique access, but you know, does
he have, does he have footage? Oh yeah.

693
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,700
Yeah. When can we see this video? Uh,

694
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,920
I think that's going to go up
within the next month. I buy stuff.

695
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,980
You got to let me know that he has a video
of him with like grinding around with

696
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,280
this contract color obviously,

697
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,720
but he's just sort of going from thing
to thing with his gun and they were these

698
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,960
moped helmets. And then so you can't
see who they are and, and, uh, it's,

699
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:00,230
you know, that's an insane thing to
do for 10 bucks. There's, there's, uh,

700
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,550
there's a increase or maybe it's just an
increase of awareness for our awareness,

701
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:09,551
but there's an increase in sort of
assassination availability and sort of

702
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,780
there's been a price decrease or whatever,
you know, because now we go and we see,

703
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:18,020
like in Karachi,
they have contract killers everywhere.

704
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,670
We were shooting a lot recently. And,
um, whereas in, in northern Mexico,

705
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,830
and, um, they're, uh, they have,

706
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,900
um,
scenarios that get paid 200 bucks a month.

707
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,090
And their job is just to kill people.

708
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,080
Like there were just the
fucking muscle that's there,
the assassins, you know, and,

709
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,270
um,
when we were there,

710
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,590
Juarez is actually the most dangerous
town in the world for journalists.

711
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,450
It's the same as, so there's El
Paso on the Texas side, same city,

712
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,270
and it's one of the
safest cities in America.

713
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,330
And then you go right across the border
and it's one of the most dangerous

714
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:56,931
cities in the world,

715
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:00,110
but it's the most dangerous city in
the world for journalists. Number one.

716
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,783
Why is that?

717
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,900
Because it's the drug cartels that run
it and there are smugglers and so they

718
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:07,730
don't want anyone to
ever filmed their shit.

719
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:10,970
So instead of like coming up to you when
you have your camera and saying, hey,

720
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:12,560
why are you carrying that camera?
What are you shooting?

721
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,430
They just see a camera and go bang,
no point in asking you a question.

722
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,360
And they make a lot of,
if you write about something,

723
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:23,690
they make a and they cut off your head
and they write the story on your flesh

724
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,720
with blood and all this
stuff. And so, you know,

725
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,780
journalists just don't go there anymore.
Wow.

726
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,870
That is kind of crazy that we're right
next to a third world country involved in

727
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,910
like the biggest drug war
in the history of the world.

728
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,450
Most Americans are blissfully
unaware. Well, we shot the,

729
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,830
we shot a big piece on that.
And um, of course you did.

730
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,190
How'd you get the deed get embedded?
Well,

731
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,290
we got embedded with
people who are fighting.

732
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,620
This is a pretty freaky story though.
I don't know how much of it allow it.

733
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,520
I'm allowed to say. Oh
really? But, uh, well

734
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,410
I can say a lot more. Uh, but, uh,

735
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,050
but it's a very complex
story and we're going to,

736
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:07,800
we're going to cause some waves, but,
uh, basically we were down in, in, in,

737
00:44:07,801 --> 00:44:12,650
in Mexico. Um, we'd done some, some stuff
with the cartels. Incredibly difficult,

738
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:17,651
most difficult stories to get right now
today are cartel story cause they just

739
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,100
kill everybody.
Um,

740
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,560
but we started hanging out with the
people who were fighting the cartels,

741
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,200
who are Mormon colonies
that's originated in America,

742
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,300
so they could keep practicing polygamy.

743
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,230
Went to a northern Mexico
and they formed polygamist,

744
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,560
um, um, Mormon colonies there.

745
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,410
And because of the colonies did well,

746
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,770
the cartels started targeting them and
started kidnapping them and killing them.

747
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:58,370
And so the Mormon colonies started arming
themselves and fighting against the,

748
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,730
the cartels. She's, so there's been a
war between the Mormon colonies and the,

749
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:10,530
and the, um, and the, and the narcos.

750
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,830
And we went down there to live in the
colonies and we were hanging out with the

751
00:45:15,831 --> 00:45:19,290
Lebaron who, I don't know if you've ever
heard of, but they have a crazy story of,

752
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,993
they had a,

753
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,070
one of their brethren believed that
he had the power of blood atonement.

754
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,120
So he was killing all the people in the
church that we're trying to, you know,

755
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,470
mess with them. So he had about
30 or maybe at 50 children,

756
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,480
nearly years,
nearly 50 children.

757
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,750
And he had them work as
assassins for him in this,

758
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,810
in this bloody war that they had
down there. This is all happening,

759
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:46,200
not in the 1880s this isn't happening
in the 1980s this is happening in like

760
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,980
Blues Brothers Eighties Oh my God.
And so they have this crazy war,

761
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:52,950
but they arm themselves, right, because
they're all fighting it within the family.

762
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,760
And then because of that,
when the narcos attack them,

763
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,610
they were sort of armed and
ready to go and bad acid.

764
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,570
So they started fighting them.

765
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,580
But they're actually just one colony
over from the other people that they came

766
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:07,050
down with who are the Romney's.

767
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,040
So Mitt Romney's father was born
in one of these colonies of land,

768
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,200
and then they, they, now, this
is the father was born in Mexico.

769
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,290
Mitt Romney's father was born in a
polygamous colony and northern Mexico

770
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,900
Chihuahua.
She's lonely and colonials and blend.

771
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,620
And actually he ran
for president and they,

772
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,810
they said, uh, they, they, they brought
up the fact that he might've been illegal,

773
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,680
illegal immigrant and that,
uh, and that, you know, he,

774
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,600
he gave us more than a polygamous
calling me and site is his presidency.

775
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,390
Uh,
presidential candidacy didn't last long,

776
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,360
at least say that the piece, but like,
but his sons, his son, well, because book,

777
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:58,230
you know, but he's, he actually,
we say out of all the candidates,

778
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,980
Republican candidates, Mitt Romney
had the staunchest, you know, uh,

779
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,520
stand against immigration and, and
you know, it, it's, you know, and he,

780
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,650
he sort of ignores his roots and he
never talks about it. And you say, well,

781
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,490
I understand why it's completely
logical because you know, he, he, he,

782
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:17,670
he wanted to veto the dream act and he
said he'd publicly to veto the dream act,

783
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:20,660
although his father as the poster child
for the Dream Act. But you say he,

784
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,591
you know, he, he,

785
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:24,390
he would veto the dream act because he
wants to get away from these stories

786
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:27,120
because of the stories.
When you dig into them are fucking insane.

787
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,130
Of course he doesn't want to talk about,
because polygamy,

788
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,830
uh, not battles with drug
lords, you know, and,

789
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,700
and you know,

790
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,270
completing and kidnapping and insanity do
not a good presidential candidate make,

791
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,630
how was this not mainstream?
How was this,

792
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,700
is it going to come out during
the presidential campaign here?

793
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,340
That's going to come up? We get, we
have great footage. Mitt Romney's,

794
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,850
either the official nominee yet on the
republican side. I mean the, obviously

795
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:58,780
he will be, he will be, but he's
not official, right? Yeah. But yeah,

796
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:03,760
for sure it's going to come out. I
mean, the thing is, is, is you know it

797
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,420
all right?
I don't know why you can't knock them out,

798
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,240
but when people have written a little
bit about it, not very much about it.

799
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:15,080
When you see a guy is that flawed and
it has such an obvious story that that's

800
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:19,950
so beyond fucked. Hmm. Does it make
you feel like this has all been set up?

801
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,100
Does it make you feel like they put him
in there because they knew he couldn't

802
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:26,490
win?
Uh,

803
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,580
it doesn't make sense to me that that's
the best that the Republicans can do.

804
00:48:29,581 --> 00:48:32,850
I've met a lot of smart Republicans.
I met a lot of bad motherfuckers.

805
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:36,060
You would just conservative and right
wing and maybe they're a little too by

806
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:39,550
Billy. Right? But you know, I've
met some pretty strong minded,

807
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,750
very articulate republicans.
How come they never get there?

808
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,710
How come we're dealing with these,
these like second rate hacks,

809
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,800
these guys who just fucking changed
their opinion when the wind blows.

810
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:53,070
Like how does a guy like that get to a
position to be running for president?

811
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:57,150
Because that seems like that's a
weak example of what a politician,

812
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:59,200
a leader can be.
We've seen the JFK is,

813
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:01,080
we've seen the bill
cleanse who've seen the,

814
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:03,210
the people that have the strong voices.

815
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,850
When you have a guy who was a wishy washy,
has Mitt Romney,

816
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:09,390
who's comes from a fucking religious cult
that it was in northern Mexico. I mean,

817
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,790
I'm like,
really that's the best you can do.

818
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:15,420
A multi multimillionaire who his
father was from another country,

819
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:17,130
but as against immigration.
But

820
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,680
I mean, look, the rumor is
that they knew that they,

821
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,010
the economy's going to go keep,
keep going down and you know,

822
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,790
drops aren't going to get
better, et Cetera, et cetera.
So they said, okay, you know,

823
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,940
we'll just put up and
also Ryan and you know,

824
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,950
then we'll get to the next two terms
after that because the economy is going to

825
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:38,170
be shit. Anyway, put Jeb Bush on tap.

826
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,240
There you go for 2016 but I mean,
Mitt Romney, you know, the, it's,

827
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:46,660
it's, it's funny because they
want the Anti Obama, you know,

828
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,070
so they just want to sort of,

829
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,060
they don't understand.
Uh,

830
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,540
Obama was the first example I've ever
seen in my life of it where it's pretty

831
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:58,440
clear it doesn't matter anymore.
Whatever it takes to get into office is,

832
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,180
you mean once, once the, the
politician gets there, that's
all out the window. All,

833
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:06,060
all it is about there is keeping
everything moving the exact same way.

834
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:06,850
It's moving right now,

835
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,110
making sure these corporations
make fucking billions of dollars,

836
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,760
making sure that the rights
of the civilians get shrunk
more and more every day

837
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,950
until it gets to this global scenario
that we have where the whole world is

838
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:22,830
controlled by money and money
is the government and that's,

839
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:26,880
that's it seems to be where we're
moving towards an actual real,

840
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,830
especially this idea of America,
what it was supposed to be, you know,

841
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,160
a a government by the people.
We were going to set it up.

842
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:35,540
We were going to govern ourselves.

843
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:39,350
We're going to have a very strict set
of laws and checks and balances in place

844
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,230
to make sure this doesn't get out of
hand and become what it used to be.

845
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,610
It doesn't work that way.
How do we fix this Shane Smith?

846
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,880
How do we fix this?
You're the world traveling.

847
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:53,460
It's going to get worse because
actually money does rural everything.

848
00:50:53,461 --> 00:50:56,940
And I think that you'll probably always
has. But you know, if you look at,

849
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:02,160
you know, communism, the synthesis of
communism is that market regulates itself.

850
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:05,910
And you have a small thing
for infrastructure. Same
thing with capitalism. David,

851
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,820
Ricardo, Adam Smith, you know, the, the,

852
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,840
the free market sort of doesn't
need government. Um, but I,

853
00:51:12,841 --> 00:51:15,930
and I believe that both were up.
Apologies for what was happening.

854
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:17,160
And then industrial evolution,

855
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,410
because everyone was looking around
saying this is fact. You know,

856
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,740
there's nothing, there was, you know,
every kids working in coal mines,

857
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,310
all that shit. But the reason why
I say it's going to get worse,

858
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,070
and I'm not actually, I'm actually
an optimist. I'm a certain,

859
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:33,510
not a doom and gloom guy, but is that
money runs everything. But the problem is,

860
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:37,260
is the money's running out,
right? So you have kids, you know,

861
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:41,790
in Spain you have a under 27 years old,
50% unemployment.

862
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:46,080
So you have all these young kids and
there's nothing scarier than a young kid

863
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,880
with no future. You've just taken away
his future there. You know, 17, 18,

864
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:53,640
19 year old kid.
What the fuck does he have to lose?

865
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,170
And you've seen the riots in Athens,
you've seen the riots in London,

866
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:01,080
you've seen the riots in Paris, you've
seen the riots and I mean Tahrir Square,

867
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:03,990
you've seen, they're all over those human
rights in Montreal. This, there you go.

868
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,630
And young people are getting
more and more frustrated,

869
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,430
I should say protests in Montreal, they
didn't really write. The problem is that,

870
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,520
you know, well, look to have rights here.

871
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:18,360
Now they have occupied
Wall Street here and it's,

872
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,370
it's not going away. It's just, you know,

873
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:24,890
sort of getting more and more subversive
and you know, doing their own, uh,

874
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,530
content networks and everything now.
But you know,

875
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,450
when you have young kids
rioting with nothing to lose,

876
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,780
then you're going to look for
a radical economic solutions.

877
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:39,600
And radical economic solutions
mean radical political parties.

878
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:42,560
Radical political parties hate each other.
And it's the,

879
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,650
it's the same sort of scenario you
have that started world war two,

880
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,070
incredible depression. You
know, somebody comes up with a,

881
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,490
what seemingly is sort of
fixing the depression. Oh,
we're all going to do that.

882
00:52:53,491 --> 00:52:55,560
No,
we're going to do the antithesis of that.

883
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:59,900
So you have communists versus fascists, et
Cetera, et cetera. And both of, you know,

884
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,560
extreme sides of the spectrum. And
then there ended up warring, you know,

885
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:07,830
fighting. And what's
happening now is, you know,

886
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,240
Europe has just fucked and it's getting
going to get worse and worse and worse.

887
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,220
And there's going to be more
and more radical politics,

888
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:18,540
more and more kids in the streets.
And that's when I get worried and say,

889
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,680
hold on a second. What are we going
to do? Wait until there's, you know,

890
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:26,220
militias running down Berlin main street,

891
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,710
fighting other fucking police whatevers,
civil war, uh, until we step in and say,

892
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,180
Hey,
can we not fix this?

893
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:36,240
Because it's just getting fucking
worse and worse and worse. And sure.

894
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:39,270
You see bad shit in Afghanistan. You
see bad shit. And in South America,

895
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:43,410
we just saw in Caracas where it's insane,
higher murder rate than America,

896
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,370
you know, with 20 million people,
population, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

897
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,980
But Europe is about to fucking explode.
It's about to explode.

898
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,960
So this all has to do with the
adoption of the euro. Is that what,

899
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,010
fuck this whole sister situation out the,
the whole,

900
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,400
because Europe is all connected. All
the countries are connected now I think.

901
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,293
I think it's,

902
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:11,220
we've been in a depression because what's
the difference between a recession and

903
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:13,200
depression and depression goes on for it?
You know,

904
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,160
it's a cyclical economic
downturn. It lasts, you know,

905
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,480
a longer time than a recession. Well,
we, because of quantitative easing,

906
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:24,120
all these things I economic things,
we sort of kept it at bay.

907
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,020
But right now Europe's
already back in recession.

908
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,400
China slow down in new sod down.

909
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,440
America's very shortly going to
slow down behind them and it's no,

910
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:35,400
there's no way we can. And you go,
okay, well it's another five years.

911
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:40,020
So that means, okay, well it started
in 2008 it's going to be, you know,

912
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,350
eight years,
nine years before we get out of this.

913
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,610
So economically we had all these things
that we tried to fix it, it didn't work.

914
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:50,520
So now there's just no money,
no money, no jobs in the system.

915
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:53,610
So young people are the ones who
get forced out. The problem is,

916
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,370
is young people are the first ones who
are going to go out and get a stick and

917
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:58,350
start bashing shit up
because why wouldn't they?

918
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,830
Of course. Yeah. I mean, I've,

919
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:02,280
I've said that's the biggest problem
with this country is that, you know,

920
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:04,680
everybody wants to fix everything
that's happening everywhere,

921
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,990
but they don't want to
fix what's going on in,

922
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,460
in the impoverished areas of this
country. When you're there, see,

923
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:15,120
there was something that was released
today that a study I read today rather a

924
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:18,870
study on a message. It was on my message
board, but I forget what the study was,

925
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:19,171
what it said.

926
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:24,171
The 72% of black people in this country
are born to single parents and raised by

927
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:30,090
single parents. That's fucked.
That's just fucked. You know, if,

928
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:34,650
if we, if we want to like start fixing
things and we got to fix this country too,

929
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,330
I mean if we, we this, this, this
country could fall apart just as easily.

930
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,720
When you look at giant patches where
kids are growing up without any hope and

931
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:49,320
that's, that's the most fuck thing.
When a child like, as you said,

932
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,280
has no future. They feel they
have no future and they're angry,

933
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,053
they feel rob,

934
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,440
it's, you know, you're
saying, well how do you,

935
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:01,370
how does it feel to come back to New
York from Afghanistan? You know? Well,

936
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:06,620
it reminded me so much of, of nine
11, but it was like the stark thing.

937
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:11,510
Whereas what, what fucked me up
more was when you're in Mexico,

938
00:56:11,511 --> 00:56:12,830
like five miles from the,

939
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,050
from the border and shit is fucked up.
Like some of them you were just saying it,

940
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:21,150
some of the craziest shit
you've seen generally, you know,

941
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,390
makes you feel better about
your life feel or, you know, I,

942
00:56:24,391 --> 00:56:28,590
I'm happy I have all these, you know,
health and things. But I went to a, uh,

943
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:34,430
a church run outside of warriors
by a sort of born again,

944
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:38,860
pastor who was a,
an ex junkie and he takes in sort of the,

945
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,900
the refuse of, of, of, of
warriors into this church.

946
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,020
And it's like a lot of people with,

947
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,870
with severe psychological problems,

948
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:53,860
people with severe um,
uh,

949
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,400
drug addictions and a lot of,
uh,

950
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,900
there was two feral children, not
children. They were, and then adults now,

951
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:05,020
but they had grown up funeral
like on the streets sort of thing.

952
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,900
One sort of barked like a dog and,

953
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,140
but you go and they live in these cells
cause some of them have to be locked in.

954
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,770
And like there was,
you know,

955
00:57:12,771 --> 00:57:16,660
people with open colostomy bags and
stuff with flies buzzing around their

956
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:17,980
innards and stuff and they say,

957
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,490
and you're walking around
and it was like just crazy.

958
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,030
She's fucking just degradation,

959
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:29,170
like fearful people were,
you know, and, and, and,

960
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,070
and like a nightmare. Like it was crazy,
you know, and, and they, they all,

961
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,900
he has the pastor gets them to paint and
all their paintings are fucking insane.

962
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:41,980
Like so heavy and depressing and a lot
of them are missing limbs because of,

963
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:43,120
you know,
gang green and,

964
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,660
and so when you come from shooting there
and then when I was just in Vegas for

965
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:51,970
the fights and you walk around
and we went out like to, you know,

966
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,170
a nightclub after the fights and it's
just Chanel and Louis Vuitton and this and

967
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:57,970
that. And like everybody, you know,

968
00:57:57,971 --> 00:58:00,430
all the stores on the way to the
nightclub and then get everyone dressed up

969
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,970
whenever you're like,
as human beings,

970
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:08,690
we just want to forget, you know,
we just want entertain TV more,

971
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:13,540
just spectacular shit.
Just fucking lots of stuff because it's,

972
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,770
we like to bury our heads in the sand
because that's just right here. Like,

973
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:21,010
that shit is happening just fucking,
you don't have to go to Afghanistan.

974
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:22,270
It's five miles from our border.

975
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:28,090
And so you know that that's what,
what you think when you come back from,

976
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,070
from places like that. And by the
way, all the guns when we were there,

977
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:38,071
it's the largest hall of ammunition was
over 250,000 rounds of ammunition at

978
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,590
some point 60 ammunition and it was
coming from America. And I was like, oh,

979
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:44,770
that's, you know, strangely, like, no,
all the guns are coming from America.

980
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:47,440
All the guns,
all the ammunition coming from America,

981
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,710
all the drugs comes up from here and I'll,
excuse me.

982
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:51,940
And all the money comes from America.

983
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,930
Well, what was that
one crazy uh, DEA idea.

984
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:03,400
They're in a sell guns. The
fast and the furious. Yeah.

985
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,800
They sold guns with, with markers. Yeah.

986
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:07,660
So that they can find
out who's using the guns.

987
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:12,370
And those guns were directly used
to kill agent. Yeah. That, well,

988
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:15,040
they figured that was a scam.
It was a scam.

989
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,230
And that they just pretended it was a,
a mission or the mean,

990
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:24,590
just the fact that they could
ever justify selling fucking guns.

991
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,500
Lots of guns to Mexican drug dealers.

992
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,850
They had the, uh, how could they
possibly think that that would,

993
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,930
they had a killer cart with the CIA,

994
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,950
the old director of the
CIA ceremonial pistol. Wow.

995
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,450
Like, you know, it has like director
of the CIA on it. Holy Shit.

996
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,450
So Holy Shit.

997
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,831
They're just,

998
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:52,400
the fact that they can say that that
was an operation and they could say, oh,

999
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:56,030
this is what we're going to do.
The way we're going to track the network,

1000
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,920
we have to actually sell them real guns.

1001
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,930
Yeah. The Mexicans laugh
at it. It's hilarious.

1002
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,980
This is what the Americans are doing.
Just giving free guns to the Narcos

1003
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,850
in order to find out
what rapists are like,

1004
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:10,040
I'm going to have to go
get my ducks sucked a lot.

1005
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,820
I'm going to really have to find out what
did it, what it's like to rate people.

1006
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:18,620
So I'm gonna have to do
some raping. What pop? Fuck.

1007
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:21,560
How has no one getting,
why is no one going to jail for that?

1008
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:27,570
Well, I mean, God knows
that the whole, I mean,

1009
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,670
the majority of the police
done in Mexico are corrupt.

1010
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:34,440
So every time the Americans tried to do
something with them, like it just gets,

1011
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:34,930
you know,

1012
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:38,320
well, how has no one in the
American DEA going to jail for that?

1013
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,443
I Dunno.

1014
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:44,800
That's just seems like the most
ridiculous idea of all time.

1015
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,490
Yeah.
The worst guy,

1016
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,980
the worst guy I've ever heard about
as a guy named Eldora keen and he's a,

1017
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,020
a narco that was fighting
one of the Mormon colonies,

1018
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:57,830
but he's famous for, uh, you know,

1019
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:59,930
he's obviously there
were drug dealers and in,

1020
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:03,290
so he went into a drug
rehab center or he didn't,

1021
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:07,070
but he had his people massacre the mall.
18 different people in a,

1022
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,950
in a drug rehab center just for being
in a drug Rehab Center. You know,

1023
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:18,100
this is a very bad guy. Um, and he
kidnapped and killed some of the, uh,

1024
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,500
the Mormon, the Lebaron family. Um,

1025
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:25,820
but he is famous for getting caught
on the other side of the board,

1026
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:29,910
on the American side of the border
with a Mexican military, um,

1027
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,190
convoy filled with something
like 15 tons of pot

1028
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:39,530
and they had a firefight with
the American border patrol.

1029
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:43,340
And then they came back into
Mexico and they knew who it was.

1030
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,070
They knew that they did.
They knew he had had a firefight,

1031
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,500
but he went back to where he lives,

1032
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,380
which is eight miles down
the road from the Mormons.

1033
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,360
And the Mexican government
didn't do anything.

1034
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,890
Whoa. I got a frog in
my throat. Jesus Christ.

1035
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:05,840
Fuck
yeah.

1036
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,733
Elder keen.

1037
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:12,810
What a ballsy move.
Do you want a water or something man?

1038
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:17,180
Yeah, maybe we reach it. There you go.

1039
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,310
You need more rehab.

1040
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,530
This is a fridge right behind
you. I'll grab you one. All right.

1041
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,640
Get some cigarettes is,
that'll help.

1042
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,540
Maybe.
What a ballsy move.

1043
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:34,140
That guy gets in a fucking armored car.

1044
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:38,880
Voi with weed and tries it too. I'm
asking a firefight with them. Holy Shit.

1045
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,150
Now how are these and Mormon
is getting around in Mexico.

1046
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,590
They all take convoys now.
I don't know.

1047
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,010
Like heavily armed and shad
are heavily armed. Yeah.

1048
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,710
So did they like drive around with
like tanks? Like what did they,

1049
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,920
what do they do? Cause I know a lot of
the drug cartels, they have tanks now.

1050
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,710
Jay have trucks with, you
know, with guns and stuff.

1051
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:59,700
So the Mormons drive around
like they're in war. Yeah. Wow.

1052
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,460
What a nutty thing. It must
be for them, Huh? Yeah.

1053
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,690
They are at war and they
can't get out of there.

1054
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,090
Are they trying to plan to get
out of and get out of there?

1055
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,470
A lot of them have American passports,

1056
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,610
but they don't want to
do it with like Mexicans.

1057
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:17,850
Like these are like big super tall
cowboy hat wearing sort of Texas dudes,

1058
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,950
but they're in Mexico,
three in Mexico,

1059
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:21,540
and they're going to war
with these drug cartels.

1060
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,690
I would think that if you're ever in
a place where you're at war with drug

1061
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:28,690
cartels, it's time to get the fuck out of
dog asked them that. What they say. Um,

1062
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,040
this is my country. This is my home.
It's hard to leave your home. Wow.

1063
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:36,450
Fuck out of this. That's some
silly nonsense to me. Uh, you know,

1064
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,750
I think people have to get over that idea.
You should live anywhere.

1065
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,290
Get your loved ones together and move
where it's safe. Tough Fuck Outta here.

1066
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:46,110
If you have money.
I mean if you have enough to do it,

1067
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:48,030
and I can understand if you
have to fight for your property,

1068
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:52,980
but that that's a lost cause. That
place. Yeah, they don't leave.

1069
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,010
It's, I mean I had the same
answer and when I was in,

1070
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:59,280
so the Africa where shooting and there's
like a lot of violence in South Africa

1071
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,820
and I kept saying to people, why don't
you leave? I said, that's our home.

1072
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,860
Those people are idiots. That's crazy.
That's just, it's so ridiculous.

1073
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,610
If you know there's a better spot on
earth where this kind of kind of shit

1074
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:13,620
doesn't happen,
he can look where my home is,

1075
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:18,270
home invasions and and assassinations
and institutionalized rapes and all these

1076
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:22,020
things are just part of the daily
equation. Then it's, then fuck it.

1077
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:26,400
I'm not doing that. Yeah.
Yeah, I agree. Yeah.

1078
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:27,810
The fuck man.

1079
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,960
How do we get the rest of the world
anywhere near where we are here right now?

1080
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:35,340
Is that possible?
Can,

1081
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:39,930
the human condition evolves so much that
we could ever get everybody on a higher

1082
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:42,750
level all across the world?
Or is this just a part of the program?

1083
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,410
The spectrum always goes from the worst
case scenario to the best case scenario

1084
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:50,610
and every shade in between.
Is that just how things keep moving?

1085
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,450
Is that just the conflict, the Yin
and Yang? Is that, is that the, the,

1086
01:04:54,451 --> 01:04:58,230
the pull and push of life? That's the
best question I've heard a long time.

1087
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:01,800
But I think it's unanswerable.
If anybody,

1088
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,910
if anybody would have seen it,
the spectrum is broad as humanly possible,

1089
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:09,250
I would think it would be you, you
are, I mean, the thing is is if you,

1090
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,930
you see some things that that are,
that are great,

1091
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,490
like we did a story on

1092
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,220
these scientists who are developing,

1093
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:19,000
um,

1094
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
machines that can sort of harvest the
atmosphere so they can take out carbon and

1095
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:29,620
all the harmful things in the atmosphere
and then sort of reduce it to CO2,

1096
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:30,460
which you can make.

1097
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:36,210
You can actually activate algae
for biofuels or you can, uh,

1098
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,480
combine them with other elements and
lots of solar to make hydrogen cells.

1099
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,650
And it might sound like we're
clinging at straws here,

1100
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:47,740
but when you start to think, wow,
you know, if we had unlimited,

1101
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:51,220
if we have unlimited solar power
and you have unlimited carbon, a,

1102
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:53,260
it stops global warming would be,

1103
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:58,030
you can make hydrogen cells or
biofuels and then you can say,

1104
01:05:58,031 --> 01:06:01,000
wow, that would be interesting
because you could actually,

1105
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,820
you could put hydrogen cells
and t like every new car.

1106
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:05,170
So every new car had to have that.

1107
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,050
So that's a whole new industry that
we would run because of the patents,

1108
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,400
the only,
um,

1109
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,370
effluent that comes out of a
hydrogen cells as pure h or two,

1110
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,940
which we're running out of water. So you
say, hey, it could build a new economy,

1111
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,590
build this new world.

1112
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:24,760
And so when you start talking to the
scientists who are really smart guys and

1113
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:28,020
realizing, well, you can sort
of regulate, you know, the,

1114
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,740
the amount of harmful toxins in the
atmosphere. Um, there is sanity. You know,

1115
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:36,870
there are people coming up with ideas.
This could start a whole new economy. Uh,

1116
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,790
you know, sort of set us out on this, you
know, great, right track and you're like,

1117
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,700
wow, and you feel really good and
maybe we are going to be smart.

1118
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:45,250
Maybe we aren't going to put these
machines to the next every factory.

1119
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,010
Maybe we are going to do this great stuff.
And then the problem is,

1120
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:53,110
is you go to Africa or
Southeast Asia and you know,

1121
01:06:53,111 --> 01:06:57,100
we did a story on, um, you know,

1122
01:06:57,101 --> 01:07:01,700
a lot of people are going, Europeans
and Americans are going to, uh, um,

1123
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:05,650
Thailand, you know, to get a
medical vacations, they call them.

1124
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,280
So you go there and you get a facelift
and two weeks of vacation on orchitis.

1125
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:14,480
And so, you know, then you
can get transplants. He
can get this. And you know,

1126
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:18,130
that's a more and more
people are going for, um, uh,

1127
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,460
medical procedures. So it
started a war between the, uh,

1128
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:27,310
ambulance gangs to take
bodies. Uh, you know,

1129
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:30,880
because let's say you hurt yourself.
Well, more than often than not,

1130
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:34,990
you're not going to arrive alive
because they want to harvest your,

1131
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,570
your pieces. So Bangkok,
body snatchers. So there's,

1132
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:43,280
there's what like street gangs that fight
each other over the sort of dead end.

1133
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,320
So say if someone falls
and breaks their leg,

1134
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,890
they're not going to take
you to the hospital. They're
going to take your organs.

1135
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,900
Well, if you're, if you're injured,

1136
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,840
they're going to make sure
that you don't arrive alive.

1137
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,340
And then they harvest York so they
kill you. Yes. They let you die.

1138
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,980
They'll let you die. Yeah, they
don't kill you. They let it,

1139
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,600
they don't give you medical attention.

1140
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:11,460
We never saw anybody sort of overtly
being killed. We've heard about it.

1141
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:16,100
But you don't want to say, yeah,
okay, well they don't seem like

1142
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,933
they're ethical.

1143
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:20,210
So I wouldn't imagine that would be
outside the realm of possibility.

1144
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:22,100
But I understand exactly
where you're going with that

1145
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,850
one side. You have this
sort of hope, you know what,

1146
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,990
we're going to get our shit together.

1147
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:30,980
We're going to have new fucking energy
systems or aren't going to crazy people,

1148
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:34,910
all this stuff. And then, and then you go
see that and you're like, wait a minute,

1149
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,420
we're parasites were bad,
bad people.

1150
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:41,860
Yeah. I, I did this thing before my,

1151
01:08:41,861 --> 01:08:46,861
a showtime special in 2005 or I talked
about human beings being a really

1152
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:50,070
complicated form of
bacteria. So, hey, you know,

1153
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:55,071
I've had this idea a few times while
tripping and the inside tanks and even on

1154
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:56,880
planes,

1155
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,880
and I've had this feeling like if you
looked at the earth as a life force and

1156
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:05,350
you look to human beings, you would,
you would say, well, that's a growth.

1157
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,050
You would say, look, if it's,
it's everywhere. It's, it's,

1158
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,060
it sucks all the fish out of the ocean,

1159
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,990
it throws waste in there and kills all
the rest of the life. It fucks everything.

1160
01:09:13,991 --> 01:09:17,680
It touches it everywhere it lives.
There's brown smoke,

1161
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,790
you burned down giant chunks of it.
It grows right back and even gets bigger.

1162
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:26,650
It's like this is some crazy growth.
I'm like, if you didn't understand whom,

1163
01:09:26,651 --> 01:09:31,270
if we, you were so alien that human beings
were an identifiable as an individual,

1164
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,760
you would,
you would look at them as a giant,

1165
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,450
huge swarm of life on
top of this other life.

1166
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,370
You wouldn't see individual people.

1167
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:43,510
You would see it just like mold and I
said that maybe we're here to eat the

1168
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:47,500
sandwich. Maybe we are like moldy sandwich
that maybe we're just a really super

1169
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:50,590
complicated thing that's
here to fuck things up.

1170
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,050
That's why at the pinnacle of Technology,

1171
01:09:53,051 --> 01:09:56,770
the the best we have to do is the
shit that fucks things up the most.

1172
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,680
Like nuclear power,
nuclear waste, you know,

1173
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:04,000
and and all sorts of other
crazy experiments that are
probably going on right

1174
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:06,790
now that we're not even aware of.
Anti matter type shed.

1175
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:10,450
They were there working on anti-matter
weapons and aunt in area 51 what does

1176
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:13,270
that mean? I don't even know. I don't,
I don't even know, but it can't be good.

1177
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,330
It's like what? Nuclear power
doesn't kill everybody quick enough.

1178
01:10:16,331 --> 01:10:20,680
You fuckhead you need to develop something
that kills everyone instantaneously.

1179
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:24,310
We have enough bombs to blow up the
whole world, like how many times over?

1180
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,300
And they'll like, yeah, but it doesn't do
it quite as good as I think can be done.

1181
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,760
So they continue to make nuttier and
nuttier weapons. Do you see that? Uh,

1182
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:34,780
the jet drone, Dave, uh,

1183
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:38,490
developed the go something like 18 times
faster than the speed of sound. Right?

1184
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,360
Some insane amount just to get over
there and fuck things up as quick as

1185
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:44,194
possible.

1186
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,550
We don't need any better weapons.
That's, you know, we have,

1187
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,400
we have weapons that we don't even
have the first clue about now.

1188
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:54,420
Well, it's what I've, but we
are nature as, as animals,

1189
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:57,870
as an intelligent animals is to
keep trying to make things better.

1190
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,870
It's like if we stopped right now
with cell phones and said, we good,

1191
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,720
we good with this. We can talk, we
can taxed. This is good enough. Right?

1192
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:06,690
Can we just stop right there? It
would. No one would take that.

1193
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:10,800
People would go crazy. Four years from
now they'd be fucking so math or iPhone,

1194
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,930
this fucking clunky old hunk of shit.

1195
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,790
Why can't they have something better
than this now? People would be angry. We,

1196
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:19,950
we have a deep desire for
technological innovation.

1197
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:24,420
At the end of that is destruction
at the very peak of technology.

1198
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:26,820
The best we're capable
of is blowing shit up.

1199
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,850
It makes you wonder if that's
really what we're here for.

1200
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:33,900
It makes you wonder if we are not some
weird technological caterpillar becoming

1201
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:38,700
a butterfly and all of our desires and
ego and the need to get pussy and drive a

1202
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:39,240
fast car.

1203
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,290
All that shit really is just pushing
the society and the society is pushing

1204
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,030
technology and technology.

1205
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:48,630
One day someone's going to press a
fucking button and the whole thing.

1206
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:52,680
She said,
now I'm not going to be so smiley anymore.

1207
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:56,580
Maybe that's the way it's supposed
to be though. Well, my theory is,

1208
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:59,100
my theory is that that's a no,
that that's,

1209
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:04,130
that's how the universe gets born and
dies with us and that the Bang Bang.

1210
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:08,550
It's really just a bunch of scientists
with autism on anti anxiety medication

1211
01:12:08,551 --> 01:12:12,360
and they make a big bang machine and
one of them presses it and the whole

1212
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,250
universe starts all over again.

1213
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:19,050
And it starts again with planets forming
and then life forms. And then dinosaurs.

1214
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,530
Dinosaurs get hit by an asteroid
billions of years ago by the whole deal.

1215
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,370
And then one guy presses a
button and a big bang machine,

1216
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:29,450
he rigs boom and it starts all over again.
Why not if the unit,

1217
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:32,520
if it's possible for the University
of the universe, that's possible too.

1218
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:36,600
It's possible that it's just a bunch
of scientists with autism and every 14

1219
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,210
billion years they blow the whole
fucking thing sky high and it starts from

1220
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:43,620
scratch. Uh, well definitely.
Uh, we're going to have to eat,

1221
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:45,440
drink and be marry them
because we're all going to,

1222
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,860
that's what I'm talking about.

1223
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:51,150
What do you think when you talk to these
people that are like, I mean for you,

1224
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,270
you are a realist. You're a dude who's
seen the dark parts of the world.

1225
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,580
When you talk to people and they,
you know,

1226
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:59,760
they start hitting you with some fucking
power of positive thinking type shit

1227
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:04,170
and hit you with the secret or Eckhart
toll and you know, he's like, do,

1228
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,230
do you want to like when that holds
the secret thing was going on,

1229
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:10,410
do you want to say, listen, you, you're
fucking environment is real. Okay.

1230
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,320
You don't create it with your mind.
It's real.

1231
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:16,140
There really are parts of the world
that sock and positive thinking he's not

1232
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,150
going to get you out of Mogadishu.
Right.

1233
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:23,790
Well we are in Pasadena. I mean like, you
know, positive thinking. Got You here.

1234
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:26,310
Yeah. There you go. Uh, you know,

1235
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:31,050
New York tends to be a bit more
cynical and la tends to be a bit more,

1236
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:34,470
so whether, whether I'm pretty
girls, that's what it does.

1237
01:13:34,471 --> 01:13:38,690
It for real and space space.
Um,

1238
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:42,310
the fact that it's not, you don't get
rained on hardly ever and it's never cold.

1239
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:46,800
Right. That's huge. That east coast
winter thing is, that's bullshit.

1240
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:51,730
That's retarded. Everybody
gets angry. Yeah. Your face
hurts that she has no good.

1241
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,330
He get stuck on the highway. Every
gets stuck on the highway. Yeah,

1242
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,080
the whole fucking highway shutdown
black ice. That's always fun.

1243
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,500
That shit doesn't happen here.
It doesn't have in here at all.

1244
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,030
So people were more relaxed.

1245
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,960
It really is that plus the people
that landed on the east coast,

1246
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:11,961
we're all animals who were so fucking
fed up with Europe that they on boats to

1247
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:16,990
get on boats and they got them when
across an ocean before there was TV. Okay.

1248
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,260
And they decided to move to
this new country that they
didn't ever probably even

1249
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:22,180
have good pictures of.
You know,

1250
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:25,420
someone just told them is a land of plenty
and they decided to get in a boat and

1251
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,910
give it a shot.
Those people are psycho.

1252
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,970
I mean those are some really
adventuresome fucking people.

1253
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,780
Well those were the, those were the
first ones. Those were all adventuresome.

1254
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,180
But the ones who said, okay,
you're going to go up that way.

1255
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,450
We don't know how far it is and we
don't really know if you're going to get

1256
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:41,860
there.
And by the way,

1257
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,700
there's all kinds of tribes that are
going to try to scalp you and rape your

1258
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:48,160
daughters and all this shit
as you go through there.

1259
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:51,580
And there's mountains that are probably
impassable and you're gonna have to eat

1260
01:14:51,581 --> 01:14:56,350
your kids, go, go west. And,
and, and it was, it was,

1261
01:14:56,410 --> 01:15:01,090
when we say frontier, it was like the
frontier was, we don't know what's,

1262
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,930
what's next. We don't know what's beyond
there. And so for those people to say,

1263
01:15:04,931 --> 01:15:08,320
I'm going to leave,
I'm like a Irish fucking potato picker.

1264
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:10,810
And I lived in New York for
three years and that was no good.

1265
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,640
So I'm going to go out and I'm just
going to go out into fucking absolute

1266
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:18,460
wilderness where everyone hates me in
the animals and want to eat me and I'm

1267
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:20,890
just going to keep going until I
hit the other ocean. That's crazy.

1268
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,020
And it's amazing how quick it happened.
Yeah.

1269
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,920
It was just like being know
a couple hundred years,

1270
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,810
a giant fucking swarm of millions of
people had completely populated this one

1271
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:34,240
continent that before that,
you know,

1272
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:36,580
the last time people came
across here was the ice age.

1273
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,850
There wasn't really a lot of human beings
live in the air when most people don't

1274
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:43,000
know is in North America.
Just a little over 10,000 years ago,

1275
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,600
half of it was covered by a mile of ice.
I mean,

1276
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:50,950
wrap your head around a mile of fucking
ice above your head and that covered

1277
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,010
half this country.
This is the,

1278
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:57,640
this country that we don't understand
like the history of humanity in the world.

1279
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,000
We have a very, um, patchy,

1280
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:05,140
sort of a knowledge of
everything past the Ice Age,

1281
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:09,430
everything about people 10,000
plus years ago. It's a lot of,

1282
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,020
there's some bullshit,

1283
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:13,870
there's a lot of bullshitting because
there's a lot of information they're not

1284
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:16,600
willing to look at.
Some new stuff's coming along,

1285
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:20,680
new construction that they've found
like in Turkey, this go Becky tap lead.

1286
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,540
It's at least 14,000 years old.

1287
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:27,100
Massive excellently cut stone columns,
civilization,

1288
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:31,240
clear civilization back in a time where
they're attributing all that area only

1289
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:33,850
as hunter and gatherers, there is
no civilization, there's no cities.

1290
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,730
Where's the fucking city man you're
going to, you got to explain this.

1291
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:41,290
Not only that, it has drawings up or
um, statues that are carved into it.

1292
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:45,580
Like these three d images of animals
that don't even exist in that area,

1293
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:49,900
that part of the world. So it's a, it's,
it's real possible that shit. Like,

1294
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:50,141
you know,

1295
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:55,141
the ice being over half of this
country that's moved around for tens of

1296
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:00,040
thousands of years and there's probably
been these pretty kind of nifty

1297
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:03,310
sophisticated civilizations,
but maybe they get to a point,

1298
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:05,230
not even as far as we've gotten right now,

1299
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,800
but maybe get to some previous point and
just implode like those crazy ass holes

1300
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:12,970
in Pakistan or implode
like Nazi Germany or,

1301
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:18,140
or implode like a million different
examples from Gingiss Khan to,

1302
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:20,390
to, you know, to the Catholic Church,

1303
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:24,550
look at all the crazy shit that's
gone on in this country. This, yeah.

1304
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,770
It easily could be like that always.

1305
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,850
And that we've gotten to these really
amazing Atlantean type civilizations and

1306
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:36,050
just fucking chaos. Boom. Somebody
comes in strapped up, but Dynamo,

1307
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,770
who the fuck knows and just
ace is the whole thing.

1308
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,770
There's one part of the world somewhere
in the Middle East, I forget where it is,

1309
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:46,970
where there's um,
they found glass in the desert.

1310
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,790
They found like this area
in a satellite image,

1311
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:53,480
kind of wish I had more information
about this from the tip of my tip of my

1312
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:58,280
tongue, but the, the, it was either
some sort of an asteroid will impact,

1313
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,950
or like hundreds of
thousands of years ago,

1314
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:03,750
somebody had a fucking gigantic
explosion there, right?

1315
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:08,060
Like if it was like some sort of
civilization and they flattened that

1316
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:08,751
motherfucker out,

1317
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:13,010
that's not outside the realm
of possibility that someone
figured out something,

1318
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:16,430
some sort of massive way to
fuck things up, you know,

1319
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:19,010
that we're the only ones that have ever
figured that out throughout history.

1320
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,250
It's very possible that somebody else
might have time when we might've done this

1321
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:26,360
whole dance to the top a couple of
times before tumbling. You know,

1322
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:28,090
this is just the highest
we've ever gotten.

1323
01:18:28,091 --> 01:18:30,980
It kept it together very good at
destroying shit, that's for sure.

1324
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,570
I've got this guy coming on June
7th for those of you who, uh,

1325
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:39,050
been asking me about this, uh,
John Anthony West and uh, he's, uh,

1326
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:44,110
this egyptologist who is a famous for
his work is uncovering the fact that

1327
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:48,830
there's not just one each option
civilization that they're dealing with.

1328
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,000
You're dealing with old,

1329
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,840
older and older civilizations to
go back to 30 plus thousand years.

1330
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:58,460
There's actual hieroglyphs that show
that each option civilization goes back

1331
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:01,640
that far. Like they even named
the pharaohs, but for some reason,

1332
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:04,850
modern day egyptologist have looked
at all this stuff and said that, well,

1333
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:05,684
that's a myth.

1334
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,110
Like everything was real up until about
5,000 years ago and all the rest of that

1335
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:11,720
stuff is just, they just made
that shit up because it doesn't,

1336
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,770
it doesn't coincide with our own ideas
of how long civilization has been around

1337
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:17,000
for,
you know,

1338
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:20,780
it just seems to me that when you look
at how sophisticated we are today and how

1339
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:24,260
close we are to fucking it up and how
badly it is fucking up and all the places

1340
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:25,310
in the world that you described,

1341
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:28,220
it seems like the odds that
we haven't done this already,

1342
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:32,390
like it just seems really small and I
think we've got a lot of Amnesia when it

1343
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:34,640
comes to the past of, of, of humans.

1344
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:39,650
And I think you also have to factor and
physical things that we can't control

1345
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:42,320
like the earth volcanoes,
earthquakes,

1346
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:46,520
sh asteroidal impacts shit like that.
You know, when I'm driving here today,

1347
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:49,880
I was driving on the the
one 18 and it's beautiful.

1348
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,020
You're going through the hills,

1349
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:55,190
the mountains and I'm looking up and I'm
just saying it is amazing that we are

1350
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,730
basically in the whole world
is a convertible, right?

1351
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:01,540
There's no top and we're just,

1352
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:06,110
we just sort of accepted that
we're just head to the universe,

1353
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:11,410
just nothing but space and fucking giant
rocks can fall from the sky and crush

1354
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:16,380
your country. And we've just sort
of completely forgotten about that.

1355
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:19,950
I mean there's, there's impact
holes that you can visit. I mean,

1356
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:21,750
if you look at the general life
of the university, you know,

1357
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,830
the university being billions
of years old right now,

1358
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:26,610
look at all the holes on
earth and then you just think,

1359
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:29,670
how long have we been around? 4.6
billion years. How many holes are there?

1360
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,370
This is going to happen again.
You motherfucker this,

1361
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,830
we're forgetting that this shit happens.

1362
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,590
Like there's hundreds of
thousands of them. You know,

1363
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,220
there is biggest states and they're flying
through the air and they're going to

1364
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:45,900
land and they're gonna fuck up everything
there. You're really depressing me.

1365
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,310
You could throw that. No, it's not
bad, man. I think, I think if that's,

1366
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:52,980
if we're going to go, that's,
that's a fucking amazing way to go.

1367
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,710
That's going to be quick. It's going
to be quick and it's going to be crazy.

1368
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,080
And you don't have to worry about
anybody suffering. You know,

1369
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:01,920
it's like we're not afraid to sleep and
everybody's afraid to die and both of

1370
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:04,640
them are inevitable. It's going to
happen. You're going to die on it.

1371
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:06,930
It's not like we're going to live
forever. If he asked her, it doesn't come,

1372
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,020
we're going to die. For sure. That
might be a crazy way to do it.

1373
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:14,070
I'm not saying it's not saying it's good,
but might not be bad.

1374
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:18,510
It might be the way it has to happen
for the next ultra intelligent thing to

1375
01:21:18,511 --> 01:21:19,920
come along.
That wouldn't have existed before.

1376
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:23,310
The dinosaurs wouldn't have existed
before us. I mean, that makes sense.

1377
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:28,420
I'd rather go out by an asteroid then
a series of sort of dirty bombs by some

1378
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:33,770
sort of cult or religious terrorism.

1379
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,810
Did you see the latest footage from Syria?
All the murdered children?

1380
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:41,410
Yeah. What the fuck is going
on over there? Well, it's
the same thing. You know,

1381
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,650
that that happened in Libya.
It's the same thing. You know,

1382
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:49,240
that might happen in Egypt.
Um, you know when people fight,

1383
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,840
it's the years you,
you know what you said about Vietnam,

1384
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,480
don't they remember Vietnam?

1385
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:59,230
And you know when you go to these places
and you see what injuries look like,

1386
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:02,890
which are colostomy bags and you know,
legs that are gone and our arms are gone.

1387
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:08,020
You say, well you know, why would you
ever do this again? And then you know,

1388
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:11,020
generation forgets and then they
go do something else. Like go,

1389
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:11,854
just go do it again.

1390
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,350
How do we, how do we stop the cycle?
Is it possible without mushrooms?

1391
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,610
I don't think so. I think it's
what I'm thinking. Asked for a tap

1392
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,320
doing asteroids. I'd rather have
the asteroids to do it though.

1393
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,510
We know the concept of asteroids
coming from machines. No, excuse me.

1394
01:22:27,511 --> 01:22:30,190
Mushrooms coming from asteroids,
asteroids coming from Russia.

1395
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,750
Maybe the world comes from mushrooms.
Maybe getting to be a really trippy,

1396
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:37,110
well this is a from Mckenna.
Mckenna is theory.

1397
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,290
Well Panspermia is a real
theory of life right now.

1398
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:44,610
The theory that amino acids and certain
nutrients and things and water in fact

1399
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:48,300
comes from comets and asteroids and
that life is transferred from planet to

1400
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:51,750
planet by Asteroidal impacts. This
is a legit scientific theory. Well,

1401
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:54,600
Mckenna's theory about
silicide been was that suicide,

1402
01:22:54,601 --> 01:22:58,590
but it's completely alien to any other
form of life that we have here on earth.

1403
01:22:58,591 --> 01:23:03,180
There's nothing like it biologically
are biochemically, it's, I think it's,

1404
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:08,230
I'm not, I'm not saying exactly right,
but I believe it's like four Fox for all.

1405
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,720
Oxi Nn dimethyltryptamine.

1406
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:14,760
It mimics the human
neurotransmitter dimethyl trip team,

1407
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,530
which is a potent psychedelic drug.
It mimics that,

1408
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:21,190
but it also has like phosphorus and the
four position, which apparently no other,

1409
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,770
no,
no other compound on earth does.

1410
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:29,070
And the idea is that spores can exist
in a vacuum and that spores could easily

1411
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:32,830
have traveled through the vacuum and
the radiation of space and landed from

1412
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:34,060
another planet here,

1413
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:38,260
created this life form that wants you
to eat it so it pops up and looks like a

1414
01:23:38,261 --> 01:23:41,710
dinner plate and it pops up all
over the place. Everywhere you go.

1415
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:44,130
It's not hiding it all.
And karmic.

1416
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:47,140
It's literally at the bottom of
the food chain. It lives on shit.

1417
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:50,200
It's just a humble little thing that
wants you to come along and eat it.

1418
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:53,740
And when you eat it,
you're granted spectacular visions,

1419
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,510
spectacular visions and feelings of love
and God and unity and the thoughts of

1420
01:23:58,511 --> 01:24:03,070
the universe being entirely connected
in one big mathematical equation,

1421
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:07,120
computations and cells and organisms and
fucking all the way down to atoms and

1422
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:09,430
subatomic particles and
then branching out again.

1423
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,220
And all this shit comes from
something that grows out of shit.

1424
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,980
All this shit comes from
something that comes from space.

1425
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:16,990
And the idea is that our,

1426
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:21,580
our concept of life and our concept
of intelligent is very narrow.

1427
01:24:21,581 --> 01:24:25,570
And we egocentrically have assumed
that all intelligence must be contained

1428
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:30,280
inside a brain in some sort
of an intelligent upright
body that we can respect,

1429
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:33,310
that's going to come here from another
planet and show us how to use a laser gun.

1430
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,020
You know?
But in fact,

1431
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:39,320
intelligence can exist in plant
form and that intelligence in, in,

1432
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:41,390
in spectacular visions and,

1433
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:46,610
and knowledge all comes out of a dimension
that you cannot access without these

1434
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:49,360
molecules that exist in these plants.

1435
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:52,660
And it opens literally
chemical doorways and the mind.

1436
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:57,280
It's pretty fascinating idea. The fact
that, you know, that is alien invasion,

1437
01:24:57,281 --> 01:25:02,020
that mushrooms are an alien invasion.
I got to read this. Who's MCKENNA?

1438
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,270
Terence Mckenna. He's a w who
is a crazy psychedelic chemist.

1439
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:11,050
Slash botanist. Slash.
Uh, I think his degrees,

1440
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:13,450
we're all in ethnobotany.
And his,

1441
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:19,080
I think his main study of work was
the concept of the stoned ape theory,

1442
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,470
um, that and his idea of
TimeWave zero, which would,

1443
01:25:23,471 --> 01:25:28,270
the idea was that time was like a
mathematical progression of waves and that

1444
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:31,180
like a novelty and terrible
times would all just,

1445
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:33,490
they were all almost be
predictable that you could,

1446
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:37,210
it was some sort of a mathematical
equation or getting to infinite novelty,

1447
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:41,440
which was like in this year supposedly,
really, which is probably horse shit. But,

1448
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:43,720
uh, his other, the fascinating
theory was the mushroom theory,

1449
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:44,800
the stoned ape theory.

1450
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:49,180
And that was the theory that that's how
human beings actually evolved from lower

1451
01:25:49,181 --> 01:25:53,020
primates was the consumption
of psychedelic mushrooms
and his theory, actually,

1452
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:57,400
I don't know if it's been supported
by a lot of different scientists.

1453
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:01,600
I know there's some debate on whether or
not as timelines are right, but it's a,

1454
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,710
based on the idea that

1455
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,950
a bunch of monkeys ate some
mushrooms and then help them evolve.

1456
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:12,420
It's interesting how many theories there
are about how he got from sort of that

1457
01:26:12,421 --> 01:26:13,250
to this.

1458
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,890
Yeah. Well, it's crazy. You look at
it, we go to visit them in the zoo.

1459
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:18,890
I took my kids to the zoo the other day
and I'm staring at my cousin's sure.

1460
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,053
In a cage.

1461
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:23,210
Well here in the home of Scientology,
you know,

1462
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:28,060
they believe that the aliens came and
went into the monkeys and that's what we

1463
01:26:28,061 --> 01:26:30,310
are.
We're just vessels for alien souls.

1464
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:34,360
Well, that's the sexiest idea.
Sexiest idea is the auto knocky stuff.

1465
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:37,750
You know the stuff that we were
created by aliens and we were a genetic

1466
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:41,020
engineering program and you know,

1467
01:26:41,021 --> 01:26:44,260
you look at like stuff on the Sumerian
texts from like 6,000 years ago that

1468
01:26:44,261 --> 01:26:45,820
depicts the Annunaki coming here.

1469
01:26:45,821 --> 01:26:47,800
And how do you not know that
that's not science fiction?

1470
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:53,070
Maybe that's like their version of a
sure outer space or the outer limits or

1471
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:55,700
something like that. Well it's, it's,

1472
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:59,680
it's insane how many people are like
this was, this was how it happened.

1473
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:03,850
It's aliens, mushrooms,
it's this, it's that. Well,

1474
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:06,730
the weird thing is the doubling
of the human brain size.

1475
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,260
I don't know what the fuck happened,
man.

1476
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:11,410
I think it's probably a lack of
information more than it is a,

1477
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:16,330
I think it can't just be mushrooms that
we did. We did. That would be amazing.

1478
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:21,010
If it was like, oh you have to do is eat
mushrooms, your brain would just grow.

1479
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:24,580
But we just got on mushrooms within a
hundred years we'd look like those gray

1480
01:27:24,581 --> 01:27:26,170
aliens.
Just giant heads.

1481
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:30,550
We would need any muscles because we
would use our minds to control matter.

1482
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:33,370
And we'd just be moving shit
around constantly with our minds.

1483
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,870
I feel mushroom trip coming onto you think
so. I think I'm ready to do it today.

1484
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,260
Or you got that. Um, you've got one
over here, man. You want a cigarette?

1485
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:47,470
Um, that's going to fix today. I
was thinking how much I love you.

1486
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:51,820
I hate cigarettes and I'm handing him,
I'm like, I just want you to like me.

1487
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:56,850
I just want you to be
happy. Shane 11 to you're,

1488
01:27:56,950 --> 01:28:00,520
you're, you're blowing my mind today.
A lot of people on my mind, always,

1489
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,810
a lot of people have been passing around
this, uh, speech that you gave at Africa.

1490
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,630
It was some conference lately where
you were talking about the future of

1491
01:28:07,631 --> 01:28:11,140
television. Can you explain it? Because
I haven't actually watched it yet,

1492
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:14,040
but I'm interested in what you yeah.

1493
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:19,600
Um, it was a speech, uh, for
Internet week about, you know,

1494
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:23,380
everyone's online versus versus cable.

1495
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:28,990
And you know, what I was saying
was, so I didn't know what to do.

1496
01:28:28,991 --> 01:28:32,770
I didn't have uh, uh, anything
plan that was very smart. So I,

1497
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,620
I was flying back actually
from Afghanistan, no,

1498
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:39,120
it's finding back from Afghanistan and I
ducked into Pakistan to see the garage.

1499
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:39,471
He shoots,

1500
01:28:39,471 --> 01:28:44,471
it was flying back from Pakistan and I
was thinking about all the kids that I

1501
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:47,410
had seen who are going insane
and who were, you know,

1502
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:52,060
the guys who would kill for 10 bucks
and this is fucking crazy fucking dudes.

1503
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,420
And I was like, look, the
youth everywhere in, in,

1504
01:28:55,421 --> 01:28:59,890
in Asia and Africa and Europe here,
everyone's fucking revolting.

1505
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:04,380
But what, what we making like,
so when I went to do the upfront,

1506
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,940
which is where all the TV shows get sold
and online shows get sold and you have

1507
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:11,930
like, the voice was just, which is the
biggest show, which is just American idol.

1508
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,890
It now TV is derivative of TV.

1509
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:17,190
TV is just making shittier and
shittier shows based on itself.

1510
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:20,730
And then the on the Internet,
which could be this,

1511
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:24,090
it could be revolutionary because it's
better because you can be watching

1512
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:24,371
something,

1513
01:29:24,371 --> 01:29:27,250
been text somebody and then
get information than Google
this and fucking what's

1514
01:29:27,251 --> 01:29:28,110
it going on here and here.

1515
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:33,510
And instead of trying to be and
say what the fuck is going on.

1516
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,561
And by the way,

1517
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:36,960
young people are revolting all
around the world and they want the,

1518
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,310
this is how they get their news now.

1519
01:29:38,311 --> 01:29:40,500
They get it through blogs and
online shit here and there.

1520
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:41,670
They don't even watch TV anymore.

1521
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:45,870
But instead of doing something innovative
and challenging and revolutionary,

1522
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:50,240
we just do shittier versions of TV shows
with half the budgets. And so it's,

1523
01:29:50,241 --> 01:29:53,880
the city sort of Google says,
you know what really pisses
me off is Dah, Dah, Dah.

1524
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,930
It's like America's funniest home videos
with a, with a sort of annoying host.

1525
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:03,390
And you're like, why don't we,
why don't we use the internet?

1526
01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:06,760
Why don't we use, you know, the, the,
the social networks and you know,

1527
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,920
video and all this stuff we can do now
to actually do something that's good and

1528
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:13,470
revolutionary and start changing shit.
Because when he asks and says, well,

1529
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:15,600
how do we fucking stop all this shit?
Well,

1530
01:30:15,601 --> 01:30:19,320
the first way you stop about it is
it stop. It is to find out about it.

1531
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,260
So we have to know about it and then we
know about it. And then we can do shit.

1532
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:26,430
Like we can not buy certain things,
you know, dollar advocacy. You know,

1533
01:30:26,431 --> 01:30:30,840
consumer advocacy is the most
powerful tools we have, et Cetera,

1534
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,820
et cetera. But the first of
all is knowing about it. And,

1535
01:30:33,821 --> 01:30:37,020
and so I just sort of got really pissed
off that the Internet has become so

1536
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:40,590
derivative and so shitty and just
trying to mimic TV interviews shit.

1537
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:44,580
So let's try to fucking make something
that actually people understand where the

1538
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:47,970
people, like whether people use
that helps people or, or, or,

1539
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,510
or they understand of shit. Like, for
example, like Kony 2012 you're like,

1540
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:55,320
what's it shows that it's viral shows
that people actually want to know this

1541
01:30:55,321 --> 01:30:59,290
shit and shows it. But like it was, it was
okay. Like it was this sort of half ass.

1542
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,680
What did you think about that
whole situation? I mean that,

1543
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:05,310
that is another example of one of the
reasons why I believe that life is a work

1544
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:06,144
of fiction.

1545
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:11,660
A fucking guy decides that he's going
to make this viral video against James

1546
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:12,110
Kone

1547
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:14,000
whack, whack, whack in it. Oh,

1548
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:16,630
is that his name's Charles.
Connie James [inaudible].

1549
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:21,450
He's going to make this viral video,
expose the world to this horrible person,

1550
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:25,710
but they're getting a disproportionate
amount of the money goes to them and then

1551
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:30,210
they get accused of being unscrupulous,

1552
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:32,820
whatever the words would use to, they
didn't do anything illegal. They just did.

1553
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,350
They're a little funky with the money.

1554
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,550
Then the guy shows up naked in the
streets, beating off acting gang.

1555
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:39,540
Did you see in the video?

1556
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:44,500
Yeah. Uh, that's like craziness.
Like, well, they didn't,

1557
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:48,370
I'm sure they didn't think they went
through these kids that go over and they

1558
01:31:48,371 --> 01:31:51,910
shot it Fairfox to him. You know, I've
been there. It's a bad part of the world.

1559
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:56,470
And, and you know what, it's
interesting on a few points.

1560
01:31:56,471 --> 01:32:01,000
One because it shows that the fucking
like everyone, kids don't care.

1561
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,520
People don't care about
anything outside of America.

1562
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:07,090
Like it's a big in media that I would
say don't do anything outside of America.

1563
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:08,230
People just don't give a shit about it.

1564
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,830
Well I think it shows that people
do give a shit about it and,

1565
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:15,550
and these guys weren't expecting it.
That become a huge thing and you know,

1566
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:20,290
so obviously when weird shit happens to
you, you have different ways of coping.

1567
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:22,300
The Sky Cope by going fucking

1568
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,353
go see,

1569
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,790
which actually seems appealing sometimes.
Like when life's really hard,

1570
01:32:28,791 --> 01:32:30,320
you're just say,
I'm going to take off my fucking clothes.

1571
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,420
There's fucking serial killers and
assassins everywhere. I've just,

1572
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,430
I'm going to get your flashlight.
Fucking that guy was

1573
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:42,870
on the street in his underwear.
He got naked.

1574
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:47,520
He was like a flailing his arms around it.
And acting like Super Gay.

1575
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,920
Yes.
I wonder what he was on.

1576
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:54,420
What makes the act gay besides being

1577
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:58,830
yeah, mostly Cox balls, booty hoes,

1578
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:04,740
red band flashlights. What is a well,
yeah, Cody. I mean the thing is, is it,

1579
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,940
it became huge and I think it shows
that there's a massive audience anyway.

1580
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,830
So it was possible. Yeah.
And the whole thing is,

1581
01:33:09,831 --> 01:33:14,430
is let's make shit that actually isn't
shit. Let's make stuff that, you know, uh,

1582
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,760
is telling the stories. And so that's what
we're doing. And I said, you know, look,

1583
01:33:17,761 --> 01:33:19,830
if,
if it's vice who's doing it,

1584
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:24,860
then we're really in fucking trouble
because I didn't come up with any sort of

1585
01:33:24,901 --> 01:33:25,734
save the World Cup.

1586
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:28,380
Yeah. But you're not compromised
yet. And as a human being,

1587
01:33:28,381 --> 01:33:30,240
when you gotten to the point
where you see this information,

1588
01:33:30,241 --> 01:33:31,110
you're not compromised.

1589
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:34,740
So you're releasing it and you're focusing
on it and you have an honest died for

1590
01:33:34,741 --> 01:33:35,130
what?

1591
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:37,620
Well, it's also when we went around
the world and expanded the company,

1592
01:33:37,621 --> 01:33:39,990
you just see all this shit happening
and you're like, what the fuck?

1593
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:43,840
Why isn't anybody fucking
saying this shit? And then,
but, but I always say that,

1594
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:45,330
look, if we're, if we're a new source,

1595
01:33:45,331 --> 01:33:49,380
then it's the world's in trouble because
we were a style mag, you know, we all,

1596
01:33:49,381 --> 01:33:52,970
we gave a shit about what's fucking, you
know, famously say, you know, cocaine,

1597
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,080
supermodels,
rare denim and sneakers.

1598
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:58,680
And then when you go around the rest of
the world, you're like, holy fucking shit.

1599
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:01,710
And you sort of, you know, come
out of the pond and go, okay,

1600
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:02,550
well we gotta do something.

1601
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:07,750
Well, I think that's probably, they're
here to get you. You got enough. I think,

1602
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:14,160
you know, the only way journalists ever
become journalists in the first place,

1603
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:17,550
they feel they have something that
they feel needs to be sad, right?

1604
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,070
They have this desire to,
to send a message.

1605
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:22,380
And that comes from seeing
things that are wrong.

1606
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,450
Seeing things that need to be reported
on, things that you know, and,

1607
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:27,810
and it turned you into a journalist.
I mean,

1608
01:34:27,811 --> 01:34:30,840
essentially the reality of
the world turned you into
a journalist and you're the

1609
01:34:30,841 --> 01:34:35,460
perfect example of what a journal is
should be because you're not compromised

1610
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:38,460
because you can do these stories
and you can, you can, I mean,

1611
01:34:38,461 --> 01:34:42,090
if you had someone overseeing you,
someone from NBC or CBS, do you,

1612
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:43,980
what do you think you could've
gotten any of this stuff done?

1613
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:45,813
Well,

1614
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,390
if you said to them,
Hey,

1615
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:50,780
I'm going to go to Pakistan and I'm gonna
meet with the Taliban, I don't think,

1616
01:34:50,781 --> 01:34:52,450
yeah, we wouldn't be allowed to, to do

1617
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:54,310
a lot of this stuff that
we do because we just,

1618
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:58,190
we just go in and get permits.
You guys just go,

1619
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,890
don't generally don't get permits.
You asked for the people,

1620
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:02,750
if you could put them in
a movie on television,

1621
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:06,490
the people that they sign anything,
they signed things.

1622
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,170
But people generally want
to tell their stories.

1623
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:11,920
But I mean ask government permission
or police permission or all you know,

1624
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:14,890
the things you're supposed to or also,
um,

1625
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:20,180
you're generally supposed
to go with security teams
and we're like what do I did

1626
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:24,210
a security team wants, cause we
were doing a show with MTV and um,

1627
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:28,800
they made us get one in Beirut and I'd
been to Beirut like 20 times if they were,

1628
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:32,770
it's not that bad sometimes and
parts of it are bad, but, and,

1629
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,910
and we were walking target cause you
just have all these dudes like talking.

1630
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:40,880
And so I said I'm never going to have
security ever again because that's the

1631
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:43,400
sure way that you're not going to get a
story or the real people aren't going to

1632
01:35:43,401 --> 01:35:46,520
talk to you or everyone's going to
think what, who are the fuck these guys?

1633
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:49,950
So we go and you just, you just,
we call it immersion as them,

1634
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:54,270
you just go immerse yourself,
you know, in, in, in the
place. And then just, you know,

1635
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:55,183
press record,

1636
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:59,330
don't go in with any sort of preconceived
ideas or notions or political

1637
01:35:59,331 --> 01:36:02,240
paradigms or I'm going to
prove this because generally
you're not going to prove

1638
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,750
that. Like for example, if
you went to Somalia and said,

1639
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:09,400
I'm going to prove that these guys
are barbarians pirates and you know,

1640
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:12,590
then you're going to shut yourself off
to exactly what you said, which is,

1641
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:16,640
well actually we illegally irradiated
their whole coast and illegally over

1642
01:36:16,641 --> 01:36:19,130
fished it so that there are
starving and they're like, well,

1643
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:22,190
we're going to tax the,
the people who did this to it.

1644
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,430
Yeah.
They're called the people's coast guard.

1645
01:36:24,431 --> 01:36:27,760
That with voluntary coast guard of
Somalia, they call themselves. Yeah.

1646
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:32,470
What the fuck man, dude, if anybody
knows how to fix this, it's, you know,

1647
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:35,380
you see it all. I think
it's the Internet. Yeah.

1648
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:38,320
Well he's the only hope we have the
Internet and technology. The technology,

1649
01:36:38,321 --> 01:36:40,780
like what you were saying about pulling
carbon out of the atmosphere and

1650
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:45,220
cleaning the air and reusing the fuel
they're using. That makes sense. I mean,

1651
01:36:45,221 --> 01:36:48,220
if technology can put it out
there, it seems like, you know,

1652
01:36:48,221 --> 01:36:51,780
we should be able to harvest it. Maybe
not now, maybe a hundred years from now,

1653
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,530
whenever the fuck it
actually becomes viable.

1654
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:57,320
Well, somebody asked me at Internet week,
the guy said, well, what if I'm not angry?

1655
01:36:57,321 --> 01:36:58,740
You know,
I'm whatever,

1656
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,620
22 and I'm not angry and I want
to go get an Mba and make money.

1657
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:05,210
And I said, great. You know,

1658
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:09,920
I think that that there was the sort
of our grandparent's generation that,

1659
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:15,110
that, you know, were, they
didn't know better. So they
were like, oh, space, age, food,

1660
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:18,590
you know,
the TV dinners and produce all the food.

1661
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:21,950
Let's make it all with computers
or whatever. Not Assembly lines.

1662
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:25,780
And so it started to be bad for us,
you know, and started to, you know,

1663
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:29,510
all these things, Agent Orange, let's,
you know, do all these terrible things.

1664
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:33,920
But they didn't know any better.
The technology was sort of their savior.

1665
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:37,060
But the baby boomers,
you know,

1666
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:39,950
they were the first generation that
knew better but still became the largest

1667
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:42,710
energy consumers, the largest
garbage producers, all this thing.

1668
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,440
Gen X has sort of slipped by.
But guess what,

1669
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:49,670
the bills here and it's going to be Gen
y like they have to pay. There is no,

1670
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,340
there is no get out of jail free card now.

1671
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:57,760
So as you're seeing economically and
socially and culturally and politically

1672
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:03,210
that we're shifting and if you,
if you just want to sort of say,

1673
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:06,570
I'm going to stick my head in the sand,
which we've done for a little while,

1674
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,640
I don't think you're going
to be able to anymore.

1675
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,690
I agree with you. And I agree that
with that things are shifting.

1676
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:15,110
And I also think that that's why these,
uh,

1677
01:38:15,111 --> 01:38:19,110
attacks on the constitution had been
permitted in and are being pushed through.

1678
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:20,370
I think they've,
uh,

1679
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,850
they've seen the prognosis and they've
seen the future and the future is the

1680
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:25,030
trends that we see on the Internet.

1681
01:38:25,031 --> 01:38:28,020
And it's a trend towards a more
libertarian line of thinking.

1682
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:32,340
It's a trend towards a smaller government,
more accountability, less bureaucracy.

1683
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:36,390
The idea of creating jobs doesn't mean
you create some new fucking laws that

1684
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:39,300
you'd have to saddle everybody with and
a bunch of people to enforce those laws.

1685
01:38:39,301 --> 01:38:39,960
And that's what they,

1686
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,370
a lot of these politicians like to think
of as creating jobs. You know, it's not,

1687
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:44,580
gee,

1688
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:48,360
you're creating problems
and you constantly keep
attacking the constitution and

1689
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:50,390
pulling amendments apart and,

1690
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:54,240
and really defacing the whole idea
what this country was founded on.

1691
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:57,930
They're doing it just because they
sensed the future and the future is not,

1692
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:00,900
it's not, it's not going to work
the way it works now. It's just not,

1693
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:03,750
we're not going to deal with this whole
idea of representative government and

1694
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:06,630
we're not going to deal with special
interest groups. That shit is nonsense.

1695
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,580
That's gotta go away.
Yeah.

1696
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:09,910
I think if you look at,

1697
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:14,770
at what's happening too is if
you look at Syria, for example,

1698
01:39:14,771 --> 01:39:19,350
if you look at, at what happened
in Egypt or, or Libya, you know,

1699
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:23,370
I spent a lot of time in those
countries just before the revolution.

1700
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:27,980
I got arrested and in Libya. And
then when I went back, you know,

1701
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:31,060
and I said it, you know, I would
have never called this, you know,

1702
01:39:31,061 --> 01:39:32,460
not a lot of people did.
I would've,

1703
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:37,360
I would've said the opposite because
it was so restrictive and it was so

1704
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:39,640
hardcore and everyone was so pro regime.

1705
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:43,540
But because of the Internet,
because of Twitter,

1706
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:45,730
because of Facebook
resolve these social tools,

1707
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:48,190
you had all these young people
able to communicate and say,

1708
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:51,370
actually I'm pissed off too. Oh you're,
oh, we're all fucking pissed off. Hey,

1709
01:39:51,371 --> 01:39:52,204
let's change.

1710
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:55,180
And I think that you know that that change
isn't going to be pretty in a lot of

1711
01:39:55,181 --> 01:39:56,680
cases and it's going to be problematic.

1712
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:00,040
But you do have young people who are
taking up arms and now you also have young

1713
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:03,130
people who were just smashing the shit
out of cities like they did in Paris and

1714
01:40:03,131 --> 01:40:07,750
especially in London last summer.
But you know what happens when,

1715
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:12,970
when you know,
occupy Wall Street becomes Egypt,

1716
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,830
you know,
to try to smash the status quo.

1717
01:40:14,831 --> 01:40:19,831
What happens when occupy Wall Street
becomes Syria or it becomes Olivia and you

1718
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:24,790
know, it's, it's not in the foreseeable
future maybe, but I couldn't,

1719
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:29,470
I didn't call Libya or Egypt or Syria
either. You know, there's a lot, a lot of,

1720
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:33,310
of, of unrest out there and there's a
lot of people communicating that unrest.

1721
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:38,380
And in fact, if you see that in America,
it's growing and that if I was, uh,

1722
01:40:38,381 --> 01:40:43,150
you know, campaigning this summer,
then I would be focusing on, oh,

1723
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:48,180
we have a huge fucking groundswell and
a global groundswell of dissatisfaction

1724
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:52,000
with the only group that's actually going
to get off their ass and do something

1725
01:40:52,001 --> 01:40:52,834
about it.

1726
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,280
You must have

1727
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:59,470
at least some emotional attachment to
Julian massage and the wikileaks case.

1728
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:05,460
Um, when you see this, uh, this case and
is Bradley Manning Kid this, this, uh,

1729
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:08,230
who's, I believe it's still in
solitary confinement. Yeah. Um,

1730
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,430
I don't even know if he, does he have
a court date? I mean, I dunno, but, uh,

1731
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:16,360
they just lock this kid in a box,
cut him off from humans until he's got,

1732
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,400
I'm sure he's completely
crazy at this point.

1733
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:21,910
I don't think you can not go crazy in
solitary confinement for five years. Yeah.

1734
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:25,750
Well it just shows that
conspiracy theorists aren't crazy.

1735
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:30,780
You're not crazy at all. The
majority of, of of these are,

1736
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:33,550
are, are proof that there are, you know,

1737
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:38,860
very sorted and unseemly
things going on every day.

1738
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,790
100%. And the, the information that that
guy released alone makes him a hero.

1739
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:45,370
That guy release things
that are anti American.

1740
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:48,460
He released things that are their
war crimes. He saw war crimes.

1741
01:41:48,461 --> 01:41:51,370
We're not war criminals or
Americas where American,

1742
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:56,140
this is how I'm most proud Americans
feel we're American and we're not cunt.

1743
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:58,720
That's it. We don't take any
bullshit, but we're not cuts that,

1744
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:03,930
that's when you get a guy who feels that
and he's an American and he's a soldier

1745
01:42:04,421 --> 01:42:07,290
and he wants to, you know,
look, he's a voluntary soldier,

1746
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:10,450
signed up to represent this government
and he sees his government doing horrible

1747
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:12,370
shit that's not being reported.
It's being covered up.

1748
01:42:12,371 --> 01:42:15,760
Covering shit up when you do crimes
is not how crimes get resolved.

1749
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:19,280
What's it not?
When did tell him the truth and and um,

1750
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:22,330
keeping governments and big business
and check become anti America.

1751
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:26,470
The guy's a goddamn patriot patriot
and he's locked in a box and then Julia

1752
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:29,560
Sanje gets in trouble. This wiki
leaks thing is so fascinating, man.

1753
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:33,070
People were accusing me of getting my
information wrong, but no, he's in jail.

1754
01:42:33,071 --> 01:42:37,780
He's not even accused of rape. He's
accused of having sex without a condom.

1755
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:40,500
I wasn't lying. He apparently, you know,

1756
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:43,320
they were sleeping together and he
stuck it in this chick. I don't know.

1757
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,680
I don't know the fucking full story,

1758
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:48,550
but the bottom line is that's why
they're trying to export this guy.

1759
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,930
Like if that's not the craziest thing,

1760
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:54,010
you were going to regulate
voluntary sexual, it'd be
two people are naked in bed.

1761
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:55,300
We're going to decide what didn't,

1762
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:58,660
didn't happen between a guy and a girl
and you're going to spend that much

1763
01:42:58,661 --> 01:43:02,230
fucking money to monitor this guy and
make sure he checks in constantly.

1764
01:43:02,231 --> 01:43:06,040
And this is what he's put videos
online of his, his daily routine.

1765
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,140
He has to drive to the police station
and check in before he can do things. He,

1766
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,620
it's under house arrest.
The whole thing is madness.

1767
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:17,310
Well the thing is is the fact that they
keep going on on the story and saying,

1768
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:18,821
yeah,

1769
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:23,320
we don't want them for actually blowing
the whistle on every crime that's been

1770
01:43:23,321 --> 01:43:27,360
going on in the government. We want
them for this sort of weird, you know,

1771
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,490
quasi thing that happened in Sweden
that wouldn't be considered anything

1772
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:31,140
anywhere else.

1773
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:35,130
Well yeah. What did I think someone
described it as surprise sex.

1774
01:43:35,131 --> 01:43:36,870
Like that's not it.
It's not even rape.

1775
01:43:36,871 --> 01:43:41,871
Technically it's like they had had
consensual sex with a condom and then they

1776
01:43:42,811 --> 01:43:45,900
were lying in bed. I don't
know. The fuck really happened,

1777
01:43:45,901 --> 01:43:48,180
so I shouldn't even be saying this,
but the idea that they're,

1778
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:52,190
they're wasting so much resource on a
sexual issue, that's even a violent one.

1779
01:43:52,191 --> 01:43:53,024
Not even rape,

1780
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:57,210
but it's kind of smart actually because
it's, for example, it's, you know,

1781
01:43:57,450 --> 01:43:59,610
it's the one thing that you,
you know, you can't say,

1782
01:43:59,611 --> 01:44:02,670
well they just drummed it up and it's
bullshit. And another, because yeah,

1783
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:06,960
well rape is very serious. It's the
worst of the worst. So you're in,

1784
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,360
you're in a catch 22 of saying,

1785
01:44:09,361 --> 01:44:12,720
well they just drummed it up to get
this guy for blowing the whistle.

1786
01:44:12,721 --> 01:44:16,050
But yet at the same time they drummed up
the one thing that you're sort of taboo

1787
01:44:16,051 --> 01:44:16,630
to go again.

1788
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:18,940
It's the number one thing.
Yeah. And, but they didn't,

1789
01:44:18,941 --> 01:44:22,810
they couldn't even get a good version
of it. I mean, no, the story is so weak.

1790
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:23,891
If it was,
you know,

1791
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:27,220
he roof her and he did this and he tied
her up and took pictures and we have the

1792
01:44:27,221 --> 01:44:30,940
pictures. Oh well the guy's obviously a
con that released important information.

1793
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:35,250
But I think the sad thing about
it is that you look at, you know,

1794
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,890
deep throat, you know, who you know,

1795
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,920
just announced to he was and all this
stuff and he did it just to save the

1796
01:44:40,921 --> 01:44:44,910
government. And all that stuff.
He's a hero. Right? Right. And, and

1797
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:49,100
well, it depends on who won.
You know, Bradley Manning
could come out to be a hero.

1798
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:52,540
Julian Assange's can come out to be a
hero if there was some crazy revolution in

1799
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,271
the future.
You know,

1800
01:44:53,271 --> 01:44:56,180
we realize that this is where the
turning point of American society,

1801
01:44:56,181 --> 01:44:57,980
when they said, we're not going
to take this bullshit anymore.

1802
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,670
When they watch that collateral
murder video and realize who do,

1803
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:03,960
what are we doing to our children? We're
forcing them to even think like that.

1804
01:45:03,961 --> 01:45:05,810
So this is it.
This is acceptable.

1805
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,960
This is if this one shot at life and
this is how you're going to spend some of

1806
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:11,990
your time shooting missiles down and
innocent people wandering through the

1807
01:45:11,991 --> 01:45:12,700
street.

1808
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:14,100
Well,
what my question is,

1809
01:45:14,101 --> 01:45:19,030
when did it change from
journalism and the fourth estate?

1810
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:24,150
It's job being to make sure that
politicians weren't lying to make sure the

1811
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:28,680
corporations weren't doing these bad
things and want to gate changed it. Right.

1812
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:29,311
Well,

1813
01:45:29,311 --> 01:45:34,311
I think actually distribution I think
changes it because for companies run all

1814
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:39,750
news media and they're all major
global corporations at all have huge

1815
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:44,220
advertising. And so they're conflicted
and they don't go after politicians.

1816
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:48,450
And I remember during the the Iraq war,
you know,

1817
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:51,420
people knew that there were, you
know, that this was all a construct.

1818
01:45:51,421 --> 01:45:54,090
They knew that there weren't
more weapons of mass destruction.

1819
01:45:54,091 --> 01:45:56,220
They knew that everyone was used to joke.

1820
01:45:56,221 --> 01:45:58,590
I used to hang out with other
journalists and they'd say, of course,

1821
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:02,540
I mean alcaide is, is the
opposite of, of the bath party.

1822
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:03,950
How far do you take that?

1823
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:08,980
How far do you take the
whole idea of conspiracy?

1824
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:14,100
I Dunno if it's, it's, it's,
it's certainly a conspiracy
I think. Yeah, for sure.

1825
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:19,060
But that's been admitted to now.
And, and I think that the, the, the,

1826
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:24,740
because of nine 11 the Prescott co-opted
and it became an American to say

1827
01:46:25,471 --> 01:46:28,290
anything bad about the
government or the military.

1828
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,120
And I think that that is,
that is,

1829
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:37,830
was one of the sort of turning points,
a, because that's bullshit. And B,

1830
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:41,370
because young people got
completely disenfranchised
by the news media because we

1831
01:46:41,371 --> 01:46:45,750
saw it all happens. You say, wait
a minute, this doesn't sound right.

1832
01:46:45,751 --> 01:46:48,180
And then afterwards they're like, yeah,
there was no weapons of mass destruction.

1833
01:46:48,181 --> 01:46:52,440
Yeah, there was no car of here. And
you're like, well, but we knew that,

1834
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:54,130
but we kept saying it.

1835
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:59,180
The news media became part of a government
propaganda program and everybody just

1836
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:00,451
went along with it.

1837
01:47:00,451 --> 01:47:04,960
And that's fucking scary because no
matter who's in government, you know,

1838
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:09,090
if they can just put together a
propaganda, how is that different than,

1839
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:12,570
you know, than Nazi Germany?
How is it that different than,

1840
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:17,520
than any of these totalitarian
regimes where they say,
yes, you know, uh, you know,

1841
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:21,000
Camille Song is God or whatever.
Like how is that any different?

1842
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:23,190
Because you can use the
fourth estate as you. Yeah.

1843
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:26,150
Pr Agency. Well, there was, we,

1844
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:29,980
CIA released some sort of a state and
right after the war with Iraq and started

1845
01:47:29,981 --> 01:47:33,250
that, they were going to start releasing
fake stories to throw off the enemy.

1846
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:36,630
And once, once he admitted to doing
something like that, that's it.

1847
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:38,890
Incredibly slippery ground.

1848
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:43,420
Like that's the only way to defeat the
enemy as you have to put out fake stories

1849
01:47:43,421 --> 01:47:46,150
and lie to everyone and we're
supposed to give you that power.

1850
01:47:46,151 --> 01:47:49,270
Like what kind of checks and balances
are in place before that stuff gets

1851
01:47:49,271 --> 01:47:52,570
distributed? What do you know
what the fuck is going on here?

1852
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:56,200
Well it's also, you know, Memorial Day
and you said it exactly right is that,

1853
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:00,580
you know, what are we
doing sending, you know,

1854
01:48:00,581 --> 01:48:03,130
going in with what's our
mission to go into Afghanistan,

1855
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:06,880
what's our mission and what we haven't
mentioned? Okay, that Taliban, Taliban,

1856
01:48:06,881 --> 01:48:10,600
Taliban, okay, now we're letting the
Taliban in because well we've lost.

1857
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:14,950
We're saying, okay, well we have to have
power sharing with them. And so you say,

1858
01:48:14,951 --> 01:48:18,700
well everybody knows it's going to go
right back to civil war. So you're like,

1859
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:22,570
well why did we come here? Why did
we do all this? Like what the fuck?

1860
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:27,380
So you don't think that it's some sort
of a grand conspiracy to extract minerals

1861
01:48:27,381 --> 01:48:27,981
and all that stuff.

1862
01:48:27,981 --> 01:48:32,150
You think it's much more of a cluster
fuck shit decision by government and then

1863
01:48:32,151 --> 01:48:35,900
being in place because of momentum and
because of the fact there's contractors

1864
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:37,430
and they all want to keep getting paid.

1865
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:41,410
Resource Wealth for sure. And it was
the, it was the story that, you know,

1866
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:43,840
we broke in Sudan that time,
you know,

1867
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:47,950
Darra for as oil and resource wealth.
You know, we did it in the Congo,

1868
01:48:47,951 --> 01:48:49,750
we've done it in a lot of
stories all over the place.

1869
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:54,550
I wouldn't say I would say they got
caught in the quagmire of Afghanistan,

1870
01:48:54,551 --> 01:48:56,380
much like the Soviets did.
They went in there,

1871
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,380
they were trying to do something and
they just got sucked in and then it got

1872
01:48:59,381 --> 01:49:03,210
worse and worse and worse and
worse and worse and look it guts.

1873
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,900
It's so bad on every level.

1874
01:49:04,901 --> 01:49:08,140
I mean America is in there trying to
fight this war on drugs, war on drugs,

1875
01:49:08,141 --> 01:49:09,880
war on drugs.
They've been in there 12 years.

1876
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:14,350
There's never been more heroin for
cheaper or higher quality ever. In fact,

1877
01:49:14,351 --> 01:49:16,780
it's so good that they put the
golden triangle out of business.

1878
01:49:16,781 --> 01:49:18,220
It's all coming from Afghanistan.

1879
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:21,790
And so America is the biggest drug
dealer in the world because we're just

1880
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:24,520
sitting there running this country
that just ships out all the heroin

1881
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,300
in the world. How much of a
piece does the CIA have of that?

1882
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:31,110
Who knows? I would say
that, you know, look at,

1883
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:35,270
it's been documented that they
were part of the original, uh,

1884
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:39,600
outflux into America from Vietnam
during the Vietnam War. Um,

1885
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:44,170
as a way to keep urban populations
sort of at bay. Um, that's,

1886
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,730
that was like a real social experiment.

1887
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:50,740
They would bring heroin into the
ghetto to real. That's, that's,

1888
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,670
that's well documented. Yeah. But is
it well documented the intentions?

1889
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:59,500
Yeah, because there was civil unrest
in the major urban center, so they,

1890
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:04,060
they allowed heroin to go in because
it took away all sort of, well,

1891
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:07,870
everything comes up. Heroin
Addiction. So I mean,

1892
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:10,450
if it's been a part of
their policy in the past,

1893
01:50:10,451 --> 01:50:12,970
obviously they're going to be
incredibly sensitive to it.

1894
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:18,360
But I don't think that you can say that
they're not involved or at least the

1895
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,820
State Department is not
involved because the, uh,

1896
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,390
statistics speak for themselves.
There's two times more

1897
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:30,070
by a factor of two,
so 100% more heroin addiction.

1898
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:35,290
Heroin addicts in America since the start
of the Afghani war and heroin's never

1899
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:35,771
been cheaper.

1900
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:40,270
It's never been better quality and
we've been running it so like it's,

1901
01:50:40,271 --> 01:50:42,910
it's just flooding out to destroy the,
you know Russia is now,

1902
01:50:42,911 --> 01:50:46,270
I've got 7% in Pakistan,
which is a Muslim country.

1903
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:50,740
Extremist Muslim country has something
like 12% in, in Karachi anyway,

1904
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:53,290
a heroin addiction and it's just,

1905
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:56,530
it's flooding out of
Afghanistan and that's we,

1906
01:50:56,531 --> 01:50:58,690
we have gone in and taken all
the fields that we didn't,

1907
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:02,860
well not only did we not take the
fields now we guarded them. Syria. Yeah,

1908
01:51:02,861 --> 01:51:03,460
definitely.

1909
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:08,260
Most people want to come up with some
sort of crazy explanation or excuse for

1910
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:09,940
why they did that.
It's because

1911
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:13,140
fear that they're going to, it's the
only way they're really making money.

1912
01:51:13,141 --> 01:51:17,700
They're making money two ways, which is
the American government and, and heroin.

1913
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:21,450
And so they're like, well if we really,
if we take away the heroin production,

1914
01:51:21,451 --> 01:51:22,680
then they're really going to hate us.

1915
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:26,140
Do they, does any of that stuff make
its way in pharmaceutical grade? Uh,

1916
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,710
opiates like oxycodone,
things along those lines.

1917
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,690
Zero knows.
I don't know.

1918
01:51:29,691 --> 01:51:33,650
I all I know is like every time
we do a story on the heroin, uh,

1919
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:37,340
situation in Afghanistan is fucking
shocking because you're just like the

1920
01:51:37,341 --> 01:51:39,220
Americans let them and there's actually,
you know,

1921
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,300
pictures of American troops guarding poppy

1922
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:42,420
to this is

1923
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:46,880
the war on drugs sort
of except over there,

1924
01:51:46,881 --> 01:51:50,330
over there were a war
against the war on drugs.

1925
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,620
Do you see the war on
drugs in Afghanistan?

1926
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:57,490
And then you see the war on drugs
in Mexico. You're like, wow.

1927
01:51:57,580 --> 01:51:59,980
Well it's completely corrupt
from start to finish.

1928
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:02,470
There is this war on drugs is completely,

1929
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:06,720
what's the craziest slippery war ever
when you use the war on drugs and then you

1930
01:52:06,721 --> 01:52:11,400
have armed fold soldiers, gardening,
hobby fields, what side are you on?

1931
01:52:11,630 --> 01:52:14,850
And this war on drugs, cause it seems
like you're on the pro drug side,

1932
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:17,040
you're guarding the drugs.
Like,

1933
01:52:17,041 --> 01:52:18,900
how could you have a war on
drugs when you're carting,

1934
01:52:18,901 --> 01:52:23,901
they dry and you're sending
all the weapons to Mexico
and they need and all the

1935
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:26,940
money and you don't
even go to jail for it.

1936
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,910
And 90 what was the amount? 90% plus
of the heroin comes out of Afghanistan.

1937
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:35,040
And what did you say about how much would,

1938
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:38,550
how much is the percentage of an increase?
Since we have occupied

1939
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:43,510
just in America it's doubled, but
that's just in America. But in, in,

1940
01:52:43,511 --> 01:52:46,730
in Russia it's gone through the roof.
It's the doubled in UK,

1941
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:50,360
but Russia and Pakistan in the
Middle East, countries like Iran,

1942
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:54,770
everywhere on the path has just
heroin addictions or has soared.

1943
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,340
In fact, heroin addiction
is so huge. And Russia,

1944
01:52:58,370 --> 01:52:59,730
did you see the thing we did on Crockett

1945
01:53:01,890 --> 01:53:03,090
fuck man

1946
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:05,900
to,
to heroin,

1947
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:10,030
that if they then when they can't get it
or because it got expensive now because

1948
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:14,930
so many people are buying it that they
make their own synthetic heroin and uh,

1949
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,320
and it's called Krokodil because it makes
you look like a crocodile because it

1950
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:19,820
makes your skin like scales.

1951
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:22,340
And then the scales fall off and
you just have like bone there.

1952
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:24,550
It's insane.
If you haven't seen it,

1953
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:28,090
if you haven't seen the images
online of people that are addicted,

1954
01:53:28,091 --> 01:53:31,840
that have that, it's incredible. It's
so frightening. It's frightening.

1955
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,330
It's so frightening that people
would do that to themselves.

1956
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:39,420
Literally shoot drugs that make
my skin rot and fall off the bone.

1957
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:41,770
He's not exaggerating.
There's like people with big,

1958
01:53:41,771 --> 01:53:45,060
their arms have like big gaping.
See the bone,

1959
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:49,050
you see the bone and they can walk
around. They're not even infected. Well,

1960
01:53:49,051 --> 01:53:52,260
some of it, yeah, some of them get
infected. It was weird. It looked like,

1961
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,550
like it was burnt off,

1962
01:53:53,551 --> 01:53:58,290
like it was like fused kills all
the flesh and it falls off Christ.

1963
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,920
That's insane. And what happens
then? They just die. I mean,

1964
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:04,290
you can't just have your bones
just exposed like that. Right.

1965
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,940
Does it ever fill up if you quit?

1966
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,210
No. I don't know the answer. Does
anybody ever get off that shit? It's,

1967
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,750
it's even more addictive than heroin.
So

1968
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:20,050
that you guys had that shit about the
Colombian drug that you're blowing

1969
01:54:20,051 --> 01:54:23,810
people's faces. Yeah. That is
terrifying. Whether the free freaky

1970
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:26,780
thing about Skubala mean is you don't
believe it's true until you see it.

1971
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:30,490
Because the stories are, it's
the Zombie drug, right? And it's,

1972
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:32,860
we heard stories of,
you know,

1973
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:36,950
people coming into their apartments on
the security cameras and like clearing

1974
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:40,490
out their whole apartments and you'd
see them on security cams doing it,

1975
01:54:40,491 --> 01:54:44,830
you know, and, and they don't have any
recollection. They wake up in the morning,

1976
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,850
their bank accounts are
drained, et Cetera, et cetera.

1977
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:50,930
And they couldn't figure it
out until they, the FARC,

1978
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:54,650
the guys who were Colombians
who are making a cocaine,

1979
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:59,651
we're using the same process to refine
born Dango flowers to makes cupola mean.

1980
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,000
And what was happening with generally,

1981
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:06,140
it started out as hookers and hookers
would put a condom inside their mouth

1982
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:06,501
right there.

1983
01:55:06,501 --> 01:55:09,620
So we can go down and then they put a
little sick Apollo mean in their lips.

1984
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:14,000
And then when they go to like kiss you
whenever they go and they would spit

1985
01:55:14,230 --> 01:55:18,890
because Coppola Peter the, you inhale
it and then you think you go, Holy Shit,

1986
01:55:18,891 --> 01:55:19,551
that's scary.

1987
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:23,490
And then you go into this trance like
state and then it's auto suggestion.

1988
01:55:23,491 --> 01:55:26,480
So you, you say, okay, we're going
to go down to your apartment. Yes.

1989
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:29,120
And we're going to go to the apartment
and then we're going to clean out all

1990
01:55:29,121 --> 01:55:30,800
your shit and we're going to go
to your bank and we're going to,

1991
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:34,220
and they have security footage of them
going to the bank and signing shit.

1992
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:38,720
And it's not like one or two people. This
is like happens all the fuck. Oh my God.

1993
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:43,680
And so, uh, it's it, that's a
fucking terrifying drug. Terrifying.

1994
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:45,600
Cause you're just gone,

1995
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:49,230
you're in a sort of Zombie like narcotic
state and you just do what people tell

1996
01:55:49,231 --> 01:55:49,430
you to.

1997
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:54,210
That's the real ultimate date rape
drug. Yeah. That's the real shit.

1998
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:55,970
So we gotta make sure people
don't get ahold of that.

1999
01:55:55,971 --> 01:55:59,810
That's a life rate dating one
of those girls. Oh my God.

2000
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:02,900
Someone spit something in your mouth.
Either Zombie,

2001
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:05,570
those girls have to be on date ago.
There's no way you can date that guy.

2002
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:08,120
What a girl that would do
that to somebody. Like,

2003
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:11,710
if you knew that's what she did as a job
and then you ever got in a fight with,

2004
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:14,270
I get all these tricks.
She was a hooker. I know.

2005
01:56:14,271 --> 01:56:18,770
Imagine dating one of those hooker girls.
That's just me.

2006
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:23,980
I'm silly though. Especially ones that
take over your brains. Absolutely.

2007
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:26,570
Shit like that.
Why would that exist?

2008
01:56:26,571 --> 01:56:31,160
Why would there be something that allows
you to be turned into a fucking Zombie

2009
01:56:31,161 --> 01:56:33,440
to someone else's suggestions like that?
You know,

2010
01:56:33,441 --> 01:56:35,870
when you see the different
things in nature,

2011
01:56:35,871 --> 01:56:39,410
like different parasites to
control different organisms
and make them do fucked

2012
01:56:39,411 --> 01:56:42,500
up things. And it really is kind of
bizarre when you stop and think about it.

2013
01:56:42,501 --> 01:56:43,880
I'm like,
what kind of a system?

2014
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:47,330
What kind of a world that we
live in where there's like,

2015
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:51,800
there's that land around a plant plant
that grows and if he gets into your body,

2016
01:56:51,801 --> 01:56:54,140
people just already around you don't have,
that's crazy.

2017
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:58,520
You become a fucking robot. You become
an automated little slave for them.

2018
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,250
Drugs or drugs are crazy.
We just did a story on,

2019
01:57:01,310 --> 01:57:04,660
you probably know a lot more about it
than I do, but uh, I have a game of yeah.

2020
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:10,250
And we were doing a story
on the underground heroin
clinics where, you know,

2021
01:57:10,251 --> 01:57:11,570
people,
uh,

2022
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:16,990
like it's actually started by a lot of
ex junkies who were like 40 year junkies.

2023
01:57:17,031 --> 01:57:18,420
I couldn't get off, tried, you know,

2024
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:20,060
hundreds of times to get
cleaned and they would do,

2025
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:24,320
I have a game and then it
interrupts your addiction, you know,

2026
01:57:24,321 --> 01:57:27,160
for like two weeks or whatever. So it's
long enough that you sort of get a,

2027
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:29,780
you know, you don't have
to go cold Turkey. And uh,

2028
01:57:29,781 --> 01:57:32,420
so we went to these clinics where
they administer, I began and stuff.

2029
01:57:32,421 --> 01:57:36,410
It was fucking fascinating. It
was crazy. Did you do it? No,

2030
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,710
because I saw them do
it and it's, they, they,

2031
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:44,630
they were taking massive doses so
they were there taking like 48 hours.

2032
01:57:44,950 --> 01:57:46,880
Lots of vomiting like

2033
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:47,761
crazy.

2034
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:50,450
If I have a couple of friends that have
done in one that did it recently in one

2035
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:52,700
that it changed his whole life.
I have a buddy of mine,

2036
01:57:52,701 --> 01:57:56,830
he got his back on injured, got
hooked on pain pills, right. Pain,

2037
01:57:57,170 --> 01:58:00,370
pain pills started, uh, taking,
you know, the Nate, you name him.

2038
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:03,500
He was taking them and he couldn't get
off them. How's it was ruining his life.

2039
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:06,200
Goes Down, gets an IB game,
boom. Clean hundred percent.

2040
01:58:06,201 --> 01:58:09,380
Now brings people down there,
started his own center down there,

2041
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:13,070
brings people down there to uh,
to introduce them to Mexico.

2042
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:17,000
But I'm like a fucking Mexico man.
Mexico. Scary as fuck. Well, they,

2043
01:58:17,001 --> 01:58:20,030
it's because it's still legal there. It's
illegal here. It's a schedule one drug.

2044
01:58:20,031 --> 01:58:23,360
Just like heroin. Well, everything in
Mexico is decriminalized now. Right?

2045
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,110
They di Di. Most people don't know.
They didn't, they decriminalized acid,

2046
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:32,110
mushrooms, pot coke, everything to
fight the cartels. Correct. Exactly.

2047
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:37,960
But yeah, I have a game that's the, yeah,
that's the strongest drug I've ever seen.

2048
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:42,250
Like, because people under it, we're like,
holy fuck. Yeah, my business partner.

2049
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,400
Did it change his life? Well,
he's just done a couple of times.

2050
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:47,950
He's done a couple of different
things, right? It changes lives. Done.

2051
01:58:47,951 --> 01:58:50,360
Iowasca know I began,

2052
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:53,860
he's really into going to these
weird places and going on big trips.

2053
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:55,060
But the Ibogaine is,

2054
01:58:55,061 --> 01:59:00,061
is interesting cause we follow some junky
straight through the whole process and

2055
01:59:00,361 --> 01:59:04,120
it was pretty remarkable because
it work. Like, yeah, it's nuts.

2056
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,170
Yeah. Um, oh, I'll bring my friend
who's done it. He, uh, you know,

2057
01:59:09,171 --> 01:59:12,020
he described the process and I
didn't want to do it even slightly.

2058
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:15,620
It sounded like hell yeah.
Like, you know, you can,

2059
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:20,180
you can talk me into doing some DMT.
Maybe it's 15 minutes and I'll send you

2060
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:24,710
the piece. There's so much vomiting.
It's fucking crazy. Days of vomiting

2061
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:25,830
that cannot be good for you.
Well,

2062
01:59:25,831 --> 01:59:29,070
you gotta think don't matter if
someone's hooked on heroin, anything,

2063
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:30,990
they'll take anything
to get them out of that.

2064
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:34,630
I've watched people slip into addiction
several times in my life and it's,

2065
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:38,880
it's just like being turned by a vampire.
It really is.

2066
01:59:38,881 --> 01:59:41,970
It's a feeling that you've lost
someone there. They're slipping away,

2067
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:45,510
they're slipping away from themselves,
from their family, from everybody.

2068
01:59:45,511 --> 01:59:49,140
They're slipping away because of a
compound, some sort of a chemical.

2069
01:59:49,141 --> 01:59:54,090
It's really what a bizarre thing that we
have. This, this, this addiction quality,

2070
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,103
you know,
always say something.

2071
01:59:55,330 --> 02:00:00,330
The piece we say that this mother gives
her son to these sort of New York fruit

2072
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:05,740
cakes. Nice guys. But like weird guys
who do sort of west African Voodoo,

2073
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:08,710
uh, you know, when they,

2074
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:11,890
when they administer the Ibogaine and
we were taking your son to Mexico,

2075
02:00:11,891 --> 02:00:14,230
to one of these clinics because we
couldn't legally do it in America.

2076
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,590
So he brought the whole crew down to
Mexico to shoot it. And it was like,

2077
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:22,591
how bad is heroin that a mother
is going to give her son to these,

2078

2081
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:34,570

for two days. That's how bad heroin is.

Okay.
