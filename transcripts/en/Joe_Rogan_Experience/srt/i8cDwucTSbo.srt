1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,130
Hey fuckers,
what are you doing?

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,860
I am a right now in the middle of tweeting
this out is here. I mean she already,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,490
it's just David Show, right? You
don't have anything special? No.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,650
People with a crafty Twitter
names or real problem. Okay.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,280
Or the underscore. They just have to kill
that underscores shit. Like what's your,

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,470
here's her name will underscore

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,060
named David shows and being Korean is
like nature being named John Smith. Yeah.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,680
I went to school with three. David
chose. Yeah, I knew a few. David chose,

9
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,350
cause I grew up doing taekwondo
and there was a lot of,

10
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,370
David shows a lot of Korean kids and I'm
late. I'm late to the social media game.

11
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,300
So when I wanted Twitter at David show,
it was already, it was, I was fucked.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,130
So what is your Twitter? Well,
I mean they gave it to me also.

13
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,110
They kept it from somebody
yanked if some nuts.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,530
Someone like whenever there's
a new social media thing,

15
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:58,740
someone just grabs it and then I
get the email, hey, you want this?

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,180
You want to buy it off me? I'm like,
no, I'll just be David Choe one.

17
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:08,160
David chose 69 I got super
lucky with Twitter. I'm lucky.

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,920
There was like one dude who had got
the Joe Rogan one, but he wasn't used.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,860
Joe Rogan is sort of a
basic name too, right? Yeah.

20
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,800
There's a guy named Joe Rogan
that's a real estate agent. Right.

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,590
He's in a thing in Idaho, but
he owns Joe rogan.com. Right.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,800
And he wanted to sell it, but it's
a bit pricey. It's a very nice guy.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
He's got a legitimate claim to it. What
does he want for it? A lot of money.

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,900
Like $1 million. No, not that much money,
but enough that it was a lot. I forget.

25
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:34,900
I don't eat, I don't, you know,

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,440
I don't have a beef with the guy because
it's his website. It's his name. Right.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,200
The idea that it's mine more
than it is his is ridiculous.
Right. He owns it. He's,

28
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,370
he's Joe Rogan as well, you know,
that's his name. But uh, yeah, it's,

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,330
I'm sure it's confusing.
That was cool.

30
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:55,260
I was chose to on for a while and someone
at Twitter send me an email and said,

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,240
hey, do you want, I was like, yeah,
and fuck it. I'll take it easy.

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm blacklisted on Twitter. It used to
be so easy to get red ban on everything.

33
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,960
Now I can't get it on anything
and they still won't verify me.

34
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,150
And yet there's like a
million fake red bands.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,610
Like there's even fake red
selling fake ride band shirts.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,590
And what you said it used to be,

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,840
it used to be really easily get red
band on everything, like fuck whatever.

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,720
But now it's like everyone takes
my, my name, my fake name though.

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,050
And then Twitter,
there's like a million fake red banners,

40
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,570
even fake red band selling fake red
band shirts and Twitter won't verify me.

41
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:34,800
So it's just a hay day with my
record band name, but it's easy.

42
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:38,970
Which one is which one says red band,
which one has 100,000 fucking friends?

43
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,620
There's the real idiots. Like, well let's
this Twitter worse. Can I have that?

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,480
You got,
do you have to just accept that?

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
But I wonder why am I black listed it
on Twitter and on a whatever that other

46
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,390
shit. Wikipedia blacklist.
Yeah. He just don't accept you.

47
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,550
That means you're doing something right
to eat whatever it is is nice comp.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,980
If you were on any other show,

49
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,500
if you were on a television show and uh,

50
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,590
and you were like one of the guest
stars on the television show,

51
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,000
that would be listed in Wikipedia
most likely I would imagine.

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,140
I want me to one funniest Instagrammer
by La Weekly. That's not bad, man.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,750
I if you were on like one legit TV show,

54
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,450
like if you did like an episode
of standup on the tonight show,

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,740
if you did one thing then they'd probably
put you on Wiki. You could do that too.

56
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,720
You know, really
interesting. See you do Leno,

57
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,980
what material you could do on Leno and
what that experience of the last episode

58
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:36,220
of lender. That would be awesome cause
he'd be like, I don't care. And you just

59
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,360
freak those fucking people out. Talk
about fucking dolphins on the Leno show.

60
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,540
Yeah, I don't do that. Uh, anyway,

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,100
this episode of the podcast is brought
to neither by the Jay Leno show or for

62
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,060
any of the other David chose or
I need the other Joe Rogan's.

63
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,010
Much love to all of you people, uh,
were brought to you by stamps.com.

64
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,120
This episode is stamps.com is a,
uh,

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,250
an excellent resource for if
you have your own business.

66
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,540
Managing it out of your home was far
as like sending things out. If you,

67
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,630
if you're trying to sell things and sell
them over the internet and send them

68
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,320
yourself.

69
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,750
Most of the time when you have to do
is you have to go to the post office,

70
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,090
you have to wait in line and it's,

71
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,970
it's really annoying and they figured
out a way to make that much easier.

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,920
You can do it from your home.
You took it from you computer,

73
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:26,350
they give you a digital scale,
they tell you how to do it.

74
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,000
He printed up on your own printer,

75
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,240
you print up your postage and then the
postman comes and takes it away and

76
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:31,830
you're done.

77
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,830
You cut out so much of the bullshit
of going there and waiting in line and

78
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,520
dealing with someone who doesn't
want to weigh your dumb shit.

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,230
You could do it all yourself.

80
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,080
You get a free digital scale that
you should never use for illegal non

81
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,960
government sanctioned drugs.
If I say don't use it for that,

82
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,830
but if you want to find out what does a
beer way in the bottle and you weigh it,

83
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,200
that's legal beers,

84
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,210
illegal drug and so we support
that@stamps.com but don't be weighing your

85
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:05,350
mushrooms. He fucks you. Weirdos mean
something a little more accurate.

86
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,720
Something like really,
really accurate for that.

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,010
You don't want to be lying about
mushrooms. That could be some awful Karma.

88
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,260
If you were selling mushrooms and you're
under dosing people who I think about

89
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,210
dosing my parents all the time,
it's probably a good idea.

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
Don't do it through stamps.com though

91
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,130
it is a little old timey microphone
in the upper right hand corner.

92
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,400
If you click on it and
use the code word j. R.

93
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:34,660
E you get a no risk trial
plus $110 bonus offer,

94
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,610
including a digital scale, enough
to $55 for free postage. And,

95
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,660
uh,
we,

96
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,350
we have personal experience with this
company because that's exactly how Brian

97
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,280
sends out his t shirts, the t shirts
from desk squad.tv, which are all, uh,

98
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,630
Brian's original art.

99
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,320
He sends those out through stamps.com
it does it all through his office.

100
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:58,321
So it's super easy if a
knucklehead like Brian

101
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,970
can do it, you can too, right Brian?

102
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,450
All right.
Cold wars jre for the special offer.

103
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,490
We're also brought to you by onnit.com
that's, Oh, Anne and I t and I fucking,

104
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,720
I sound like a robot repeating
myself over and over again for this.

105
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,270
Um,
but there's no way around it.

106
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,690
We have some new primal bells in the
primal belts or the kettle bells that were

107
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,870
designed by an artist to
look like gorillas and
chimpanzees and now orangutans

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,060
and, uh, they're fucking
pat ass and they're fun to
work out with cause they're,

109
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,490
they're all like legit and balanced out,

110
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,790
but they're fun because they look like
something that might be fucking you up.

111
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:43,910
Like it's terrifying that Steven
Shubin Juniors, that dude who, uh,

112
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,110
did the artwork on it,
we did a bad ass job and they're a,

113
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:51,150
they're really well balanced too. That
was like super important. All there,

114
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:55,660
there are these strange shapes. We had
to make sure that we kept it balanced.

115
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,580
Uh, so that it doesn't change what,
what a kettle bell workout should be,

116
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,290
even though it looks cool.
It doesn't change it. Uh,

117
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,050
so check that out at [inaudible]
dot com along with all of my various

118
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:11,650
supplements,
including testosterone boosting t plus,

119
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,210
they would take a testosterone booster

120
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,780
plus it myself and ran across
the border from Tijuana to,

121
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,620
it was amazing. The police, the,
you want to police it and stop this.

122
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:29,110
And they looked at us and they're like,
what are you idiots doing?

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,750
They didn't even,
it was amazing.

124
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,830
That won't happen through t plus

125
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,820
David chose taking a
walk on the wild side.

126
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,910
He was hanging out at that place
that that church was running.

127
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:47,590
And then you remember from,
what was that movie with George Clooney?

128
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,760
The vampire movie.
Oh,

129
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:53,010
does till dusk till
dawn [inaudible] movies.

130
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,980
Harvey Keitel had a Korean son in
that movie. I was like, what the fuck?

131
00:07:56,981 --> 00:08:00,060
And it was almost like two
different movies. Yeah.

132
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,810
It was like there was this really intense
dramatic movie with the super violent

133
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:08,820
guy and his brother, right. It, who's
trying to keep everything under control.

134
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,590
It was two separate movies and then
all of a sudden it's this wild,

135
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,450
crazy monster movie that's really fun.

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,810
Quintin Tarantino is the baddest
motherfucker of all time,

137
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,220
but it comes to movies like that was
a Robert Rodriguez movie, right? Yeah,

138
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:25,560
but it was, it was amazing.
Yeah. Quentin Tarantino in that.

139
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,350
That's one of my favorite roles
of any actor ever plant ever.

140
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,220
He knows how to play that creepy
murderer dudes. So fucking good.

141
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,130
It's like bone chilling.
When you watch that,

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,300
like you really believe anybody who says
it, Quentin, Quentin Tarantino can't act.

143
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,210
You need to watch him in that movie.
If you give him the right role,

144
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,530
that mother fucker can act as ass
off those three movies. John. Man,

145
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:51,790
he fucking creeped me out
cause I know dudes like him.

146
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,430
She did. Yeah, there's dudes like
that that are they your path in life,

147
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,740
but I'm going to go out and get a snack
and you come back and they'd just a

148
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,080
murdered everybody in the room.

149
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,590
There's a dude that I used to train
when I was a kid. I was really young.

150
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,130
I was like 18 and 19 and he was a hitman.

151
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,990
He was a Hitman for, you know,
local gangsters, Irish gangsters.

152
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,540
Oh yeah.
And he wound up doing time.

153
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,400
He wound up getting caught for it and he
used to come to my taekwondo school and

154
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:24,000
he would just like straight ask you how
you would kill somebody if you're going

155
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,370
to kill somebody. I
keep me. And he wanted,

156
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,540
he had like a crude martial
arts background. Like it
was a very big powerful guy.

157
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,670
But this guy,
I knew something was up.

158
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,400
He would ask you how you would kill
someone or you would ask him what he's

159
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,350
learning how to fight.
I wanted to learn, oh,

160
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,360
he wanted to know how to kill someone.
They want to know,

161
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,690
like he would just flat out ask you
who would take the black belts and like

162
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,550
wouldn't, what would you do if
you're going to kill somebody,

163
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,350
how would you kill someone?
And like, and I was like, wow,

164
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:49,170
this guy's pretty intense. And
then we find out, you know,

165
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,310
years later he was a fucking Hitman,
you know? So you taught him how to kill?

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,540
Not really.

167
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,440
I mean he already knew how to kill people
and trust me or at least knew how to

168
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,200
fuck you up. Right. He was just a,

169
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,600
he wanted to tighten up
his martial arts technique,

170
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,590
but it was just interesting running into
a guy like that that you know is just

171
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,690
not playing by the rules.
We're all playing by,

172
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,550
we're playing by the be nice rules.

173
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,780
Most of us on this planet are playing
by the be nice roles. I want to friends,

174
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,020
I don't want anybody to hate me. You
want friends, you're a nice person.

175
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,200
When we run into people were just trying
to be nice to each other for the most

176
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,030
part, for the most part. I'm happy now.

177
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,730
And then you run into a dude
is not playing that game.

178
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,560
You could run into a crazy person.

179
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,180
I went on a hike today, it's three
o'clock right now. I was like, let's,

180
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,230
let's go on a hike. And uh, I go
hiking with critter. The guy out there,

181
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,050
I don't know how we got
onto this subject matter,

182
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,250
but while we're walking down the thing,
we got into an argument and he's like,

183
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:47,100
fuck you,
I can rape you if I want it to right now.

184
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,220
Jesus Christ. I was like, who said that
to critter? The guy sitting out though,

185
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,210
that's uncomfortable,

186
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,390
you know, and I go, what'd
you just say? He's like,

187
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,280
I could rape you right now
cause we're hiking. He's like,

188
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:02,000
I throw you in the bushes right now.
Rip Your Legs Open. I'll fuck them.

189
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,070
And critter.
He can beat the shit out of anybody.

190
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,930
I get that and not overpowering me.
Yes, he could overpower me. But like

191
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,810
that's a weird thing for him. It's a weird
thing to say to a friend and also we,

192
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:18,890
so then we got into it, you
know, of course. And I'm like,

193
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,600
okay,

194
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,930
if I went to prison or even if crude is
trying to rape me in the mountains right

195
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:27,200
now,
okay physically you get me down,

196
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,620
I'm fighting you. You hold my legs
down, you punching me in my face,

197
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:34,460
you ripped my pants down, now you've
overpowered me, I'm still fighting you.

198
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,340
Whatever.
But I was like,

199
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,900
it takes a special kind of guy.
There's a guy that will kill you.

200
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,760
There's a guy that will beat the shit
out of you. But like, like Joe's, Joseph,

201
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,360
you're a fighter and you could probably
beat the shit out of me, but you're like,

202
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,100
I want to re rape Dave Cho. You're
like, I want to. Could you like even get

203
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,830
your Dick hard to do that I don't think
are just, yeah, you think you could Brian,

204
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,880
Brian could just being excited about,
cause you know,

205
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,630
they do that in a guy alive
that he could rape because,

206
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,300
because you see it in prison movies,
you're like, we need to show, you know,

207
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,730
it's the most embarrassing, humiliating
thing you could do to a man. Hey,

208
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,900
we're supposed to start some music, but
let's not just keep talking. Keep talking.

209
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,880
Podcast has begun. Okay ana.com fuck
yourself, whatever. And I'm like,

210
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:24,340
uh,
what?

211
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,320
Like that takes this kind of guy that
you're talking about the Hitman Kinda guy.

212
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,210
Cause he's a little bit more than that.

213
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,120
It takes most likely someone who has
probably been molested themselves.

214
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,460
What are you going to like?
Okay,

215
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:40,180
so you're trying to ultimately beat
me physically and then humiliate me,

216
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,080
but then you still have to get your dick
hard to get it into my bottle, you know?

217
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,990
Yeah. It's an odd, odd
thing to be proud of.

218
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,140
I think if you're a man
and you're doing that,

219
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,980
there's a lot of those guys that have
probably been molested then probably been,

220
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,020
I mean they said that that's one of
the big factors for child molesting his

221
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,390
people who were molested
themselves. Right. As a child.

222
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,950
And I'm not saying that
that's CHOGM lasting, but
fucking rape like that. Right.

223
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,210
It's kind of akin to, right.
It's the number one fear.

224
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,230
If you're going to go to prison,

225
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,360
sons of anarchy just started
the new season. Right? Right.

226
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,360
Amazing. Like it starts with uh,
auto getting butt fucked, you know,

227
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,230
and how rude and he's, he's the
creator of the show, I think.

228
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,760
So that means he okayed himself
getting butt fucked and okayed it.

229
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,900
Guy Probably wrote it in.
Yeah, he wrote it. He's getting
butt fucked. And I'm like,

230
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,083
I'm like,

231
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,710
and then the guy implies this is going
to go down on the regular everyday now.

232
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,500
Oh, so if you know every morning
you're going to get bought fucked.

233
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,030
At what point do you just give up? Like
even fighting it. You're just like, oh,

234
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,050
do you shit yourself every morning so
that the guy has to stick his dick like

235
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,160
through like that shy,
I bet shit's not gonna scare him off.

236
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,890
If I had to take a wild guess right,

237
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,180
and the guy was trying to fuck
you in the butt every day,

238
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,800
that guy's not like discerning, learn to
like it, you know, day two, day three.

239
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,240
Do you just,
you could,

240
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,250
that could be the non passive bluedot
approach and learn to be a good wife.

241
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,460
You know, maybe you actually
grow to love each other.

242
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,040
I mean how it's a terrible
idea to be locked up in jail.

243
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,310
The guy was fucking all the time for sure.
You would probably,

244
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:25,660
your mind would try to rationalize
and find some way to escape it,

245
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,650
but think about the performance anxiety
of just like just being with a girl girl

246
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:30,520
regularly,
right?

247
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,670
You're like with her and then you can't
get it up and you're like, oh my God,

248
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:37,840
how embarrassing. Think
about the performance anxiety
of male rapist who's like,

249
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,150
I'm going to rape this guy.
You beat them up.

250
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,670
You get them down and you rip his
pants down and then you're like, sorry,

251
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:46,810
give me a second. You're
like, I gotta get this. Well,

252
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:51,800
it's a perfect example of rape
being not sex. Rape is violence,

253
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,100
right?

254
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,690
You know a guy fucking and raping a guy,
especially if he's not gay.

255
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:59,300
It's a control and violence thing.

256
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,541
You should get him as,

257
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,230
he should get a known male rapist prison
guy on the show and ask him what he

258
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:09,060
thinks about to get hard.
I don't think they could do it there.

259
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,540
That's the way I like wrestling mask
two people now taking their minds to

260
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,374
separate places.

261
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,650
You got the guy getting a rape to trying
to think of anything but getting raped

262
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,820
and you've got the rapist.

263
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:21,930
Trying to think of like something to get
them hard to rape the guy. Yeah, it's

264
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,700
comfortable idea, but it's also an
idea that we kind of understand.

265
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:29,430
That's one of the more
uncomfortable aspects of it, right?

266
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,170
We kind of understand that there are
guys out there that would rape somebody,

267
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,570
right? They would do it and you train
them to kill. I don't think that guy was,

268
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,930
he could have been a rapist,

269
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,970
but he definitely at least tried
to kill people. Or was it very,

270
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:49,350
I should say at the very least ready.
Right. I met a couple guys like that.

271
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,190
I met a couple of guys along the
way that we're like really crazy.

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,970
One of the guys that I used
to do martial arts with,

273
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,240
he went to jail and came back
a completely different person.

274
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,580
Right. It was weird, man. He came
out like a wild animal. I mean,

275
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,980
he went in, he was a real tough kid
and he went in when he was like,

276
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,500
I guess he was probably like
18 or something like that.

277
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,910
We were around the same age. Right. And
when he came out, he came out years later.

278
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,680
Right. He didn't want to tell
everybody he was in jail.

279
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:22,470
So he had this crazy
story about, uh, you know,

280
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,320
being away and helping somebody
out or something like that.

281
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,670
And then eventually just confessed.
Right.

282
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,380
But then getting to know him like
he was a totally different person.

283
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,780
It's like all of a sudden
I had to realize like,

284
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,140
oh that the last guy he does not, he's
not here anymore. This is some new dude.

285
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,670
Now I gotta talk to this new dude and
figure out what the parameters of our

286
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,740
friendship our cause
he seems fucking crazy,

287
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,340
but he's been fighting for his life and
it cage right for the last four years.

288
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,130
I mean the dude went away and you know,

289
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:54,480
he told me about like fights where he
tried to be got a death with a mop handle.

290
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,350
Some guys were coming out of with
Shane came out an animal. Yeah,

291
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,290
I came out of an animal.

292
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:03,291
It was for real wild animal fight to
the death type shit on a regular basis.

293
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,110
Yeah. Well he was in
jail for drugs. Right.

294
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,420
And so he was in like a
serious jail who's in jail,

295
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:12,810
I think either heroin or cocaine.
I don't know what it was,

296
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,390
but he was fucking nuts when he came out.

297
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,790
I hate to say how much time I've actually
thought about getting fucked in my ass.

298
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,590
Cause because I've been to
jail a few times, you know,
I've never done hard time,

299
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:28,390
but I've been to jail a few times
for a few months. And uh, you know,

300
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,550
it's like you have to think about it going
in, I guess especially being an Asian,

301
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,970
right? You go in as a black guy, there's
the blacks, you go into the Mexican,

302
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:41,080
there's a Mexican gangs, you go on the
whites, do you join the area and whatever.

303
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,770
Um, I have a friend that's Japanese, a
little Japanese guy that went to jail.

304
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,940
And then there's not enough Asians in
jail where they just all have to you.

305
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,840
You have to be friends with the Chinese,
the Japanese, the tie, the food, right.

306
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,050
It's not like, oh, because there's
so few and come on, let's face it.

307
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,820
Everyone likes Asian chicks and so,
especially this pervert over here.

308
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,360
So if everyone likes Asian chicks,
then we're the Asian chicks.

309
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,550
Male rapist want Asian dudes.
Dude,

310
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:13,551
if you're in jail and you're fucking
white dudes and Harry Fro buttholes and

311
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:18,580
Mexicans and then like a
hairless Asian clean, you know,

312
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,660
you're like, oh, you know, and
kind of see your point. You know,

313
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,710
it depends on what your agents are small.
We're like, some were smaller than,

314
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,310
so if you're a rapist and look,
I'm just,

315
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,990
this is the things I think about and I
get to jail. I'm an easy target, you know,

316
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,170
I'm not a fucking giant
guy. Like, he's like, oh,

317
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,340
and he doesn't have that much hair. Like
I wasn't a weird thing to think about.

318
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,080
Do you think about this?
Well,

319
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,600
I think about it when I get go to court
and they go, you're going to jail.

320
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,800
You Know How many times you've been in
jail? Uh, I've been maybe five times.

321
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,590
Most of them like just a week or a day.

322
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,840
And then the Japan thing
where I was for three months,

323
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:59,250
but never more than a few months,
you know, and I never got raped.

324
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,130
It's like almost, it's
almost a weird thing. Like,

325
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,350
I almost wanted it to happen
so I could finally let, yeah,

326
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,080
you didn't try hard cause you remember
the Ed Edward Norton Movie 25th Hour

327
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,710
where we asked his best friend to beat
the shit out of him so he would look ugly

328
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,460
going in. So he looked, he looked like
a bad ass. So I never went that far,

329
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:21,640
but it was like, God, I forgot about that.
You know what a crazy strategy. Yeah,

330
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,130
but it's like, it's okay. I
get to prison the first day,

331
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,840
a white gang, Mexican gang,
whatever is like, let's, let's
fucking show the new guy,

332
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,310
like how it's done here. I'm
like, at that point I'm like,

333
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm going to be overpowered, whatever,
this and that. I was in my mind, I,

334
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,820
I made it up very early on. I was like,
I'm not going to get fucked in my ass.

335
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,743
It's not going to happen.

336
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,930
If I go to jail and like five guys hold
me down and fuck my ass or whatever,

337
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,320
then I'm going to die the next day.
I don't want to be the guy that gets,

338
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,020
I'm going to fucking kill
the guy that did that to me.

339
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,730
And if I die trying then I'll just be
dead. But I'm not going to like, you know,

340
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:06,270
if they make me suck their dick, I'll
bite their dicks off. You know, I'm not,

341
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm not strong statement,
you know,

342
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,000
like I'm not going to fucking be the guy
that just gets bought. Fuck, you know?

343
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,420
I know what you're saying. What if you
like it though man, that is the problem.

344
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,010
Like I think you're going to like it.

345
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,380
Well you know you have that bingo
button in your prostate or whatever.

346
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,250
So allegedly, allegedly, I never pushed
that bitch. I don't want that job.

347
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,720
But the, on a regular like, you
know you've trained martial arts,

348
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:37,140
this and that and I've heard like the
Bruce Lee story stuff where he's a bad ass

349
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:40,920
so everyone always tries to fight
them. Ray, like on a regular week,

350
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,450
how many times does someone try to fight?
You know,

351
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,060
or never will never try to find me.
I'm very nice. I know you're a nice,

352
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,950
he comes up to me, I know you're a
nice guy, but does people ever go, hey,

353
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,470
you think you know a lot of fights?

354
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,120
No, no. You know, I, I'm not like, uh,

355
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,050
I'm not very impressed
with myself. You know, I'm,

356
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:00,740
I'm not like type of person who
brags about what I can and can't do.

357
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,260
So it's not like I have to
respond to things that I've said,

358
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:06,530
like I could kick this guy's ass.
Fuck that guy up. I would never even,

359
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,330
I don't even think like that
or do it for me to do it to,

360
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,640
to calm my crazy monkey body. Right.
I do it to keep my mind straight.

361
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:17,270
I do it to give myself something to
something that's very difficult to do

362
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,270
because I think that as a person,

363
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,330
oftentimes we have a lot of intensely
built up stress because of the nature of

364
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,000
average everyday life in comparison to the

365
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,370
ancient man had a completely
different existence. Right?

366
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,880
But we essentially have the same body
that body has like energy requirements.

367
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,530
And I find that if I don't test myself
at some extreme way on a regular basis

368
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,720
physically,
that I can't stay calm.

369
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,780
Well, I tried to push me like I've
been painting my whole life. Right.

370
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,830
So I guess when any anyone does anything
their whole life to other people,

371
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,750
it makes it look easy. Right,
right. So I'll paint and you know,

372
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,580
I'll just pick it was,

373
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,850
and I paint quickly so I don't really
spend too much time on any one painting,

374
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:03,350
you know? That's because I've
practiced in practice. You know,

375
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,940
what's your style too? Right? You have
a very particular style, you know,

376
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:09,250
people will see me painting and
go, Oh, I think I could do that.

377
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,430
I thank you very much for the Werewolf.
That was cool as shit

378
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,130
framing was done. I'd have it hanging
out while you're in here. But that was,

379
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,750
well that was cool to find out.

380
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:21,560
How much do you like comics and the
horse shit growing up in that, you know,

381
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:22,760
that stuff.
For me it's fun to paint.

382
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,670
It was, to me it was so fun like the,
the old creepy and eerie and all those.

383
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:32,390
And, and Dude, you bought me a whole book
series to you. You're the nicest guy.

384
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,910
Oh a man. Well, I bought
me a whole book series of,

385
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:37,650
of those comic book a horror things.
Wow.

386
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,650
Look, I was bad. I had been
doing this show for four years.
Right? I'm all set. Yeah,

387
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,850
I'm, I'm a baby. But you've been like
on fear factor. You're, you're in Bro.

388
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,180
You've been in broadcasting for
awhile. Like broad casting. Yeah.

389
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,080
Well you've been in front of a
camera too. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

390
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,170
I'm new to this shit.
You know, it's, and I,

391
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:59,060
and that's another thing for me
to challenge. You know, like I,

392
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,730
my podcast is barely a year old that when
I did the show for vice to thumbs up,

393
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:07,210
I was just fumbling and fumbling through,
like making shit up.

394
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,810
The device. Things were cool, dude. The
vice things, it got people to know you.

395
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,490
But I first heard about
you, I'm sorry, go ahead.

396
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,630
It's just a lot of stuttering though,
right? And there's no, there's no person,

397
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,350
there's no script. I'm just like, uh,

398
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,030
and so to have like you,
Kevin Smith, Anthony Bordain,

399
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:24,631
Howard Stern,

400
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:29,490
like all these guys like let me be on
the shows and interview them like a,

401
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,250
I get ridiculously sick before the show.

402
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Like I just get filled up with so
much like nervous energy and like,

403
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,570
well I'm more calm now,

404
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,200
but like the first time I was on your
show I puked like outside of Chili's or

405
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:46,310
something right here or a did you really?

406
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,920
But I would never expect,
I would have never believed that.

407
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:52,580
You seem so calm and relaxed.
Also it had a little food poisoning then,

408
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,130
but just in general,
anytime,

409
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,250
like I have a lot of anxiety with
being like in front of cameras,

410
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:04,640
cameras or like anything like this. I like
it because it makes me nervous. Right.

411
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,271
In the same way.

412
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:08,930
Like I would like someone to at least
attempt to try to put fuck me in prison.

413
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,390
It's like it gives,

414
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,620
it's an insane amount of nervous energy
where it gets shaky and then I just puke

415
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,960
it out and then I'm good. You know? Like,

416
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,300
it's one of those things
that I think once you start,

417
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,540
once you start it right and then
you just get comfortable and, and,

418
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,930
and so I'm appreciative to
you and everyone who's like,

419
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:30,670
let me be on their show and talk.
So it's like, I think it's uh,

420
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,180
a little bit of a lost art of
writing a nice note or like,

421
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:42,500
you know, it's like, hey, hey bro, had a
good time. Send a text message. It's like,

422
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:45,470
okay, cool. But like, you know,
someone does something nice for you,

423
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,220
like do something nice.
I write,

424
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,900
really recognize the Chester and I
really appreciate it. It was very,

425
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,810
very cool of you and very generous.
But I don't,

426
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,870
and now I don't want people who've been
on the show now just start sending me

427
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,630
shit. Call David. Charles says,
well that's the thing. It's like,

428
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,350
I don't want to send
people shit that I hate.

429
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,400
Like I have a hard time throwing
stuff away and people are like, Hey,

430
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,530
you're an artist.
I'm an artist.

431
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,850
And they send me a giant like
shitty painting. And I'm like,

432
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,040
this is so sweet that you did this.

433
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,480
But I sort of feel like shit now because
I inspired you to paint this horrible

434
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:25,370
picture and I, you know, I've had a
lot of space to put it, so I'm like,

435
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:27,890
I have a real tough time
throwing stuff away. But like,

436
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,220
I know you like Werewolf Shit and you
told me you liked the EEC horse stuff.

437
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:35,090
So I'm like, Joel, like this. Uh, it's
very cool. Very cool. Thank you very much.

438
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,050
And I went to Kevin Smith's house. He has
a shitload of Batman toys, so I'm like,

439
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,640
this guy for sure likes Batman toys,

440
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:44,270
but he doesn't have the best ones that
I know about. So it's like, you know,

441
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,390
I like, I like getting people
stuff that they want, you know,

442
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:52,070
not like just bullshit, you know? That's
very, very cool. Very cool. If you man,

443
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,040
yeah, you're a, you're
a very thoughtful guy.

444
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,860
I would've never thought that you were
nervous the first time he did it because

445
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:02,660
he was so calm and normal and relaxed
and honest. Well it goes from this,

446
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,990
it goes from retardedly
nervous, like, like,

447
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,730
like I can't like I get filled with,

448
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,580
and one of the main things that
people say about me is like,

449
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:15,170
I interrupt people or I say like too much,
but it's because I have so much.

450
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,500
I, it's all in me. And like I don't,
I don't know how they should go. Well,

451
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,550
I seen you do it right.
And I seen Howard stern do it and I seen,

452
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,050
and to me I see Joe pulled up to the show,
sit down,

453
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,680
have a coffee and start talking.
And that's how I do everything.

454
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,440
That's how I do art. People go, what
do you think about when you paint?

455
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:37,660
What do you I go, I don't think about
shit. I like, I know you have your um,

456
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,410
deprivation chamber stuff to relax it and
stuff. But for me, like for podcasting,

457
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:43,920
for playing music,
for making art,

458
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,510
I sit there, I try to like
do the yoga, not yoga,

459
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,400
Zen, uh, a meditation shit of
just thinking about nothing.

460
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,640
Like just blank, go blank, like from
the Ghostbusters, think of nothing.

461
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,180
And I just try to think of nothing and
then I just try to explode, you know.

462
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,140
But then I walked in on,
um,

463
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,570
the Nerdist they broadcast from meltdown
and they had all these writers writing

464
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:13,650
shit. And I think they do
that for the stern show too.
And I'm like, this is crazy.

465
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,690
They like preparing the, you know, and
so for me, I don't do any of that shit.

466
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:19,261
I just show up.

467
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:22,350
I turned the mics on and I start talking
for like 10 hours straight cause I

468
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,570
usually do four podcasts back to back.

469
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,820
But it fills me with such nervous energy
and it takes me a second where that

470
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:32,070
nervous, I puke it out
first, then I calmed down.

471
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,360
And then in the same way where people
are like, oh, when they see me paint,

472
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:40,050
they're like, oh, I could do that. Cause
I, cause I make it look easy. Whatever.

473
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,940
I do the show with Joe and then I'm like,

474
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,850
I think I've had kicked the
shit out of jail. Not that bad.

475
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:48,650
I think I could fight him. I think I could
take them. You, yeah, you relax a little.

476
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,460
Um, I think too that the, it's such
a unique medium, the podcast medium,

477
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:58,020
and it's really, it's a medium that
like works best when you do it this way,

478
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,540
in my opinion.
I think there's two types of podcasts.

479
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,570
It's like the Dan Carlin type podcast,
right?

480
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,130
Which we were talking about last
night with a Wayne Fetterman,

481
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,410
who's a buddy of mine,
who's a,

482
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:11,730
of a hilarious comedian who became a fan
of that hardcore history podcast, right?

483
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,610
But it's not really a podcast
the same way this is, right?

484
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,350
It's more like an audio book,
like at Lecture, brilliant,

485
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,680
entertaining lecture on history,
whereas the,

486
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:26,520
but that's like a preparatory
thing or a preparation thing.

487
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,660
But what we do is, you know, essentially
it's done best when it's like,

488
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,770
who is David Choe today? Like we
very, who's David showed today,

489
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:38,850
September 12 2013 where are you at right
now? What's going on right now? Where,

490
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,170
where you had in your, your laundry list
of experiences in this life. And that's,

491
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,180
it's very unique in that way.
And a guy like you. You know,

492
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,510
the only way we were talking about
this before we even started, right?

493
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,950
But about people wanting
to do something with UL,

494
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,800
we get you David Chair and get you. We
know you're wild. We know you're crazy.

495
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,620
We'd love that.
We want you to do that on our thing.

496
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,070
And then once you get involved with
it, you realize like, oh no, this is,

497
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:07,110
they don't get me at, no, no, no, I can't.

498
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,870
You're telling me to do this and I
want to do that. And you telling me,

499
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:12,840
I can't swear and I can't say that
I shouldn't say this and that'll,

500
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,890
that'll stop them from advertising.
You know, hiccups. Fucking laundry is

501
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,720
the most perfect media to express myself
when I'm not painting or doing anything

502
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,720
because it's first of all,
the shits free.

503
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,570
I don't have any ads and you don't
have to listen if you don't want.

504
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:31,720
And I know what I am and I
know what I'm not, you know,

505
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,260
I don't know shit about history.
I don't remember dates.

506
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm not that smart where I'm going to
actually inform you about anything.

507
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,600
Like I,

508
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,040
I just know that I have a
feeling when I isolated myself,

509
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,480
when I'm, when I'm a bit of
a recluse and I don't go out,

510
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,960
that the evil thoughts start coming
in and they start feeling like a weird

511
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:56,890
person. And I'm like, does anyone
else feel like this or is it just me?

512
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,410
And a lot of times it is just me. But
like, you know, I get, I get all anxiety.

513
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,550
And so then I go see a
therapist and I'm like,

514
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,560
I don't even know if this is for me.
So for me,

515
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:08,710
the podcast is me and my friends
bullshitting. I talk about shit,

516
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,740
I know fucking art hanging out,
this and that.

517
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,690
And then I could just verbal diarrhea,

518
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:16,330
all my problems out and you can
listen or you can not listen.

519
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,860
But by me doing that,

520
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,970
I'm exercising my demons and you
could relate or not relate and go,

521
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:26,320
this guy's a Weirdo or, or not. And I
can only, I can only talk about what I,

522
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,950
what I know. And I, I'll
give you an example. Uh,

523
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,590
I just, for the first time in four years
had my first art show. I haven't painted,

524
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,400
uh, I did a few murals,
murals and shit in that time,

525
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:44,230
but not like an actual art show in a
gallery or museum. And you know, I,

526
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,530
I'm at a point in my life where money is,

527
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,110
I don't need to play the money game,
which is a very rare thing to say. Like,

528
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,330
I don't have to make money doing anything.

529
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,160
I don't have to make money off my podcast.

530
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,350
I don't have to have an art
show and sell it out. Like,

531
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,190
so if I'm not playing the
same game of most humanity,

532
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,310
most people will never get a
chance to say that, right? Like,

533
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:09,130
I don't have to worry about money.
My kids don't have to worry about money.

534
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:10,810
Their children don't have
to worry about money.

535
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,530
So I'm starting to do some more
charitable stuff to help people.

536
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,720
And as far as art goes,

537
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,990
I didn't become an artist so that
only rich people can afford my art.

538
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,520
So I'm trying to do shit that's free
and museums, more murals, whatever.

539
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,390
So I did, uh, I did my art show in Mexico,

540
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,940
but immediately after the art show,

541
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,450
and actually it's still up if anyone's
in Mexico City and wants to see it,

542
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,340
it's at the Museum del Chapo at,
and it's called Snowman monkey barbecue.

543
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,920
And it's like, it's an old
camp, a gambling term that, uh,

544
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,600
um, is that online? Can we see that
image? Yeah, you could see shit online.

545
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,470
What is it? Snow man. What?
Snowman monkey barbecue. Dot. Mx.

546
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,360
Um, and so, um,

547
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,770
I, I'm, I'm like,

548
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,940
that was crazy because I had two and a
half weeks to put that show together,

549
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:04,330
you know,

550
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,980
and I did murals and watercolors
and sculptures and all that shit,

551
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:13,540
so. Wow. What is, what's
going on back there? Oh yeah.
I just made shit out of, uh,

552
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,820
uh, Penn Yada material,
that fucking thing.

553
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,560
And I'll be, is that man? Uh, I dunno.

554
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,880
It was like three stories high and shit.

555
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:29,560
So it's insane. That's a real
work of art. But, so it's like,

556
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:34,090
uh, it's, I haven't painted in
four years. I'm fumbling around,

557
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:38,620
I'm doing bullshit. And then someone's
like, here's this space at a museum.

558
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,040
You got two and a half

559
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,460
weeks ago. Just puking
it all out. You know,

560
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,370
go back to the one large image of it.

561
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:50,770
If you would see seats filled out
up with this cane, what did that,

562
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,030
that's fucking crazy. Look like a giant
Eagle looking thing. Yeah, I mean it's,

563
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,820
it's everything I saw in Mexico,
everything that I felt and I just,

564
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,810
you know, and I'm confident at this
point in my life to pink, you know,

565
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,681
when I was younger,

566
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,250
I would see something in my head and
the hand eye coordination of like,

567
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,710
it wouldn't look exactly how I saw it.

568
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:13,280
And now I can make exactly
what I see in my head come out.

569
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:17,890
So to your hand is filming
you make me nervous.

570
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,790
So I just puked that shit out,
you know? And then, um, Brian,

571
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:29,390
I don't think you can show that.
Think get in trouble.

572
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,580
So we're not really gentlemen.
They were definitely not real. Um,

573
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,210
so then I was at a dinner,
um,

574
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,700
a year earlier with Anthony Bourdain
and David Chang and there's a food

575
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:48,161
symposium in Copenhagen every year
called mad symposium and it's like a food

576
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:51,920
conference, you know, and it's
just all Michelin star chefs.

577
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:56,510
Like pick the guys that do with food,
that kind of shit. You know too.

578
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:01,250
That's so cool. Okay. I
know that young child girl,

579
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:05,090
boy in the lower right hand corner
with the Eagle thing over its head,

580
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:07,400
what kind of bird is that?
If you saw that in detail,

581
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,570
it's just goes deeper and deeper. Like
the girls being eaten by like a parrot,

582
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:15,110
but then her beak turns into another
thing and there's a blue dog.

583
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,920
I try to see fractal almost.
Well I tried to do this like,

584
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,200
well I could talk to you about it
because you understand that I wasco,

585
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,490
the Iowasca open something inside me
where I'm tripping all the time now.

586
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,980
Well I'm tripping all the time.
She go to a doctor. I mean it's,

587
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:36,110
they broke your trip. No, it's crazy
man. Like you're tripping all the time.

588
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,860
Like it's happening, you
know, like you do mushrooms,

589
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:44,030
are you Iowasca then you
start seeing shit, it's just
happening all the time now.

590
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,640
So you see it all the time.
All the fucking time.

591
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,060
Like Jill would just be sitting
down when I'm seeing it right now.

592
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,290
Like there's like a train track right
here and then there's like weird colors

593
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:58,490
coming down this way. Um, really, I don't
want to sound like a Weirdo, but it's

594
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,160
weird.
I don't try to fight it.

595
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,410
The images are just exploding.

596
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,820
I mean I could differentiate between
reality and whatever. Right. But it's,

597
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,830
if I just close my eyes like that time
before you fall asleep and I just lay

598
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:20,510
there, I could just watch like this
symphony of, I don't know what it means.

599
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,640
I don't try to make sense of it,
but it's happening.

600
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,000
So it happens on a super
regular basis all the time.

601
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,570
And it only happened once you had
your initial Iowasca experience?

602
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,490
I did,
yeah.

603
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,090
And in one year I did mushrooms a few
times and I did Iowaska three times back

604
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,040
to back.
And since then it opened something

605
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,300
inside me. And you know, it's the
same visions that I would see,

606
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:46,650
like if I had a dream or whatever,
but now it's just all the time.

607
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,150
It's never, there's no like, oh, now
I'm going to trip. And the IOWASCA,

608
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,350
that's the Iowasca on the third night.
Oh my God, I was on the third night,

609
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,590
you know the call it the spirit,
it talks to me and it said to me,

610
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,740
don't ever do this again. You
got, you got your homework,

611
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:05,670
now you know what you need to do. Wow.
And I wrote everything down and said,

612
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,930
you need to do this,
this and this.

613
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,740
And it gave me instructions of all the
shit I need to do for the rest of my life.

614
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,430
I couldn't do an eight lifetimes,
you know, 20 lifetimes.

615
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,070
And it says you could abuse anything,
right?

616
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,460
I could start doing IOWASCA
recreational. It's, and it's,

617
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,240
it's a powerful tool and I don't
want to abuse that. And you know,

618
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,470
so I'm like,
why would I need to do something?

619
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,060
I mean it's, I can, I think I
could still function as a human,

620
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:37,450
but it's all the time. It's,
it's open now and it's uh,

621
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:43,470
it's cool. I like it. Yeah. I love it.
It's not like maddening or whatever.

622
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:45,060
It's like,
um,

623
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,290
I wish this is one of those
days where like, you know, if a,

624
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,850
you and I were not in the same
room, right. And I'd say, well,

625
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,810
show me what it looks like. Uh, you know,
if you were describing a physical object,

626
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:58,750
you can take a photo of it, send
it to me. Right. Right. One day,

627
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:02,120
I hope that technology exists that I
could actually see what you're seeing.

628
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,750
I could you imagine if we found out
that like your version of like various

629
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:12,280
things that you're looking at is different
than my version because you do it and

630
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:15,550
you're like, it's crazy Dave. And I
go but explain crazy and I'm like,

631
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:18,280
is your crazy the same thing
that I'm seeing, you know? Well,

632
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:19,990
it's like how much of you,

633
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:24,991
what you impart as beauty to something
is based on your own personal or cultural

634
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:30,550
context. And if you could
absorb another person's views,

635
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,930
right? Like, if you could see something,

636
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:35,050
maybe an actual
visualization of something,

637
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:37,060
it's not just the image itself,

638
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:40,780
it's the emotions attached to the
image automatically by the mind.

639
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,420
And I think we all have
different ones of those,

640
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:47,950
which is why some dudes like girls that
are like really kind of overweight,

641
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,580
right. You know, and some girls like
really skinny guys or some, you know,

642
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:55,060
it's like you, there's
something, it triggers in you.

643
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,580
The one thing when people do
like dream analysis and shit,

644
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:01,850
like what does it mean this and that.
One thing that I try to,

645
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,280
that I do a lot is I over analyze stuff.

646
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,940
Like why did I just draw this guy's
own dick going into his own butt?

647
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,950
Or why did I draw like an
uh, blew over and over. Yeah.

648
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,670
Yeah. What did I draw?
Yeah. Why did I draw this,

649
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,400
draw that a hundred times that movie super
bad. When the guy throwing the Dicks,

650
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,630
I was like,
why didn't I get that job?

651
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,590
Nobody draws dicks veins on a
tick better than me. That was

652
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,720
close to home book.
It's everywhere.

653
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,920
If you go to any country and you
take a shit in any public bathrooms,

654
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:34,700
someone always draws a dick.
Yeah.

655
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:39,130
What is desire to draw dicks
and a peace symbol of fuck you.

656
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,330
You know? Right. There's always the,
it's always goes back to the dig, well,

657
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:47,740
who are these bathroom philosophers?
I do. It. Is that quest people, right?

658
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:52,570
Like shit down on a wall. It's a, it's
a weird thing. It's like you're, you're,

659
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:56,350
uh, we're all admitting
that we're experiencing the
same uncomfortable moment,

660
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,990
right? So here's something to
think about. Distract you. Right.

661
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,870
Well, so when you have dreams and
you have visions and you're like,

662
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:06,570
what did that mean? Did something
happened in my life that day? Um,

663
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,520
I did a lot of over analyzing like that.
Like, why am I seeing this right now?

664
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:13,100
Why is this dog's head exploding?

665
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,680
And then a mushrooms coming out and then
flowers are coming out of the mushrooms

666
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,940
and this and it's turning
into my mother's face. Slap.

667
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,090
Like w instead of thinking about that,

668
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,690
I just watch it now instead of trying
to be like, why is that happening?

669
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,950
It's just like, cool, this is happening.
And in the same way that mural,

670
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,110
everyone's like, it just kept changing
every day. And it's like, what is it?

671
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:37,730
Is it a animal or is it this? And what
was happening in my life during that time?

672
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,290
First of all,

673
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:43,100
there's an unbelievable amount of pressure
as an artist after not having a show

674
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:45,500
in four years to, you know,
every time I do a show,

675
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,360
I want it to be the best
show I've ever done.

676
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,430
And this was like such a small amount of
time to put that much art together that

677
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,640
I was, you know, everyone's like, you
fucking bitches in Mexico. I'm like,

678
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,210
I'm working. I'm not, I didn't
go to Mexico to fuck, you know?

679
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,350
But he was a very strange way of saying,
fuck, how did I, how do I say it?

680
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,150
It's very bold. Oh, really? It's
like I didn't bravado to it like,

681
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:12,120
you're wearing a cape. I didn't go to
Mexico to fuck up. It's like you're,

682
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,530
you know, a confident way of saying, fuck,
why do I, what do I like to do? Fuck.

683
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,900
Just like it's, you're, you
almost defiant in your tone.

684
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:22,220
So I got to tell you what happen

685
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,690
and I, I uh, you know, cause every,

686
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,560
I'm going to go off subject
just for a second, cause no way.

687
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,730
Every time on the show,
every time I think, wow,

688
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,330
I've experienced a new sexual thing
that I've never, like, this is insane.

689
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:42,130
Like how many are left when a girl's
shoots a ice cube? My butthole or, or,

690
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,590
or you know,
like,

691
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,420
or like when I'm laying down and then
like five women are just giving me a

692
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,630
massage just using their
tongues. I'm like, oh five,

693
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,840
it's not going to get better than
this. You know, this is like a baller.

694
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,340
Damn. I didn't know who it went over to
handed. I thought it just stopped there.

695
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:01,890
You got five and then so I meet a guy,
yes,

696
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,860
your day. And he's like, Oh yeah, we did
some rate red rope shit and this and that.

697
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:07,650
And I'm like red probe. I'm like, I don't,
I don't know what that is. He's like,

698
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,360
you don't know what the red
rope services? And I go, no,

699
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:15,270
but please tell me like, what the
fuck are you talking about right now?

700
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,430
My name is Marty and I'm the
inventor of the red rope service. So

701
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,920
sitting there, okay, so you're laying
on your, it's a massage parlor. You Go,

702
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:27,540
it's not, it's a service. It's not the
name of a place. It's like a code word.

703
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:31,650
You Go, can we get, can I get the red
rope? Okay, so you're getting a massage.

704
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,340
I think it's only in Asia.
And you're laying on your back

705
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,700
and then you go, you know, you get,

706
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,740
you get to the happy ending point where
she gets her dick hard and everything

707
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:44,240
and you're like, I would like the red
rope at this point. She ties a rope.

708
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:47,570
And here's the crazy part. It doesn't
have to be read. It's just the rope.

709
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,860
And they tie it to the whatever, the,
the bars above the massage table.

710
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,950
And they hook their feet on
it so they're upside down.

711
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,810
And so they start spinning around and
then they put their mouth on your hard

712
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:00,560
dick.

713
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,300
And then they let go and they helicopter
their mouth around your Dick all the

714
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:07,280
way.
And I'd never done it before,

715
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:10,190
but the guy says it feels like your
Dick's can it like you've never felt

716
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:13,520
anything like that before in your life
and it feels like your Dick is just going

717
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:16,130
to explode with, uh, you know,

718
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:19,290
like a neutron bomb and
explosion and then you,

719
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,350
and then it's done and it stops and then
it spins the other way around to listen

720
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,210
to the crafty.

721
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,560
Always unbelievable because they,

722
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,350
they really like take
sex to another level.

723
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:37,460
Like they try to figure out the most
pleasurable things to do to you and then

724
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:41,330
they do them, you know, so wrote books
about it. I mean, you know the the,

725
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:43,250
what does that,
that book the um,

726
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:48,290
what's the fucking the famous a tantric
book. Yeah. What the fuck is that book?

727
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,400
Um, for me, uh,

728
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,090
well here's the thing about the red
rope or any of that shit. What the fuck?

729
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,890
I know what you're saying.
I know what you're talking about.

730
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:05,210
Cause I do that tantric shit. God Damn
it. What's the name of the book though?

731
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,320
There's a famous name that if you find
it over people's houses, like, oh,

732
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,070
they're a freak. I, yeah. You
know what I'm talking about?

733
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,900
I know what you're talking. I do.
I do. Student of Tantra. So fun.

734
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,800
Have you ever had a soapy where you're
on a raft and they put like soap all over

735
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,170
again? Then you just wrap
your body up and down. Brian,

736
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:26,930
I've done it on the red
rope. Well, here's the thing.

737
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,610
Here's all the shit that we're talking
about, right? The soapy raft. Yeah,

738
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,740
the red rope, whatever sutra.
The conversation. I mean, um,

739
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,210
here's the thing about all
these weird sex things,

740
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,770
especially like at a massage parlor
where they do those things. You're like,

741
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,810
how does one girl do the red rope?
She had to learn it from,

742
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,640
they have to teach someone who does
a happy ending. Like amazingly,

743
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,540
the quality of service has to maintain,
you know,

744
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,230
like how can one girl give the
best hand job? She had to learn it.

745
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,250
So that's another thing I think
about, you know, who's teaching him,

746
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,740
who's teaching them? Is it a client
down? It's gotta be who's the Guinea pig?

747
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,020
The guy who owns the building,
who's the Guinea pig guy owns a building.

748
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,130
No fucking big mayonnaise
jar fill. Viagara. Exactly.

749
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:19,440
So I don't know if you know this Joe,
but I like to gamble. I know I haven't,

750
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,210
I haven't gambled in, in almost a year
and eight months now. No one's counting.

751
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,950
But uh,
I used to gamble in Macau and cow is like,

752
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,940
it's Times 10, it's Vegas Times a thousand
a thousand. They do shit in Macau.

753
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,410
That shit's on v one. One
good casino in, in, uh,

754
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,320
in Macau makes more money
than all of Las Vegas.

755
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,420
Like they're finishing out there is two
football fields wide. Like it's crazy.

756
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,030
Oh my God. And they have
chips. Like, you know,

757
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:50,820
you go to Vegas and you see black
chips and green chips, whatever.

758
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,010
They have like square chips, the size of
this and you're like, Whoa, what's that?

759
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,930
And they're like, that's a million
dollars million dollars. China,

760
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,840
if you ever thought China's
going to run the world, yes.

761
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,720
The answer to that is yes.
They don't give a shit.

762
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,530
They have money there that it's like
you wouldn't even fucking understand.

763
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:12,060
It's not a good thing or a bad
thing if China runs the world, uh,

764
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,190
I mean you say China and everybody
goes communism, tenement, square.

765
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,000
Those are two things that come
up. Communism, tenement, square,

766
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,980
and then you say America. And what did
they say? Hiroshima. Nagasaki, Kent State.

767
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,890
You know, it all depends on whether
you like Chinese food or not. You know,

768
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,530
like if you like MSD then it's
good that, I don't know. China,

769
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:40,420
Chinese people running shit. Who
knows? I do know that if you, uh,

770
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,550
to the like the three listeners
out there that oriented Asian guys,

771
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,340
if you like Asian dudes,
if you like, you know,

772
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,650
the hairless body and all that shit data,
Chinese guy from China,

773
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,500
because there's so many of them because
you don't want to date a Korean because

774
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:59,220
they're fucking assholes. They're
stubborn, insecure, judgmental assholes.

775
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,840
You don't want a date, like
a weird Japanese guy. China,

776
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:09,170
Chinese like to fuck. They like to
fuck a lot. Whoa. That's why words.

777
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,840
That's why there's billions of them.
There's more of Chinese than anywhere.

778
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,270
There's more Chinese people got to
get good point there. I'm right.

779
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,120
They know what is that point? They
don't like. They don't like to pull out.

780
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,410
They like to come inside and they like
to have babies so much that there's

781
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:26,460
billions of them. Overpopulation.
What does the Chinese government to,

782
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,080
you can only have one child. Now you can
only have one if you can only have one.

783
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,710
What do you want a boy?
What did the Chinese people do now?

784
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,210
For years now you can only have one kid
or else you have to pay crazy taxes.

785
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,400
So if you're trying to use,
and you have brothers and sisters,

786
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:44,880
that means your parents would probably
rich. So you owe port till you have a son.

787
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,430
So what does that do
to the population now?

788
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,220
There's way more boys than there's women.

789
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,220
What does that do now that now in the
same way they used to do the mail,

790
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,950
a Russian mail order bride.

791
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,100
Now they do that for China
with Vietnamese in Filipino,

792
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,970
there's not enough women so that
they need to do Filipino mail order,

793
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:07,290
bride time mail order bride.
And what does that do? There's,

794
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,360
I don't know,
I don't know statistics,

795
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:12,180
but I think it's something like 10
for every 10 guys. There's one girl.

796
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,320
So what does that do to the entire
country? He creates homosexuality,

797
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,040
more higher numbers.
And if you're,

798
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,710
if you're a dude and you're
lucky enough to get a girlfriend,

799
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,210
you're going to treat her amazing.

800
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,260
You're going to treat her like
a fucking princess. So ladies,

801
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,250
if you like the Asian,
get a Chinese,

802
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,740
it seems like a recipe for fucking chaos
because it doesn't seem like if you

803
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:37,100
live like that and you
only have one child and um,

804
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,180
the majority of them
are men at first of all,

805
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:40,500
it doesn't feel like that's sustainable,

806
00:47:40,501 --> 00:47:43,680
but it feels like people are
going to be so unhappy. Well,

807
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,940
if we're going to be so
crazy and I want answers to

808
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,740
book called the Kama Sutra and learn some
tantric shit so you don't fucking come

809
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:51,580
inside and have so many,

810
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,210
we got them babies, you know, that's
not going to help at this point.

811
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,781
At this point.

812
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:58,440
It seems like when you have that situation
already in place where you're only

813
00:47:58,441 --> 00:47:59,310
allowed to have one kid,

814
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:03,300
so you have this excess of males
and completely imbalanced set up.

815
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,680
Whenever you have imbalance like
that, it creates unrest. It's bad.

816
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:13,310
What they could be doing is setting up
their entire country to change the tone

817
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:14,790
of the country.
Right.

818
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,410
Well,
here's the thing that I know,

819
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,470
I know when a shit is fucking crazy
because the art gets really good.

820
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,710
You know, are in China is better than
the art and the rest of the world. Why?

821
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,340
Because they have been tormented.
Yeah,

822
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,610
because they have been
living under communism,

823
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,200
like Brian only fucks porn stars and he
thinks it's going to be a step up for

824
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:37,470
him to start dating artists.
That is like 10 steps down.

825
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,400
Wait til you hear his comedy
after he starts dating an artist.

826
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,530
It will be the best comedy he's ever done
in his life, but because they're crazy,

827
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,430
they're horrible.

828
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,490
Especially once the paint a lot of self
portraits of themselves. No, I mean,

829
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:47,830
come on,

830
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,050
give me a fucking break. Hey,
let's not get specific here.

831
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,020
It's not going to have civic,
but you know what I'm saying.

832
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,960
I know exactly what you're saying.
So

833
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,200
like,
um,

834
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,360
so I'm in China and I'm gambling
and I get stressed out and they go,

835
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:05,530
do you want to go get a massage? And I,
and I told the guy, he goes, you know,

836
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,910
a massage or a massage. And I go, no,
like, seriously, like a regular massage.

837
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:10,780
I want to calm down.

838
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,400
So he gives me the number for this place
and like old Macau and I go in and it's

839
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:17,230
amazing.
It's like giant,

840
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,350
huge sofas where he could kick
back and the guy runs and goes,

841
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:23,770
do you want a sandwich and some
ramen or whatever. I'm like, yeah,

842
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,820
give me some noodle soup. Gimme a ramen
than a dude rolls up. And he's like,

843
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,430
you got some like hard skin
on the bottom of your feet.

844
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:34,060
You want me to shave that off? I'm like,
yeah, fuck yeah. You know, wait a minute.

845
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,280
Many petty dude and the Andy Petit.
Yeah.

846
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,930
So I got a dude shaving with a razor
blade, like the hard skin on the,

847
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:41,930
off the bottom of my shoe.

848
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,090
And then a little girl just comes
and sits on my shoulder and she goes,

849
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:48,220
do you want your ears
clean? And I go, yeah.

850
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,520
And she's doing like little
flowery shit blowing in my ear,

851
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,590
digging all this like earwax out.
And I'm like,

852
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,870
I feel like a goddamn princess right now.

853
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,880
And then a sold a sort of like milfy
older, not that attractive, but you know,

854
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:04,460
got some weird meal. Five, that's my
time comes up and goes, do you want to,

855
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,030
do you want a leg massage? And, and
this is all like 30 bucks, you know,

856
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:14,020
like now I got three people catering to
me. I got one dude on my feet, one chick,

857
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,980
uh, cleaning my ears. And I think at one
point I had four, like one chick was like,

858
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,650
do you want to head scalp massage? And I
was like, let's just do the whole thing,

859
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,590
you know, so you're just sitting
there like a goddamn king.

860
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,710
And then the lady that's
giving me my thigh massage,

861
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,950
she's like sitting on a little
stoop between me rubbing my legs,

862
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:31,790
rubbing my calves.

863
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,630
And then once in a while she goes from
one leg and then she goes to the other

864
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:37,970
leg. And one time when
she went to the other leg,

865
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,500
her hands scraped the bottom of my
balls. I was like, oh, whoops. Sorry.

866
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:47,000
Like was that an accident? And then
did you ask why? It was like, oh,

867
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:51,350
that's sort of cool. You
know, I didn't say anything.
I was, I was getting my ears,

868
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,820
whatever I was going on.

869
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:56,240
But then she goes to the other leg and
this time she grabs my balls. I go,

870
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,490
that's not an accident. So I'm like,
monkey grabs the peach. Right. And,

871
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:05,620
uh, I'm sitting there and
she starts, monkey grabbed.

872
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,270
And so now she's giving,
she's giving me a,

873
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,770
a h j but not like an aggressive HJ.
It's like just,

874
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,610
she's just playing with my balls. Handjobs
you've broken it down to two letters.

875
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,050
J well, there's the dry Hj, there's a
wet HJ roadmaps terminology right there.

876
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:27,020
Monkey monkey steals the peach.
But she's just giving me like, um,

877
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,550
just like a boring, she's not trying
to get me off. She's just massaging.

878
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,380
She's just being nice to you and I and,

879
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,980
but then I started getting hard and I'm
laying on a sofa thing like this right

880
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:37,814
next to my friend,

881
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,080
like our feet are touching
so it's kind of gay.

882
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,090
He's like to push off me,
I'm getting hard,

883
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,110
so I feel the bottoms of your feet
but there's tow shake with you.

884
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,080
But there's a blanket over my,
my Dick.

885
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,440
So I started getting hard and she starts
hitting it on her hand and showing my

886
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:57,140
friends, he's like, look your friend
very hard. And I'm like, don't do that.

887
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,210
They'll do that. And uh,
and I'm like, this is weird.

888
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,830
I'm getting a sexual act. While other
people are like, hmm, like hearing me,

889
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,600
you know, that's so crazy. And it was,

890
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,660
and then it's 15 minutes that she stops
and she goes, do you want it to go on?

891
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,590
Or whatever. And I'm like, let's
stop for right now. Let me, let me,

892
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,410
let me just try to figure out
what just happened right now.

893
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,440
He's not like a business manager. Let's
stop for right now. Let's stop right now.

894
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,060
We're going to get the team
together. Where we go from
here. So they all stopped.

895
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:30,590
They go away and I go, Bro, that girl was
like said, do you want to find massage?

896
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,560
And she was massaging my balls
and he's like, that was awesome.

897
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,710
And then we're talking and
we're looking at everyone.

898
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:41,210
So we look like the feet manicured.
People are mostly dudes.

899
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,050
The ear cleaning chicks are usually like
really small because they sit on you

900
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,810
and the five massage
ladies for the most part,

901
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:50,900
and they all have different colored
jackets to, this is what my job is.

902
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,870
So the Thai massage ladies are all milfs,
they're all,

903
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,960
they're all older and they're not all
hot and some of them aren't even hot.

904
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,390
Then I saw one with the thigh massage
jacket that was young and beautiful and I

905
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:06,350
said, hey, Hey Thai massage my
massage. And she's like, ah.

906
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,180
She had a weird look and I
was like, what? What, what?

907
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,420
And then the old one that just gave me
one comes and goes, you don't want her.

908
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,190
And I was like, no, no,
no, I do. And she goes,

909
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,970
first day doesn't know what she's doing.
Lecture. And just perfect, perfect.

910
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:20,990
I want here. And she goes, no,
no, no, no, no, no. And she
goes, you don't want her, like,

911
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,670
I'll do it. I'll do it again.
I know what I'm doing. And I
go, no, no, no. I want her.

912
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:25,220
And she's like,
I'm not none now.

913
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,440
And they start speaking in
Chinese and they go like, okay.

914
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,310
And then all this shit I'm talking about,
the dreams came true.

915
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:37,050
They tell me to get up. I go into a
side room and she trains her on me.

916
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,020
I'm the Guinea pig. They never
even look at me. She's the,

917
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:44,070
the young ones like this. He
starts giving, he's like, no, no.

918
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:46,650
And she starts yelling like
this and they're having a fight,

919
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:50,190
arguing over my Dick, practicing,
giving me a hand job, and I'm like,

920
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,410
this is the best day of my life.
Wow.

921
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,370
I'm the Guinea pig of the girl that gets
trained on how to give a Thai massage

922
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:58,140
and you're in Macau and I'm in McKell.

923
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,420
He must've felt like you
in an Indiana Jones movie.

924
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,900
I always feel like I'm in an Indiana
Jones. I'm always short round.

925
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,000
I just stepping on session cookie.
That sounds incredible.

926
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,050
That sounds like the craziest freakiest
experience ever. It was, it was amazing.

927
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,250
And it,
it was nothing close to sexual for them.

928
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,080
I was just a fucking piece of meat and you
know, she was like, like this. No, no, no,

929
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:26,640
no, I'm not, I'm not like, I was like,

930
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,760
I want this to go on forever.
And you know, it's amazing.

931
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,530
So things like this happen and then,

932
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,910
and then I have you say, I say, fuck,

933
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,610
I talked about this shit.
You know, and it's like,

934
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,730
it's sort of like suicide to
just keep openly talk about.

935
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,770
But the freaky chicks that listened to me,

936
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,690
they hear me say a story like this and
then they're like, oh, I'll fucking,

937
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,330
I'll do some shit to him that he's never,
so why would you say it's suicide?

938
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:55,230
And talk about things like this.
Um,

939
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,590
there was a girl that I really liked
a long time ago when I did a different

940
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:02,490
podcast called Koreans gone bad.
And I was considering,

941
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:06,120
I've been single for eight years now
and I was considering dating her,

942
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:11,100
settling down and she goes for her
first thing was no more podcasts.

943
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,200
Like I can't be like with a dude that's
talking about people practicing handjobs

944
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,590
on his Dick, you know, which makes sense,
you know, you don't want to be with,

945
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,060
I wouldn't want to be with someone like
that. And you know, so it's so, you know,

946
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:28,670
when I put all my shit out there,
I'm on, I have my own podcast, uh,

947
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,250
DVD say were ever besides,
you know, also as a porn star,

948
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,010
but everyone else on the show and they
don't want to share that shit and that

949
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:39,900
makes sense. You know, they're not,
you know, but she knows who you are,

950
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,080
you know? Right, right. And
you are who you are. You're a,

951
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:47,820
you're a very interesting guy. The idea
that everyone has to be uniform. Right,

952
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:52,650
right. And then we all have to fit into
the same pattern of, of control. Well,

953
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:56,490
what's, what's happened is
I've turned into like, uh,

954
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,410
when guys look at a chicken,
they're like, she's a slut. Like,

955
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,470
that's what shouldn't your mail slot.
That's a chick you fuck.

956
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,960
But you would never take home to your mom.
That's how girls look at me now.

957
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,320
I think some do,
but some probably,

958
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:11,040
which I love don't they think that it's
probably like a challenge to be the girl

959
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:14,790
that cracks his, his, his mind
open. It's exciting to me cause,

960
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,390
cause this is what Mary guys,
this is what married guys say to me.

961
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,400
Why don't you get sick of it, Dave? No.

962
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,840
You know why they said
that you get sick of it.

963
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,000
They want you to join their misery.
Well this and,

964
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,270
and I, and I get it. Cause I,

965
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:29,280
I know like some famous people that do
fuck a lot and they say this shit like

966
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:32,560
you're getting dangerously close to start
sucking Dick. You know, once you start

967
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,070
it happens, you know, listen
to this. Listen to me.

968
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:39,030
This is the problem with married people,
right? This is coming from a duties. Okay.

969
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,720
All right.
Married people are much like,

970
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:44,950
people that want you to use the same cell
phone services. Then they're like, dude,

971
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:45,940
why are you with Verizon?

972
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,960
Atnt you can answer your phone well and
they get like real passionate about it.

973
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:53,260
They want you to be miserable
with them for whatever reason.

974
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:57,190
And it's not a knock on and t, it's just
an example, whether it's windows or PC,

975
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,280
there's people that want
you to use what they use.

976
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,500
And people who are married and like,
C'mon Dude,

977
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,840
why don't you fucking get
married man and become one of us?

978
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,760
They just want you to,

979
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,710
they have accepted this new
stage of existence and they
want for whatever reason,

980
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,700
everybody else to be exactly like them
or it becomes uncomfortable cause I do

981
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:16,361
the same thing.
I go,

982
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:18,850
why don't you just get divorced and
come fuck all these girls with me.

983
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,220
Take my sloppy seconds. You know, I got
hit with a placebo. Take some shrapnel,

984
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,580
you know, let's take my sloppy
seconds. What are, and I don't eat say,

985
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,670
and you know what? I don't give a shit,
dude. I'm in. I don't you go first.

986
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,480
I'll take sloppy seconds.
Podcast.

987
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:38,440
Is that an m e double s guys are like,
oh dude,

988
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,490
you're going to fuck a girl. I was like,
you guys all go first. You can go first.

989
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:45,490
You can take sloppy seconds. I'll
go through, I'll go last. Wow.

990
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,180
Joe and Brian's come out of
how

991
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,620
I saw. How dare you don't
get, I don't give a fuck.

992
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,980
Well you're that would,
yeah,

993
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,590
I can see what I'm girls would have
a problem with Joe. I understand.

994
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,680
I understand that because it's sort of
true. They go, don't you get sick of that?

995
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,700
Another sex story,
another fucking quadruple hand job.

996
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,280
Another like Tom,

997
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,550
I have a problem with people that have
a problem with people that don't get

998
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:15,700
tired of shit.
Like why do you care?

999
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,260
People have called me a massage
and this says I love love women.

1000
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:25,380
I love them and I'm not sick of it.
Every time I have sex again it's,

1001
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,950
I can see the feelings of maybe
I'll get bored of this one day,

1002
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,170
but in eight years I haven't.
Why is that a point of concern for you?

1003
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,670
If you're a happy person,

1004
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,940
if life truly is a temporary existence
and if you are a good person,

1005
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,220
you're a very nice guy. So aren't those,
those bases are covered. Then why? What,

1006
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,880
what difference? I'm going
to do something. I'm going
to do some math for you. Oh,

1007
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,893
Jesus.

1008
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,860
I'm 80% happy.
80% of my life.

1009
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:56,500
I'm happy with how I'm living it.
What I'm doing.

1010
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,390
20% of my life is miserable. I look
at married people, I go, I want that.

1011
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,290
I look at this and that. But I go, at the
end of the day when I do the math part,

1012
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:09,070
the Asian math park, I'm like,
my life is so fucking awesome.

1013
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:14,550
Whatever that next 20% to fill up that
to make it a 100% whatever has to be sole

1014
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:20,380
fucking amazing that I'm going to
fucking risk what I have right now.

1015
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,980
You know?
So there's parts of my

1016
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,860
life that I'm like, Oh shit.
You know, I don't have a wife.

1017
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,650
I don't have kids that say, I love you
dad. She'd like that. But you know what?

1018
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,840
80% pretty good. Don't have to give
that up to you know. But you don't know,

1019
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:36,860
Dave, you don't know the love of
a child. That's some shit. I know.

1020
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:40,280
But you'll also don't know the love of
two fucking women fighting over your Dick

1021
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:43,530
that don't speak English.
You know, like, like,

1022
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,470
so this is what I think either or,
right.

1023
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,700
It doesn't matter.

1024
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:53,660
I know the real promise people want it
to be the way they're living and who

1025
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:56,930
gives a shit. I don't say never. You don't
want someone goes, hey Dave, are you gay?

1026
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,390
I go, not yet. I don't
know. I might be one day,

1027
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,360
so I might be married one day I put
Google, are you gonna get married?

1028
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,390
And I used to say, no, I'm never getting
married, but I might one day I don't,

1029
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,280
I don't know if I'm not
here. You know, there,

1030
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,900
there's nothing wrong with
anything you're saying.

1031
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,810
But here's the thing that I do see with
guys that fuck a lot is they get into,

1032
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:18,170
you know, this, that the
group sex, anal threesomes,

1033
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,730
then it goes to trainees. Shemales
sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah,

1034
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:27,020
I take trainees is derogatory or ts,
dude,

1035
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:32,080
I got attacked by the transgender trainee
is like saying Nigger or Jack or you

1036
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:39,470
say ts or trans or transsexual.
Like,

1037
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:42,830
you know when midgets getting
mad for it's little people or uh,

1038
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,210
what's fs with the ts? I Dunno. So,

1039
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,370
but you know, you, you keep, you know,

1040
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:53,480
it's when you catch a Hugh grant or Eddie
Murphy in there with like a weird look,

1041
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,760
cause they've already
fucked Elizabeth Hurley.

1042
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,720
They've already fucked the
hottest supermodels and then
they want something else,

1043
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:03,440
you know, so I understand that too. And
people are like, Dave, the path you're on,

1044
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,620
you're going to start letting guys
suck your Dick just, just for fun,

1045
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,590
just to feel the stubble on your
balls. You know, you're getting there.

1046
01:01:09,591 --> 01:01:13,430
And I'm like, it's possible. Right?
It's possible. Anything's possible, man.

1047
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,120
I see fucking blue snakes in this
room right now as your friend.

1048
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,790
I would say it's possible.
And I would say don't worry,

1049
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,190
because it's not the worst thing
that can happen to you. Right.

1050
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,520
There's a lot worse shit. But I'm going
to bring all this shit back to Mexico.

1051
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,800
So this is what's going on in my life.
And,

1052
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:33,200
and people tell me Shit about the red
rope, you know, but I get to Mexico,

1053
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:37,310
I'm not there to fuck, I'm there to
paint. But you know the thing about love,

1054
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,530
the funny thing I'm
thinking about love too,

1055
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,480
you never know when it's going to hit,
right?

1056
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,140
You should be entering through bead doors.

1057
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:51,140
Some of those beat doors that they used
to have when you would buy porn when you

1058
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:55,850
were a kid in Mexico. I painted with, uh,

1059
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,120
one of the last living, uh,
Mexican surrealists, Pedro
Pedro Fair, Fraserburgh Berg,

1060
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,940
which was an amazing experience.
Actual name, Pedro Fraserburgh. Pedro.

1061
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,710
He's amazing.
He's old school.

1062
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:10,940
He's like 80 years old still
drinks like Moscow smokes and just,

1063
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,200
we just sat and painted.

1064
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:17,260
But I also met the greatest comedian
of all time of all fucking Joey Diaz.

1065
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,910
Uh, no, no, no, no. Not

1066
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:25,220
going to use. It's funny, but
this, this is on some next level.

1067
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:29,910
What's this guy's name again?
Pedro of Berg Frey. Frey doe. Uh,

1068
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,400
he's a Jewish Mexican, so it's hilarious.
I'm looking him up. Oh, there he is.

1069
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,230
He's like, he's like, love your
mother. Fuck the MC. Escher of a,

1070
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:40,260
of Mexican art and you know,
so I'm having like this,

1071
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,280
I'm painting with him for the show.
I'm painting my own shit and Oh,

1072
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,490
you never know when love's
going to hit you. You know?

1073
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:50,430
So I meet this girl in Mexico
and Mexican girlfriend.

1074
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,400
My friends love calling her that and uh,

1075
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:55,470
she doesn't have a phone
that I can text her.

1076
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,630
So we have a super like WB Dawson's creek
kind of relationship where she lives

1077
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,900
two blocks from my
studio and to contact me,

1078
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:08,550
she has to throw rocks or lighters or
sticks at my window. So that's beautiful.

1079
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,780
So I'm like, cool, this is what it
feels like to be a normal person.

1080
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:17,640
Every morning I wake up and I have a job
to paint the show. It's not like, oh,

1081
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:19,560
next week I'm going to be in Cambodia,
next week.

1082
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,100
It's like every day I'm painting.
So that feels regular.

1083
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,190
And now I have this chick that
really likes me. She's an architect,

1084
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,330
I like her and this is what it feels
like to have a girlfriend, you know?

1085
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,250
So I'm like,
cool.

1086
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,190
And she's super busy so she doesn't
have that much time for me anyways.

1087
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:40,320
And we didn't have sex right away.
I really liked her and uh,

1088
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:43,350
she did this weird move that we
talk about on our show all the time,

1089
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:46,290
which is black people when
they have sex with asa,

1090
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,830
they never take their shoes off or
their socks off. Then he traction.

1091
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,330
It's a weird thing. Like they'll, she says
they'll even take their pants off too,

1092
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,270
and their shoes to take the pants
off and then put the shoes back on.

1093
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,610
They want to be able to fuck with
like a lot of force behind it.

1094
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:03,510
And she was the same way. She's
like, she's like, uh, I don't,

1095
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:06,390
I won't take my socks off. The first
time we did it, the lights are off.

1096
01:04:06,391 --> 01:04:09,030
She's like, I'm not taking
my socks off. I'm like, oh,
like black guys. And she goes,

1097
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,420
no, like woody Allen. And I go,
oh, I don't stop saying that.

1098
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,240
So I'm fucking her in the whole
time. She's like, like woody Allen,

1099
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,250
like woody Allen. I'm like,
stop saying Woody Allen.

1100
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,480
And so I really liked this girl.
I'm starting to, to, to, you know,

1101
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,860
this is a joke that I've killed,

1102
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:27,380
but I keep saying it's the worst STD
you could possibly catch feelings. Uh,

1103
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,890
so I like her and yeah,
and, uh, it's going good.

1104
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:37,680
And also on the show became a relationship
advice or David Cho and one night,

1105
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:42,270
cause she loves drinking. She's
a hard drinking, Mexico sloppy.

1106
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:47,070
We're having sloppy sex. And she
goes, you like my little piece?

1107
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:52,200
And I go, what? And she goes,
uh, I have a little piece.

1108
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,780
I go and, and her English
isn't perfect, so I go,

1109
01:04:54,781 --> 01:04:57,150
I don't know what you're saying right now.
And she goes,

1110
01:04:57,151 --> 01:05:01,740
it's really shy and it doesn't
come out all the time. And
I go, what? And she goes,

1111
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:06,630
you know, like a little penis. And I go,
and the thing is, every, every night,

1112
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,610
every day that I painted in Mexico,
my hands are caked in pain, right.

1113
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,320
And I would come home and I'd scrub them.
So like she would let me finger her,

1114
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:18,010
you know, and girls, you know Joe, you

1115
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,070
know how many your urinary tracking
podcast is the greatest thing that's ever

1116
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:21,904
happened in my life.

1117
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:26,430
You know how many urinary track infections
these hands have given. I know. No I, I,

1118
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,490
I, I cut my nails, I
scrub them, I get all,

1119
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,650
even with the scrubbing I get
some pain on still. But you know,

1120
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:35,050
if I'm painting a giant mural like that,
I'm going for it.

1121
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:36,880
And my hands are covered in paint.
And then the,

1122
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,300
the chemicals he used to take
the pain off as well. Right?

1123
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,020
Doesn't that linger in the scanner?
Exactly.

1124
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:45,100
So I go home and I spend like hours
cleaning my hands cause I want to finger,

1125
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,610
you know, can you get a check drunk with
Turpin time? I'm sure you can. You know,

1126
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:52,560
it seems like that would
absorb. Yeah. Somehow

1127
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,710
that guy's weird clean because
we're stupid. Don't say shit.

1128
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:01,810
If you just stopped and thought
about half the shit you said,

1129
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:03,790
just cut out half of them,
you'd be amazing.

1130
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,430
He'd be like the greatest
podcast side kick of all time.

1131
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,520
So right now you're number two.
What?

1132
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,190
What do you get from number one is
what do you do from that? Joe? You,

1133
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,560
you started having sex with
a girl you really like,

1134
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,390
she doesn't speak perfect English and
I don't know what she tells you in the

1135
01:06:19,391 --> 01:06:22,700
middle of the night. She has an extra
piece that only comes out sometimes. Ah,

1136
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:25,810
you would have to really decide how much
you liked her. I really did like her.

1137
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:27,910
And so what difference does it mean?
I've seen I've had to grow up.

1138
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:32,860
What does it mean? She said
it and immediately my brain
goes, oh, my transgender.

1139
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:37,420
Well, she thought she said it.
And immediately my brain goes,

1140
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,070
oh my God, I'm gonna lose my boner right
now. I'm like, but it only got harder.

1141
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't, I don't know what that
like. And so means you're a savage.

1142
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:50,300
You enjoying the real prime illness.
I tried to laugh it off. I was like,

1143
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:55,480
what are you talking about? Like I tried
to like, then you came over like a rhino.

1144
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,610
As soon as, as soon as she says
it, I, I go for the fingers. Right.

1145
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:06,790
I'm searching and she goes, it's shy.
It doesn't come out all the time. I go,

1146
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,370
maybe it's my brain is thinking.
As soon as she walked out that door,

1147
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:11,930
I'm going to Google.
Hermaphrodite is,

1148
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:15,700
is that even how it works at
a penis is inside the vagina.

1149
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:21,340
My Dick is inside her vagina. She has
a Dick in there are dicks or rubbing.

1150
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,850
Right now her little Dick
is going into my day.

1151
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,460
Most likely it's an enlarged clitoris,
right? Yeah. No, no. Her clit was fine.

1152
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,310
You know,
I looked at the clit,

1153
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,680
she said it was inside and it doesn't
come out all the time. Wait a minute.

1154
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:36,590
She seemed a real thing or did you like
look this up? Like in medical journey?

1155
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,350
I looked it up.
I couldn't find a picture of that.

1156
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:40,830
But what did you do with the girl
that's like [inaudible] her mat.

1157
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,440
So this is a hermaphrodite girl that's
like that. What it is, it's like,

1158
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:46,090
this is like right on
the top of the penis.

1159
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:48,910
There's some girls have this little thing
that's comes out and it looks like a

1160
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,880
little baby. I can't fit. I've seen that.

1161
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,390
I've seen women who have enlarged click
tourists and it comes out and it looks,

1162
01:07:58,391 --> 01:08:02,790
um, you know, it looks like a little
penis, but this is not that high.

1163
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:07,870
She had a normal a
clitoris and I'm searching.

1164
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:09,790
I don't,
and here's the thing,

1165
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,350
it's a weird thing to say
someone to someone during sex.

1166
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:15,970
It's weird thing to

1167
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,080
say. You got to bring it up. You're
going to bring it up. Bring it up now.

1168
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:23,020
So listen, bitch, don't pretend you
wait and join the sweet boy pussy. Well,

1169
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:26,770
let's be honest, and this is a
lot of things, and it's, and it's,

1170
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:31,790
it's a weird thing to say. This
is many things. Yeah. I mean she,

1171
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,230
you enjoying the shit out of a bitch?

1172
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:36,540
She's constantly fucking herself and she's
like, oh, your dick got harder. Yeah.

1173
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,380
Gas,
right?

1174
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:42,220
Yeah. I'm going to look for images. Human
Hermaphrodite. Okay. Do you find it?

1175
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:47,350
Oh, it's very odd. I don't want to see
what you're looking at right now. Ooh,

1176
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:51,400
it's not what I thought it is.
It's a fascinating,

1177
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:55,090
and because I overanalyze everything,
I start thinking, am I gay now?

1178
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,920
And there's a, there's a
little, uh, liberating feeling.
I'm like, yes, finally,

1179
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:03,040
I'm gay. There's nothing about this
girl. Let me see her face. If she,

1180
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:07,720
and you know nothing about this chick
that's male, she's a beautiful girl.

1181
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:10,810
She's cute. That might be a
little hot. Then I'm like,

1182
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:14,230
I found the perfect man woman
because the technical, well,

1183
01:09:14,231 --> 01:09:17,260
I hang out with my guy friends all day.
I go on Bro dates and I'm like, man,

1184
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:20,230
I wish you had a pussy. Wow.
That was just so weird to say.

1185
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,610
I don't know if I would keep eating
or on a lunch date. And you're like,

1186
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:28,390
how am I am I might need my, uh, I
need my energy to fight this dude off.

1187
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,400
I don't know what the
fuck's going down next.

1188
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,860
No, you don't have guy friends. Let's
go. I could rip you if I wanted. No,

1189
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,770
Greg Greg did.

1190
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:39,120
Simmons has a very funny joke about if
he was trapped on a deserted island and

1191
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:42,510
you get to pick his wife or one of his
friends, he would go, I would take it.

1192
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:48,510
This is great. It's fucking funny. And
he's like, because we would just laugh.

1193
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,690
We'd go in the woods and jerk off and
then we'd just be hanging out with each

1194
01:09:51,691 --> 01:09:55,700
other and it goes.
If it was by wife who like pop pop,

1195
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,870
I'm not doing that bit justice. By the
way, Greg, Craig, I'm paraphrasing.

1196
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,260
Pick a guy that you have to be bigger
than him in cases that day comes when you

1197
01:10:04,261 --> 01:10:05,290
want to rape your friend.
Awesome.

1198
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:06,900
Why would you rate your friend
if you were really friends?

1199
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:09,820
You didn't jerk each other off. That's
true. Just that's what I owned together.

1200
01:10:09,821 --> 01:10:13,160
I'd jerk you off down, but hold
a butt. Just touching. Buttholes

1201
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:18,940
not as gay, but it's all gay. You're all
trying to come. It's gay. You should just,

1202
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,580
if you were like at that point we like
rubbing bought halls and you tell him to

1203
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:25,260
check like look baby. I mean we
were on that island for 10 years.

1204
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,890
The worst I did his rub
bottles would be like,

1205
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,830
why didn't you just suck each other off?
Who Cares?

1206
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:32,280
You pooped in the rabbit island.
He pooped into my boat.

1207
01:10:32,281 --> 01:10:36,450
I pooped in his boat wherever I can.
I mean it's not just whether or not,

1208
01:10:36,451 --> 01:10:39,840
how long would you hold out in prison? You
know, it's, would you want to hold out,

1209
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:43,430
you want to hold out or would you just
say it's an amazing blow each other half

1210
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,470
to just send your mind somewhere else.
You know the whole thing.

1211
01:10:46,471 --> 01:10:48,150
If you're getting raped and
you just want to go somewhere,

1212
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,580
we're not even talking about rape,
we're just talking about gay sex.

1213
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:53,760
Like you blowing your buddy cause you're
both just collecting coconuts for the

1214
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:57,240
rest of your life on this deserted island.
Occasionally one, if he gets a boner,

1215
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,780
come on man. Can you just pretend you
regrow girl bro, I fucking love you.

1216
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,930
I shaved you from that snake. First of
all. You right handed or left handed?

1217
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,330
I'm right handed but I use my
left hand for a lot of things.

1218
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:06,611
Well,

1219
01:11:06,611 --> 01:11:10,610
I'm left handed and I jerk off with my
left hand so we could do side by side and

1220
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:14,080
also, but the thing
is, did you do that for

1221
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,190
holding an iPad with your right and you
get like really good with the iPad and

1222
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,090
you're just like, oh I'm amazing. I'm
like Tom Cruise in minority report.

1223
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,220
But I just closed my eyes and I just try
to pretend like it was my dick. Okay,

1224
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:26,970
I'm drinking off mine.

1225
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,520
It'd be like doing the stranger when you
sit on your hand and you make it go now

1226
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,410
it was a girl for five minutes.
Jesus Christ. How hard would it be?

1227
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,300
Why don't you just fucking with something
hot oil in your hand and jerk your

1228
01:11:35,301 --> 01:11:38,760
friend off? How much Jesus Christ, it's
not gay. You helping each other out.

1229
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,220
He both trapped.
Is it gay to get a massage?

1230
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,270
I used to think it was gay to get a
massage by men until I realized that it is

1231
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:48,690
gay until they stick their fingers in
your bubble. I'm a manly man and I design,

1232
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,160
I need hard massages and just get a
regular massage. Oh cause I'm thick. Well

1233
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:58,080
I know a couple of Thai girls that
would take care of you ever go to a guy?

1234
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,320
Trust me dude, they can't do it. I get,

1235
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:03,930
I go through these torture deep tissue
massage sessions that you need like a

1236
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:06,660
really strong dude or I do it.
I just,

1237
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:10,230
I'm in pain right now because they've
got a tight chick to just destroy me last

1238
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:14,010
night. Oh really? I was crying. I
was like what is that? What stuff?

1239
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:17,850
She probably wouldn't make me cry though
cause they were a roommate or a manly

1240
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:21,840
man. I'm a savage tribe when it comes to
Thai massages when I step on your back

1241
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:23,970
especially that's,
that is pretty intense shit.

1242
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,200
I went to a one once and this lady was
standing on either side of my back and

1243
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:33,180
she had her hands clamped on my wrist
and had my arms like stretch back and she

1244
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:36,060
was just walking up and down
my back and I was like, wow.

1245
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:39,420
Like this lady is probably done
this a thousand million times.

1246
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,690
She just had it down. It was
almost like a Jujitsu move. Right?

1247
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,660
Like you get really good at a triangle
and then you lock it in tight.

1248
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,190
It's just as strong in that position.

1249
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,800
That's how she was with
this crazy arm thing.

1250
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:54,030
When's the first time you go to massage
by a guy? Like years ago? A long time ago.

1251
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:58,700
First Time was this, uh, this
Mexican dude who, uh, worked for one.

1252
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,980
I think it was a Mexican boxing team.
But you had the conversation in your head,

1253
01:13:01,981 --> 01:13:05,850
right? I don't give a shot. I know
he was, he wasn't gay. He was a male.

1254
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:08,280
I'm saying for you, you're like,
we fucked a couple of times,

1255
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:10,830
but it was just because I owed
him money. You had, you had,

1256
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,490
you had had massages by women
and you had made up your mind.

1257
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,060
It's not storing enough. Actually, no.
I need a man to do it. I actually, no,

1258
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,240
I'd never had a massage by a woman. I
had never had a massage period. Oh, okay.

1259
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:24,410
This guy was shocked that I was
a competitive athlete. Right.

1260
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,100
And then I never had a massage
and I had done all this, uh,

1261
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,810
martial arts competition and everything,
and I never had a size when I was, uh,

1262
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,810
when I was young,
like my approach to nutrition,

1263
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,920
vitamin supplementation and all that,
it was really kind of crappy, you know?

1264
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:41,400
And so I never got massages when I was
competing. I never did any of that shit.

1265
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:41,670
Right.

1266
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:45,330
This one dude who was a friend of a friend
who had a problem with his shoulder,

1267
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,380
he's like, I'm telling you man, this
dude like change the way my body moved.

1268
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:53,220
Like he's, it doesn't feel good. It
fucking hurts. Right. But when it's over,

1269
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,330
like everything just sort of snaps
and flows and moves as good. He just,

1270
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,040
he loosens you up and he
had this no happy ending,

1271
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,380
but he had this way of, uh, it was like a,

1272
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:09,420
I think it's called the a a pressure
release or point release or something like

1273
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:11,980
that. Style of massage where
would just fuck trigger

1274
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,640
release. It would just pinch down
on these muscles and pull it across.

1275
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:19,450
It fucking hurts, man. It's
similar in a way to rolfing.

1276
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:21,340
Have you ever had that
done? Yeah. You know,

1277
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:26,050
rolfing is another like really brutal
form of a massage. I've had it all, man.

1278
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:30,340
That stuff's great though,
that, that stuff. If you work
out a lot. I was like, what?

1279
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:33,310
I went,
I had that conversation with myself too.

1280
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:36,280
Like years ago when I lived in New York,
there's a Russian bathhouse,

1281
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,850
like on the lower east side. Uh, it's
like a shoe fits and all that shit.

1282
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,120
And I was like, shit, I feel like shit. I
should get a massage. And they were like,

1283
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:45,610
there's only do care. There's
only guys. And I was like,

1284
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,430
at that point I'd only gotten
a massage from women. I'm like,

1285
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:53,410
what the fuck do I care? You know,
it's not sexual. And it's like guy too.

1286
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,600
Well, it's like I had a problem
of getting an a man's Dick. Well,

1287
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:01,660
I had a problem of getting boners every
time I go to massage, no matter what,

1288
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:05,980
just cause I was loved. Someone touching
me like that, you know? So I had the,

1289
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:09,340
you remember the Seinfeld where George
is like, I think it moved with the guys.

1290
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:13,360
So I'm like, I don't even want
to mistakenly get a boner.
But I was like, whatever.

1291
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:17,190
It was like a old, like a eastern European
guy. Bunch of fate or looking dude.

1292
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,530
I'm like, whatever. So it looked
like he was like an old man.

1293
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:24,610
He's got to compare him to a movie
star. Uh, is he in your saying sorry,

1294
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:28,140
he looked like bank is are who
the hell's that? Uh, he's like,

1295
01:15:28,141 --> 01:15:29,130
be watching indie films.

1296
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:34,300
Just still black and white
now. He's an actor. He,

1297
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:37,690
I think he was a Vincent
Gallo Dad in Buffalo 66

1298
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:44,780
that was supposed to be a
good move is really good. He
spoke gambling. Yeah. Okay.

1299
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:50,020
Wait. Why do you want this visual right
now? I don't know. I'm trying to, oh,

1300
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:53,760
Ben Gazzara. Yeah. Oh, that
guy's a bad motherfucker.

1301
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,560
So I'm like, lot of shit. So I'm like,

1302
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:59,530
I'm not going to get a boner during a
banker's hour massage. Oh yes, she would.

1303
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:02,140
I would if it was Ben
Gazzara just out of respect.

1304
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:05,080
And also I hadn't gotten a lot of
massages where I take all my clothes off.

1305
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:06,990
I always like to leave my
boxers on or something.

1306
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,740
So I get in the room and he's
like, he's dead. He goes, take off,

1307
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:14,230
take your clothes off. And
I'm like, all right, whatever.

1308
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:18,970
And then he puts the oil on and he
started massaging my butt and um,

1309
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,600
it's the, but is the the
exclamation point on his massage.

1310
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:27,710
It's shoulders back to bud
calves back to button. I go,

1311
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:32,650
hey, um, you know, butts not that sore
doesn't, doesn't really like, it's cool.

1312
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:33,484
Like thanks.

1313
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:37,270
And then he just started needing my butt
and start talking about how he misses

1314
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:41,200
home and oh. And I was like,
Shit. I was like, dude,

1315
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:44,950
you got to stop touching my ass, man. I'm,
I'm over it. Like please stop doing that.

1316
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:46,430
And then he kept doing
it. I was like, all right.

1317
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,480
He kept doing it and she told him
to stop while he was in his zone,

1318
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:52,030
like just talking to himself,
like pretending like it wasn't happening.

1319
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:55,330
He was ready to suck your
Dick. I was like, all right.
And that was the last time.

1320
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:58,660
How many decks do you think you
probably suck that week? Him Or me? Oh,

1321
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,130
uh, it's probably his move,
man. Yeah. I miss home.

1322
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:10,070
The only way to get away from this miss
his penis in mouth. Come on. I just

1323
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,190
had the worst massage PR thing.
I'm Kinda, I think I'm done now.

1324
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,500
I was in Santa Monica and it was like,

1325
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,210
I was trying to think carefully if you
want to say this on the Oh yeah, yeah,

1326
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:22,250
it's fine. But uh, I was actually thinking
like, I'll just get a legit massage.

1327
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:26,330
This place was open really late though,
and it, but it looked really nice outside,

1328
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,250
you know, so I was like, uh, are you open?

1329
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:32,420
And I think they might've just sent the
last girl home because I saw this pretty

1330
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:37,250
decent looking girl walk out the
side door and then a nine 30,

1331
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,490
you know,
instead of on really for the most part,

1332
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:43,400
no legit massage happening
after nine 30. Yeah. Well,

1333
01:17:43,401 --> 01:17:46,370
I would say it's like most of the
massage places closed down around nine,

1334
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,950
you know? Yeah. But this was the right
down the street from Bolus. I'm like,

1335
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:52,530
all right, can't be too crazy.
Right. All right. So, uh, I,

1336
01:17:52,531 --> 01:17:56,270
I go in and this really old fat
Asian lady was there and I was like,

1337
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,090
are you open? And she's like, Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. Should I go in the room?

1338
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,940
And I now just always take
my all my clothes off.

1339
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:05,190
I don't even keep boxers on all the time
now just in case if you know the girls

1340
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,940
really hot, that's cool, you know?

1341
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:11,840
But I just wanted a real massage and
then she walks in wearing like a dress,

1342
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,880
no underwear and like cut really
short and just fat and old.

1343
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,780
Like, like a grandma old, like I'm,

1344
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:21,200
and she was dressed up like
totally changed clothes.

1345
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:24,410
I heard somebody go to the bathroom,
so that means she went into the bathroom,

1346
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:26,720
washed herself, you know,
and stuff like that.

1347
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:30,640
Cause she was smelled like this
perfume and then she joined,

1348
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,260
she gets on top of me,
removes the towel,

1349
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:37,940
gets on top of me and just
kept on bouncing like I
hurt a vagina was like on my

1350
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,970
butthole. Like it was just like, she's
like, yeah, army just bouncing and it's,

1351
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:46,610
she's just like not really massaging
or anything. Uh, I don't think so.

1352
01:18:46,611 --> 01:18:50,390
I think I was freaked out
and so I was just like, play
dead, play dead, play dead.

1353
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:54,440
Like don't even like don't make
a noise. I'm thinking like, oh,

1354
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:58,610
I hope she's like really gets off me
if she just was stop, start massage me.

1355
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,190
So suddenly she starts rubbing her
hands on my back and hurt shit,

1356
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:05,150
calluses or something because it just
scratched and it was, it hurt though.

1357
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:09,800
Like it felt like she was like stabbing
me like hurry, like, so I'm just like, ah,

1358
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,140
ah. And then like she flips me over
eventually and stuff like that.

1359
01:19:13,141 --> 01:19:16,100
At any point where you're like, I'm
going to just leave right now. Um, no,

1360
01:19:16,101 --> 01:19:19,670
because I didn't want to be
rude and I thought she would,

1361
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,760
she was kind of trying and then she,
oh,

1362
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:25,100
she started playing with
my butt and stuff. Like,

1363
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:28,010
like a lot of places give you prostate
massages and I'm trying to like tighten

1364
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:28,844
it up.

1365
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,890
A lot of places give you prostate certain
pretty popular compared to what I'm,

1366
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:40,580
I'm really good now at like what you said
like when I'm uncomfortable like shit

1367
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:42,760
like that I will give you
bad at leaving cause yeah.

1368
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:46,090
But like now I walk out of movies, I
walked out of massage. You just get up.

1369
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,070
I'm just like, I'm not into this
anymore and I just get up and I leave.

1370
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,230
I should have done that yet.
It ended really bad.

1371
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:52,460
And then when she flipped me over,

1372
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:55,220
she just kept on like touching
my dick and I'm like, no,

1373
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,320
it wasn't like this and stuff like that.

1374
01:19:57,321 --> 01:20:00,800
And then she finally gave up and then
left and then came in and watch like you

1375
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:04,150
didn't get hard for her? No I
couldn't. No, I seriously, I did. I,

1376
01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:06,770
I was so grossed out,
I was like freaking out with hide my eyes.

1377
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:08,010
Cause like how many
times have you been back?

1378
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,310
I've never get back that. How many times
have you jerked off thinking about it?

1379
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:15,660
Never. She's not in my spank bank.
It was too gross. My spank bank,

1380
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,260
there's a massage place by my house,
which that,

1381
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:23,680
listen, let's not name names. No,
no, no. I live, I live in Korea.

1382
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:28,370
Tell, oh cool. And I, I've been going to
this place for over 10 years, you know.

1383
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:32,060
Did they have young girls? No,
it's uh, it's not a sex place.

1384
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:34,910
It's a complete legitimate massage place.
And like Joe,

1385
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,630
when I go to a place when it's
like some white chick or something,

1386
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,650
it's not a good massage.

1387
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:43,100
You go to the Thai place or you go to the
Korean place where they look like your

1388
01:20:43,101 --> 01:20:46,820
mother fucking rip your Shit Up,
Dude.

1389
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:51,500
They go fucking crazy. Like you don't,
they give you, they get in there,

1390
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:54,020
they stand on your back,
they pound your shit and yeah,

1391
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:58,330
afterwards you feel all felt and
nice and flowy, whatever. Geos,

1392
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:03,040
boxing gym in Burbank. There's msis
parlor that's connected to, no, no, no.

1393
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,810
That's a good, legitimate,
solid, legit massage.

1394
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:10,810
So this is a place I've been going to for
10 years. Not that much. But you know,

1395
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:14,060
every time I know that I
just want a regular massage.

1396
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,750
I know that some chick that looks like
my mom or my aunt is going to give me a

1397
01:21:17,751 --> 01:21:20,700
great massage and then
I'm done. You know? So I,

1398
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,860
but I haven't been back for a few years.
I moved to New York, whatever. Um,

1399
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:30,260
and my way of dealing with that whole
thing with me puking before going on shows

1400
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,130
is I started getting massages and I like
hard ones. I'm like, it has to be a hard,

1401
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,700
deep tissue. And I was like, I'm going
to go back to that place. And uh,

1402
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:42,400
so I already told this story, but I'll
tell it quick. It's the same stories.

1403
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:47,390
Yours all the, it's nine 30
or 10. All the, the, you know,

1404
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:51,530
they're not ugly, but they're just
older and it's just, the Mama saw the,

1405
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,790
she's like, I'm like, oh,
I'll just come back. And she's
like, no, no, no. Just come,

1406
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,290
come in. And I'm like, okay.

1407
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,670
Never once even thought that I was
going to get a hand job, you know,

1408
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,930
I get in there, she comes
in and then I'm like, oh,

1409
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:08,960
the fucking lady the receptionist has
given me. And I'm like, all right, cool,

1410
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:14,210
amazing massage cracks.
My neck cracking sounds back,

1411
01:22:14,211 --> 01:22:17,560
just fucking doing it.
And then, uh, you know,

1412
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:20,240
she flips me over and starts
jerking me off and I'm like,

1413
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:26,300
oh, that's what I thought when I came in.
It was always like a $40 massage place,

1414
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:30,200
like a cheap Korean massage, and then
it was $75 now or something like that.

1415
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,140
I was like,
what a $30 increase in like,

1416
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,190
what the fuck is that? That's
a bargain and a half. You know,

1417
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,730
what could they be doing different?
Maybe it's an incense tax,

1418
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,900
maybe it's scented candles that they
have to pay. She flips me over. Yeah.

1419
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:48,310
And, and she goes like, like she just
does a couple of ball flux, like,

1420
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:51,910
do you want this? And I was like, I
was like, no. But I was like, yeah,

1421
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,920
no, but you were like 12.
Yeah, exactly. And I'm like,
there's, and I was like, Brian,

1422
01:22:57,921 --> 01:22:58,150
I was, yeah. I was like,

1423
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:01,570
there's no way I'm going to get hard,
but because she's a professional. Yeah.

1424
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:05,830
She was getting whatever. She did.
Lots of hot oil. Wow. I'm whoa.

1425
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:10,860
And then I'm pretty sure this is
a massage parlor fo the thing,

1426
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:14,830
the bell from someone else coming in.
Hello is someone in here? She goes, okay,

1427
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:19,810
wait, so mid sure. Tops mid
jerk. She stops and I here,

1428
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,230
you know it's like a small place. So I
hear their whole conversation. He's like,

1429
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:27,820
Hey, is Rachel or Jenny working tonight?
He's like, no, everyone go home. Ah Wait,

1430
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,810
10 minutes, maybe five minutes.
And I, and I get in the guys,

1431
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:35,260
you could tell he's like, no, I think
I'll call and be like, no, no, stay.

1432
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,930
I give you a discount, I'll give you
a $10 discount. And he's like, ah.

1433
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,800
And I'm sitting there and my
boners just go on. And I'm like,

1434
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:45,900
cause you're seeing her
actively be rejected. It's
bad on both fronts and just,

1435
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,170
and just like, I got a break, I'm like, I
could cut out. Right, right, right, right.

1436
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:53,130
I'm like,
I should leave and then leave.

1437
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:56,360
And then the negotiation is like,
he's one foot out the door. He's like,

1438
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,720
I don't know. He's like, no, no, no.
Come in. I'll be done in five. No, four,

1439
01:23:59,721 --> 01:24:03,140
three minutes. I'll be finished. Three
minutes. I didn't like. I'm like,

1440
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,080
okay,

1441
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,760
I'm going to get up. Okay, I'm going to,

1442
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,760
I'm going to like count to 10
in my head right now. Time nine,

1443
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,770
when I get this one,
I'm going to walk out the door.

1444
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:14,190
So I started sitting up and then she,
the guys like,

1445
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,310
I'm going to go and he left and she runs
back in and she goes, lay down and I go,

1446
01:24:17,311 --> 01:24:21,630
okay, it's that laid out and now
I'm deflated. I'm like, I said,

1447
01:24:21,631 --> 01:24:24,030
it's okay. I'm just going to go.
And she goes, no, no, no, no.

1448
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:27,450
And she starts up again and now she's
just playing with my wet noodle. It's not,

1449
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:31,470
it's like there's too much thought
in and I go, stop right there.

1450
01:24:31,471 --> 01:24:33,810
Is there a sad moment in life?
No.

1451
01:24:33,811 --> 01:24:36,960
It's tugging on your deck and you don't
want them to, yeah. I'm like, it's, it's,

1452
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,650
it's cool.
This lady's fit and it's a dark room.

1453
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:44,940
She doesn't give off. She's
a trained, trained assassin.

1454
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,240
She wasn't even worried for
a second. She was okay. Okay.

1455
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:54,390
She reaches up behind her and Tara
is a piece of Saran wrap and I go,

1456
01:24:54,391 --> 01:24:57,270
what's going to happen now?
I don't know what this is right now.

1457
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:01,210
And she fucking like put some shit on
my ass and lube and she's like puts the,

1458
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:05,490
she, she holds my legs up like this and
Taft's my legs like, like hold your legs.

1459
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:09,720
And I'm like, okay. So I'm holding
my legs like this and I go,

1460
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,140
I don't know what's going to happen
right now, but I'm going for it.

1461
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,210
She puts the Saran wrap
over my butthole and I go,

1462
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,090
she's gonna Lick my ass right now.
Like through the Saran wrap.

1463
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:19,720
Okay.

1464
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,790
To this day besides the
part where when I was a kid,

1465
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:24,700
then I put a vacuum cleaner on my
butthole. I've never felt this before.

1466
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:29,200
She didn't stick her tongue into
my bottle. She sucked my butthole,

1467
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:33,130
she put her lips around my
bottle and sucked and I was like,

1468
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:36,760
never felt that before. Whoa.
Dick gets hard immediately.

1469
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,170
A few seconds just shot a load
without even jerking off. Yeah, no,

1470
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:41,951
she jerked me off.

1471
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:46,951
But it was like how much time between
her putting the Saran wrap over your butt

1472
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,670
hole and you shooting a
load, how much time fit? 15
seconds to put the Saran wrap,

1473
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:56,200
got five seconds to shoot.
She was at a heart immediately.

1474
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,850
Like I was like,

1475
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:02,320
I've heard of girls putting their finger
up a guy's boat and licking it and

1476
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,000
right she the button,

1477
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:08,100
she sucked my bubble.
So I,

1478
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,680
I am filled with so much
shame. I'm like, Huh. I'm like,

1479
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:15,870
she's like, and you know, she
just throws a towel. I mean

1480
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:20,110
it's like, okay cool. Oh my
God. And I'm like, you know,

1481
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:24,850
does this lady, when she goes to the
supermarket and she buys the Saran wrap,

1482
01:26:24,851 --> 01:26:28,420
does the lady know what she's going
to use it for when she brings it home?

1483
01:26:28,421 --> 01:26:31,840
And the kids are like, grandma, why you
buy so much Saran wrap every week? Like,

1484
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:36,250
oh my God,
I go in the car and I go,

1485
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,550
I can never talk about this day.
And then I told him,

1486
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:42,940
yeah, I mean it was a dare you even
lie to yourself. Well, unlike Brian,

1487
01:26:42,941 --> 01:26:45,760
I've been back like several times
now. So, and where's this again?

1488
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,730
It was the hit hard times,
you know,

1489
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:53,710
it went from a totally legit place to
suck on asshole with Saran wrap place.

1490
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,920
You need to open your shit up a little
more and it's quit judging so much,

1491
01:26:56,921 --> 01:27:01,470
you know? Oh, he's not judging. I
had a horrible experience for kids.

1492
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,660
Her hands hurt.
She gave me zero and I saw she was,

1493
01:27:04,661 --> 01:27:07,840
he gave me some kind of massage. I
would probably have to be honest, man.

1494
01:27:07,841 --> 01:27:09,040
Just cause you had a good experience,

1495
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:11,350
doesn't mean you can't
accidentally wind up with a demon.

1496
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:14,500
We all know you could wind up with
a game. That's true. That's fit.

1497
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:18,490
An old lady in Pasadena, she
was soft hands. So it was nice.

1498
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:21,570
I won't say names or faces.
She grind it.

1499
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:26,380
She grinded on her butthole with her
guilt shaved Posi you know, come on man.

1500
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:28,870
What Gil if great grandma.

1501
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:34,140
I'm a little dark. So Joe, I got it.

1502
01:27:34,141 --> 01:27:34,620
So Dan,

1503
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,500
we keep going off all that fucking
story because one of the great stories,

1504
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,450
actually I tell you, it changed
my way of thinking about sweating.

1505
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,111
Here's the thing,

1506
01:27:43,111 --> 01:27:48,111
it's like that that experience was so
important and so funny and there's so few

1507
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:52,320
people that would express it with the
same kind of honesty and glee that you do

1508
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:57,321
it with that it's almost like a disservice
to man a kind if you decide to settle

1509
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,230
down.

1510
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:02,580
We have like a real hard time with
that and anybody who wants to stop your

1511
01:28:02,581 --> 01:28:05,670
podcast is a cultural criminal.
This is what I see

1512
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:07,420
do traveling a lot.
The,

1513
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,670
this is what I see in Chinese and Italian
culture and it's like in this society

1514
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:16,060
there's a lot of crying. Oh my God, my
husband cheated on me and it's like, yeah,

1515
01:28:16,061 --> 01:28:17,440
that's just sort of what guys do.

1516
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:21,640
There's sort of almost like an acceptance
in China and Italy where you got your

1517
01:28:21,641 --> 01:28:23,320
grandma and you got your wife.

1518
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,650
As long as you're handjobs and girlfriend,

1519
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:28,570
shit doesn't fuck with your family.

1520
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:33,430
It's almost like an understanding of
the wife knows you're going to go get a

1521
01:28:33,431 --> 01:28:37,000
massage parlor, hand jobs or
have a girlfriend and it's like,

1522
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:40,840
just don't put it in my face. You
know, like you have a business meeting,

1523
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:43,240
you guys are all going to fuck
hookers, get it, but don't,

1524
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:44,500
don't bring it back to me.

1525
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,020
That's it. A lot of European
cultures as well. Right?

1526
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,580
Like the prime minister of France didn't
he? I'll openly have, they're like,

1527
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,330
they're cool. They're just like, they're
like, I think Monica Bellucci said it.

1528
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,410
I want to ask you about this.
Right. This is an important subject.

1529
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:02,140
Okay. What do you think is the
cause for, I mean is it the,

1530
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:02,571
the,

1531
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:07,571
the sexual puritanism of America where
people would judge you on you being a

1532
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:09,960
nice person,
you having fun and just doing,

1533
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:13,320
having these experiences which are
readily out there for a lot of people that

1534
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:18,321
somehow or another it's perhaps perhaps
one of my lecturer exploitative or that

1535
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:22,440
people would have a problem with
the idea of using prostitution,

1536
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,510
but at the end of the day you're
not really hurting anybody.

1537
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:28,140
And is that one of the most
important issues to concentrate on?

1538
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:32,670
What is the reason why people
do concentrate on it and
get mad at you and judge

1539
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:36,210
you? And I think it has, it has
to be based on the insecurity.

1540
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:40,800
It has to be based on the idea that
are you kidding out what you're doing?

1541
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:44,210
Of course they would want to do it too.
Well, Hey, you have those sex in Dawn,

1542
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:47,010
dawn guys in here. So there's a
lot of like weird religious shit.

1543
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,050
Christopher Ryan,
the guys that wrote the sex at a guy.

1544
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:56,190
And so I think a lot of great guy
by the way. I think I am. Okay.

1545
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:57,700
So I went to the extreme version.

1546
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:02,280
No, that I just came back from
Afghanistan. Right. And you know,

1547
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:04,040
you're not supposed to
judge other cultures. Right.

1548
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:09,610
And I get there and I'm staying with a
guy who runs like all the networks in

1549
01:30:11,241 --> 01:30:14,510
Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein, and
he's letting us crash at his place.

1550
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:19,040
And everyone's like, oh man, it's so
backwards out there. Like the girls,

1551
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:22,550
they were the burkas and you only
see their eyes and Afghanistan,

1552
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,680
you don't even see the eyes.
It's a

1553
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:25,570
complete,

1554
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:28,730
you don't see like mosquito netting
and you don't see flesh like ghosts.

1555
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,920
They wearing gloves,

1556
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,390
the shit goes to the feet.
You don't see flesh at all.

1557
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:39,190
The dudes, what are they wearing?
Flip flops. Sweatpants, the chilling.

1558
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:43,930
And it's like, don't fucking touch
my girl. Don't fucking look at her.

1559
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,340
And, and you go back to this whole thing
with insecurity. That's what it is.

1560
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:51,700
It's like, Oh, if she cheats on you,
if she talked to another guy, yeah,

1561
01:30:51,701 --> 01:30:53,380
we stone her.
We'd beat the shit out of her.

1562
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:57,790
It's like the reason why the Taliban
has no problem getting female suicide

1563
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:00,130
bombers is because your life is miserable.

1564
01:31:00,131 --> 01:31:04,930
If you're a woman in fucking Afghanistan,
you know, you, your husband beats you.

1565
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,670
And if you go to the
police station to complain,

1566
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,520
then the fucking police beat
you for complaining. And it's,

1567
01:31:10,521 --> 01:31:14,920
it's just like we had, uh,
two girls that are westerners,

1568
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,660
so they didn't have to
wear the full burka,

1569
01:31:16,661 --> 01:31:18,370
but they still have to
like cover their hair.

1570
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:23,200
And wear jeans and long sleeve shirts
or whatever and they took us to a,

1571
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:27,070
they took us, they took me to a
calligraphy school to check out that like,

1572
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:32,170
like uh, Arabic like calligraphy style.
I love that shit. And they go, hey,

1573
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,450
if you, if we go to the roof right
now, we could see the whole city.

1574
01:31:34,451 --> 01:31:36,160
It's a beautiful view. I
go, coolest, check it out.

1575
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:40,090
So they went up first and I was like
drawing with some kid and then critter was

1576
01:31:40,091 --> 01:31:43,180
with me and he's like, Hey,
get up here right now. Get
up here. And I'm like, what?

1577
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:46,570
We run up to the thing,
the two girls,

1578
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:50,860
they were all standing on the ledge of
the roof looking out at the whole city,

1579
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,690
the junk yard tire shop below the
guys working at the tire shop.

1580
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:00,070
Look up and see two white girls and
they could see their face. They start

1581
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,490
jerking off, they pull their dicks
off the out and start jerking off.

1582
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:08,920
And I'll walk by like in a trance
and I'm like, and you're like, whoa,

1583
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:10,150
crazy, crazy. It's like,

1584
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,230
think about how much pussy you
already saw today without even trying,

1585
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:19,300
turning on the TV. A Victoria's
secret ad, a billboard, you see flesh,

1586
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,770
you go to the supermarket,

1587
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:24,580
you go to fucking whole foods where the
bitches are like wearing short shorts

1588
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:28,960
and it's sex is everywhere.
Think about being a Horny,

1589
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:32,920
horny Arab kid and then you see
a fucking chick, just her face.

1590
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:36,580
They couldn't control themselves and
then they saw us and then they stopped.

1591
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:40,240
But it was like they went into a trance
like that's amazing. It was amazing.

1592
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:43,570
I was like, I never got so much
joy watching another guy jerk off.

1593
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:47,770
Weird levels of like intense
religious respect to sex.

1594
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:52,110
It all goes back to fucking
while it. Well, whether it
does or it doesn't have it,

1595
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:56,830
it's all about control. But when you
see that control implemented on people,

1596
01:32:56,831 --> 01:33:00,400
there's always a rebound from it. Right.
There's some crazy reaction to it.

1597
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:04,420
Some fanatical explosive
reaction to it. Right? Yeah.

1598
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,520
We have a very real natural built in
response to someone trying to control us

1599
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:15,510
and we either go with it full heartedly
and make it like it's our idea or we

1600
01:33:15,701 --> 01:33:20,470
rebel against it and w w and we hate it
and we go the exact opposite direction.

1601
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:24,560
Like Catholic school girls who become
sluts, right? No, that's the wrong slot.

1602
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:27,730
Right? So that's a bad word. Love snow.
Slut shaming on the Joe Rogan experience.

1603
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:29,380
I don't believe in slots.

1604
01:33:29,381 --> 01:33:31,140
I think there's people that do
whatever the fuck they want it.

1605
01:33:31,141 --> 01:33:35,110
I'm just saying I agree with you.
This society is whatever.

1606
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,840
Every society has its problems.
For me personally,

1607
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:39,910
I think if I were to ever get married,
I don't,

1608
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,520
I don't want to get into like
some six swinger shit or whatever,

1609
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:47,150
but I think I need to be with like some
European or it's just hold out until the

1610
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:51,970
robots hold out. Until you can get
monogamous robots. What's that shit?

1611
01:33:51,971 --> 01:33:56,770
You just show me the silliest rift.
OCULUS rift. Don't, don't buy that.

1612
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:59,860
Don't buy that.
It's going to ruin your life and tell.

1613
01:33:59,861 --> 01:34:03,190
I know that I have to go to the mountains
and I fucking put up a high fence to

1614
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:05,890
keep the fucking crazy. Some of
those robots, like the shittier ones,

1615
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:08,920
and they're there in my, in my
closet I bought, I buy every,

1616
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:13,000
anytime someone's like, this is the next
best thing. I buy it with that thought,

1617
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:16,510
when I go to the mountains and
everyone's dead, at least I'll have this,

1618
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,570
but I don't open the plastic
cause I know it'll ruin my life.

1619
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,810
That's too freaky right now. When you're
dealing with things like, you know,

1620
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:27,790
rubber vaginas are fake. The boxes that
you stick your Dick into and the Gyri no,

1621
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:32,120
it's fake. Right? Even
though it's enjoyable, it's
pleasurable sexual experience,

1622
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:36,220
right? It's removed from
the sexual experience of
having sex with a real woman.

1623
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:40,030
That's not going to be the case 50
years from now, 50 years from now,

1624
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:44,050
they're going to have robotics down to
the point where they can have a real,

1625
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:48,580
bonafide artificial woman who's warm
and feels fucking amazing and is the

1626
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:51,520
hottest chick you've ever
seen on the planet earth.

1627
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:55,390
And you can have 10 of them in
a warehouse charging by solar,

1628
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:57,700
but that will help overpopulation,
don't you?

1629
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,310
Well,
it'll help a lot of things,

1630
01:34:59,311 --> 01:35:03,150
but like overpopulation is
most certainly a bad thing.

1631
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,560
But one of the worst parts about it is
that there's a depletion of resources and

1632
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:11,790
this sort of diminishing of the value
of a human being when there's too many

1633
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:12,420
people.

1634
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:17,420
That's what I think about La and I think
about a lot of places and it's one of

1635
01:35:18,091 --> 01:35:21,510
the worries that I have about
China is the volume, right?

1636
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,330
And I think my personal experiences,
I've,

1637
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:28,890
I've lived in small towns and I've lived
in, you know, really big places. I've,

1638
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:29,813
I've seen this,

1639
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:33,060
there's a different way that human beings
treat each other when they don't see

1640
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:35,820
each other's often. There's less
of them. They have more comradery.

1641
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,710
There's a number that
becomes unmanageable. Right.

1642
01:35:37,711 --> 01:35:40,950
I don't know what that number is,
but the group passed it in Los Angeles.

1643
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:42,930
We certainly passed it.
But I think that's

1644
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,320
hurry up doctors with that rubber
robot pussy make that. Sure.

1645
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,720
I don't think it's doctors
or scientists or whatever,

1646
01:35:48,721 --> 01:35:51,450
the scientists and
inventors and modelers and

1647
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:53,190
in the same way,

1648
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:57,900
you know people like adults get weird
when they find out how obsessed kids are

1649
01:35:57,901 --> 01:36:02,750
with video games. They're like, we
had PAC man. I'm like okay look I,

1650
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,070
what's grand theft auto
on right now? Five. Yeah.

1651
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,610
Like when it was on two or
three it you're like wow,

1652
01:36:08,611 --> 01:36:11,040
cause you're like a guy running
through a city and it feels,

1653
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:14,430
it feels like virtual reality.
But like you said, it's,

1654
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:19,020
the guy's still looks a little pixelated.
And the facial features, you know,

1655
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:22,530
they do like the stubble but
it looks still like a computer.

1656
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,110
I don't know what that says about me,
but like when I would kill him,

1657
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:27,890
hookers and grand theft auto,
the bottom,

1658
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,150
the bodies don't disappear as
long as you keep shooting them.

1659
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,930
So I would just stand over the hookers
and keep shooting their vaginas,

1660
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,780
like admit to that. Well my
little, my little nephew walked in.

1661
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:43,380
Uh, cause I, there was a time
when I got out of prison,

1662
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:46,830
I didn't have a place to live so I stayed
with my cousin and I would play like

1663
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:49,080
Mickey Mouse and the
little kid video games.

1664
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:52,230
And then when they went to sleep I'd
play grand theft auto and he snuck in my

1665
01:36:52,231 --> 01:36:55,620
room one day and you know when someone's
in the room and they, you know,

1666
01:36:55,621 --> 01:36:58,380
like someone's in the room but you didn't
hear them. So I stopped for a second.

1667
01:36:58,381 --> 01:37:00,210
I turned around, I'm like,
what are you doing? He's like,

1668
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:04,350
what are you doing uncle Dave?
And I was like, come in, be quiet.

1669
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:07,620
Don't tell your mom how old is this
kid was like six years old. He's ready.

1670
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:11,730
He was ready, but it's ready to
see hooker. But they're like,

1671
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,040
wait till mix next one and the next one.

1672
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:18,690
I'm like video games in the next
10 years it'll, you'll be you,

1673
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:20,670
it'll look exactly like you.

1674
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:23,430
There'll be no glitches where
it looks like a computer.

1675
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:26,670
And so if you're in the game
raping, killing, pillaging,

1676
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,170
that's going to fuck with your head.

1677
01:37:28,171 --> 01:37:31,410
Even more like when I played
grand theft the second,

1678
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:35,040
third or one eye after a
day of just killing nonstop,

1679
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,890
I'd walk outside and just feel weird,
you know.

1680
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:40,500
But at least I knew it
was still a video game.

1681
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:44,710
Brian, there was some images that somebody
posted in the Duncan Trussell thread,

1682
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:47,470
um,
on the Rogan board about some,

1683
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:51,760
another new technology that was
akin to the nvidia technology.

1684
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,130
That looks absolutely insane. I believe
it's from Activision. If he can find

1685
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,290
that, if you could pull those images
up because what they're doing,

1686
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,430
the virtual is going to be like
really intense. I can't wait.

1687
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:04,860
But that robot pussy though. Yeah,
the robot, the physical robot pussy,

1688
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,950
the physical carbon based,
you know,

1689
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:12,090
artificially created robot.
Like what's her face?

1690
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:16,740
What was that girl's name
and blade runner. Who was,
uh, uh, Daryl Hannah. Yes.

1691
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:20,820
That looks crazy,
dude.

1692
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:26,090
I met Daryl Hannah in 1994 at canter's
Deli in La and she was so incredibly

1693
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,480
normal. Like just a normal chick
hanging out with her friends.

1694
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:37,050
Her friends were totally
normal and it was, it was a,

1695
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:41,760
for me it was a very
educational experience because
I never thought that some

1696
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:45,330
woman who was first of all an
attractive woman, second of all,

1697
01:38:45,331 --> 01:38:49,050
a super famous slash. S yeah,
super famous actor. Right.

1698
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,420
And she could be with a
couple of her friends.

1699
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,690
I think it was two guys and another
girl and I could be with a couple of our

1700
01:38:54,691 --> 01:38:58,860
friends and they were sitting next
to us and invited us to talk to them.

1701
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:01,140
Just engaged us.
Like they were talking,

1702
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:02,550
they were doing some game where your name,

1703
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:06,150
the state and a what's the
capitol or what's the state motto?

1704
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:09,240
That's what it was with the state
model and they were like engaging us,

1705
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:12,780
can I come on and help out? Like we like
they were like friendly, super friendly,

1706
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:17,100
like any normal person who you could sit
next to if you were in a booth by you

1707
01:39:17,101 --> 01:39:20,250
know. And that was cool.
It was really cool. It was,

1708
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:24,180
it was really cool because it was like,
oh these, these like movie star people.

1709
01:39:24,181 --> 01:39:26,910
They're just fucking people, man.
They're just so fucking people that uh,

1710
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,400
someone turns a camera on too.

1711
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:32,580
But like that's not going to
happen when we all fuck robots

1712
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:37,050
and the robots are going to know all
the answers. Anyways, her character,

1713
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,060
blade runner,
Sacramento,

1714
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,810
her character in blade runner
was fucking bad ass dude.

1715
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:46,650
She was the number one robot for
that crazy little below that movie.

1716
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:51,030
Oh that movie was so fucking amazing in
that movie was bad ass because that's

1717
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:55,050
Sean Young chick. She was hot
too. God Damn, she was hot too.

1718
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,510
Not just hot but like hypnotic.

1719
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:02,330
There was like something about her like
look with her hair and everything and

1720
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,380
there was like a,

1721
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:06,870
there's a perceived innocence or
something like that to her as this robot

1722
01:40:06,871 --> 01:40:11,190
character that was just brilliant man.
And my memory is going to shit dude.

1723
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,520
When I was running the all time,
great move when I was younger,

1724
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:17,310
I got a weird job with Sean Young
and I can't remember it now.

1725
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,970
You got a job with her, like some
weird movie, I can't remember.

1726
01:40:20,971 --> 01:40:23,250
And you know what happened to her man?
She kind of went off the rail.

1727
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:25,810
What happened to her? She went off
the rails. She got it. It was too,

1728
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:29,190
too much pressure.
I think being a famous movie star,

1729
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:33,030
it's gotta be so it'd be in a famous
guy like you or is it a famous artists?

1730
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:34,650
You're famous kind of for being crazy.

1731
01:40:34,651 --> 01:40:39,570
You can and you know the amount of like
mainstream TMZ type pressure you get is

1732
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:43,410
very nonexistent or minimal and just
enjoy it. You enjoy it and it just,

1733
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:47,010
you just like, but that Tom Cruise
Shit, right? Like where she was at,

1734
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:50,350
she was at that Sean Young was in like
all of it. That's her name, right?

1735
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:55,540
She was in like that movie. Kevin
Costner. Right. Who was that moving?

1736
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,350
She said a gang of fucking
movies, man. She was a big time.

1737
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:03,550
More pressure for women because it's like
you have a window to just do all this

1738
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:07,150
shit and then you have a window to do
all this shit in and there's a freak out

1739
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:10,660
of being this one person that all these
people were focusing on that it's so

1740
01:41:10,661 --> 01:41:15,310
completely unnatural. You are a complete,
you're, you're supercharging your system.

1741
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:19,030
It's like putting a blower on a Mustang
and revving the engine much higher than

1742
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:23,980
it's supposed to go the fuck away from
actresses, Bro. Like that's, that's a,

1743
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,660
I would never generalize
like that because I've,

1744
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:29,350
I've met like a lot of really cool
actresses that I love being friends with,

1745
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:33,130
but as far as like friends, friends
is fine. I don't want to date anybody,

1746
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:34,060
anybody's anything like me.

1747
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,960
I don't want to date anybody who
is even remotely as crazy as I am.

1748
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:40,030
What I'm saying.
So when I dated a chick that she's like,

1749
01:41:40,031 --> 01:41:43,210
you got to quit the podcast. I'm like,
that's sort of like fuck you bitch.

1750
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:47,380
But then also like that's sort
of a good instinct, but you know,

1751
01:41:47,381 --> 01:41:51,670
there's people that it works out like
Thompson girl and his wife Christine

1752
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:52,660
Deposits Kate. Do you
know, you know Tom Scar,

1753
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:56,650
hilarious standup comedian and
his wife is fucking brilliant.

1754
01:41:56,651 --> 01:42:00,970
Like a really funny, I got
married and they're happy
and it works. I got to finish

1755
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:05,820
telling you about the Mexican comedian
cause he's just brought us. Okay. Um,

1756
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:10,070
I love what you're drawing right now,
by the way. My best drawing idea.

1757
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:14,700
Um, so I told you I met the
greatest comedian ever in
Mexico. It's not possible.

1758
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:16,780
I'll tell you and you fucking tell me.
Okay.

1759
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,280
So I'm fucking my Mexican girlfriend
and it's not like she's joking with me.

1760
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:27,540
She's almost nervous to tell me this.
It's like we're fucking,

1761
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:30,270
and she's drunk and she's like,
I have, I have a little piece.

1762
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,870
Like she was super nervous, nervous
that was never resolved. Yeah.

1763
01:42:33,871 --> 01:42:38,760
So I'm going to resolve it right
now or okay. It was never resolved.

1764
01:42:38,761 --> 01:42:42,390
You're correct. It was never resolved.
And, and I'm analyzing the Sh, I'm like,

1765
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:43,890
was she joking?
No,

1766
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:48,110
because she was super nervous to even
tell me we've fuck. And I'm like,

1767
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:49,953
is that for,

1768
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:56,010
is that, is that for real?
Is that it? Like she falls
asleep. I fall asleep. She's,

1769
01:42:56,020 --> 01:43:00,490
she's out. She's a drunk. We fucked,
she's out. And I'm like, this am I gay?

1770
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:04,270
Did I just fuck a hermaphrodite?
I don't sleep at all.

1771
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:07,090
The next morning she has to get
up early to go to work. I go, Hey,

1772
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:11,210
remember that thing you said last night?
She's like, what? She's like, you know,

1773
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:13,330
you said something last night.
And she's like, I gotta go.

1774
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:18,010
She like runs out and I'm like,
Whoa, no closure, no whatever.

1775
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:22,120
And I had three or four days
left in Mexico, you know,

1776
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:27,460
and I was like,
I need to find out if I'm gay now.

1777
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:31,460
This should be on vice. It's just not,
why haven't you like written this?

1778
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,200
Cause I'm telling you right now.

1779
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:39,440
So then, uh, every day, so we fucked
like every night until I left.

1780
01:43:39,441 --> 01:43:43,360
And every night she always says,
turn the lights off. Never.

1781
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:45,950
These lights are always leaves a socks on.

1782
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:51,280
And the chef dude feet won't walnut and
won't let me finger her because of the

1783
01:43:51,711 --> 01:43:52,490
pain

1784
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:56,870
as well. I got the paint on
my hands, paint, paint. So
I'm scrubbing and I go, look,

1785
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:58,910
they're clean tonight. She's like, no,
no, don't think it just fucking me.

1786
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:03,910
And I'm like, wow, is it a thing
that comes out like this alien time?

1787
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,760
There's so many questions.
I go, I go, hey, that thing,

1788
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:11,870
the extra piece was that a joke?
She's like, and her face turns red,

1789
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:16,340
like don't bring it up. And I'm like,
I'm with a fucking hermaphrodite.

1790
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:21,800
Wow. This is crazy. And you didn't go
down on it, right? You didn't ever go? No.

1791
01:44:21,801 --> 01:44:25,070
I went down it, dude. I went searching
Bro. I wanted answers. You know,

1792
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:29,750
I tried to go deep. I tried to get the
answers. So son never got the answer.

1793
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:34,210
No closure. Lucky dude. You gotta do
what you gotta do in certain situations.

1794
01:44:34,230 --> 01:44:36,770
Just kind of back out. This is
cutting your losses. This is,

1795
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:40,160
this is a two months ago, but you
really liked her. I really liked her.

1796
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,500
Still Talk to her.
I just can't stop thinking about her.

1797
01:44:42,501 --> 01:44:45,230
She just doesn't want to talk about that.
She doesn't want and I accept it now.

1798
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:48,570
I love it now. I love
that she's a guy, but she,

1799
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:51,500
it doesn't sound like she has a guy.
She's a hermaphrodite.

1800
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:54,790
Did her pussy tastes like pussy?
It's delicious. What, what does it,

1801
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:58,300
what does it feel like? It feels
different. Like guacamole. No.

1802
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:02,600
When you're actually having sex. No, it
feels when you make it, it felt great.

1803
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:06,920
You know, she does. She has a wonderful
vagina. She's a great girl. Okay.

1804
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,180
Didn't you say something like
on your podcast that, uh,

1805
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:13,850
she was disconnected with sex though?
She was a little, she was a weird,

1806
01:45:13,851 --> 01:45:17,090
she's a weird chick, you know? Okay. But
what do you, what are you saying though?

1807
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:20,570
That if this is what I'm saying? So
this is two months ago, no closure.

1808
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:24,530
And in the two months I've accepted
that she was a guy or has male parts,

1809
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:28,580
no problem. Wow. Was, uh, and she,

1810
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:32,600
she avoids the thing and
she's texted me last night.

1811
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:37,670
She goes, hey, you know that little piece
I told you about? And I go, yes, yes.

1812
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:42,290
Finally closure. She
goes, I was joking. I go,

1813
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:47,060
this is why she's the best comedian to
fucking drop a line of like that on a

1814
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:50,960
dude and tell the punchline two months
later, okay, while he's racking his brain,

1815
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:54,050
I was like,
let me fucking genius comedian.

1816
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:59,900
You tell a joke that has a fucking
punchline. Two months later, oh my God,

1817
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:01,850
that is one possibility.

1818
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:06,660
Another possibility is she decided to
tell you that it was a joke because you

1819
01:46:06,661 --> 01:46:09,590
were pressing the issue and you
wanted to talk about a lot. I dropped.

1820
01:46:09,591 --> 01:46:12,080
That was the best way for her.
Do you understand that though?

1821
01:46:12,081 --> 01:46:14,090
He very well could have
been at hermaphrodite.

1822
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:16,070
Not that there's anything
wrong with a hermaphrodite.

1823
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:20,090
Joe's not like when heard some sort
of a chromosomal test. He just,

1824
01:46:20,091 --> 01:46:22,430
she told you something and you're
right and you declared to the greatest

1825
01:46:22,431 --> 01:46:26,540
community. Never. Or maybe
it was a hemorrhoid. It could
have been hemorrhoid. Sh,

1826
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:30,050
listen, assessed. You can get a sense.
Listen guys, the ones that pop out,

1827
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:32,030
when her little Dick
went into my dick hole,

1828
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,430
it was the most amazing feeling
I've ever felt in my life,

1829
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:37,940
but we just hit a low point.

1830
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:43,360
She easily could be at Hermaphrodite. Just
didn't want to talk about it. Yeah, I,

1831
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:47,030
that's a good way to say I was just
joking. How do you deal with people?

1832
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:51,180
This is a good question for you that say
they don't listen to you, but they do.

1833
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,330
Yeah. They got all this into your
podcast. That's okay. But they know,

1834
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:59,250
but they do and they like, I don't care.
You know? Know if you want to listen.

1835
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:01,210
Listen, if you don't want to listen,
don't listen. Because I'm thinking,

1836
01:47:01,211 --> 01:47:04,320
do you want to tell me you don't listen?
You're the doing it once.

1837
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:07,380
You're either trying to inform me like
I don't know what you do. Well, no,

1838
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:10,290
just being normal or you're
being dismissive. You know?

1839
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:13,380
It's possible that you could say it
like in a way that like David Show,

1840
01:47:13,381 --> 01:47:16,350
I don't listen to your podcast.
Right, right. Okay. You know
where you're like, whoa.

1841
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,020
Like, I wouldn't waste my time
listening to you, but here's the thing.

1842
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:22,170
I talked about this on my show
and I'm thinking, did she hear it?

1843
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:25,110
And so that's why she called
me. Yeah, but she doesn't,

1844
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:29,520
she doesn't like follow me on Twitter
or Facebook or any of this shit and she

1845
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,413
really,
you know,

1846
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:35,340
well it sounds like it was a very strange
thing for you and almost indicative of

1847
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,340
like life itself, whether it was
like itself has never perfect.

1848
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,480
Whether it was a joke or not,

1849
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,870
whether she really forgot to tell
me the punchline or like whatever,

1850
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,000
whatever the case,

1851
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:48,750
I accepted it well except Joe again is
does definitely nothing wrong with that.

1852
01:47:48,751 --> 01:47:51,060
But that's not the funniest
comedian on the face.

1853
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:54,730
Come on Joe to someone pretty
soaked up though. You're having sex.

1854
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,300
What if it's most likely an excuse?

1855
01:47:57,301 --> 01:47:59,250
What if your walls up but
it's not most likely a Joe?

1856
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,960
What if your wife just out of tonight?
Just all fucking totally.

1857
01:48:03,961 --> 01:48:07,350
Seriously. I used to be a guy and
you're like, what are you talking about?

1858
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:11,460
And then she didn't tell you the truth on
month later. That's pretty funny. Well,

1859
01:48:11,461 --> 01:48:15,750
that's a long, it could be. I
guess it could be funny. You know,

1860
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:18,720
if you're the right guy and she was the
right girl and she said it the right way,

1861
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:23,110
I guess it can be fun. [inaudible]
go. I never ever told David Show God.

1862
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:26,250
It also could be that she's lying to
you if fishes like to talk about it.

1863
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:30,570
And she really is something
like a hermaphrodite. It's
possible to dude. I mean,

1864
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:33,540
unless you're going to go in Novia
if you're listening out there baby,

1865
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:37,650
don't say her name. Just it's sweetheart
in Spanish. Oh, there you go. Beautiful.

1866
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:41,540
I mean Novia um, if you're listening,
I hope you're not lying. Listen,

1867
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:43,850
it doesn't matter man. I hope
it wasn't a joke. Listen,

1868
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:46,330
you're not looking to have a
family, are you? I can't wait to,

1869
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:49,900
I started looking at how a family,
right. I'm starting to think about, uh,

1870
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:54,150
having kids without the wife
part. Well, like adopting or, uh,

1871
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:58,080
or I'm freezing my sperm and doing the
whole surrogates or whatever. I Dunno.

1872
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:02,070
Just freeze the baby. I think I'm
starting to think about having a family.

1873
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:06,570
But you know, like I said, gay or not gay,

1874
01:49:06,571 --> 01:49:10,230
I hang out with a lot of dudes and so
like critter who I hang out with all the

1875
01:49:10,231 --> 01:49:13,530
times like fuck you get a girlfriend,
I'm going to have to have a girlfriend.

1876
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:14,220
And it's like,

1877
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:18,960
well that's cause then we hang out in
the logic is that because we hang out all

1878
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:21,520
the time. So I said, why don't we
just share? You could get Monday ones,

1879
01:49:21,521 --> 01:49:23,710
they'll get Tuesday, Thursdays,
such a snapper seconds.

1880
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:27,690
You automatically offered up the
first three days you could get money,

1881
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,890
you could get the pee hole.
I'll take the be whole.

1882
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,220
Ah,

1883
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:36,300
come on Joe. Be So many women
right now. They're so angry. No,

1884
01:49:36,301 --> 01:49:39,780
we'll find a podcast is, I don't think
I would have a problem. By the way,

1885
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:43,290
kitty had a pussy boner. I don't
think. I don't think it would if she,

1886
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:46,110
if she act like a girl, she
was beautiful. Such a pussy.

1887
01:49:46,111 --> 01:49:48,040
Brian can even get hard for the grandma.

1888
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:51,070
Come on. I'm that puts it
out. Like if I, I mean,

1889
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:53,440
if somebody came out through
him and cleaned up for you,

1890
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:58,570
but listen on the line is you are enjoying
the experience until your perception

1891
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:02,740
exactly who she was and had a whole male,
female paradigm shifted.

1892
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:06,310
She became this oddity to
you like damaged goods.

1893
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:09,700
This, no, this was it, right? Well,

1894
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:14,230
this is the thing I need a
second and this is for like,

1895
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,850
I didn't like Avocados growing up. I love
it. I love him now. It took me a second.

1896
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:21,880
It took my mom's like, eat
this. I go, oh, it's green.

1897
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:25,990
It's probably tastes like a watermelon.
It tasted like shit. I love Guacamole now.

1898
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:29,830
Uh, I had Moonee Sea Urchin for the first
time. I was like, this is disgusting.

1899
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:33,490
It's my favorite food now. It
took me a second. I get to China,

1900
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:36,910
the girls have to thin mustaches.
I go, what the fuck is that?

1901
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:40,120
Because they don't care about
waxing and bleaching. I go,

1902
01:50:40,121 --> 01:50:44,860
that's gross because it's not normal to
me. I'm the in China for three months,

1903
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:49,750
sort of into it like it now. Um, I'm
starting to have sex with Arab women.

1904
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:52,330
They have Harry acids. Whoa. Grossed out.

1905
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:57,430
Want to puke sort of into it now.
Just give me a second.

1906
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:02,020
You've got a little dick
inside your pussy. Gross.

1907
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:06,010
Gimme one month to adjust.
I'm from America.

1908
01:51:06,011 --> 01:51:10,360
I was born in Los Angeles. I live in
Western society. I'm not used to dicks.

1909
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:14,380
I'm not used to Harry acids. I'm
not used the mustaches, but just,

1910
01:51:14,381 --> 01:51:19,381
I'm openminded give me a second to just
open wider and accept your mustache.

1911
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:23,470
Your hairy ass. You're a dick in
your pussy. Just give me a second.

1912
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:28,730
I'll eat the avocado.
I'll eat the sea urchin I at.

1913
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:33,370
You know, like you weren't like
avocado. Avocado tastes like shit.

1914
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:36,790
I'm never going to eat it again. It
grew on you. It took a second. You know,

1915
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:38,470
I hated it.
I spit it out.

1916
01:51:39,170 --> 01:51:42,530
I just realized it was just a texture
issue that the actual taste of it was

1917
01:51:42,531 --> 01:51:46,760
fairly bland when in fact it has a lot
of health benefits and you want candy.

1918
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:50,450
You want, you want watermelon, you want
fruit that tastes good, you know? Well,

1919
01:51:50,451 --> 01:51:53,160
the problem is you find out about candy.
That's the real problem.

1920
01:51:53,161 --> 01:51:56,060
And you find out something that
gives you this drug rush. I mean,

1921
01:51:56,061 --> 01:51:58,910
kids that get high on sugar,
like if you've ever seen kids eat cake,

1922
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:01,070
they turn into fucking demons.

1923
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,770
They go running around me and they're
crying and crank that guy out there.

1924
01:52:03,771 --> 01:52:08,210
It's more candy than anybody. It gets
crazy. It's not a kid, but he is sort of,

1925
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:11,600
but you know what I'm saying? It's
like it's a clearly a drug, right?

1926
01:52:11,601 --> 01:52:13,310
So of course they don't
want to eat guacamole.

1927
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:15,260
Guacamole doesn't give them that drug.
Right.

1928
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:17,420
They want that drug that comes from those.
I have a that,

1929
01:52:17,421 --> 01:52:20,750
you know those sophisticated do that,
those powders,

1930
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:24,500
those fucking things that kids eat
where it's literally a tube of sugar.

1931
01:52:24,501 --> 01:52:27,370
There's like pixie sticks and crack
open the end and you get funded.

1932
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:32,630
It's drama nerds, nerds,
rope crunches, sugar drug.

1933
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:35,180
That's still get fun Dept.
So bad for you too.

1934
01:52:35,190 --> 01:52:39,380
They say that sugar is
just almost toxic sugars.

1935
01:52:39,381 --> 01:52:40,970
Just almost toxic for you.

1936
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:45,260
I know, but like, like I'm saying like

1937
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:50,420
all these things, you know, I
don't, what are you doing? Like,

1938
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:51,830
have you ever been with
a chick with a real,

1939
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:55,340
like a Middle Eastern girl with a
hairy, but yes. And what did you do?

1940
01:52:55,410 --> 01:52:58,470
You're like, yeah, well it was back in
the 80s right? People that hairy butts,

1941
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:00,180
it was a normal thing.

1942
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,870
So it's worse is when they have catfish
whiskers and in certain lights you can

1943
01:53:03,871 --> 01:53:05,640
see it and you're like, ah. It's like,

1944
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:08,280
but see what we're doing now is
that that episode of Seinfeld,

1945
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:12,090
when he finds the one thing wrong, like
the CIC has the big hands or whatever,

1946
01:53:12,091 --> 01:53:16,020
and it's like, you know, I had sex
with this girl, I go to the bathroom,

1947
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:19,740
we had sex in the dark and I turned
the lights on to take a piss.

1948
01:53:19,741 --> 01:53:23,400
And I look out the bed and her head,
she has a hairy ass. I'm like that.

1949
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,380
I'm going to Puke in the toilet
while I'm pissing right now.

1950
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:28,010
And I go just slow down.

1951
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:33,510
Just except that it's someone
from another culture, you know,

1952
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:36,190
like women.
Oh,

1953
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:39,540
I sleep with a lot of women where I'm
their first Asian and they do that. Oh,

1954
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,440
you have no hair on your body. I go, yeah,
I'm Asian. Like we are not hairy people.

1955
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,860
You know, like it's like being
with a girl. I'm like, cool, Whoa,

1956
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:49,710
rude.
How rude.

1957
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:55,420
It's interesting how porn has completely
triumphed in the area of a pubic

1958
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:57,770
dressing, but it's back. It's coming back.

1959
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:01,500
Little coming back
contrarianism for the most part,

1960
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:05,160
people prefer a groomed area.
It's because HD,

1961
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:06,980
you know it's an ill,

1962
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:10,760
maybe it was before that there was some
trimming done before that they want to

1963
01:54:10,770 --> 01:54:14,670
hire the bumps. What was,
because pornography became
like really prevalent, right?

1964
01:54:14,671 --> 01:54:18,150
That's what it is. Pornography became
really prevalent and then along the way,

1965
01:54:18,151 --> 01:54:22,260
like people started like looking at the
aesthetic of male balls covered in hair

1966
01:54:22,261 --> 01:54:24,010
that creeps all the way up
to your ass hole. Right?

1967
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:27,930
And girls with giant crazy bushes that
go to the inside of the thighs and they

1968
01:54:27,931 --> 01:54:31,710
just decided to make alterations
on porn and then people,

1969
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:36,120
whether they admit it or not, right. I've
massively affected by pornography. Oh,

1970
01:54:36,121 --> 01:54:38,460
of course.
And then the shift happened where,

1971
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:41,850
I mean there's a good percentage
of the population of this country,

1972
01:54:41,851 --> 01:54:45,810
at least that trims their hair basically
based on the aesthetic that porn

1973
01:54:45,811 --> 01:54:48,180
established. Right?
Definitely. Right. Yeah.

1974
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:52,860
It's weird because it's an untalked
about thing. It's an undiscussed thing.

1975
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:56,040
It's a denied thing. It's like
it's a darkness that we just like.

1976
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:01,070
Meanwhile they're getting billions of
hits every day. I'll watch or my shit.

1977
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:01,620
Well,

1978
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:05,070
I have to trim it too because it also
gets caught in the hair and my balls gets

1979
01:55:05,071 --> 01:55:09,090
caught in my cup like,
and if you're doing Jujitsu shifts,

1980
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:12,020
getting along when you're bald here,
head stuck in your asshole here.

1981
01:55:12,510 --> 01:55:17,490
That's never happened. So it makes
like a dreadlocks. Dreadlocks. Yeah.

1982
01:55:17,491 --> 01:55:20,340
That's not good. You need
to better hygiene and that
you need better standards.

1983
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:23,820
You need to not let it get them
to that wall. Joe, because I've

1984
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:27,360
been naked around lots of different men
in different countries because of prison

1985
01:55:27,361 --> 01:55:30,780
or whatever. It's like,
yes, when I, when I'm,

1986
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:34,830
when I was homeless here in America
and I was showering at 24 hour fitness,

1987
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:38,940
then I'm like in a giant shower
with a bunch of men and like, yeah,

1988
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:41,820
for the most part you look the
off for a second and you're like,

1989
01:55:41,821 --> 01:55:43,830
well people shave their shit.
It's like,

1990
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:48,720
okay, cool. Then I'm in prison in Japan
and I, you know, it's a bath culture,

1991
01:55:48,721 --> 01:55:52,890
it's not a shower culture. And I
looked down and I'm like, Oh wow,

1992
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:56,910
these guys don't shave their shit at
all. Well first of all, porn in Japan,

1993
01:55:56,911 --> 01:55:59,460
it's pixelated,
so you never really see anything anyways.

1994
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:04,370
They pixelate genitalia or pubes the
whole area, just the whole ocean.

1995
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:06,570
But they don't,
they don't shave their shit down there.

1996
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:10,050
So their pubes are the same pubes
that grew from when they were a kid.

1997
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:13,530
So they have beards, they're pubes
are longer than their dicks. Mike,

1998
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:17,580
could I get out of the bathtub? I'm, you
know, I keep my shit tight, you know,

1999
01:56:17,790 --> 01:56:18,480
and I get,

2000
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,900
get out of my Dick and balls hanging
out and then these guys come out and you

2001
01:56:21,901 --> 01:56:25,080
just see a black beard with like a
red dot with the tip of their Dick.

2002
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:28,170
And you're like, oh, it looks like
a cute like homeless guy, you know?

2003
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,750
But yeah, those things are all informed
by pornography. They don't watch in Japan,

2004
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:36,960
they don't watch American pornography.
So of course they don't shave this shit.

2005
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:41,250
The Bush is coming back.
What's fascinating though,
that it sort of gets us to,

2006
01:56:41,251 --> 01:56:44,910
I would imagine that Bush is coming back.
I'm out on the front line.

2007
01:56:44,911 --> 01:56:47,120
I'm telling you it's coming back with it.
But like look,

2008
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:50,670
been bell bottoms coming back. No, but
it's back, right? Oh yeah, definitely.

2009
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:54,120
I mean the almost like
I'd say five years ago,

2010
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:59,150
every girl I was with had no hair or
like at tiny thin strip of whatevers.

2011
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:02,770
Uh,
now almost all girls have some kind of,

2012
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:06,560
probably heard the crabs were going
extinct and they got sad and I say,

2013
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:09,690
have the crab growing in the
crowd. Cyclical. You know,

2014
01:57:09,691 --> 01:57:12,750
how come everybody doesn't want to
the crabs to live? They want to save.

2015
01:57:12,751 --> 01:57:15,120
Like would I love seafood?
I love Krista.

2016
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:18,510
You know the ones that grow in your
Bush? Yeah, I eat those crabs like Daryl.

2017
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:20,220
Hannah eats the lobster and splash

2018
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:26,700
little little tarter sauce. A
little, uh, you know, cocktail sauce.

2019
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:29,340
[inaudible] going to red
lobster right after this.

2020
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:30,930
What's it like hanging
out with Dan at work?

2021
01:57:30,931 --> 01:57:32,990
Cause I know you guys are friends man,
and that's I,

2022
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,530
I loved them and they must
be very interesting too. Do
you ever paint with them?

2023
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:42,120
Yeah. Okay. First of
all, I love those guys.

2024
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:48,270
Do you know who Dan word is? I love them,
but I don't love one of the new songs.

2025
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:52,140
They got some new song, you know, they're
just going for it, doing everything.

2026
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:57,720
There was that, fuck you in
the ass song. I was like, okay,

2027
01:57:57,721 --> 01:58:00,420
what are you doing man? What
the hell is this? It's great.

2028
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:02,700
I like some of his
really early or shit too.

2029
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:04,860
They did some really
interesting early stuff.

2030
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:09,570
But do you hang out with a lot of
artists in general comedians? Okay.

2031
01:58:09,571 --> 01:58:13,650
So comedians or artists, comedians have
a few friends that are artists, artists,

2032
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:17,700
artists, artists, chefs.
Most people that are highly,

2033
01:58:17,701 --> 01:58:22,560
highly creative are sort of fucking
crazy. They're crazy. Crazy as fuck.

2034
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:25,980
And then, and then you try
to like do normal shit with
them and then you're like,

2035
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:30,270
why are they doing this? Oh yeah.
Cause they're fucking crazy.

2036
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:31,890
What makes them tick?

2037
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:35,600
Every comedian that I know is
out of their fucking money one.

2038
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:38,030
And I love Ninja and
I love Yolandi Ninjas.

2039
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:41,040
One of probably the most
creative people I like,

2040
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:46,000
he'll do a song and like he goes and then
the park was like this and he'll sing

2041
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:47,770
every part of the song and he goes,

2042
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,390
and then the music video
is going to go like this.

2043
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:53,700
And then he'll act out everyone's part
in the music video and what the lighting

2044
01:58:53,701 --> 01:58:55,960
is going to look like
in down to the costumes.

2045
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:58,620
And there's going to be a lion and this.
And did you,

2046
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:01,750
do you ask for this or does this just
like happen in the middle of the Congress?

2047
01:59:01,751 --> 01:59:04,980
He goes, he goes, can I tell you like
a quick story? And does it do it?

2048
01:59:04,981 --> 01:59:08,070
Do it in his accent. You were about
to, Oh, I get bailed out of it. No,

2049
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,080
I can tell you a quick
story about a set of,

2050
01:59:11,081 --> 01:59:15,370
they're the best as he can do a perfect
American accent and not like a gangster.

2051
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:17,690
He was like, you heard Jim
Jefferies. Hey Dave, how's it going?

2052
01:59:18,990 --> 01:59:23,760
Jim Jefferies, a Australian comedian
has the most eerie American accent.

2053
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:27,630
Really? He does an American guy and
you're like, yikes. It's too good.

2054
01:59:27,631 --> 01:59:29,300
It's like too good.
Right?

2055
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:32,640
They can do us apparently way easier
than we could do them because we're

2056
01:59:32,641 --> 01:59:36,450
speaking normal. Sure. That's the case.

2057
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:38,850
And I ain't get a might.
What is normal?

2058
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:42,900
Can you decide somewhere along the line
that your way of talking is better than

2059
01:59:42,901 --> 01:59:43,540
mine?

2060
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:44,110
Yes.

2061
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:49,060
And the way that you do that
is the language of English
is spoken in Australia,

2062
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:53,040
England, England, America, and
people make fun of Crocker.

2063
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,770
They do the Crocodile Dundee but England.
And then you take someone who,

2064
01:59:56,830 --> 02:00:01,830
you take a Japanese exchange student who
doesn't speak English and you go learn

2065
02:00:01,991 --> 02:00:03,460
English.
What are they gonna do?

2066
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:06,610
They're gonna listen to
dial down American movies.

2067
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:10,900
They can understand Americans.
They can't understand British people.

2068
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:12,610
They can't understand Australians.
They're like,

2069
02:00:12,611 --> 02:00:16,420
I don't what we speak
normal like normal people.

2070
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:17,920
That's ridiculous.

2071
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:21,730
Everybody in England who
grows up in England knows
how to understand people from

2072
02:00:21,731 --> 02:00:25,010
England. Everybody in America,
everyone in [inaudible].

2073
02:00:25,110 --> 02:00:28,320
Glenn can understand us.
We can't understand them.

2074
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,840
That's interesting. A thick, thick
British accent. Give me a fucking break.

2075
02:00:33,841 --> 02:00:36,870
I'm like, that is interesting. It goes,
Hey, what did you just say? He was like,

2076
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:38,150
oh fucking doors and I'll be like,

2077
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:41,060
but if you were living there, you
would understand. I'm pretty clearly,

2078
02:00:41,090 --> 02:00:42,230
if you were in his neighborhood,

2079
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:44,540
we're speaking proper English.
Joe.

2080
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:50,630
I like slang. I'm not, I'm not like this.
I'm not like trying really hard to like,

2081
02:00:50,650 --> 02:00:53,350
so what we did is basically the
Brazilian Jujitsu of English.

2082
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:57,190
We took the original Japanese
English and we made it more bad ass.

2083
02:00:57,191 --> 02:00:59,050
What's an extra guard?
Submissions and she'll come.

2084
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,120
How come when they have
like some British movies?

2085
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:03,940
Sometimes they've got to put fucking
subtitles on that shit because you don't

2086
02:01:03,941 --> 02:01:05,290
know what the fuck you got me,
man.

2087
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:08,080
I get offended if they have movies
like snatch and they put the subtitles.

2088
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:12,690
I get offended. Like I want to be
trying to figure that concentrate. Well,

2089
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:17,020
I do when I interview fighters,
when I've, I've had, uh, Paul Kelly,

2090
02:01:17,021 --> 02:01:20,080
he's a gentlemen, I've had an interview
in the UFC. I'm Michael Bisping,

2091
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:23,140
sky from Manchester, right? These
guys have incredible accents.

2092
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:28,270
Bisping has gotten much better
at speaking in like a more clear,

2093
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:32,680
he slows it down a little bit, right?
But English people and a Irish people,

2094
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:37,060
they talk faster. They have a faster way
of combining the words together. Right.

2095
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:39,980
I had a fucking guy come up to me
and I had a conversation with a

2096
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:43,280
dude in Belfast, Northern Ireland
were getting drunk at a bar.

2097
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:48,050
There was a UFC there and just me and
Eddie Bravo went down to this bar and we

2098
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:52,670
said, let's just tie one on with these
Belfast people. And I think, um, um,

2099
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,490
day bishop was probably there too,
right?

2100
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:56,840
Who's the local comedian
that we did a Gig with?

2101
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:58,610
This fucking dude was talking to me.

2102
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:03,260
I didn't have a clue as to what
he was saying. We were hammered,

2103
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:07,580
right? And he was telling me how it fight
it heal the basic tenant or the basic,

2104
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:11,440
uh, uh, script was, I'll fight any
man. Right. He was just telling me,

2105
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:14,480
letting me know he'll fucking
fight anybody. You know, it was,

2106
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:18,920
I'll fight any of mine, chuck it out
to la aim. Hey, he made high capital.

2107
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:22,390
Don't cat fight. Handyman
have fight any man. This,

2108
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,650
I barely could understand him.

2109
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:28,540
It was like this crazy game I was
playing like staring into his eyes and

2110
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,383
struggling

2111
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:32,230
and his word, and this is like the shit
everyone always wonders about, right?

2112
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,360
You got, um, you got the dude that's
the jacks from sons of anarchy.

2113
02:02:37,361 --> 02:02:41,180
You got all these actors that have that
accent, right. How to fight any of mine.

2114
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:45,370
But then they're in movies and TV
shows speak, or when they do songs,

2115
02:02:46,060 --> 02:02:49,960
accent just magically disappears and
then they're back doing the interview and

2116
02:02:49,961 --> 02:02:52,870
it comes back so they could turn it off.
They could turn that

2117
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:53,250
shit off.

2118
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:57,070
Now when they're drunk in a bar and not
some dude who actually lives in Belfast

2119
02:02:57,071 --> 02:02:58,270
to some local boxer,

2120
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:03,280
I was ready to throw down and fight any
man for what he fight me. Oh Fuck Ya.

2121
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,650
They want to fight those people.
We were in Belfast, right?

2122
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:08,800
You're driving it like the fund.
They have these cars.

2123
02:03:08,801 --> 02:03:12,190
He's cop cars that have
bulletproof windows. Right.

2124
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:14,800
These giant metal plates and bomb proof,

2125
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:18,930
like shielding all over the car,
wrecked their cars are designed.

2126
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:23,140
The cop cars are designed to absorb bombs.
Pull up, pull up some pictures of them.

2127
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:27,670
Belfast, Northern Ireland, a cop, cars,

2128
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:32,110
bomb protection. They like to fucking
party. It's a different kind of a world.

2129
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:35,380
I mean they went through
some crazy fucking shit.

2130
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:39,970
They went through a crazy war like
fairly recently. Right between, you know,

2131
02:03:39,971 --> 02:03:41,890
essentially people that are
right next door to them.

2132
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:45,520
Right. Joe, I got to ask you a question.
Okay. David's, I like being scared.

2133
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:46,181
I was like,

2134
02:03:46,181 --> 02:03:48,850
I like thinking about how I'm going to
fight myself if guys were trying to rape

2135
02:03:48,851 --> 02:03:53,800
me. I like doing a podcast. Something
that I've never done challenging myself.

2136
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:56,680
I like trying stand up
something I'd never done before,

2137
02:03:56,860 --> 02:04:01,450
so I like being scared and challenging
myself to never been in a professional

2138
02:04:01,451 --> 02:04:05,290
fight. I've used to fight all the
time when I was a kid. I'm 37 now.

2139
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:10,150
I haven't been in a real
fight in over eight years now.

2140
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,960
If I wanted to have one like shitty

2141
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:16,460
pro undercard fight,
how much training would have to do?

2142
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:20,000
You'd have to see him a lot. A
lot like for a year, years, years.

2143
02:04:20,001 --> 02:04:23,180
He wanted to be safe. If you wouldn't
want to be safe, you, oh, here's a thing.

2144
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:27,230
You're not in shape right now. You
don't have totally not in shape. Okay.

2145
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:31,340
Do you do any kind of a sport jerked off.
It allows you to move aggressively.

2146
02:04:31,450 --> 02:04:34,220
You're in a lot of trouble. How old
are you? 37 you're going to get hurt.

2147
02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:37,100
Don't do it. I'm definitely going to get
hurt. No, no, no, no, no, no. Listen man,

2148
02:04:37,130 --> 02:04:40,110
this is, there's a romanticism that
people have about getting hurt.

2149
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:44,250
I have no help you. I have no problem
getting to change your thought process.

2150
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:47,580
Do you understand this? Like it's going
to change who you are as a human being.

2151
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:50,200
Like you don't understand the head trauma.
If you've had,

2152
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,410
I've been hitting my head my entire life.

2153
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:54,960
I bet you've been really love your
head trauma. You've been really lucky.

2154
02:04:55,310 --> 02:04:59,520
Wasn't shit. I bet you have. I believe
you. But it all works still. Yeah,

2155
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:04,110
there could be at any point in time
it could be the tipping point and head

2156
02:05:04,111 --> 02:05:07,850
trauma is just no joke and any
unnecessary head trauma, right,

2157
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:11,820
that you want to introduce into your
life I always think is a terrible idea.

2158
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:14,880
And what I know is if there's
a guy was 37 years old,

2159
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,570
any martial arts training I do anymore,
well I don't even spar.

2160
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:21,420
I didn't even kick her off
spar. I do Jujitsu, spar,

2161
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:25,590
but I won't kickbox bar because it's
not worth it. You listen to me, man,

2162
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:28,590
you only can get hit a certain amount
of times in your head and if you think

2163
02:05:28,591 --> 02:05:31,590
it's like cute to go out there and have
an MMA fight. No, I don't think it,

2164
02:05:31,591 --> 02:05:35,550
cause you want to experience it. It's,
it's fucking dangerous. I know, I know.

2165
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:37,460
I'm most likely not going to win.

2166
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,140
I know I'm most likely going to
get the shit kicked out of me.

2167
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:43,290
But you don't want that man. I'm
telling you. I understand that.

2168
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:46,710
You asking me that he's
could easily rate me.

2169
02:05:46,830 --> 02:05:50,100
I would like to be able to be not
going to beat that guy. You're not.

2170
02:05:50,101 --> 02:05:54,270
I met that guy like I was too big.
He's too big. I've got a guy like that.

2171
02:05:54,271 --> 02:05:56,960
You're going to have to become some
sort of a black belt in Jujitsu.

2172
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:58,180
You're going to have to be
able to wrestle him too.

2173
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:03,330
I appreciate the concern for the head
trauma cause I've had been extremely

2174
02:06:03,331 --> 02:06:07,260
damaged in my head before. I've had
been knocked out all that shit. Yeah,

2175
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,760
it's not fucking awesome.

2176
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:11,340
I've been knocked out where I
wake up and I don't know who I am.

2177
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:15,780
Like that kind of shit.
So I'm not under any misconception of,

2178
02:06:15,781 --> 02:06:19,890
it's like going to be like a cake walk or
anything, but I'm just saying too many.

2179
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:22,980
Will you train me? No Way. No Way.
I don't want to be a part of it.

2180
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:27,180
It's too many variables. Play
me, bro. Here's, here's a
bunch of the variables. Okay?

2181
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:30,140
You're in shape. First of all, you don't.
You got to have to pick a guy, right?

2182
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:31,920
And you're going to have to
pick a guy that's commensurate.

2183
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:34,170
I love saying that word. It makes
me feel sad. What does that mean?

2184
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:36,540
It means like similar, like
Google, the same level.

2185
02:06:36,541 --> 02:06:39,480
I want to fuck the guy bigger than
me. Okay. What are you doing man?

2186
02:06:39,481 --> 02:06:41,810
What are you trying to get hurt for?
You trying to be a hero. No, I don't.

2187
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:45,630
I just want to, I don't look, I know
a dude who lost his sense of smell.

2188
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:50,880
He took a beating and lost his sense of
smell and it was just a one to head kick

2189
02:06:50,881 --> 02:06:55,500
combination. Okay. The most out
of shape and fat I've ever been,

2190
02:06:56,170 --> 02:07:00,000
the x factor. I'm was ferocious. Oh,
okay. I won't see luck with that shit.

2191
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:02,730
I won't stop. That's not going to help
you out at all. Not even a little bit.

2192
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:05,790
People think that being tough is going
to help you. I'm tough. I'm ferocious.

2193
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:08,310
That's just going to get you hurt more.
That's just going to meet you.

2194
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,290
You to take more punishment.
So then I'll tap out.

2195
02:07:10,291 --> 02:07:12,700
Then if I'm getting fucking the
shit kicked out of it. Okay,

2196
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:15,840
well then what happens? You, you,
you got damage to your brain.

2197
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:19,620
If you just tried bonded, she'll give
you fight a guy. Here's my, here's my,

2198
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:22,830
my recommendation in this area.
If you really think about doing it,

2199
02:07:22,831 --> 02:07:24,690
if you want to do it and you
want the same kind of thrill,

2200
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:28,080
you can get a very similar thrill from
doing a Jujitsu match or just getting

2201
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:32,160
your butthole lick by old ladies. No,
cause that, you know, when you tap out,

2202
02:07:32,161 --> 02:07:34,680
it's your responsibility. But
the whole thing, things going on.

2203
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:37,630
So you're telling me to stick
to just getting massages by men?

2204
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:41,500
Well I just think that it's not to be
fucked with head trauma is not to be

2205
02:07:41,501 --> 02:07:43,240
fucked with people die man.

2206
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:47,170
There was a kid in Ireland that died a
really recently in a rugby match. Right?

2207
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:50,070
And he had had a,
he got knocked out to guests and needed,

2208
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,210
he got knocked out again and
died. Well, here's the thing,

2209
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:55,630
I know for sure I have a glass jaw.
Like if you hit me in my jaw,

2210
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:00,640
I knock out my entire life. I'm Korean,
I have a thick head, we have big heads.

2211
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:02,710
Right?
That's how you can tell the Asians apart.

2212
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:06,690
Like Koreans usually have bigger
heads. Um, big moon pie faces. No.

2213
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:09,370
If you see like a Chinese,
Japanese and Korean, we usually,

2214
02:08:09,371 --> 02:08:13,690
our heads are a little bit bigger,
right? I've been kicked, punched, like,

2215
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:17,680
like I've had a lot of head trauma and
it all, for the most part still works.

2216
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:20,410
My memory's going to shit a little bit.
But asides from that,

2217
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:23,330
I can fucking for the most part function.
Okay.

2218
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:27,610
And I could see if you're willing to take
this chance and possibly alter the way

2219
02:08:27,611 --> 02:08:30,610
your mind works if you're going
to be intelligent about it.

2220
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:31,750
Cause you're an intelligent guy,

2221
02:08:31,890 --> 02:08:35,470
which you would want to do is dedicate
yourself to martial arts first before you

2222
02:08:35,471 --> 02:08:38,110
ever actually do it. And it was
Kinda, it's Kinda taking a long time.

2223
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:41,260
You're going to have to learn how,
first of all, to defend yourself. And B,

2224
02:08:41,261 --> 02:08:44,510
you're going to have to
learn to be proficient in
something. Well, it's striking.

2225
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,740
I have, my background is judo. I grew up,

2226
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:51,070
I grew up doing judo and I know how good
are you? I was, I want a lot of awards.

2227
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:54,990
What was your belt? What, what belt did
you get to green or something? Okay.

2228
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:56,990
I didn't, I didn't get
my black belt, but I won.

2229
02:08:57,430 --> 02:09:01,720
I won every single judo match I was in.
Well, that list, why not an amateur?

2230
02:09:01,721 --> 02:09:04,600
I remember talking about,
I'm not a novice Joe,

2231
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:08,770
I'm talking 15 years old was the last
time there's an understanding there.

2232
02:09:08,771 --> 02:09:10,720
Like what we know,
I wrestled in high school then I,

2233
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:13,120
there was no touching in judo,
but I never lost,

2234
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:17,410
I wrestled in high school and I didn't
do any grappling again until I went to

2235
02:09:17,411 --> 02:09:21,860
Jujitsu, which is like almost 10 years
later. Right. And, uh, I remember,

2236
02:09:21,861 --> 02:09:25,500
I remember it like instantly can
right back to me because your,

2237
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:30,220
your body develops as a young man.
Understanding how to pin someone,

2238
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:34,060
understanding how to grapple and get
gable grips and how to use your hips to

2239
02:09:34,061 --> 02:09:36,520
sprawl.
You kiss just comes back to you.

2240
02:09:36,890 --> 02:09:39,310
And I think that like
having that background,

2241
02:09:39,311 --> 02:09:41,500
especially at that age 15 that's big.

2242
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:43,420
Learning something and
getting really good at it.

2243
02:09:43,421 --> 02:09:45,370
Where are you competitive
at it when you're 15 right?

2244
02:09:45,371 --> 02:09:46,960
That's like such a developmental period.

2245
02:09:46,961 --> 02:09:49,660
It becomes like sort of a part
of who you are as a person.

2246
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:53,670
But the thing with me is I, my
bones break easy. Oh Jesus. So I've,

2247
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:57,160
and I just fucking do it.
I just quit after whatever.

2248
02:09:57,670 --> 02:10:00,610
Like I broke my collarbone in
judo, I quit, I played baseball,

2249
02:10:00,611 --> 02:10:03,640
I broke my collarbone, I quit, I played
football, I broke my ankle, I quit.

2250
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:07,260
It's like anytime I break a bone, I'm
like, okay, that was that. You know. Well,

2251
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:10,990
it's not hard to break your ankle or your
collarbone doing any of those things,

2252
02:10:10,991 --> 02:10:14,440
whether it was judo or football
or baseball. That sounds in line.

2253
02:10:14,441 --> 02:10:18,220
I mean it might not even be that you're,
your bones break easy.

2254
02:10:18,221 --> 02:10:20,440
It might be that you're just
a little bit too ferocious.

2255
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,980
I hugged the shit out of, you
know, but you know what I'm saying?

2256
02:10:23,981 --> 02:10:25,170
You're like going for it.
No,

2257
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:28,660
I really like when I tell
people interested themselves,
my, my parents were like,

2258
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:32,260
you have to wear, my dad was like, you
have to learn some kind of martial art.

2259
02:10:32,261 --> 02:10:33,980
You're Asian, you have to. Yeah. I

2260
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,550
was like, we, you know, we, we were
not into sports. Loosely set the bar.

2261
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:41,210
We had long hair. We fucking
did. We listened to heavy metal.

2262
02:10:41,211 --> 02:10:43,070
We didn't care about
anything. My, you know,

2263
02:10:43,071 --> 02:10:45,350
it's like when a guy has
three sons and he's like, yes,

2264
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:47,030
they're going to watch sports with me.

2265
02:10:47,031 --> 02:10:50,300
Whatever we did in fucking give a shit
about, we were nihilists we'll be like,

2266
02:10:50,301 --> 02:10:53,960
we don't care about shit. And why
is that? I don't know what happened.

2267
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:57,470
We like, we would, we would go to school,

2268
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:02,500
like my dad would take us a sack full of
balls and just pour it out in front of

2269
02:11:02,511 --> 02:11:05,960
us. On the weekends ago. What do you
guys want to play? Softball, baseball,

2270
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:11,090
a kickball, handball, football basket.
He'd have every ball and be like,

2271
02:11:11,091 --> 02:11:13,840
what do you guys want to do? And we're
like, nothing. We don't want to do any,

2272
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:17,420
I don't know. We just,
we were just very like,

2273
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,350
we don't care about anything.
We don't,

2274
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:22,670
when you look back on like what
turned you into who you are today,

2275
02:11:22,671 --> 02:11:23,870
this is sort of wild dude.

2276
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:27,780
Do you have any one thing that
like stands out as being the, the,

2277
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:32,690
I don't give a fuck. There's not
one, there's not one incident,

2278
02:11:32,691 --> 02:11:36,230
but it's a combination of racism,
uh,

2279
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:40,310
humiliation and like, just
never getting laid, you know?

2280
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:44,060
So just lack of good experiences
and a lot of bad experiences.

2281
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:47,120
Just unbelievable amount of anger,
you know,

2282
02:11:47,121 --> 02:11:50,450
like going to a school where everyone
makes fun of you for being Asian.

2283
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:55,610
Go into someplace where every girl rejects
you and then within your own family,

2284
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:59,510
having this insane sex drive where just
everyone just catches me jerking off all

2285
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:02,080
the time. Like just the, uh,

2286
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:07,070
I was sleeping when you're really
young. I mean the humiliation, like,

2287
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:11,450
oh my God, my mom just saw the tip of my
dick hard. But don't you think though,

2288
02:12:11,451 --> 02:12:13,190
when you were like really young,

2289
02:12:13,191 --> 02:12:16,550
a really stressed out and really fucked
up that that's almost like a natural way

2290
02:12:16,551 --> 02:12:18,300
to blow off the steam. You're like, dude,

2291
02:12:18,301 --> 02:12:22,610
who are troubled almost always check off
a lot. Yeah. You know, I, I don't know.

2292
02:12:22,611 --> 02:12:26,200
What do I, what, what am I
doing surveys? No, I'm not that,

2293
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,730
there was no census attached to anything
that I've said here. I'm just talking.

2294
02:12:28,731 --> 02:12:30,440
No, no, no. I know, but you're right.

2295
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:33,290
Like I would go home and I'd just
be full of aggression and I'm like,

2296
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:36,710
and I just wasn't good at sports, so I'm
like, I don't even want to try this shit.

2297
02:12:36,711 --> 02:12:41,240
But then when they told me in football,
you could hit people cool. And then like,

2298
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:44,630
yeah, I don't even know how you're
angry. You wanted to hit very angry.

2299
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:49,550
And the thing with judo is I, that's
another thing that my parents made me do.

2300
02:12:49,551 --> 02:12:50,570
I didn't want to do it,

2301
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:53,480
but it's like I also didn't
like people throwing me around.

2302
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:56,600
So when we got into it I was just like,

2303
02:12:57,650 --> 02:13:00,590
I don't care if this guy's a
higher belt than me, whatever.

2304
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:04,040
Like I'm not going to let
him pinned me down. You know?

2305
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:07,880
Like as soon as he starts winning,
I'm going to go like I just went there,

2306
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:10,760
I'm going to go fucking crazy
and well what you should do.

2307
02:13:10,761 --> 02:13:14,270
I became a pride of my Dojo. They sent
me to all the tournaments and I was like,

2308
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:18,170
that was like the reluctant, like I don't
want to be here, but okay fine. I'm here.

2309
02:13:18,171 --> 02:13:19,980
I'm going to win the pride of your Dojo.
Yeah.

2310
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:24,380
I won every like trophy thing for and
then I broke my collar bone. I was like,

2311
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:26,360
okay, that's the end
of my collarbone. Okay.

2312
02:13:26,361 --> 02:13:30,470
Now my shoulders are a little smaller
cause I broke this one and this one. Wow.

2313
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:32,150
So you don't have to call her bones break

2314
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:34,930
in the video like this, right?
Really? Yeah, they, they,

2315
02:13:34,931 --> 02:13:38,250
they just healed next to the collarbone
snap and then there's no brace.

2316
02:13:38,251 --> 02:13:38,731
You can put on.

2317
02:13:38,731 --> 02:13:42,200
So you just hold your thing up and then
the bones just heal like this over each

2318
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:45,520
other. Yeah. And so how much stronger
or weaker is it than they used to be?

2319
02:13:45,521 --> 02:13:48,570
I think they get stronger,
but my shoulders are a
little bit in there or, wow,

2320
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:51,570
that is a weird man.
It could be worse though.

2321
02:13:51,571 --> 02:13:55,020
There's a lot worse shit that you can
break. Right? I'm not scared of pain.

2322
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:56,670
Like I've been burned.

2323
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:59,970
I've you sound like a guy was doing this
like interview thing for like a king of

2324
02:13:59,971 --> 02:14:03,720
the cage and routes. No, no, no. Like
patient care to pain. Pain is not like,

2325
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:07,220
oh pay my whole like I'm not
gonna do something cause I
could get hurt. You know,

2326
02:14:07,250 --> 02:14:09,920
like that doesn't bother
me. You know, and I,

2327
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:13,320
and I'm not scared to be humiliated
either. That what I worry about,

2328
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:15,440
I worry about for people that don't have,

2329
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:17,820
like an extensive background
in martial arts is head trauma.

2330
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:19,830
You're not going to know how to get away.

2331
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:21,690
You're not going to know
how to not get hit as hard.

2332
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,830
You're not going to know how
to protect yourself. Judo.

2333
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:28,050
All we do is for the first few months
of learn how to fall down. So I do.

2334
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,153
That's good.

2335
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:33,360
Jumping over someone and then tucking
into a role and all that shit like you

2336
02:14:33,361 --> 02:14:36,060
know, I know to fall down, I'm willing to
bet you get any hint. That's all right.

2337
02:14:36,061 --> 02:14:37,830
Right.
I mean it's just appreciate it.

2338
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:41,850
I appreciate your concern and this is
something I'm probably not going to do,

2339
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:45,370
but just wanted to throw it out to
see if what your thoughts on it.

2340
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:50,310
I seen people take some serious punishment
and change them as a human being

2341
02:14:50,311 --> 02:14:54,300
changed the reality of their life. Right.
Impair their function. Right, right.

2342
02:14:54,301 --> 02:14:57,720
It's real. No, I know that I've seen
it happen not just from men and May,

2343
02:14:57,721 --> 02:15:00,240
but I have a friend who got hit in the
head with a golf ball and he wasn't the

2344
02:15:00,241 --> 02:15:04,380
same for almost a year, so he said
like six months. He was fucked. Fuck.

2345
02:15:04,381 --> 02:15:09,381
Cause every day massive headaches and
it depression and that can happen.

2346
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:11,760
Who hit the golf ball?
Some dude just,

2347
02:15:11,761 --> 02:15:13,530
he got hit with a line
drive right in this side.

2348
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:15,520
Like fuck he's playing golf
or just sitting at his house.

2349
02:15:15,521 --> 02:15:19,950
He was on the golf course and I just
don't have an errant ball hit him in the

2350
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:24,060
temple and he got fucked up man.
He went down hard,

2351
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:28,830
just like totally knocked unconscious
fucked up for a long time.

2352
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:33,330
So what I'm one of my, my point is like
that can happen from a kick to man,

2353
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:34,560
that can happen from a knee.

2354
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:38,460
You can be diving for a takedown and some
guy comes up with some flying knee and

2355
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:42,900
separates your fucking vertebrae. Right?
It's nasty shit man. You can get really,

2356
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:45,690
really hurt if you really want to do
it though. What I was gonna say is,

2357
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:49,260
well you should do is make it a vice
thing. Have them follow you with cameras.

2358
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:53,160
Start like a real training thing. How
then checking on you every couple months,

2359
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:56,520
but do it in a way where you're not
going to hurt yourself, go to a gym.

2360
02:15:56,521 --> 02:15:57,354
Or was it that

2361
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:01,810
you can minimize the amount of damage
that you take with intelligence? Right.

2362
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:03,360
But actually learning some skills.

2363
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:06,000
And so if you really want to do it back
on the show, if I'm in a wheelchair,

2364
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:08,130
of course if I'm stuck,
I'll have you back on the show.

2365
02:16:08,131 --> 02:16:12,310
If you talked to me through a
thing in your neck gel like jet,

2366
02:16:12,311 --> 02:16:16,320
I've listened to you. It was all
right when it came to not doing MMA.

2367
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:19,530
I'm not saying that
anybody should not do MMA.

2368
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,330
I think that if you're
going to take risks,

2369
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:26,810
it's ridiculous to take risks that have
in w within them the possibility of

2370
02:16:26,821 --> 02:16:30,190
massive trauma and,
and not do it correctly.

2371
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:33,640
Like you could get knocked out.
Obviously. Look Anderson Silva,

2372
02:16:33,641 --> 02:16:37,170
who's the greatest mixed martial
arts fighter of all time, right?

2373
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:41,010
And he's the master. He got knocked
unconscious. Janie buddy can

2374
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:46,280
telling to me is complete common
sense, but there's no, but it's just,

2375
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:49,800
it's you're making sense,
right? And, and the thing is,

2376
02:16:49,801 --> 02:16:53,730
it's you telling me they shouldn't start
like, oh man, Joe was talking crazy.

2377
02:16:53,731 --> 02:16:58,200
It's like you're being a good guy
giving me the wisdom of, you know,

2378
02:16:58,201 --> 02:17:02,790
all the stuff you've seen and learn.
Okay. Yeah, there is a, but, but uh,

2379
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:07,250
it's weird, like I just got, um,

2380
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:10,410
did you see the vice HBO series?
Yes.

2381
02:17:10,411 --> 02:17:13,620
It's just like suicide bombers,
you know,

2382
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:16,910
pirates like all dangerous
shit. Right, right, right.

2383
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:18,690
They asked me to be for season two,

2384
02:17:18,691 --> 02:17:22,290
one of the hosts and I just got the
assignment list of things, you know,

2385
02:17:22,291 --> 02:17:26,580
of places to go and it's every
single place I could die, you know?

2386
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:29,220
And it's like,
there's nothing about that.

2387
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:31,080
And I don't know what this says about me,

2388
02:17:31,081 --> 02:17:34,890
but there's nothing about that where
I'm like, oh, I'm scared of my life. Or,

2389
02:17:35,150 --> 02:17:38,220
you know, I'll go anywhere. I
don't give a shit, you know, so,

2390
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:42,870
well then you're the perfect guy for
the job. Cause me, I'm at home going,

2391
02:17:42,871 --> 02:17:46,460
boy would want to be fucking David Show
right now. Well that's why when it,

2392
02:17:46,461 --> 02:17:48,340
when the things you

2393
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:52,820
tell me about hurting myself, those things
don't, that's not a deterrent for me,

2394
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:55,580
but I guess dying is dying.
You're just dead.

2395
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:58,720
Listen man, being in a wheelchair
is, you're, you're traumatized.

2396
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:03,250
I would never want someone like me doing
something to me that I could do to me.

2397
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:08,170
I would never want someone planting a
fucking Shin on my head the way I know I

2398
02:18:08,171 --> 02:18:10,870
can do to somebody. Right? I would
never want someone kicking me in.

2399
02:18:10,871 --> 02:18:13,610
The body punched me in the face the
way I know I can do to somebody. Right?

2400
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,480
I would never want someone
who knows how to strangle me,

2401
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:19,720
strangle me the way I could do to me if
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

2402
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:23,950
So what I'm saying is if you are
going to engage in mixed martial arts,

2403
02:18:23,951 --> 02:18:26,920
you've got to get proficient at a
martial art in order to be able to

2404
02:18:26,921 --> 02:18:29,680
intelligently defend yourself. Cause if
you can't intelligently defend yourself,

2405
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:32,350
someone who's good,
who's going to really fucking hurt you,

2406
02:18:32,351 --> 02:18:34,450
and there's not a goddamn
thing you can do about I am.

2407
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:37,670
It's not going to be a fight,
man. Unfortunately, it's
going to be a fight. Right?

2408
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:40,720
But in, unless you're find someone who's
a novice, it's not going to be a fight.

2409
02:18:40,721 --> 02:18:42,610
It's going to be a
slaughter. No. Unfortunately,

2410
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:45,430
I'm better at defending myself
than being offensive. Like it's,

2411
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:48,070
that's all nice and good. But if you get
a guy who actually knows how to fight,

2412
02:18:48,071 --> 02:18:48,850
you're fucked,
right?

2413
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:51,190
If you're not careful and you go
in there and get some division one,

2414
02:18:51,191 --> 02:18:55,420
all American fucking puts you on your
back in three seconds and starts smashing

2415
02:18:55,421 --> 02:19:00,250
your face with elbows from an impossibly
strong body that's been throwing other

2416
02:19:00,251 --> 02:19:01,630
bodies around its entire life.

2417
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:03,940
And you just thought you're being cute
because you're an artist who likes to

2418
02:19:03,941 --> 02:19:06,490
fuck chicks and you never
work out and you're like, oh,

2419
02:19:06,491 --> 02:19:09,550
I'm just going to go in there and
take an adventure. I'm like, fucking,

2420
02:19:09,670 --> 02:19:13,150
I'm modern day Joe. I'm getting harder
and you've gotta be careful, man.

2421
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:17,070
I don't want you to just sweaty as fuck.
If you lick him, you'll get lighting.

2422
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:20,920
It is grow ovaries.
If he drops a sweat in your mouth,

2423
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:25,220
it's a dangerous thing you're, you're
involved in. I know someone who, you know,

2424
02:19:25,570 --> 02:19:29,420
you have to be careful and sure that
what you should do is take another,

2425
02:19:29,421 --> 02:19:33,350
if you really want to do
this, took another person
who's like you and say, Hey,

2426
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:36,050
let's fight any year. Right?
And let's do it amicably.

2427
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:39,620
Let's get together and let's,
uh,

2428
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:42,950
let's what's both experienced this and
it'll probably make us a language of

2429
02:19:42,951 --> 02:19:46,940
other, more as we're steamy. What you just
described, it was gay sex a little bit.

2430
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:49,010
I'll do this to you and you've
seen it too many times, man.

2431
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:52,460
I've seen people who think they're
tough guys go in there and get,

2432
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:56,480
I don't think I'm going to, I understand.
I don't think I'm going to go in there.

2433
02:19:56,481 --> 02:19:59,810
And you kind of described yourself as
being pretty ferocious and durable and

2434
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:01,910
really good at judo and
the pride of the Dojo.

2435
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,730
So although you might not think you're a
tough guy, you think you're proficient.

2436
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:05,720
Well,
I,

2437
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:10,280
I think I'm able to like protect myself
from like getting those things that's

2438
02:20:10,281 --> 02:20:11,540
all nice and cute. Like, I don't know.

2439
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:13,600
You find somebody who actually
knows how to fight. Right? Right.

2440
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:17,270
You don't know how to protect yourself,
just do it. You just shut the fuck up.

2441
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:20,810
Seriously. I'm trying to help
the guy. It's just I just,

2442
02:20:20,811 --> 02:20:24,110
I've seen it too many times
and I'm acutely aware of
the possibilities and what

2443
02:20:24,111 --> 02:20:28,280
I can do is we're scared to go and it's
something I've already done now so I

2444
02:20:28,281 --> 02:20:29,001
know what it feels like.

2445
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:31,500
I'm more scared to go in front
of audience and do stand up.

2446
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:34,910
Then I think I would be to go and
fight someone. So ferocious fighter.

2447
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:37,030
That's because you haven't done both?
If he did both,

2448
02:20:37,031 --> 02:20:39,370
you'd be way more scared of
fighting in fights before joy.

2449
02:20:39,371 --> 02:20:42,350
I've had the living shit kicked out of
me by like gangs and like a bunch of

2450
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:44,850
people like I know what pain feels like.
It's not like,

2451
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:48,830
like I know what it feels like to get
knocked out and then wake up a day later

2452
02:20:48,831 --> 02:20:52,000
and not know who I am. Like I've,
you know, I'm sure you do know that.

2453
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:56,880
I also know that it's bad. Of course, you
know. Of course, I know that, you know,

2454
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:58,160
I'm saying, man, I just,

2455
02:20:58,161 --> 02:21:01,820
I don't like when people get romantic
about it because it's a part of,

2456
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:06,450
it's not a room. It's almost
like something, I like the
comedy thing, you know, I,

2457
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:10,250
I've done it three times
now and it turned out good,

2458
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:12,470
but I didn't go in there
with that. I was like, Oh,

2459
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:17,030
I'm going to bomb and people are going
to boo me and this and that and I'm,

2460
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:19,790
I'm prepared for that, you know?
But it didn't turn out that way.

2461
02:21:19,791 --> 02:21:22,070
But you know what? I'm good. Yeah.
I'm not going in there going,

2462
02:21:22,071 --> 02:21:24,970
I'm going to be fucking Eddie
Murphy. Like, you know, I

2463
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:25,890
have,

2464
02:21:25,890 --> 02:21:29,550
I've never discouraged someone who wants
to actually be a mixed martial artist.

2465
02:21:29,551 --> 02:21:31,890
I've never discouraged anyone
who wants to ask me in alerting,

2466
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:33,900
mixed martial arts,
taekwondo,

2467
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:37,980
I've never just tried to
discourage anybody who wants
to do something dangerous.

2468
02:21:37,981 --> 02:21:40,140
But I just always say,
if you're going to do it,

2469
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:43,390
just know as many variables as possible,
right?

2470
02:21:43,470 --> 02:21:46,530
There's always variables in a
live fight, right? You don't know.

2471
02:21:46,531 --> 02:21:49,030
You could get hit by the first punch
and you're just lights go out. Right.

2472
02:21:49,410 --> 02:21:52,740
Or you know, weird injuries.
Ha, weird things can happen,

2473
02:21:52,741 --> 02:21:57,240
but you got to be as prepared as possible
in order to be smart about it. Well,

2474
02:21:57,241 --> 02:22:00,110
that's what I would say the most
fighters retire around what age anyways?

2475
02:22:00,111 --> 02:22:04,050
It's completely different. I mean, here's
an interesting thing, Bernard Hopkins,

2476
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:06,720
it's interesting because
it never existed before.

2477
02:22:06,721 --> 02:22:09,480
Bernard Hopkins is the
oldest champion ever.

2478
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:13,170
How old is the light heavyweight champion?
And he's 48 and he's amazing.

2479
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:16,770
He's still out boxing the shit
out of people and doing it.

2480
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:20,460
Let's just say it's a thing of beauty.
I mean, he's a fucking artisan in there.

2481
02:22:20,461 --> 02:22:24,930
He has a craft. It's just like playing
a guitar or, or being a painter.

2482
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:27,230
He's got a craft. He's
an artist at it, right?

2483
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:29,250
He knows how to minimize the
amount of damage he takes.

2484
02:22:29,251 --> 02:22:32,460
It very rarely gets hit and he
knows how to box the fucking ears.

2485
02:22:32,461 --> 02:22:36,310
All the young whippersnappers
but he's 48 so,

2486
02:22:36,450 --> 02:22:40,220
but he takes care of himself,
right? He's eating right, right.

2487
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:42,990
He's working on a regular basis. It
never allows himself to get out of shape.

2488
02:22:43,230 --> 02:22:45,960
He's been fighting forever and he's
got these skills developed over a long

2489
02:22:45,961 --> 02:22:49,200
period of time series. Yeah.
I mean if I did the shit,

2490
02:22:49,201 --> 02:22:52,350
I would treat it totally serious.
I wouldn't go in there fat.

2491
02:22:52,351 --> 02:22:55,980
I would train my ass off for how
long if you like, I don't know.

2492
02:22:56,050 --> 02:22:58,740
Why would you want a year? If you could
do a year, you could get a lot done,

2493
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:01,350
but you would have to make sure
that you were matched up ethically.

2494
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:06,300
That someone is really a nice person, like
matches you up with another guy who's,

2495
02:23:06,510 --> 02:23:07,920
you know,
at least you have a chance.

2496
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:12,510
I know you say you want to go against a
bigger guy. Just someone you're sorry.

2497
02:23:12,511 --> 02:23:17,390
Sorry. Sorry. No, she Yoshi. Why
would you say that? The friend?

2498
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:20,730
Fuck yeah. I don't know. I
wouldn't want to fight Yoshi.

2499
02:23:20,731 --> 02:23:23,400
Yoshi just got that to the death.
Look in his eyes.

2500
02:23:23,950 --> 02:23:26,510
Yoshi might take things into the basement.
I might,

2501
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:31,230
they might evoke the dark Lord. You might
see some fucking hell fire in his eyes.

2502
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:35,640
Oh Man. I just, I get sensitive about
the one issue I don't like to preach,

2503
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:39,780
but there's one issue that I get sensitive
about and is that the frivolous ation

2504
02:23:39,781 --> 02:23:42,080
if that's a word,
I'm not frivolous head impact.

2505
02:23:42,370 --> 02:23:44,900
Well, I'm not frivolous.
Like Joe, I'm telling you,

2506
02:23:44,901 --> 02:23:48,200
I understand repaired to get hurt.
I know that shit.

2507
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:51,650
I know my break something or I
might get knocked out unconscious.

2508
02:23:51,651 --> 02:23:55,100
Like I know that I'm not like saying,
yeah, it's going to be fine. Whatever,

2509
02:23:55,101 --> 02:23:57,800
you know I'm not frivolous thing at all.
I understand.

2510
02:23:58,110 --> 02:24:00,920
I'm just willing to take what you're,
you know, you're, you're in this world.

2511
02:24:00,921 --> 02:24:02,540
I'd thought there'd be a
good guy to talk to him.

2512
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:03,170
Yeah.

2513
02:24:03,170 --> 02:24:06,440
Well if you are really going to dedicate
yourself to and you want to do it as an

2514
02:24:06,441 --> 02:24:08,720
experience, I think in a year
is a good amount of time.

2515
02:24:09,190 --> 02:24:13,030
I think that I, in the same way I started
thinking about maybe adopting a kid,

2516
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:15,240
I just thought also maybe I should fight.

2517
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:20,550
I would say over the fight
first. You know, that seems
like less of a commitment,

2518
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:22,110
right? You know, if you get fucked up,

2519
02:24:22,111 --> 02:24:25,940
hopefully a body shot so many hooks
you to the liver tap out immediately.

2520
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:29,250
I'm just going to stick with the
hermaphrodites. What have you got?

2521
02:24:29,251 --> 02:24:30,600
A hermaphrodite pregnant.
I mean,

2522
02:24:30,601 --> 02:24:33,390
it's a very likely she could still get
pregnant then the baby could suck the

2523
02:24:33,391 --> 02:24:34,680
Dick on the way out. We, we should,

2524
02:24:37,050 --> 02:24:39,870
let's look that up.

2525
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:42,300
Can I hermaphrodite get pregnant now?

2526
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,370
Well, I mean, if I was a,

2527
02:24:45,550 --> 02:24:48,760
I think most hermaphrodites the
Dick is above their vagina. Right?

2528
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:51,040
And I think most inside inside,

2529
02:24:51,041 --> 02:24:53,260
and I think it's just like half
the size and it really doesn't,

2530
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:56,470
even if it gets hard, it's not like
a Dick and just look at it a little.

2531
02:24:56,500 --> 02:25:00,370
I think it's not functional either. Like
it doesn't now see, I wouldn't mind that.

2532
02:25:00,371 --> 02:25:03,430
If the girl's cool and shit, you
can, you know, it'd be cute rubber,

2533
02:25:03,431 --> 02:25:06,640
a little pussy Boehner
and be fun. Um, there's,

2534
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:09,670
there's a porn star that has huge clear
tourists. I can't remember her name,

2535
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:13,810
but like the dudes in the pornos always
suck her clit like it's a little penis.

2536
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:16,450
Okay. Here's the question. Okay.
Here's the questions answered.

2537
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:21,010
A survey suggests that functioning ovaries
are fairly common in the intersexed.

2538
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:24,310
Pregnancy and birth don't happen,
but they happen.

2539
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:27,430
Functioning testes are rarer,
but again,

2540
02:25:27,431 --> 02:25:32,200
not completely unknown functioning
ovaries and functioning testes, however,

2541
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:34,780
plus functioning everything else.
Um,

2542
02:25:34,781 --> 02:25:38,920
I suppose I could propose one far
fetched scenario where it could possibly

2543
02:25:38,921 --> 02:25:43,860
happen, but as a practical matter,
it's not get out. It says so it set,

2544
02:25:43,861 --> 02:25:46,000
what they're basically saying
is that there's variables.

2545
02:25:46,210 --> 02:25:48,880
The same reason why there's
a hermaphrodite in the
first place is because he's

2546
02:25:48,881 --> 02:25:50,520
this weird variation they get.

2547
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:53,950
There's a bunch of different levels of
that variation. It only makes sense.

2548
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:57,220
I mean you think about people are
not the same. We're all different.

2549
02:25:57,221 --> 02:26:00,430
We all look different. We're all shaped
different. We're all different sizes.

2550
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:03,790
It just makes sense that we would have
variations as far as our genitalia girl,

2551
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:06,050
does she have a period
or does she just fart?

2552
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:09,660
Great question. That's another
one you should have not said.

2553
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:14,550
So He'd run those through the
Internet first. Before she told me

2554
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:19,110
the punchline, Jeez, I really enjoyed this
last month and I was gay. I really did.

2555
02:26:19,470 --> 02:26:20,050
I was like,

2556
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:24,190
that's what a punchline dude. It's a
fucking excuse. It's not a punchline.

2557
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:27,370
Do you understand? You're trying to
rationalize it. That's a punchline.

2558
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:31,360
This woman's got a dick up there. It's
okay though. Well, it's just a joke.

2559
02:26:31,361 --> 02:26:33,760
She's the greatest community.
Never Lol.

2560
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:37,510
RFL Mao ladies,
if you're listening,

2561
02:26:37,810 --> 02:26:39,760
it's a fantastic joke to
pull on here and do it.

2562
02:26:39,761 --> 02:26:44,200
Just tell them that used to be a guy or
that there's an extra piece jumps right

2563
02:26:44,201 --> 02:26:48,790
off a fucking cliff and you're like,
that's why it's a next level of joke.

2564
02:26:48,810 --> 02:26:49,720
It's a joke.

2565
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:52,420
Just level doing to your
thinking and correct.

2566
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:56,600
And uh, yeah. My,

2567
02:26:56,810 --> 02:26:58,430
my mom is also like,

2568
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:03,440
she came to Mexico for the show and
she's just letting me know, you know,

2569
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:07,040
my mom had three children. Me, both
my brothers, I'm in the middle.

2570
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:10,920
We're all in our late thirties
now. No one's married. And

2571
02:27:10,980 --> 02:27:15,600
do you think that's how like a rebound
from the strict Korean way of being

2572
02:27:15,601 --> 02:27:16,434
raised?

2573
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:20,350
Me and all my brothers are weird. We're
like weird. People always have that.

2574
02:27:20,690 --> 02:27:24,770
Like all of our cousins, they're
all happily married. Have kids,

2575
02:27:24,771 --> 02:27:27,770
they have normal lives. Like I tell
them my stories and they're like,

2576
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:30,340
Dave's weird uncle Dave.
He's,

2577
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:33,990
you know, right. But I feel weird too.
I, there are people that are suppressed.

2578
02:27:33,991 --> 02:27:35,180
I think everyone's aware.

2579
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:40,230
Yeah. I think talking like I think I'm
normal and I know that that sounds thieves

2580
02:27:40,290 --> 02:27:43,560
crazy. He does crazy shit. And he
thinks, I'm like, I think of the most

2581
02:27:43,670 --> 02:27:46,280
normal person because I just do,

2582
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:49,790
I live like how I think
you're supposed to live.

2583
02:27:49,791 --> 02:27:54,560
And then I meet these people that just
do what society wants them to do and it's

2584
02:27:54,561 --> 02:27:58,760
crazy to me. And they withhold, they
live like fucking pussies. Well,

2585
02:27:58,761 --> 02:27:59,470
you didn't own beings.

2586
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,650
Passionate followers.
We're naturally pattern following.

2587
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:05,110
So we naturally follow successful patterns
of behavior because those have been

2588
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:06,280
proven to be effective.

2589
02:28:06,281 --> 02:28:10,540
So all of our concerns and issues and
insecurities to sort of get ironed out in

2590
02:28:10,541 --> 02:28:13,510
advance by other people that are
successful. Right? So when we,

2591
02:28:13,511 --> 02:28:16,330
when we follow the society
pattern that's set up right now,

2592
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:21,190
the society pattern is,
you know, get married, get
divorced, lose all your money,

2593
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:25,100
get married, stay together, have
a family, get married, you know,

2594
02:28:25,101 --> 02:28:27,890
a [inaudible] and you know,
get married, be super happy.

2595
02:28:27,891 --> 02:28:30,260
There's a few different
possibilities that can happen to you.

2596
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:34,790
It's a bunch of different ones, but you
have to follow the natural paradigms,

2597
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:35,720
right?
If you don't,

2598
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:38,360
there's something wrong with you
and people who are following them.

2599
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:40,880
They don't want to be around
you like especially like wives.

2600
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:44,870
I'm sure you have friends that have
wives that do not want David show.

2601
02:28:44,871 --> 02:28:46,150
Being around the hideous,

2602
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:49,580
David chose talking about getting
his butt hole sucked out of his head,

2603
02:28:49,581 --> 02:28:52,070
his body by some crazy woman.
I got advice

2604
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:54,770
people, but it's not for married
people. It's not for everybody.

2605
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:58,950
My advice is for people who
don't want to be, like if the

2606
02:28:59,460 --> 02:29:00,181
giving advice,

2607
02:29:00,181 --> 02:29:03,630
you're giving out experiences that
you feel are very positive experience,

2608
02:29:03,870 --> 02:29:07,100
I like to go and people can
learn from them. Yeah. When
people go, oh, Dave's lucky.

2609
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:09,800
He, it's like he won the lotto with
the Facebook shit and this, I'm like,

2610
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:12,350
I've been successful at
everything I've ever done.

2611
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:17,380
I've made tons of money doing art,
gambling. It's like, oh. So that,

2612
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:20,270
that was all luck for people don't
know what the Facebook thing is.

2613
02:29:20,271 --> 02:29:22,310
Just in a nutshell,
just spell it out real quick.

2614
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:25,250
That was something that I learned
from gambling that I brought over.

2615
02:29:25,550 --> 02:29:29,420
I had just gotten out of prison and
a guy named mark, uh, Sean Parker,

2616
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:34,310
who started Napster, had, you
know, he's 23 or 24 at the time.

2617
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:39,200
Maybe it's 26 but he was in his young
twenties and he'd already started a couple

2618
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:41,600
of multimillion dollar companies.
None that really made any money.

2619
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:45,260
Plaxo didn't make any money. Napster
got sued for, I think, $1 trillion.

2620
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:49,490
So this was his next project and this
whole time he was a fan of my art.

2621
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:53,690
He's like, Dave, I got to get
a painting from you. Like,
you're a sick fuck like me.

2622
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:56,360
I need to get a painting from you,
but I'm being sued right now.

2623
02:29:56,361 --> 02:30:01,160
I can't afford it, this and that. And so
when Facebook came up, he's like, look,

2624
02:30:01,161 --> 02:30:04,550
there's this new social media site that
connects college kids. And I was like,

2625
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:06,680
that sounds gay.
And he goes,

2626
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:11,600
and we have some financial backing so
now I could finally pay you to do a

2627
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:15,770
painting. And I said, or if you want,

2628
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:19,820
if if, and he's, you know,
he's an innovator. He's
like, I'm going to fucking,

2629
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:23,120
the shit is going to take over the world.
This, I'm going to change the world.

2630
02:30:23,121 --> 02:30:25,280
This is good.
If if you don't want,

2631
02:30:25,310 --> 02:30:28,400
then I could give you stocks
in the company and I needed
money because I needed

2632
02:30:28,401 --> 02:30:31,490
to pay my lawyers. I need to pay
all my ex girlfriend, my friends,

2633
02:30:31,491 --> 02:30:35,570
I need to pay everyone back. And I
said, I don't know about social media.

2634
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:39,260
I was never on my space. I
was never on any of these
things. I said, you know what?

2635
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:40,580
I believe in this kid.

2636
02:30:40,610 --> 02:30:44,150
So I took the stock stock ended up being
worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

2637
02:30:44,151 --> 02:30:48,500
So overnight that made me, I guess the
highest living paid artists in the world,

2638
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:49,670
which is pretty cool.

2639
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:54,830
But before that I was pretty
successful at everything else I did.

2640
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:58,250
And uh, why do you think that is? Well,

2641
02:30:58,610 --> 02:31:00,530
I just came back from this conference in,

2642
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:04,520
in Norway of the all the top chefs in
the world. So I'm like, this is cool.

2643
02:31:04,521 --> 02:31:06,080
I like this.
I'm in a new environment.

2644
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:10,370
It was sort of like show of boarding
boarding didn't go, that's why I went.

2645
02:31:10,730 --> 02:31:15,590
David Chang who has Momofuku in New York
goes board and please come this year is

2646
02:31:15,591 --> 02:31:19,410
talking about guts about being brave
and you come and boarding. It's like,

2647
02:31:19,411 --> 02:31:20,244
are you kidding me?

2648
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,980
I'm not going to fucking embarrass
myself in front of the top chefs.

2649
02:31:22,981 --> 02:31:27,390
I've been out of this game.
Like he's like, Dave, you
should go. And so I'm like,

2650
02:31:27,391 --> 02:31:30,930
what am I going to do? And I just started
thinking I want to start doing standup.

2651
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:33,150
So Dave Chang was like,
Dave,

2652
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:36,960
why don't you come and like you'll be
the first non shift that's been asked to

2653
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:41,961
speak at a fucking chef conference of
600 of like the top Michelin Star chefs.

2654
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:47,010
And I don't know these people, I get
off the plane and they're like, Dave,

2655
02:31:47,011 --> 02:31:51,840
we're going to eat at nomo tonight.
You know, and uh, or Nola, sorry,

2656
02:31:51,841 --> 02:31:56,160
I said it wrong. Fucking
retarded. He'll reading at Nola
tonight. I'm like, oh, Nobu.

2657
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,850
And I'm, I'm like, oh, there's
a Nobu Nobu in Copenhagen.

2658
02:31:59,970 --> 02:32:04,650
Nola is the fucking number one voted
restaurant in the world like four years in

2659
02:32:04,651 --> 02:32:07,350
a row. Like, it's like an
eating experience. You've never,

2660
02:32:07,470 --> 02:32:09,690
the guy that runs a Nola,

2661
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:13,890
Renee is a fucking like Picasso
of the cooking world. I mean,

2662
02:32:13,891 --> 02:32:18,570
just insane. Like, like he'll put
this in front of you and you're like,

2663
02:32:18,571 --> 02:32:19,860
what is this?
And it's like,

2664
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:24,240
this is a rock that I just shit with
food that you would never believe.

2665
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:28,980
And so I'm here with these highly,
highly successful people that are like,

2666
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:34,260
you know, a fucking Darrio cine, uh, um,

2667
02:32:35,490 --> 02:32:40,040
fucking, I can't even remember all their
names. Alex had Taylor from Brazil. Um,

2668
02:32:40,470 --> 02:32:44,640
they all have the number one restaurant
in their city, you know, the guys in La.

2669
02:32:44,641 --> 02:32:47,400
And this for me, it's amazing
because Dave's like, you know,

2670
02:32:47,401 --> 02:32:49,530
we're not going to be able to pay you.
We can get you out here,

2671
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:53,640
but you will never have to fucking wait
to eat at any of these restaurants ever.

2672
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:56,160
And I'm like, I'll do it just
for that. And I get there.

2673
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:58,470
And so I don't know who
any of these people are,

2674
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:02,430
but they are the fucking
champions of the cooking world.

2675
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:07,140
And so I got to hang out with
them for a week. And it, it's,

2676
02:33:07,710 --> 02:33:12,510
you once talk about following
patterns of success. I mean they,

2677
02:33:12,690 --> 02:33:17,280
first of all, they're all angry,
like an insane amounts of like,

2678
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:21,120
this is the way you run a restaurant
and why they challenge everything.

2679
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:25,920
They are fucking brave. They fucking
went for it. Like everyone said,

2680
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:28,080
a restaurant is going to fail.

2681
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:31,890
The chances of a restaurants thing
in business is not that good.

2682
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:36,750
And who's going to want to eat a
fucking Taco that has Korean media?

2683
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:41,250
Like you're, they're challenging the
norm. They're challenging society and,

2684
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:44,640
and they're all crazy challenging
society with Tacos. Just, you know,

2685
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:47,280
whenever you go to a
restaurant and you like,

2686
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:50,460
well that's the thing is I went there
and I was like, I don't know. I don't,

2687
02:33:50,490 --> 02:33:51,570
I don't even know why I'm here.

2688
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:55,260
So these guys are talking about what
do you mean you'd have to eat? No,

2689
02:33:55,261 --> 02:33:59,580
it was about next level food. Like
how does it was serious, right?

2690
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:03,450
It's like what food is doing to the
conference conference. Yeah. Okay.

2691
02:34:03,451 --> 02:34:06,480
I thought you meant the restaurant.
Oh, well the restaurant was to eat,

2692
02:34:06,481 --> 02:34:10,530
but then the whole conference was like
the fucking shitty food we're serving in

2693
02:34:10,531 --> 02:34:15,330
public schools. Uh, like a guy that,
a speaker there was from Somalia,

2694
02:34:15,331 --> 02:34:18,520
his restaurant had been blown up like
three times and he keeps opening it.

2695
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:21,790
So it was about all these,
it was sort of like on a serious topic,

2696
02:34:21,791 --> 02:34:24,700
like the state of food right
now with overpopulation.

2697
02:34:24,701 --> 02:34:28,780
And what that's doing to create
like dark snow and just, I'm like,

2698
02:34:28,781 --> 02:34:31,300
what the fuck am I doing here?
You know?

2699
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:36,600
And it was super serious and they're
covering like real issues about food and,

2700
02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:40,120
and the world and this and that.
And then I just,

2701
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:43,870
I just went on stage and started talking
about how everything makes me shit.

2702
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:46,920
That's all I could do, you know?
And she tried to do stand up.

2703
02:34:47,250 --> 02:34:50,710
I did standup and it was amazing.
Like that's hilarious. Yeah,

2704
02:34:50,711 --> 02:34:53,110
it was fucking awesome. Like I was, I,

2705
02:34:53,111 --> 02:34:55,540
I puked before I went for
a walk and I was like,

2706
02:34:57,010 --> 02:35:00,580
the girl before me was a 10 year old
speaker that talked about how she changed

2707
02:35:00,610 --> 02:35:04,270
the way people eat in Africa,
offer offer blog. And I'm like,

2708
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:06,820
I need to kill myself.
Oh my gosh.

2709
02:35:06,821 --> 02:35:09,300
I think she's 10 and she changed
the way they eat now. Yeah.

2710
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:12,710
She started a blog about how
people are starving and, and,

2711
02:35:12,810 --> 02:35:16,750
and everyone's crying and clapping
and I'm like, Holy Shit. I was like,

2712
02:35:16,751 --> 02:35:19,330
I can't go up there and try
to sound like I'm a food guy.

2713
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:24,010
And I just talked about things that
give you diarrhea. Well, I'm Asian,

2714
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:27,820
you know, I, I grew up, man,
I'm Asian. I grew up in America.

2715
02:35:27,830 --> 02:35:32,170
I'm Asians aren't supposed to
eat lasagna then they, no. Why?

2716
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:34,720
There's no cheese in Korean food.
There's not no,

2717
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:37,930
there's no cheese in Korean food.
So you can't eat lasagna.

2718
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:42,690
Thousands of years of Koreans eating rice
and soup and Korean, seaweed and shit.

2719
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:47,380
Korea Poulenc wine. They come to America.
What did you say Brian? Korean poo wine.

2720
02:35:47,500 --> 02:35:48,160
What does that,

2721
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:53,160
it's something in Korea that's a medicine
vice did a thing on it where they

2722
02:35:53,201 --> 02:35:57,010
take, uh, the poo of a seven
year old child. Oh, come on.

2723
02:35:57,610 --> 02:36:00,370
And they actually had a reporter
from vice that had to take it.

2724
02:36:00,371 --> 02:36:04,630
And I felt so bad for her. She was so
nice about it. She drank the poo wine.

2725
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:06,390
I don't know about Korea.
I don't want to say this.

2726
02:36:07,030 --> 02:36:08,980
Basically she cut that off to it.
There's

2727
02:36:08,980 --> 02:36:13,490
no, there's no, you know, all the shit
that there's, that's part of American die,

2728
02:36:13,491 --> 02:36:17,980
like hamburgers, spaghetti, Tacos,
all this shit. This is all new.

2729
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:22,810
You know, this is all new.
So your genetics are not set
up for cheese. So what WWE,

2730
02:36:22,930 --> 02:36:26,230
so my entire life I've had
irritable bowel syndrome. Wow.

2731
02:36:26,231 --> 02:36:27,940
Life my whole life.

2732
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:33,010
A part of the anxiety is I'm going to
go talk to Joe Right now, live for,

2733
02:36:33,011 --> 02:36:36,820
I don't know, an hour or two hours,
whatever. If I'm getting nervous,

2734
02:36:36,821 --> 02:36:39,970
I have to shit like I what?
I'm going to make this guy live,

2735
02:36:39,971 --> 02:36:41,290
cut the thing so I have to run.

2736
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:44,140
So that gives me more anxiety
and that adds to the pukey.

2737
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:49,180
So did you cut dairy out of your diet?
I S I love Lasagna. I can't stop.

2738
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:52,480
You know, that's just your decision.
You love design you more than you love,

2739
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:56,120
not shitting yourself. I love comics
the same way you love comics. Okay?

2740
02:36:56,140 --> 02:37:00,550
But I grew up reading like
Calvin and Hobbes for, I
started with the funnies, the,

2741
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:04,690
the newspaper, you know, like Garfield,
Calvin and Hobbes, right. All that shit.

2742
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:09,610
And so I was obsessed with Garfield,
like eating Lasagna,

2743
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:12,460
you know, I'm like, why? Why
does this cat eat? You know,

2744
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,520
because I'm an Asian kid eating rice
and fucking Kimchi. I forgot about,

2745
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:19,940
I don't know. I don't know what was,
I don't even know how to pronounce it.

2746
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,370
[inaudible] you know, so let's
tag. I'm like, you know, and,

2747
02:37:24,410 --> 02:37:28,730
and I don't know what it is. It's like a
exotic foreign white people food thing.

2748
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:32,840
And then my aunt brings it one day and
we eat the shit out of it. And I'm like,

2749
02:37:33,050 --> 02:37:38,050
no wonder Garfield loves it because it's
cheesy and it's got tomato sauce and

2750
02:37:38,271 --> 02:37:42,350
what does it do? It explodes out
of my ass. It's like poison to me.

2751
02:37:42,351 --> 02:37:45,350
I can't eat this shit. I can't
eat dairy. I'm lactose intolerant,

2752
02:37:45,710 --> 02:37:49,460
but it tastes so good. There's nothing
in Korean food that tastes close to that.

2753
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:53,360
I mean, we have other delicious treats,
but nothing like that. So I'm like, look,

2754
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:54,461
I told you,

2755
02:37:54,461 --> 02:37:57,350
but you were really willing to take
that just for the delicious taste.

2756
02:37:57,650 --> 02:38:01,670
You willing to just do it a shit
yourself. I do it even today. Now, I mean,

2757
02:38:01,671 --> 02:38:06,340
my eye, I've had irritable bowel syndrome,
so I've always looked it up on, on uh,

2758
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:08,610
you know, web MD and
shit like that. How it,

2759
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:13,910
there's no known cause for it,
but they think it's most likely stress,

2760
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:19,070
you know? So, um, but wouldn't
it be dietary? Well it's,
it's, it's a combination.

2761
02:38:19,071 --> 02:38:22,730
I have the IBS from like the
nonstop stress and then also the,

2762
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:26,570
the dietary part of it. So yeah, I
cut down a little bit on the dairy,

2763
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:29,360
but the stress part,
a lot of it came from the gambling,

2764
02:38:29,361 --> 02:38:33,710
from all the taking all these insane
chances. Like I'll tell you like, oh,

2765
02:38:33,711 --> 02:38:37,940
I'm going to fight some crazy killer and
I might get my shit kicked in, whatever.

2766
02:38:38,120 --> 02:38:42,200
Like I'm cool, like out here, but
inside I'm like, oh my God, you know,

2767
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:46,070
or we're going to send you to interview
some Somali pirates and they might chop

2768
02:38:46,071 --> 02:38:50,510
your head off, you know? Cool, no
problem. But inside I'm just shitting.

2769
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:55,100
I'm just a fucking mess.
So I internalize it.

2770
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:59,120
So as I've eliminated less
stress from my life, I've,

2771
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:03,530
the IBS has gotten better, you know?
Jesus. So, so that's what I did.

2772
02:39:03,531 --> 02:39:04,920
My whole act on and the,

2773
02:39:04,921 --> 02:39:08,210
and you know when I Friends Harris
widows who writes for eastbound and down,

2774
02:39:08,390 --> 02:39:12,470
he does stand up to, and I
said, dude, what the fuck do
I talk about? And he goes,

2775
02:39:13,220 --> 02:39:16,940
anytime you do stand up,
like it's a fucking cheap
shot, it's a no brainer shit.

2776
02:39:16,941 --> 02:39:20,310
Stories always kills, you
know, so I went up and I, and,

2777
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:22,760
and it did like the people
there were like, I was like,

2778
02:39:22,761 --> 02:39:26,090
all that food you guys serve me, makes me
shit. And you know, I turned it around.

2779
02:39:26,091 --> 02:39:30,920
I ended up talking about, you know, how
I'm in a different, um, practicing them.

2780
02:39:30,921 --> 02:39:34,070
But you know,
if you want to be successful,

2781
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:37,040
if you're not focused in life
is to be like a family person.

2782
02:39:37,041 --> 02:39:41,060
But if you want to be the absolute
best of whatever your field is,

2783
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:44,840
then you have to take chances. You can't
be a pussy, you can't be a follower,

2784
02:39:44,930 --> 02:39:45,920
you can't follow.

2785
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:50,810
You have to break constantly and
challenge yourself and challenge the way

2786
02:39:50,811 --> 02:39:52,520
everything is.
You have to question things.

2787
02:39:52,521 --> 02:39:56,700
And it's scary because no one else has
done it. So shitting yourself, you're

2788
02:39:58,790 --> 02:40:01,130
challenging yourself. Well that, well

2789
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:07,670
that is the joke part, but when it was at
its worst, I didn't leave the house. Wow,

2790
02:40:07,671 --> 02:40:11,300
that's so crazy. This is my diet
up. This is, this was my day. Well,

2791
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:13,980
it wasn't just the dice.
Well, how of a variation did

2792
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,840
you give your diet? Oh, did you ever cut
out gluten? Did you ever cut out dairy,

2793
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:23,110
everything and just try to eat nothing
but meat and vegetables? Uh, I've, yeah,

2794
02:40:23,130 --> 02:40:27,750
I've done every different kind of like
I've tried nothing else. Uh, you know,

2795
02:40:27,751 --> 02:40:30,900
I did just protein stuff. I've
done, I've done different stuff.

2796
02:40:30,901 --> 02:40:35,430
But at the end of the day, it's always
the, the stress that gets to me. You know,

2797
02:40:35,530 --> 02:40:40,280
what stress feel like
I'm in therapy. Well,

2798
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:43,980
I've been in jail a lot of times. The,
which means I did a lot of bad things.

2799
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:47,670
So yeah, I used to like constantly
be looking over my shoulder.

2800
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:51,870
So that's the stress. That was when I was
younger than the gambling. Every time,

2801
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:55,950
every week I would put my entire life
savings on the line. So it's like, wow,

2802
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:59,580
I'm in Vegas. Someone else's like having
a good time, going to a strip club,

2803
02:40:59,581 --> 02:41:00,210
whatever.

2804
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:04,170
I'm risking everything I've ever worked
for right now that creates stress. Wow.

2805
02:41:04,330 --> 02:41:09,210
And how do you deal with that today?
Well, I don't gamble anymore that,

2806
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:12,540
that she couldn't take it anymore.
It's just, it's just stupid.

2807
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:14,820
There's no reason for me
to gamble when you have,

2808
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:18,600
when you made as much money as me,
it's just retarded to gamble, right?

2809
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:21,580
Because you can get caught up and lose
it all. What's the point? You know?

2810
02:41:21,581 --> 02:41:23,320
And it can happen,
right? People, of course,

2811
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:25,380
especially when you go to
Macau and they're like,

2812
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:28,080
do you want to fucking bet
bet with million dollar chips,

2813
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:33,920
it makes me so nervous. It makes your day
can shrivel up into your body, you know,

2814
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:35,730
pass by those tables in Vegas.

2815
02:41:35,731 --> 02:41:39,840
And I see someone who's willing to bet
like $25,000 on a roll of roulette. Right?

2816
02:41:39,930 --> 02:41:43,200
I've seen it happen. Oh No, that
was me. Oh, what a crazy move.

2817
02:41:43,201 --> 02:41:44,220
That's the pink chips.

2818
02:41:44,390 --> 02:41:49,390
And I got to the point in Vegas where
they knew me and they would let me bet a

2819
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:52,920
quarter of million white one $7
million one night in Vegas and he's,

2820
02:41:52,921 --> 02:41:56,820
he's lost as much as a million. You guys
should get together and make out. I mean,

2821
02:41:56,821 --> 02:42:00,210
that guy has made a shit ton of money
doing UFC. And so to get his dick hard,

2822
02:42:00,211 --> 02:42:02,790
he has to that like that, you
know his dick hard. That's a,

2823
02:42:02,791 --> 02:42:06,630
that is not going to sit oppression for
gamblers, isn't it? I mean his dick hard.

2824
02:42:06,631 --> 02:42:09,240
Yeah. What's he going to do? Sit
at a table and play $20 blackjack,

2825
02:42:09,270 --> 02:42:13,470
like nickel slots. What is it about
people that love, first of all,

2826
02:42:13,570 --> 02:42:18,090
use a lot of UFC takes place in Vegas,
right? Yeah. So He's there alone. Okay.

2827
02:42:18,091 --> 02:42:18,511
So that's,

2828
02:42:18,511 --> 02:42:23,370
the UFC office is in vague and if
he's an addict then he's dangerously,

2829
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:27,100
you know, like that's a
horrible place to live. Yeah.

2830
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:30,030
But he's getting away with it because
he's rich and it makes a lot of money.

2831
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:32,350
Right. And he figures out how to do
it and he's good at it. We'll see.

2832
02:42:32,351 --> 02:42:34,290
You in Vegas that kept you off.
You know,

2833
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:37,020
you can't bet like you can't bet
the way you doing in the cow.

2834
02:42:37,050 --> 02:42:39,270
Well that's one of the reasons
why we stopped being at the palms.

2835
02:42:39,271 --> 02:42:44,010
They cut back his uh, his limit cut back
his credit cause he was killing them.

2836
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:45,960
Yeah. If you, if you
have a shit ton of money,

2837
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:48,540
if you have a bank roll
and you know how to gamble,

2838
02:42:48,630 --> 02:42:52,030
you could fucking knock one of
those casinos out and you know it.

2839
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:56,610
They'll fucking, yeah, it's a good
feeling. That's Hilarious, man.

2840
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:00,520
It's so crazy and dangerous and wild.
The idea Penton,

2841
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:03,190
how much fucking money I don't,

2842
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:09,310
how did you think I got to that
point? Oh, I'm sure you know yet that,

2843
02:43:09,330 --> 02:43:12,340
don't get me wrong.
You bet with your life savings and when,

2844
02:43:12,341 --> 02:43:15,190
when till you get to the point
where you're like, oh, now I'm like,

2845
02:43:15,191 --> 02:43:17,120
those guys betting $25,000.
Well,

2846
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:19,750
you're a smart guy and you
also know that there's some,

2847
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:23,530
there's some ways as a gambler in quotes,

2848
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:26,950
you can sort of minimize the risks and
it's by being very intelligent about what

2849
02:43:26,951 --> 02:43:29,920
you're doing, right? That's exactly what
I'm telling you about MMA fighter, right,

2850
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:34,930
but with much more everlasting
repercussions because if you get broke,

2851
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:37,420
you're a smart guy, you'll figure
out how to get money. Again, you,

2852
02:43:37,450 --> 02:43:39,640
you already know the drill,
you know how to get rich,

2853
02:43:39,670 --> 02:43:40,810
but I'm not trying to be like a,

2854
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:43,300
like a professional fighter
with their long career.

2855
02:43:43,301 --> 02:43:46,150
I'm trying to have why I understand,
but I'll tell you what, you get a,

2856
02:43:46,220 --> 02:43:50,140
I could kill me. Tiago Alvarez and one
fight could change your fucking life,

2857
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:50,470
right?

2858
02:43:50,470 --> 02:43:52,720
That motherfucker would change the
whole rest of your life with a couple of

2859
02:43:52,721 --> 02:43:55,580
knees. It's just you got to
make sure that if you're,

2860
02:43:55,610 --> 02:43:57,340
you're finding someone
that they're like you,

2861
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:01,720
a guy who's not necessarily
a lifelong expert.

2862
02:44:01,721 --> 02:44:05,410
Maybe there's a little bit of martial
arts and you got to get good at protecting

2863
02:44:05,411 --> 02:44:06,400
yourself against strikes.

2864
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:08,910
That's the big one because it
sounds like if you have a judo base,

2865
02:44:08,911 --> 02:44:10,030
you'd probably really good grappler.

2866
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:14,230
Judo guys are notoriously strong
core strength, hard to take down.

2867
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:15,700
I give it amazing bear hugs,

2868
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:19,760
but the striking striking is a
totally different thing. I have no,

2869
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,250
we'll set you up,

2870
02:44:21,280 --> 02:44:25,180
fake you out and drop off fucking bomb
on your noodle and you're not going to

2871
02:44:25,181 --> 02:44:28,060
like it. I have a weak chin.
I'll get knocked the fuck out.

2872
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:32,950
One cin one knock right here. I'll out
do it man. Don't do it then. Trust me.

2873
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:34,750
It's about a grappling match.
You could,

2874
02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:38,620
that could be some hardcore shit you
could learn Jujitsu weren't learning

2875
02:44:38,621 --> 02:44:39,454
Jujitsu.

2876
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:43,810
Get into a school like train and train
for grappling match and the worst case

2877
02:44:43,811 --> 02:44:46,600
scenario is you get tapped out,
you get strangled, you tapped out.

2878
02:44:46,601 --> 02:44:50,350
You're all right. You get an arm bar,
you tap out and it'll be fucking crazy,

2879
02:44:50,351 --> 02:44:51,340
wild and fun,

2880
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:54,190
but you don't have to worry about
the lasting effects of head trauma.

2881
02:44:54,850 --> 02:44:57,790
It's still as possibly and
potentially very dangerous,

2882
02:44:57,970 --> 02:45:01,090
but you'll minimize the risks
considerably when you take out striking.

2883
02:45:01,790 --> 02:45:03,490
We'll just tell people
if you want to fight,

2884
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:05,380
that shit should be a solitary thing.

2885
02:45:05,650 --> 02:45:07,270
There should be nothing else
you want to do in your life.

2886
02:45:07,271 --> 02:45:10,720
I don't want to fight and be a
bestselling author and be a fighter pilot.

2887
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:13,060
It's what do you want to do?
Do you want to fight? Okay. No,

2888
02:45:13,061 --> 02:45:14,910
this dude's out there
that only want to find.

2889
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:17,160
I decided that this is something
I'm going to do. I'm not going to,

2890
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:20,140
I'm told anything else. I'll train
and that'll be it. That'll be my life.

2891
02:45:20,141 --> 02:45:22,420
Should do painting two you'd be
like me and multiple Musashi.

2892
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:25,660
He was a Great Samurai who also did
a lot of calligraphy and painting.

2893
02:45:25,661 --> 02:45:27,850
He thought it was important.
Write poetry. I mean,

2894
02:45:28,050 --> 02:45:30,820
I mean the way I throw myself into
when I paint, that's all I do.

2895
02:45:31,210 --> 02:45:33,730
Throw my shit like I'm
like, this is, you know,

2896
02:45:33,731 --> 02:45:36,820
there's always going to be someone better
than me, but as far as I'm concerned,

2897
02:45:36,850 --> 02:45:41,450
I'm going to do the best I can and there's
nothing besides painting that's going

2898
02:45:41,451 --> 02:45:43,750
to obsess.
We had a cool conversation about work,

2899
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:45,310
like last time I was at your place,

2900
02:45:45,550 --> 02:45:48,240
you know you go through
like these like spurts.

2901
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:52,360
Sometimes we just decide to just attack
and just start working. But yeah,

2902
02:45:52,361 --> 02:45:53,780
I do that but also the same,

2903
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:56,620
same way like you know when
people are like I'm an artist.

2904
02:45:56,621 --> 02:45:57,910
I'm like this is what I do.

2905
02:45:57,970 --> 02:46:01,480
Like even though I haven't painted like
for four years I do something creative

2906
02:46:01,481 --> 02:46:04,720
every day and if I had to
paint for a career like living,

2907
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:07,450
then I don't do the gay. Like, oh,

2908
02:46:07,451 --> 02:46:11,570
I only paint when I'm emotionally like
move to do it. Or when I feel like it,

2909
02:46:11,571 --> 02:46:15,810
like whether I feel like shit, like
it's a real job. I show up every day,

2910
02:46:15,860 --> 02:46:19,910
every everyday repetition.
Paint a horse painted a thousand times,

2911
02:46:19,911 --> 02:46:22,490
it'll get better.
It's like it's a real job.

2912
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:25,970
I paint whether my girlfriend dumped
me or whether she's sucking my dick or

2913
02:46:25,971 --> 02:46:30,260
whatever. Every fucking day you
paint, no matter what. No excuse.

2914
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:33,230
That's a beautiful statement right there
and the people should take that and

2915
02:46:33,231 --> 02:46:34,980
make a video. I don't
be fucking gates. Just

2916
02:46:37,770 --> 02:46:42,110
the gay as in like, I don't, I don't
feel like I know what you're saying.

2917
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:46,420
I need inspiration. Fuck
your inspirations. You
shouldn't call it gay. Okay.

2918
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:51,140
You Force yourself, you force yourself
transgender. Don't call it that either.

2919
02:46:51,141 --> 02:46:52,360
Dick.
Um,

2920
02:46:54,380 --> 02:46:59,030
well gay as in Glorious and amazing
and yeah,

2921
02:47:02,030 --> 02:47:06,170
I know what you're saying. I know
what you're saying. It's um, I, I've,

2922
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:08,900
I feel where you're coming from. You're
like, you're, it's a call to arms.

2923
02:47:08,930 --> 02:47:12,410
Get up and work. Get your shit
done. If you're a professional,

2924
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:15,440
you do it every day and that's how the
work gets done. And don't be a wimp.

2925
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:18,410
Don't be a pussy. Don't be weak. Don't be
a pussy. Shouldn't say, don't be a pussy.

2926
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:22,250
[inaudible] amazing. It's
one of my favorite things.
Yeah, but don't say Ethiopia.

2927
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:24,590
Why would you would be something amazing?

2928
02:47:25,250 --> 02:47:29,140
That'd be something I'd want to lick and
lick my stuff all day. It's not, it's,

2929
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:33,610
it's just, it seems wrong to call
someone a pussy and that means it's,

2930
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:37,700
he's a bad thing. I'm not trying to change
the language here. All right. It works.

2931
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:38,990
It's better than fag.

2932
02:47:39,290 --> 02:47:42,050
But when they say don't be a pussy or
are they talking about like a pussy cat,

2933
02:47:42,051 --> 02:47:44,960
like a cat, is that worth
talking about? I don't know.

2934
02:47:44,961 --> 02:47:49,961
I mean the fat fuck Garfield Lasagna
and Cock sucker gave me irritable bowel

2935
02:47:50,331 --> 02:47:55,280
syndrome, but it's like for,
for success and shit like that.

2936
02:47:55,281 --> 02:47:58,730
Like especially with music or art
or something creative, it's like,

2937
02:47:58,760 --> 02:48:00,800
it's easy to be like,
I only feel inspired.

2938
02:48:00,801 --> 02:48:04,680
It's like fuck that repetition
putting in the time,

2939
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:07,870
put it in, put in the time like, yeah,

2940
02:48:08,030 --> 02:48:10,820
force yourself whether you feel like
it or not. And you know, that's,

2941
02:48:10,850 --> 02:48:14,840
that's the way you do it. You're dead
right. You're dead right. That training,

2942
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:18,150
it's training. It applies to
comedy, applies to martial arts.

2943
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:19,040
This applies to everything.

2944
02:48:19,041 --> 02:48:21,740
And that's why when I paint
something like in two seconds, it's,

2945
02:48:21,741 --> 02:48:25,100
cause I've already painted it
a thousand times, you know, so

2946
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:27,800
I don't want to be a Dick Joe,

2947
02:48:28,010 --> 02:48:33,010
but I have to actually run back to
silver other set up and I have to get,

2948
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:37,930
uh, a painting done. Dude, I'm
broke out of time anyway. There was,

2949
02:48:37,950 --> 02:48:39,860
there's a lot of fun, man.
You were fired up today, dude,

2950
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:42,550
you could tell you've been doing a lot
of podcasts. You're a different person.

2951
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:46,970
Am I get a lot of shit to say now you're
an animal man. When you get comfortable,

2952
02:48:46,971 --> 02:48:50,500
you get wound up and you just fucking
fire off. Is this show over? Show's over.

2953
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:53,480
Show is, um, it is right now. A six, 12.

2954
02:48:53,510 --> 02:48:56,070
Does it do just end it whenever
you feel like it ended?

2955
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:58,060
Whenever I feel like we don't
have any producers plan.

2956
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:01,400
I got to beat traffic and feet.
That traffic son.

2957
02:49:01,430 --> 02:49:05,690
I'm going to bribe a are a Brie plaza
into being my best friend. Who's that?

2958
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:09,160
She's the actress from doing shout
outs right now. No, no, no, no.

2959
02:49:09,161 --> 02:49:11,520
Given someone a shout. Oh,
I got to go. How dare you.

2960
02:49:11,580 --> 02:49:14,640
She wants a painting for me and I said,
it's for you to get a painting for me.

2961
02:49:14,641 --> 02:49:15,470

02:49:47,611 --> 02:49:48,840
he has his own show called Yoshi.

2971
02:49:48,841 --> 02:49:51,880
Didn't go listen to that show
