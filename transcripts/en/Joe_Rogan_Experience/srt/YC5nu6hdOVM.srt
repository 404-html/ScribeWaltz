1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,420
Hey fuckers,
what's going on?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,840
Party people.
Welcome.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,780
Welcome once again to the Joe Rogan 
experience podcast.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,900
This episode is brought to you by 
stamps.com

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,290
stamps.com.
If you've ever gone to desk dot TV and 

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,110
ordered one of those cute little kitty 
cat tee shirts,

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,950
guess how they get to you bitches?
They get to you through stamps.com

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,280
because that's what brian red band uses.
You can buy and print official US 

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,860
postage for any letter or package using 
your own computer and printer and unlike

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,770
the post office stamps.com
never closes.

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,630
You can get posted whenever you need it.
Twenty four slash seven to a great asset

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,130
for small businesses

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,190
and not only it can eat,
you can buy these stamps so it looks 

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,000
just like a stamp or you could just buy 
it like on a.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,550
It just prints it out.
So like if you have an envelope,

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,930
just an envelope in your printer and it 
prints the stamp right on the,

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,990
on the envelope.
It's so fucking easy.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,070
Like I was scared to use this for awhile
when I first started shipping tee shirts

19
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:04,071
out.
I would actually go to the post office 

20
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:05,781
and sit there for like an hour with 
these boxes where this old lady that 

21
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:08,610
sits there puts a stamp on it and go 
ways it and it took forever.

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,630
So I finally did this and man,
I will never ever go to that post office

23
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,020
again.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,280
Post offices,
brutal.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,240
There's a reason why they fucking shoot 
each other every now and again.

26
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,670
They just fucking inbox outbox and bug.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,660
I think the post office stamps.com,
I think it was like super fast,

28
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,460
like why are they saying.

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,380
It seems to me that the post office is 
on its way out.

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,580
The ups store is way fucking easier to 
use and something like stamps.com.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,820
If you have a small business,
why you would be crazy to use anything 

32
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,381
else.
Like it's the last thing you ever want 

33
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:49,641
to do is take a bunch of fucking 
packages to the post office with 

34
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:50,310
stamps.com.
You don't have to do that shit.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,740
You can do it whenever you want.
Twenty four hours a day.

36
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:55,260
It's convenient.
It's the way you want it.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,290
You can just anytime you want,
wake up at three in the morning and do 

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,810
it.
You don't have to go in line and have to

39
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,940
do.
You have to deal with nobody else.

40
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,470
It's a.
it's a beautiful thing.

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,400
If you use the Promo Code J R,
e,

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,180
m,
if you look up,

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,990
if you go to stamps.com,
there's a little microphone in the upper

44
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:17,991
right hand corner and if you go to that 
microphone I said Adam Carolla 

45
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:17,991
microphone.

46
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:22,130
It's an old school one.
Chris rock from one of his specials and 

47
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,881
Lenny Bruce too.
Nobody ever really used those 

48
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:25,881
microphones,
but if you want to look slick,

49
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,490
you'd get one of those microphones.
Meanwhile,

50
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:30,300
those microphones are pieces of shit.
It would sound like fucking dog shit.

51
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,360
If you ever did a comedy show and you 
had one of those microphones,

52
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,660
everybody wants to use those microphones
for like their fucking head shots,

53
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,630
but if you were at a concert and you had
that microphone,

54
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:44,631
you'd be like,
what is this fucking stupid piece of 

55
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,641
Shit you've given me?
This ancient shitbag goofy looking 

56
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:46,770
fucking microphone.

57
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,810
It sounds great though.

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,330
Doesn't even sound that good.
Those old pieces of shit.

59
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,890
They sound terrible.
Anyway,

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,210

We're also brought to you by [inaudible]

84
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,140
dot com.
I don't know.

85
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,590
That's o n n I t I don't know how many 
of the chimp kettlebells are left.

86
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,870
Um,
I know we're almost out of him if we're 

87
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,870
not sold out already.
They went flying off the shelves because

88
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,170
they're the coolest fucking pieces of 
workout equipment ever.

89
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,690
It's cool just to have it around like 
workout equipment.

90
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,700
These just to put on both sides of my 
speakers and my living room.

91
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,330
Just wait till we get the other ones 
too.

92
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,030
I'm telling you this is this,
this one's my favorite,

93
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
but there's other ones that are just as 
bad ass.

94
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,270
They're,
they're right up there with it.

95
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,770
It's collecting matt balls.

96
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,140
Is that an adult?
I can't wait to collect all this.

97
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,260
And we had them all done by special 
effects artist.

98
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,120
So they're,
they're really like,

99
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,560
it's,
it's not goofy looking.

100
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,840
I mean it looks like a fucking real 
angry chimp.

101
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,080
That's the last thing you would ever 
want to see if that thing had its face 

102
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,100
between your crotch and it was biting 
off your Dick and it had that face clap.

103
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,850
That's the.
I just put your duck off face.

104
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,210
I'm angry.
I'm a champ and I bet you degraff the Ed

105
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,120
asner taking a shit.
I think it adds a little more handsome.

106
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,080
I think being cruel and that doesn't 
look like his nose at all.

107
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,530
Chimps are fucking terrifying.
Those creepy animals.

108
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,000
Anyway,
on it.com.

109
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:06,001
If you go there,
we got all kinds of cool shit for 

110
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,551
fitness.
It is literally a one stop shop for 

111
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:08,551
functional fitness equipment.

112
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,720
We have kettlebells,
we have.

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,640
Excuse me,
we have kettlebells,

114
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,950
we have the primal kettlebells.
We have regular kettlebells and all 

115
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,411
sizes.
The primal kettle bells is just the 

116
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:19,411
chimp right now.
We're expanding the line soon.

117
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:23,971
Of course we have battle ropes.
We have extreme kettlebell cardio 

118
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:27,001
workout DVD,
which is like the best workout DVD you 

119
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:27,760
can ever get when it comes to like 
cardio and kettlebells.

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,570
It's a brutal,
brutal fucking workout and you can.

121
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,020
You can kill yourself with a 35 pound 
Kettlebell if you're interested in doing

122
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:40,021
any of this stuff.
The one thing that I absolutely always 

123
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,090
encouraged people to get a trainer,
go hire some dude over cost 50 bucks or 

124
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,921
whatever.
Just make him show you the correct way 

125
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:45,921
to do things,
filming on your iphone,

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,090
and then when you do it at home,
take your time,

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,350
learn how to do it properly.

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,090
Form is very important to keep yourself 
from getting injured and don't try to go

129
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,690
too fast either.
It's,

130
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,550
um,
it's really important whenever you,

131
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:02,570
if you're just starting working out for 
the first time to slowly build up,

132
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,370
you can eventually have really hard 
workouts.

133
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:06,140
But if you have hard workouts right 
away,

134
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,480
you're just going to break yourself.
You've got to be intelligent.

135
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,270
I know you feel like a pussy if you know
you.

136
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,790
Oh well me,
20 pounds,

137
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,490
trust me,
did better.

138
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,210
It's better to do it slow.
Um,

139
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,260
we have all sorts of supplements that 
can aid you in recovery,

140
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:23,261
including t plus our fantastic new 
testosterone supplement that has been 

141
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:27,401
flying off the shelves.
Lots of people with positive response 

142
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,791
for that and no,
it's not going to make you failing drug 

143
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,910
tests and no,
it's not going to fuck with your balls.

144
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,700
It doesn't,
uh,

145
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,610
the way it works,
it doesn't work in a,

146
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:39,010
in a way that would introduce artificial
testosterone,

147
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,830
two body system.

148
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,730
It actually encourages your body's 
production of testosterone.

149
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,120
See it would bite.
There's certain routes like this stuff 

150
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,740
called Long Jack and as we've seen the 
PURINA's,

151
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,510
however you say it,
um,

152
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:57,260
there's,
there's a bunch of different supplements

153
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:02,261
like magnesium aspartic acid that have 
been shown to increase testosterone and 

154
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,060
it's not the kind of results you're 
going to get with steroids,

155
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,040
but it's also not going to kill your 
balls either.

156
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,120
It's a,
it just enhances your body's natural 

157
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,350
production of testosterone and decreases
your,

158
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,170
uh,
your estrogen production as well.

159
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,120
So you don't get bitch tits.
I don't want to get no bitch to sun.

160
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,580
Trust me.
What isn't cod liver oil?

161
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,581
What they used to give,
like an old cartoons that it was always 

162
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,310
like the grossest are Annie,
but it was good for you.

163
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,170
It was a castor oil to Castro was the 
big one.

164
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,790
Yeah.

165
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,010
Well what they didn't,
you know,

166
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,880
people were like,
oh,

167
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,870
that's all bullshit.
No,

168
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,350
it's not that liver cod.
Liver oil.

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,900
Fish oil is fucking fantastic for you.
It's really good for you.

170
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:46,901
It's one of the best things ever.
If you have like sore joint before you 

171
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:47,060
do anything,
and before you know you say,

172
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:51,950
oh well I got to take Ibuprofen every 
day now please try this.

173
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Just go get yourself some fish oil and 
take like they're like a thousand 

174
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,310
milligrams.
Take five a day.

175
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
I know.
That sounds crazy.

176
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,090
I know that sounds like a lot.
I take 10 a day.

177
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,280
How about that?
Yup.

178
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,580
But meanwhile,
my fucking joints don't hurt when you do

179
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:11,270
like crazy hard workout shit.
Having sore joints,

180
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:12,830
sore elbow,
so sore knees,

181
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:15,230
things along those lines is something 
that you just sort of accept.

182
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,500
You just deal with it.
I'm telling you one of the greatest 

183
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,111
supplements Avar for,
for any sort of inflammation in your 

184
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:23,111
joints,
it's fish oil.

185
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,760
Try it.
You've come,

186
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,080
let's smell so horrible.
My comes delicious.

187
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,740
I here.

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I would have no idea.
I would be pissed if I licked my calm 

189
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
and it didn't taste like anything.
I'd be like,

190
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,350
what's with all the fucking complaints?
Jesus,

191
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,760
could you imagine you're telling me 
you've never tasted your.

192
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm sure I have one way or another.
I'm sure somehow or another,

193
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,520
you know,
they say that the average human needs 

194
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,700
like a pound of bugs over the course of 
their own life because you know,

195
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,340
you're,
you know,

196
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,450
whether it's a candy bar or soda,
like there's a minimal amount of bug 

197
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,420
tissue and all sorts of manufactured 
foods.

198
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,370
So they say you eat like a pound of 
bugs.

199
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,460
So I'm sure of all the pussy now have 
done.

200
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,230
You know how I do.
I know I probably.

201
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,470
And so in my own calm,
whatever,

202
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,700
whatever,
whatever.

203
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:15,930
I'm here to tell a story.
I licked little esther's ipad last night

204
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,780
and it was so like sort of bigger prints
on it and stuff like that.

205
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,050
And so much of her come,
you've probably looked at her shit.

206
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,910
I didn't think of that finger,
but she got a little scratch in there 

207
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,910
and it's like,
what do I care?

208
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,151
It's my ipad.
All sorts of food items are also 

209
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,210
available on [inaudible] dot com and,
uh,

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,510
including supplements like Alpha brain,
shroom tech,

211
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,920
if you want an exercise.
Supplements,

212
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,770
shroom,
Tech Sports,

213
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,520
the one.
All right.

214
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,000
This fucking commercials too long.
Back o n n I t use a codename Brogan.

215
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,620
Save yourself some cash on any and all 
supplements you dirty pitches.

216
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,040
The Great William Burr.
The first Sierra.

217
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,620
You the first.
Uh,

218
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,510
I don't know because he dad,

219
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,890
No,

220
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,210
First.
William Bertha.

221
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,420
The first.
Ladies and gentlemen,

222
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,780
one of the finest stand up comedians 
America has to offer and is here to 

223
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,530
visit me.

224
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,670
The Joe Rogan experience podcast all 
day.

225
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,650
Powerful bill.

226
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,950
For this one,
it's going to be something where guys 

227
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:22,950
like you,
uh,

228
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,890
especially comics in general,
but comics from Boston,

229
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,940
I will always have a soft spot in my 
heart for comics from Boston.

230
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
No flying kick today.
Right?

231
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,000
Right.
You're flying kick.

232
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:34,930
How dare you,
how dare you,

233
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:37,170
Mr Burke a.
The last time I saw you,

234
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,280
you stopped by to say hi at the Wilbur 
show,

235
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:39,940
man.
That was cool.

236
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:43,710
You came down and risk your life at the 
end of the world was over 24 years.

237
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,310
Well,
yeah.

238
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,710
You understand?
Hope I had to do it.

239
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,020
Then you gave me a shout on it had 
already left because my girl came by 

240
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,951
with the car.
I had to hustle out there and I felt 

241
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:53,951
like an ass.

242
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:53,951
No,
no,

243
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:53,951
no,
no worries man.

244
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:54,280
It was cool.
It was cool seeing it was fun.

245
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,450
Yeah.
There was uh,

246
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,480
one of the weirdest events that I've 
ever done because we don't usually do 

247
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,840
like theaters in Hollywood.
If I'm in Hollywood,

248
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:06,070
I do like the Improv or I usually do.
Pasadena usually worked the ice house,

249
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,310
so to do like the wiltern it was like,
it was one of those big events that all 

250
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,720
these agents come down to that you don't
know.

251
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,180
And I remember there was a point during 
the show,

252
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,800
like where it had already started and we
were in the green room.

253
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,510
It was you and me and um,
I think stan home was back there too,

254
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,570
like two guys that I knew and then 
everybody else I didn't know.

255
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
There's all these agents and they're all
eating my

256
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,310
and they sit there,
you know,

257
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,760
picking at the stuff.
Like I actually feel bad because,

258
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,230
you know,
I,

259
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:39,231
I know my core group of people.
Then there's people that I know that 

260
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,210
I've met before,
but it's just like I don't see you.

261
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,370
I see you every couple of years.
So I feel I actually feel bad sometimes.

262
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,740
I don't ever feel bad when they all just
show up in the green room and just have 

263
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,931
conversations and like this is so 
strange because it was people from all 

264
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:54,931
sorts

265
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,650
of different agencies.
Like the honey honey is bands,

266
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,830
people and all these other.
I just like to go in there and I 

267
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:01,830
couldn't get.
It was ridiculous.

268
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:01,830
Right.
It was packed.

269
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,380
I wasn't allowed in.
You would,

270
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,870
you didn't have a badge?
No.

271
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,370
Joey isn't it?
You're not allowed to that bro.

272
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,770
Why?
Joey Diaz didn't allow you to come over 

273
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:10,770
here.
Come on.

274
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,240
He's tired of your bullshit.
That's the place I would love to play,

275
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:14,540
just because I've seen so many,
uh,

276
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,900
I've seen a lot of great bands there and
really good shows.

277
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,560
I only got to see one of the show there 
before I saw,

278
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,470
um,
uh,

279
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Robert Schimmel who was doing show back 
in the day for Tom Lucas who was doing a

280
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,090
show at the wiltern.
I was like,

281
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,140
wow,
what a cool theater.

282
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,620
But when we decided Stan hope and I 
many,

283
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:37,621
many years ago decided that we were 
going to do a show on December 24th 

284
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:37,621
2012.

285
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:38,820
So if the end of the world really did 
end,

286
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,590
like everybody thought it was going to 
the Mayan apocalypse,

287
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,510
we would at least be doing a show 
together.

288
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh,
that's cool.

289
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,220
Yeah.
So when it happened and I was a little 

290
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,480
anticlimactic,
just drove home with to sleep.

291
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,210
Meteors,
no aliens,

292
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:57,211
nothing,
no cooler cookie Lacan or whatever the 

293
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:57,211
fuck his name is.
No Kettle quadel.

294
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,030
Yeah,
I don't,

295
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't pay attention in this.
Yeah,

296
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:03,130
good for you.
I'm not up on the Mayan calendar.

297
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,690
They lost a lot of fucking credibility.
I'll tell you that.

298
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,730
They're like Jimmy,
the Greek [inaudible] 98 or whatever it 

299
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:10,730
was.
When he went down,

300
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,570
Jimmy got fucked.
This guy,

301
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,450
Jimmy got fucked because he told her the
truth.

302
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,490
God dammit.
He told the truth.

303
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:18,030
He basically was breaking down.
Dude.

304
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,950
It was basically if,
if what happened in Amistad was true,

305
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,770
it was like you boiled it.

306
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,520
Love how strong you had to be physically
and mentally to make it easy.

307
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,940
Just right there.
You got rid of anybody week,

308
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,820
dude.
You don't see any regular African dudes 

309
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,041
coming over here playing fullback 
running over people that marathon 

310
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,040
runners,
skinny guys is kinda like the big ones.

311
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,780
Like the massage.
They're like really thin guys do.

312
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,170
There's certain groups of Armenians,
Russians,

313
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,430
they're just like,
damn.

314
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,250
Like I would never mess with any of 
their.

315
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,480
Yeah,
their heart people.

316
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,440
We got a lot of Armenian MMA fighters 
part.

317
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,120
They come out of the womb with a shaved 
head ready to grapple.

318
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,440
All of them do.
There's a guy down at the car wash where

319
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,380
I go,
he owns the thing and he's Mike 55 slash

320
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:07,381
60,
but he still solid and he talks about 

321
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:07,600
how it used to grapple and all that and 
I laughed.

322
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:10,630
I go to all you guys know how to grapple
wrestle and he just goes,

323
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,640
yeah,
yeah.

324
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,420
We did Armenians,
Armenians know judo,

325
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,600
a big judo contention as bad as people 
talk and proud.

326
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,410
They're real men to men.
I have my friend Armand,

327
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,490
Armand,
the Armenian.

328
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Uh,
he was telling me a story once and he 

329
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,940
was dating this girl and she got mouthy 
with him and he,

330
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,941
uh,
he grabbed her by the neck and pinned 

331
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:35,941
her up against the wall and he's telling
me this and I go,

332
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,580
I go,
why'd you do that?

333
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,410
He goes,
she's fucking Armenian.

334
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,480
She should know better than to talk to 
me like that.

335
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,470
He goes,
it's one thing,

336
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,360
and some white bitch starts talking to 
me like that.

337
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,660
And he goes,
this fucking Armenian bitch gets in my 

338
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:48,660
face because he's Armenian.
He's like,

339
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,630
bitch,
you don't know your place.

340
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,320
Like,
you know,

341
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,510
our people.
I was like,

342
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:52,290
wow,

343
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,470
like that's a fucking hard environment.
You're coming from.

344
00:14:55,471 --> 00:15:00,471
Like he was justifying,
grabbing his girlfriend by the neck and 

345
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:02,010
penny are to the wall because she said 
something just didn't

346
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,720
defensive him.
What did she say?

347
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,560
I'm kidding.
Kidding.

348
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,520
What was.
You had a bit about that,

349
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,320
that about fuck.
What was it?

350
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,060
We want to know what a girl said before.

351
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,950
What was he on a bit.
Now you might get some ice cream over 

352
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:25,350
there and just starts throwing punches 
or it was there,

353
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,040
so there was some sort of button pushing
I would guess that went on and she 

354
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:40,581
didn't.
She thought it was only going to go 

355
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:40,581
halfway up the building and it went to 
the roof.

356
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:40,910
Yeah,
right away when he was driving to.

357
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,930
Right.
That's like when the dudes go to the 

358
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,171
gym,
go to the zoo and they start fucking 

359
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,061
with some animal and they think it's a 
joke and then all of a sudden I think 

360
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:50,061
reaches through.
You're like,

361
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:50,061
oh my God,
this is real.

362
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:55,190
Yeah.
Like when a lady gets too close to the 

363
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,190
polar bear thing,
ever see that video?

364
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,540
The polar bear has a hold of her leg 
with its teeth,

365
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,350
has trying to pull her through the cage 
and she's screaming,

366
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,390
her leg snapped or femur snapped.

367
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,920
You know what's amazing about that is if
people didn't get there in time,

368
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,220
he eventually would have had the power 
in his back and his neck to pull that 

369
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,220
woman,
right?

370
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,790
Yeah.
It would have chewed her apart.

371
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,840
He woulda Woulda,
woulda got whatever he could get out of 

372
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,060
that one piece of leg and then he would 
have reached through and pull.

373
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,250
She would have been eating her.
The worst of the best thing that could 

374
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,950
happen when a polar bear comes at you is
you're not.

375
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,740
They're not in a cage because at least 
it's over quick,

376
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:30,270
but if they were in a cage and there's 
no one around,

377
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:35,271
you're slowly going to get eaten to 
death because it's going to hold you 

378
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,401
down.
Which I would stick a fucking artery 

379
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:37,990
right in his mouth.
That one in effect.

380
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,160
Go ahead,
take a champ.

381
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,950
Yeah,
you'd probably be bleed out from the 

382
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:44,950
legs.
The legs are good.

383
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,130
Spot to get bit by a polar bear.
Something you're not gonna last long,

384
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,770
especially inner thigh,
and you don't.

385
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,470
Is this the one of the lady?
Oh Jesus Christ,

386
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:56,690
this fucking stupid lady,
crazy person decides to get close enough

387
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:01,160
to a fucking polar bear that I could 
reach out and grab a hold of him.

388
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,670
I was thoroughly involved in binkies 
enormous choice.

389
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,820
Take off your belt.
Binky.

390
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,380
I nearly $1,000
is 29 year old Cathryn Warburton from 

391
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:27,271
Sydney.
I that looks 50 fucking leg is marble.

392
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,650
There's a video when we played it on the
show anymore.

393
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,230
Pause around her legs and was chewing 
on.

394
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,240
Catherine.
Get jumped over to low lying barricades,

395
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,480
hoping to get a closeup photo of banking
in his cage.

396
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,180
Instead,
biggie got the closeout.

397
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,970
He has plunged his canines directly into
Catherine's three d animated fake 

398
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,410
version of wider apart than in other 
bears.

399
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,210
That extra space allows them to grasp 
and tear too.

400
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,850
They can kill a walrus.
Other teams and they only kill.

401
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,370
It's the difference between polar bears 
and grizzlies.

402
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,220
They don't eat any vegetables.
There's no plants where they live.

403
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,400
Medical doctor knows there is not much 
time left.

404
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,260
Knowing the anatomy of a throw that 
camera at the lower extremities.

405
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,330
No,
it's not good enough.

406
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,390
The best thing you could do there 
honestly is a either stabbing the eyes 

407
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,820
or a grab a belt and wrap it around its 
neck and choke and unconscious,

408
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,821
but you'd have to get close enough to 
put your arms around its neck and hope 

409
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,030
it doesn't let go and snap your arms as 
you're doing that.

410
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,170
Two words.
Zoom button.

411
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,700
There's a long time ago.
She probably got a really cheap two 

412
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:51,700
megapixel Jamey.

413
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,650
Yeah.
I would've loved to have seen how quick 

414
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:55,650
that thing close the distance,
like the closing speed of that,

415
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,630
like a cornerback.
I can make up distance with the wide 

416
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,630
receiver and the whatever thinks it's 
what dudes wide open and all of a sudden

417
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,790
gets picked off.
That's like,

418
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,940
what just happened?
Oh,

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,660
what's over there?
It's your leg is in its mouth.

420
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,850
Have you ever seen how fast a bear can 
run up a tree?

421
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,110
Oh,
it's sick.

422
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,460
It's insane.
There's this.

423
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,680
There's a video and see if he could find
this.

424
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,120
Well,
you know when a guy or girl,

425
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,770
person,
girl trapped in polar bear cage,

426
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Oh my God,
Jesus Christ just left under the 

427
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:29,230
surface.
Only a rubber ring distracts it from its

428
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,890
on.
Oh my God.

429
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,960
Got So grip strength,
strength to safety.

430
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,680
Oh my God.
Wet Jackass.

431
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,320
Before the woman had been in a bas grip.
Oh my God.

432
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Is that her head?
When the help is try to get out of it by

433
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,880
the trousers and pulled her back.
I was just born with that weapon,

434
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,130
getting little plunger.
But this was far from a game.

435
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,310
Witnesses looked on.
A six keepers distracted the animals 

436
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,310
with meat,

437
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,050
with meat.
They got backup,

438
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,320
emergency break glass.
It would if it didn't have any of that.

439
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:10,220
Got there.
Like Shit.

440
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,080
There's no meat.
Get the frozen meat.

441
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,270
There's a video of a couple guys 
hunting.

442
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:20,120
They're in a hunting blind and they're 
sitting there.

443
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,190
They're hunting for bears and this 
fucking bear runs up the tree beside 

444
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,921
them.
And I mean the guy's like maybe 25 feet 

445
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,100
in the air.
The bear is up to him in one second,

446
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:36,101
and I'm not exaggerating,
it's just they just fucking giant bear 

447
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,350
scoots up the tree.
It is what they do.

448
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,240
Fucking terrifying.
The bear didn't do anything.

449
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,860
The guy that guy just wrote.
That's it.

450
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,450
That's fine.

451
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,920
Top One.
What does it say?

452
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,600
SASQUATCH and black bear.
Adrenaline at its best.

453
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,140
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

454
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,730
That's exactly it.
Yeah.

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,130
We're fucking bear.
Runs up this tree.

456
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,280
Try to find out where it is,
where the bear runs up.

457
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,400
It's fucking ridiculous because the guys
in the stand and it just decides.

458
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:04,100
It makes us mad.
Sprint up the tree right next to him.

459
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:06,200
Here it is.
See the guys looking down.

460
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,990
It's like there's the bear right there.
So this fucking bear just goes for this.

461
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,860
Out of nowhere.
Like,

462
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:13,880
watch this,
watch this.

463
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,360
The bear passed him.
Watch this.

464
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,000
They get a film in the bear.
What is he laughing about?

465
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,530
Well,
he's got a fucking gun.

466
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,880
You know?
I mean,

467
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:32,820
I think he's probably laughing because 
he's terrified to.

468
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,620
Yeah,
I think that's.

469
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:38,621
I think he's scared shitless and they'll
watch the bears right beside him.

470
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,040
He gets trying to get the camera on it.
It's just chilling there in the tree.

471
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Look how fucking high that thing got in 
like a second was like one second,

472
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,070
but you know their claws.
You ever see a guy climate telephone 

473
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,070
pole at those sites?
That's what that.

474
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,870
They have those built in like Wolverine.
They just go and write up the trend.

475
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
Let's the thing go down.
Then he shoots it with an arrow.

476
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,740
Check this out,
watch Dick.

477
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,360
It's keeping played.
We played was the thing runs down the 

478
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,890
things out there.
It's like,

479
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:11,510
all right,
I'm not going to kill you.

480
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I'll let you go about your way.
It seems like you just sitting in a 

481
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:16,600
tree.
And so the guy was like,

482
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,240
yeah,
look what I got here.

483
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,040
Ooh,
it's a compound bow.

484
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,750
Hm.
So as that bear like,

485
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,360
just got done checking them out from 
lunch height.

486
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,400
I mean it was like mouth to face.
It was right there.

487
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,100
He waits for the bear.
Go to go back to the barrel.

488
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,950
By the way,
the bed,

489
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,030
the barrel is filled with food.
They bait these bands.

490
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,320
That's how they.
That's how they hunt.

491
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:43,321
Bear a lot of bear.
These dogs and other ways they treat 

492
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:46,730
them.
There's a bunch of different looks.

493
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,110
He's going to fucking put one right 
record.

494
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,860
They're delicious.

495
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,770
Perfect.
Do you think there's no native American 

496
00:22:59,770 --> 00:22:59,770
that would have done that?
First of all,

497
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,170
they wouldn't have been dumb enough to 
let it happen.

498
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,580
They would have had some great code 
about.

499
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,520
Used to have some ceremony when they 
killed a bear because a bear was so much

500
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:09,521
like a human,
like it's mannerisms and that type of 

501
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:09,521
thing.
Really.

502
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:09,910
I overheard it in a bar.
There you go.

503
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,810
Could be true.
Could be true.

504
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,400
Could not be true that we were on a 
podcast yesterday.

505
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,880
We talked about what you want to get 
down from the tree,

506
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,940
so you got to shoot.
I guess that's what it is because what 

507
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,580
if it comes back this time and these on 
the bottom?

508
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,220
Yeah.
It just runs out of them.

509
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,540
You know what?
Strike that smart move.

510
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Smart move and he's gonna.
He was there for that in the first 

511
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,600
place.
I mean,

512
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,670
that's the reason why the bear.
Was there a reason why he was there?

513
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,930
Spare of the bear did bear spirit.
I'm.

514
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,940
I'm really putting literally putting 
human traits on disparate stupid.

515
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:42,941
I think the die in the woods to dumb the
bears is too dumb to figure out shit,

516
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,310
dude.
He's a good guy.

517
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,890
We came up,
he could've shot him.

518
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,920
He didn't get a shuttle down and he goes
over to his caddy and some of the 

519
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,700
fucking Arrow.
An Arrow from 20 yards.

520
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,060
Can you imagine somebody shot him with 
an Arrow?

521
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,200
Can imagine what it would have been if 
he got the right Sheree,

522
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,260
if he did have the right to imagine will
come up and just grab you fucked up.

523
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,960
Close animals come to victory sometimes 
and there's just the one little thing.

524
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:09,260
They just

525
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,760
the dot that chromosome,
they missing that dumb.

526
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,370
That's a.
that's like the fastest I've ever seen a

527
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,380
bear climate tree.
I didn't know they could get up a tree 

528
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:20,380
that fell.

529
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Oh,
you do.

530
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,440
Your best bet is you have to get up so 
high that they're nervous that I guess 

531
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,400
that the tree is going to break,
but then you're up there.

532
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,890
Well,
it depends on what bear to grizzlies 

533
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:30,890
don't climb trees.
Never been bear hunting.

534
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:30,890
I don't even know where.
What are you?

535
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,660
What are the words come from?
Sometimes like,

536
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,250
what am I saying?
Shut up.

537
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Got To do is I've watched this on 
discovery from an l shaped couch.

538
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,020
Let me tell you what to do now.
A black bear,

539
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,110
black bear.
This is what you got to start breaking 

540
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,110
it down.

541
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,720
Bears are more likely to climb trees.
They climb trees all the time.

542
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,900
Grizzlies apparently don't climb trees,
so if you

543
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,240
never.
My plane crashed.

544
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:03,960
If I've ever used that information,
but you never know the plane crash.

545
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,410
You gotta do what you gotTa do.
Bill due to plaintiff starts going down.

546
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:09,480
The first thing I'm doing is taking the 
seatbelt off.

547
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,690
Really don't want to survive this 
covered in jet fuel.

548
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,730
Coming out with my slacks melted to my 
legs.

549
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,030
I get start knocking on the fat.
Fuck next to me.

550
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:20,550
Just kill me ahead.
I had a great one.

551
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,560
I had a great life.
Yeah.

552
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,520
Why not,
right?

553
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,460
Yeah.
Why not sober?

554
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,300
So you were talking about the.
We were talking about the grid,

555
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,720
Jimmy,
the Greek thing about Jimmy,

556
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:31,240
the Greek for folks who don't know 
Jimmy,

557
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,490
the Greek was a famous football.

558
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,760
The commentator would do the odds,
right?

559
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,160
Take the bears laying three.
It was the seventies where you could,

560
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,350
you allowed to talk about betting 
gambling?

561
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,030
Yeah.
For the NFL was like,

562
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:46,980
wait a minute man,
what are we doing it when men were men

563
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,920
and uh,
he had the gall to insinuate that there 

564
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,031
might've been some benefit to these 
African American people breeding in 

565
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:57,210
slaves and that

566
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,740
he was doing what I just did with bears 
and he was having a drink in a 

567
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,980
restaurant and somebody filmed it.
It's like one of the original,

568
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,360
like,
you know what it was?

569
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,050
Yeah,
he was,

570
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,390
he's like in a restaurant.
I thought it was an interview.

571
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,170
Now he's,
I believe he's in like,

572
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,450
I don't fucking remember.
He was like in an interview and he's 

573
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:15,800
like eating potato skins and they're 
just like,

574
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:17,230
what happened to all the white running 
back?

575
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:18,650
So he's like,
here's the theory,

576
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:19,430
you know,
you're in a bar,

577
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,410
somebody asked a question,
you're gonna answer it.

578
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,650
They wanted to get rid of him anyway.
I'm not saying what he said is 100 

579
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,071
percent true,
but it's like they wanted to get rid of 

580
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:33,491
him.
They wanted to get rid of that guy 

581
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:33,491
because that was like back then like 
you,

582
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,090
you make that video.
Well I guess they could maybe show them 

583
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,090
a local newscast,
but there was so many videos.

584
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,270
There was a girl back then called Jane 
Kennedy,

585
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,840
gorgeous woman and some sex tape came 
out about her and one of the first ones 

586
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,160
and it just went around

587
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
the industry and she lost her job.
Like if there was no youtube to upload 

588
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,030
it to and they were all just like,
this is absolutely.

589
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,230
And then fast forward,
you know,

590
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,400
35,
40 years later,

591
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:58,401
it's like a career move.
No one ever saw that and liquid Kim 

592
00:26:58,401 --> 00:26:59,610
Kardashian move mean like the,
the,

593
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,550
those girls was when they were all in or
it's just not one accident.

594
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,110
Several,
several camera goals.

595
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,600
But she's like that brilliant to be 
like,

596
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,810
this is how well wait a minute.
Paris Hilton already done it.

597
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,640
Paris Hilton got famous that way.
So that's how she got them.

598
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,530
She had a famous boyfriend,
she was dating this guy,

599
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,590
Ray j,
but it's usually the famous guy gets all

600
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,450
the press unless you banged somebody 
else famous.

601
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,420
Well he got,
he got a lot of press from that.

602
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,320
It's just he couldn't maintain it.
He just,

603
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,380
for whatever reason,
I mean I think he's still like big in 

604
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,800
his and b community or whatever kind of 
music he plays.

605
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,080
But uh,
you know,

606
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:32,280
for whatever reason,
I mean,

607
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,870
it's not like he's an unknown.
He's a,

608
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,660
he's still a pretty known guy,
but she became,

609
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,340
whether he's known or unknown,
it's usually like the unknown person 

610
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,390
who's getting banged.
It's,

611
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,770
you know,
it's like Joe blow,

612
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:45,510
fuck Sahar right.
You know,

613
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,590
like you're just,
you know.

614
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,890
But yeah,
or whatever.

615
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,840
But I guess she was so good looking 
people wanting to know who she was.

616
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,420
Like the dvr girl.
All of a sudden everyone's like,

617
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:58,140
who's that girl in the commercial exotic
looking one and then you look it up.

618
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,950
Yeah,
I definitely think that.

619
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,170
But I also think,
no,

620
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:06,171
I think that she was just fucking rabid 
opportunist and it was in the same time 

621
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:12,000
that Paris Hilton really got more famous
because of her sex tape.

622
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:17,001
And then remember when girls would just 
showing their pussies like they would 

623
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:17,950
climb out of cars and not know that the 
Paparazzi,

624
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,130
he had a fucking camera and interim or 
snatch.

625
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,840
I mean,
how many girls were.

626
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:26,640
They had those download photos to the 
most ridiculous photos ever because it's

627
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,260
so fucking obvious that you've,
you've,

628
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,500
you plan that the camera is below your 
pussy.

629
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,920
You're getting out of a car and the 
camera's below your pussy looking up at 

630
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,880
it.
Fuck yeah,

631
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,060
100 percent guaranteed.
It's all like Paris Hilton.

632
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:45,210
It was all these real dumb skanks no,
no offense.

633
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,250
But all these,
uh,

634
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,170
these really silly girls,
you know,

635
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:51,810
it's like those,
those were the girls are fun girls.

636
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,500
They're just,
yeah,

637
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:57,501
the knucklehead girls.
And that was their move to show their 

638
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,781
pussy.
And they were distinct advantage as a 

639
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:03,831
woman.
Like if I got out with a kilt and you 

640
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:03,831
flashed your junk,
like I think that that would hurt you,

641
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:05,940
you'd probably go to jail.
It's offensive.

642
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,050
No whipping out your cock is way more 
offensive than showing of your pussy.

643
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,920
He can climb out of a car and show your 
pussy.

644
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,970
No one to tell you they completely 
shaved is the creepiest thing I've ever 

645
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,190
seen in my life.
It's like I don't want to be.

646
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,590
You look like a woman up here and you 
look,

647
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,350
you know,
you don't like that.

648
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:26,870
Now it's amazing that it's so popular 
that porn has made such a massive 

649
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:33,201
success.
Like it's such a massive victory to pay 

650
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:33,201
around.
The pussies kind of made a comeback.

651
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:35,550
They'll never go back to like full on,
like,

652
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,270
you know,
energy crisis,

653
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:43,280
pussy hair,
Jimmy Carter Ford.

654
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,320
It's over.
Yeah.

655
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,370
They will go back to that.
But,

656
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:45,640
you know,
like,

657
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:49,210
keep it.
Especially because of the asshole hair.

658
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,980
No one's no one's into that.

659
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,470
I heard somebody told me the other day 
that crabs is going in,

660
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,000
instinct are extinct because uh,
no one has a pubic hair anymore.

661
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,500
That it's actually.
Oh yeah,

662
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:00,960
it's like they pour salt in the,
in the,

663
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:01,980
in the fields.
Yeah,

664
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,700
I mowed them down.
Um,

665
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,010
so the reason why I brought up the Jimmy
[inaudible] thing is,

666
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,300
this is one thing I wanted to talk to 
you about that I got in trouble with for

667
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:18,301
saying that I didn't think that a 
transsexual man should be able to fight 

668
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:18,301
women.
There's a,

669
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:19,870
a man bullshit.
Yeah.

670
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,650
You got a sex change and then didn't 
tell anybody.

671
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,630
Did he get it?
Still got the band shell does that looks

672
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,190
just like a man.
Okay,

673
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:35,270
got it.
Got a sex change sort of fighting women 

674
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,330
and beat the fuck out of two chicks 
brutally before anybody figured out that

675
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,780
he used to go to jail for that.
That's what I say.

676
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:46,390
Do you ever see South Park?
They go and they talk about something 

677
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:46,390
called the heat now call it is.
She goes,

678
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,030
it's not a sheet.
It's a mutilated man.

679
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,300
I hate talking about this because 
whatever the hell you want to do is what

680
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,690
you want to do.
But like I draw the line where you know,

681
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:57,691
you got dude's shoulders and manhandled 
and you're going to go up there against 

682
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:57,691
Christina.
I mean,

683
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,040
that's,
that's not fair.

684
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,650
There's a long time ago they had that in
tennis and this,

685
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,070
this guy was.
He was killing it.

686
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,050
Renee Richards.

687
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,170
Yeah.
Is that what I just terrible as a man.

688
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,660
Didn't do well at all.
Started playing as a woman,

689
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,210
got a secretary as operation.
It was just dominating.

690
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,060
Just dominate and kicking ass in a way.
Never kicked ass before.

691
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,650
Yeah,
let's not.

692
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,120
It's not,
it's not fair.

693
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,380
Well,
there's a lot of things,

694
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,190
but make it unfair.
It's not just the frame,

695
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,430
it's also spatial awareness.
There's a difference in the genetics is 

696
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,010
there's also different in reaction time 
of significant difference.

697
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:32,170
Ten percent difference between men and 
women.

698
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,600
Men have a 10 percent faster reaction 
time.

699
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,660
It's,
that's pretty much the bumping each 

700
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,001
other in the head.
Being the first ones out there with a 

701
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,751
spear.
Our bodies are just designed for 

702
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:45,751
different shit.
When we were hunter gatherers,

703
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,150
we were hunters.
You know,

704
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:50,410
let's just do this wrong with getting a 
sex change operation.

705
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:55,411
Whatever God bless you,
but like to go in the ring with women 

706
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:55,830
and beat the shit out of a woman like 
that know,

707
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,330
especially for fighting is one thing,
if you know,

708
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,210
and this is where I'm getting the 
stress,

709
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,960
this is where I'm getting a stress from 
getting it from,

710
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,990
from feminists and I'm getting it from 
people that support a transsexuals 

711
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,180
because they want a transgender woman to
be considered a 100 percent woman and 

712
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:16,900
they're like a trans.

713
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,940
This is the argument I've been getting 
all online.

714
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,970
You know,
a trans woman is a woman asshole.

715
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,570
A Trans woman is a real woman.
Your bigotry and transphobia.

716
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,890
I'm transphobic apparently because I 
don't want men to get their dick chopped

717
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,570
off and beat the shit out of women.
I mean,

718
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,780
you know,
I am 100 percent supportive of anybody 

719
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:36,780
like a hot dog.
And then they make a giant lay.

720
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,440
Sure.
I'm looking at it right now.

721
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,130
They make like a,
they don't,

722
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,760
they,
they,

723
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:43,010
uh,
I don't know what they do.

724
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,400
They call it a peanut on version,
actually pnl in version.

725
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,460
And then they got to like a,
I don't know how they scoop out your 

726
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,160
tank,
just hardcore.

727
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
This has got to be some stuff in there 
that you're just.

728
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,370
It's like the crawl space under your 
house.

729
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:02,620
You don't know what's on.
Listen,

730
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,270
if someone wants to do that,
God bless you.

731
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,430
If you want to be referred to as a 
woman,

732
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:07,950
I,
I'm,

733
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,150
I'm fine with that.
But like don't get in a ring and start.

734
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,000
You know,
concussion sounded pounding.

735
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,530
Some woman would,
you know,

736
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,320
come on.
Ain't take estrogen pills.

737
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,000
They shot,

738
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:24,670
they take shots,
but in their muscle mass does decrease 

739
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,830
and their,
their,

740
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,760
their bone density does decrease.
It does.

741
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,630
But there's just some massive mechanical
advantage of the male frame.

742
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:34,370
When it comes to something like combat 
sports,

743
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:39,371
the shape of the hips are different 
because no matter all the take them man 

744
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:41,030
can take all the estrogen in the world.
He doesn't really develop a woman's hips

745
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:46,031
is a completely different structure.
And when it comes to kicking that 

746
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:47,180
structure makes a big difference.
What's that?

747
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,630
Cheesecake sits on the couch.
It's a saddlebag work like Mariah Carey 

748
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,470
built.
No,

749
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,560
it doesn't.
No,

750
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,990
it doesn't.
It doesn't look like that Bill Clinton 

751
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,710
had bitch hips.
Your body looks like he had big,

752
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:08,711
big mother and hips.
I bet he had a lot of knee problems and 

753
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:08,711
he was jogging.
Oh,

754
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:10,130
I'm sure he went out the acs fat as 
fuck,

755
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,390
right?
Yeah.

756
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,950
What about this?
What about the guy that has down 

757
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:17,950
syndrome that wants to fight?
Yeah.

758
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:17,950
Well,
blimey.

759
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,440
Well we'll get to that too,
for sure.

760
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:20,580
But I thought that.
Oh,

761
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,960
the craziest thing about this is that 
these women in this desire to be super,

762
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:32,201
super progressive and super supportive 
of gay rights and transgender rights,

763
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,690
that they're willing to allow other 
women to get the fuck beat out of them 

764
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,260
because it's almost all women that got 
upset with me.

765
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:42,470
There's a few guys like gay guys.
I got upset with me,

766
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,380
but uh,
quite a few women wanted that,

767
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,960
that transgender woman to be recognized 
as a woman.

768
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:53,140
And I said like,
I'm 100 percent supportive of someone 

769
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,350
doing that and I'm willing to call them 
a girl in a sheet and whatever your name

770
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,130
is,
I'm cool with that.

771
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:56,480
You know,
I don't mind,

772
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,240
but the fighting men,
the girls,

773
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,900
it's amazing how much resistance I've 
gotten from this.

774
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:03,920
It's fucking.
It's really,

775
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:04,730
truly amazing.

776
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,030
I mean,
everybody's entitled to an opinion.

777
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,110
Opinion isn't going to stop them from 
doing anything like people get,

778
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,000
you know what it is,
it's just that you're kind of known,

779
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:18,001
you know what I mean in that area.
So it's a good thing for them to hitch 

780
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:19,570
their wagon to where like I've noticed 
that a lot of people,

781
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:21,820
they don't really get offended by 
anything that I say.

782
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:23,890
It's because there's nothing to attach 
your wagon to.

783
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,070
I do try to stand up and like strip 
malls,

784
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:31,071
so I jumped on Conan that.
That's usually the punishment end up,

785
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,740
right?
Yeah.

786
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:35,800
What are you going to.
What I mean and I'm not a doctor either.

787
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,070
Do like if somebody came up like I 
actually,

788
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,070
this is what annoys me about groups like
that as I feel that when somebody says 

789
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,721
something and you're offended,
it's very easy for them to get in 

790
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:47,721
contact with us.
Fairly easy with twitter,

791
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:52,671
facebook,
all of that to to hear that makes sure 

792
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:54,570
that they're hearing it right to clarify
what you say and they don't.

793
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,240
They want,
they want to do is create this,

794
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,550
this,
this hysteria,

795
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,760
and then they get you on tv and you're 
on the split screen and that split 

796
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,900
screen argument is not about finding 
some truth.

797
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:11,901
It's just about winning.
And then they go out there and as you 

798
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,050
start to make a good point,
they'll go see that.

799
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:14,840
See that?
That's just the ignorance.

800
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:18,900
That night they shout you down and it's 
some of the worst tv you'll ever fucking

801
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,500
debate things where you have three 
minutes to make your point.

802
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:28,501
They're the dumbest ways to address a 
complex issue than anybody could ever 

803
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:28,501
get her.

804
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,540
That's get came from PTI.
Think on ESPN.

805
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,570
It was a sports show.
These two good friends used to yell at 

806
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:36,570
each other,
not yell,

807
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,921
but they will make great points and it 
would get heated sometimes and that do 

808
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:41,110
and they blew up because you know,
it was.

809
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:43,810
You saw the friendship there and then 
they were just like,

810
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,500
oh,
they like

811
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,700
people yell.
They just boil it down and next thing 

812
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:49,700
you know,
everybody's just screaming.

813
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,160
They always do that.
They have like some guy whose kids got 

814
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,111
shot a school and then next to another 
guy who's like a fucking one of those 

815
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:01,851
militia guys who thinks we should all 
have assault rifles and then Pierce 

816
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:06,350
Morgan pretends it's a debate.
They put two pit bulls and it's what 

817
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,350
they do and then they just sit back and 
think,

818
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,770
oh,
that's going to kill eight minutes.

819
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,960
Well we talked about it on the podcast,
you know,

820
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,360
that's when the discussion happened that
got to the air.

821
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:16,230
So they had plenty of opportunity to see
what I meant and what I didn't mean,

822
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,130
but they choose to only lock onto like 
some of the things that I said like it's

823
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:25,131
a guy with no dick and you know,
and that's where they got really mad at 

824
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:25,980
you because that's hurtful.
That's transphobic.

825
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,620
But technically it's accurate.
And I understand what you're saying.

826
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,200
Yeah,

827
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,420
it is.
It is a guy who had his penis removed.

828
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,630
Yes it is.
I mean,

829
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,350
chromosome will try to look like he had 
female parts,

830
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,350
but here's something weird I found out 
when you do chromosome tests,

831
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,370
what are blowing up right now?
A lot of women have the y chromosome 

832
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,770
actual,
just women,

833
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,440
real women.
I don't even know.

834
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,160
Not hermaphrodites.
You don't know what it means.

835
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,500
Women are xx mentor x,
y.

836
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,410
The y chromosome is the differentiator 
between men and women.

837
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,590
Everyone's born a woman.
Still respect the fact that you told me 

838
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,801
that like I'm going to retain that.
I'm not going to come in the next time 

839
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:06,520
when you bring that up.
But while this was going on,

840
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,620
I was thinking of you.
I was thinking man,

841
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,220
is bill burr was in this situation 
because you know,

842
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:14,620
you're just a.
It seems like,

843
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,600
you know,
like with the crips Chris Brown thing,

844
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:21,270
you're one of the few guys out there 
that will go there with a bit like that.

845
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Why?
I want to know what the fuck she said 

846
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,280
before he hit her.
You know,

847
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,280
there's a lot of people out there.
No.

848
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,280
My

849
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,710
thing about that was like,
uh,

850
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,120
I might,
I might question it was,

851
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:35,210
and it was an honest question was do you
have any personal for your

852
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,980
own safety as a woman to not 
deliberately sit there and push 

853
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:43,570
somebody's button and get in their 
grill,

854
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,571
you know,
and get physical and hit and do all 

855
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:49,870
that.
It gets to a point of like,

856
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,660
my thing was like respect the fact that 
a guy's going to hit you,

857
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,790
don't take advantage of it.
And it's like,

858
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,590
um,
you know,

859
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,840
like I,
I don't know if that's right or wrong,

860
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:01,900
but it was a question that these groups,
you can't talk to them.

861
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,120
You just want to ask them like,
do you feel like,

862
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:05,790
you know,
like if you just go,

863
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,230
well that's why your mom's Dad,
man,

864
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,740
I hope you get fucking cancer too.
And,

865
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:10,630
and,
and just say this horrible,

866
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,790
hurtful shit.
Start pushing somebody.

867
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:16,150
And it's like,
at what point are you guilty of,

868
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,910
of provoking the next level?

869
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,010
If a woman got in your face and you were
like,

870
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:25,640
seriously worried that she was going to 
hit you and you really felt like you had

871
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:26,870
to defend yourself,
would you hit her?

872
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,880
No.
Well,

873
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,060
I would.
I would have.

874
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,090
She would have to have a fucking machete
really.

875
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,920
And like,
no,

876
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,610
I.
It would have to be like,

877
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,550
I will be doing that stuff just running 
around the walls.

878
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,040
I get

879
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,230
cardio.
Right where you usually have better 

880
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,480
cardio the man when it comes to the 
jargon,

881
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,230
when it comes to the ones who jog a lot 
of,

882
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,300
especially the ones that hit you that 
more likely to have pent up frustrations

883
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:53,710
and getting out with the exercise?

884
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,140
No,
I dated a girl one time.

885
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,030
She,
she had some issues about when she would

886
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:00,120
get mad she would get physical and I had
to talk to her about it.

887
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:06,050
That saying that you've got to 
understand that the natural reaction to 

888
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,560
this is this.
You can't just walk around hitting feet.

889
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:11,520
That's so disrespectful and it's 
childish and it need to grow up.

890
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,980
Like I had to have that conversation 
because,

891
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
you know,
it's,

892
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:21,590
it's,
it's in that split second when somebody 

893
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:21,590
blast you in the face,
either man or a woman,

894
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,120
it's like you go into self defense,
what you eat,

895
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,250
you might even just out of reaction go 
like that.

896
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,280
And you know,
a lot of times guys are so much bigger 

897
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,280
than women.
That's a forum.

898
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,640
Then their nose is bleeding and then 
you're down the fucking police station.

899
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,260
Yeah.
And then you have like a problem.

900
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,550
So,
um,

901
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,620
my thing and all those,
what is,

902
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:39,560
you never learn anything you never 
learned.

903
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:44,160
Like was this guy just a bad guy and 
this was inevitable and what happened in

904
00:40:44,161 --> 00:40:49,161
his childhood?
Can we deconstruct this guy 

905
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:51,541
psychologically?
Can we go back and figure out what led 

906
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,820
to this event?
Or was it like he has no track record of

907
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:58,821
this and then all of a sudden it just 
the right set of circumstances and it's 

908
00:40:58,821 --> 00:40:59,910
like,
is this guy a bad guy?

909
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,160
Is this guy I'm unlucky guy?
Like,

910
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,020
like,
what happened?

911
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:05,340
But I got it.
I got to tell you.

912
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,090
It's like,
you know,

913
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,270
the first punch you flipped out.
I mean once you fucking,

914
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:14,271
you know,
I think we set up the jab throwing 

915
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:14,271
combinations.
It's like at some point you got to be in

916
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:18,681
your head like I am hitting a woman,
but the conversation fascinates me and 

917
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:19,080
it's such a touchy subject.

918
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,080
What's annoying is that you can't like 
the amount of people who are listening 

919
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,210
right now,
but that scowl on her face,

920
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:27,240
like you can't even,
you can't unless you just go,

921
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,960
you are 100 percent right.
There was no reason to ever do it and 

922
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,621
you don't have to respect another being 
on any level and you can throw stuff at 

923
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,380
them and you can say stuff.
You can,

924
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,430
you know,
push their buttons and do everything you

925
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,000
basically can to get it to that point 
and,

926
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,810
and then.
But,

927
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:46,580
but you're not,
you're not guilty.

928
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:50,150
You don't have any responsibility.
There's nothing that you could do in the

929
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:51,200
future to be like,
well,

930
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:52,760
hey,
next time you know,

931
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:56,090
it's relationships over the over,
but the next time I'm with a guy,

932
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,810
you know,
maybe I only ramp them up a couple of 

933
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,630
floors as opposed to just like,
dude,

934
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,750
you know that they know what to say.
They know what to say,

935
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,170
and I do.
You know what I mean?

936
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,030
Fucking walls.
You know how many lamps you just like,

937
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,640
oh,
like they just know they do.

938
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,900
They.

939
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,110
Well,
this is what you're going to do it.

940
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,570
I can give you the best advice ever.
Cut them off,

941
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:24,810
cut anybody like that off.
I've had people like that in my life to 

942
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:24,810
try to get in fights with me.
I've had people like that.

943
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,310
The one arguing all the time,
you cut them off.

944
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,680
Even if they're hot,
even if they give good head,

945
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,880
even if they got a great ass,
you got,

946
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,770
you got to get rid of them.

947
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,580
Charlie Murphy gave me the best advice 
was just yo,

948
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,940
he goes,
woman ever comes at you.

949
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,420
He goes,
you immediately lock yourself in the 

950
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:42,420
bathroom.
He goes and then call the police.

951
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:42,960
That's good advice.
Yeah.

952
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,290
Just lock yourself in.
He goes,

953
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,140
you don't have any strike marks because 
they can,

954
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,980
you know,
he was talking about it,

955
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,090
you know,
somebody was gonna,

956
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,730
you know.
I don't know.

957
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,850
That's a good move.

958
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,430
Okay.
On the swim from.

959
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,640
No.
Well,

960
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,200
it's controversy and you know,
hitting women.

961
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,990
I've never hit a woman ever,
but obviously,

962
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,910
but I could never.
I could never do it,

963
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,420
but I would.
If a woman was attacking me,

964
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,090
I would knock on conscious.
There's no doubt about it.

965
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,420
I mean if a woman was coming in with a 
knife trying to hit me with a ball one 

966
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,150
or window haymaker right to the chops,
going to take them out,

967
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,980
take them out,
stop playing games.

968
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:26,030
If you're going to hit a check,
you've got to blast him right in the 

969
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,651
face.
Most chicks are just not prepared for 

970
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:29,680
that.
I'm not prepared for that either.

971
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:35,130
Nobody is,
but I would only do it to save my life 

972
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:35,440
or you know,
my safety.

973
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,090
But you know,
you never know man.

974
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,460
I've seen fucking checks that can punch 
really hard.

975
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:44,461
My friend Tommy,
my friend Tommy junior has a girlfriend 

976
00:43:44,461 --> 00:43:47,491
that works out all the time and we took 
her to one of those fucking things at 

977
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:47,491
the,
you know,

978
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,400
one of those,
a video game.

979
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:53,401
Things were the bag pops out and you hit
it and praying and you see what she 

980
00:43:53,771 --> 00:43:57,210
fucking hits hard.
I was looking at like,

981
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,220
if this girl's soccer punch me,
I'm going to wake up with a flashlight 

982
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,220
in my face.
No

983
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,220
you don't.
You know what?

984
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,230
I don't,
I don't like,

985
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:07,290
uh,
I don't like watching when the women 

986
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:07,290
fight each other and fighting.
Really.

987
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:07,600
I don't,
I don't like it.

988
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,420
You know what they should do?
They should have them fight like 

989
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,470
convicted rapist and the rapist don't 
know that the fight is going to happen.

990
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,660
So then I got to shape eating prison 
food.

991
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:23,630
Just come out there and then you have to
be rapist in the right weight class and 

992
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:23,630
they just get in.
Yeah.

993
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:28,130
Oh yeah.
You can work all the details and they 

994
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,130
just beat the living shit out of still a
man.

995
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,470
But to sit there,
well just sit there and uh,

996
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,950
I like to sit there and watch to women 
like they don't want to hate a.

997
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:35,590
When they punch each other and they hit 
that Teddy's

998
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:38,560
sacred.

999
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,580
If I run a rosy and Liz Carmouche,
Ronda Rousey got kicked in the tits,

1000
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,840
shout out just before she,
uh,

1001
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,240
got back to it.
I'll tell you,

1002
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:48,950
you know,
and you know,

1003
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:50,750
they have a name for that within their 
circle.

1004
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,930
What that feeling is kick to kick to the
tits.

1005
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:56,840
They got to have some sort of slang for 
it where um,

1006
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,040
you know,
it'd be funny,

1007
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,720
but I would never want to take the ass 
kicking was,

1008
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,420
is how bad those girls could beat me.
Somebody.

1009
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:06,200
Somebody like,
like three weight classes below me.

1010
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,470
Well Rhonda Rousey would be a good one 
on me because she's a grappler.

1011
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:13,800
She'd just getting you in an arm bar.
Training is for brothers,

1012
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,740
headlock,
dual head

1013
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,380
throwing.
Keep it from here to here.

1014
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,340
So Dad doesn't get mad it from Chin,
Chin to belt.

1015
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,360
Yet if somebody starts winning,
always punched in the hair the.

1016
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,530
So the lump lump wouldn't show up,
you know,

1017
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,570
it's funny,
we were learning basically how to beat a

1018
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:33,730
woman,
so I didn't really look at it,

1019
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,900
but we would do it to each other.

1020
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,630
But um,
I think that.

1021
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:41,860
But I really think that like it would,
it'd be great if somehow you could teach

1022
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,670
women that because of all these dirt 
bags and these guys who do hit women,

1023
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:48,100
if you were to teach them that so they 
could have that,

1024
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,500
uh,
to be able to defend themselves.

1025
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:50,930
Yeah.

1026
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,680
Almost always the best option because 
you have your legs,

1027
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,880
you know,
a woman's legs,

1028
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:00,160
you know,
you think about it can carry you and you

1029
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,180
know,
you weigh 130 pounds or whatever your 

1030
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,081
weight.
They're fucking carrying you around all 

1031
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:07,081
day.
You can't do that with your arms.

1032
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:09,100
So you could lock them man up in a 
triangle or an arm bar and fuck them up.

1033
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,910
You know,
he really,

1034
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,210
a woman like Rhonda Rousey could break 
my arm easily.

1035
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,940
She got me in an arm bar for sure.
She could break my arm.

1036
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,710
You know,
there's,

1037
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,020
I don't know why they send those kinds 
of people to jail,

1038
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:23,230
like rapist to study should just shoot 
him in the street like a rabid dog.

1039
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,180
That's how I feel.
I was.

1040
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,300
You do any of that that sent you over?

1041
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,450
We had a guy,
we.

1042
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:32,130
There was a video of some guy who's a 
shooter,

1043
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,170
a school shooter.
He was taunting the family of the 

1044
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,411
victims and I was like,
the only reason he's doing this because 

1045
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:41,931
he's in a court and because he knows 
there's laws and things are protecting 

1046
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:41,931
them.
They should beat that guy to death

1047
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:43,870
in the family that's got to sit there 
and take that.

1048
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,520
Yeah.
Who played by the rules.

1049
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:50,521
It's just like you'll never forget him 
taunting you and just like the fact that

1050
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:55,360
he's like still alive.
There's certain rather holidays,

1051
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:56,670
he gets a decent meal.
Yeah.

1052
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:57,560
There's aspects of it

1053
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,340
law that,
uh,

1054
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:03,390
that there's aspects to all human 
behavior where we have like workplace 

1055
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,240
rules,
like you have to behave here,

1056
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:13,241
you have courtroom rules where you have 
to behave like this and that allows 

1057
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:16,910
people to get away with some fucking 
ridiculous shit like that.

1058
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,480
No,
you're supposed to act civilized to 

1059
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,480
someone who isn't civilized and I get 
that to a certain point,

1060
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,380
but it's just like you're not going to 
cure what somebody is attracted to it.

1061
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,880
So if someone is attracted to kids,
it's like they have to be removed.

1062
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,040
Yeah.
There's no way you can

1063
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,260
cure that.
Ruins a kid's life.

1064
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Yeah.
The recidivism rate years like 

1065
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:37,680
generations and generations.
Gee,

1066
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,820
this is really heavy topics,
but it's weird how like the,

1067
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,410
that,
that thing is like,

1068
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,750
what,
what's missing is like common sense,

1069
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,930
you know,
and the same can be applied to stand up 

1070
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,881
comedy.
Like when Tracy Morgan got in trouble 

1071
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:52,600
for joking around about a son saying 
that he was established son who's gay.

1072
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,970
Right.
We all knew it was a joke.

1073
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We know.
It was just saying he's being Tracy 

1074
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,380
Morgan.
He's been fucking completely out of 

1075
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:02,380
bounds.
Continues in that direction.

1076
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,780
That's his.
His whole act is being outrageous like 

1077
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:06,780
that,
but you know,

1078
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,170
like common sense goes,
oh,

1079
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:10,270
is he a comedian?
Is he telling a joke though?

1080
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:11,650
That's just,
that's all it is.

1081
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,450
You know,
it might not be good.

1082
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,110
You might say,
well,

1083
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:15,820
I think he sucks.
That's fine.

1084
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:21,340
You're allowed.
I mean there's a broad spectrum of what 

1085
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,660
people like and don't like joking about 
certain subjects as if it bombs.

1086
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,550
Yeah.
Then,

1087
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,460
but if it kills every this,
that there's always that legendary line 

1088
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,540
to the one comic said,
you're fucking trying to get out to your

1089
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,570
friends at a diner because you're still 
laughing because it was so ridiculous.

1090
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,060
I always use Brian Holzman's.
Susan Smith,

1091
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,190
one.
Susan Smith was a chicken tender.

1092
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:44,191
Kid's this motherfucker got on the 
comedy store stage a couple of days 

1093
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:48,871
later and he goes,
I heard those kids were bad kids and 

1094
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:48,871
heard.
They sat that close to the TV.

1095
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:49,900
They didn't pull it away.
Their blocks.

1096
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,660
They always spilt the milk.
Those kids will not be missed.

1097
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,010
And we were just going,
oh no.

1098
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,300
Too soon,
and he's,

1099
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,020
he's just so great.
I don't want to name the comic because I

1100
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:02,170
never

1101
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:07,270
talk to them to confirm it,
but there was a plane crash and I don't 

1102
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:11,491
know,
like North Dakota or South Dakota or 

1103
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:12,851
something like that someplace and he 
goes on stage like within the year and 

1104
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:15,800
it's making fun of it and some guy in 
the crowd just stands up and he's like,

1105
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:19,370
my wife was on that flight without 
missing a beat.

1106
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:19,880
He goes,
great,

1107
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:20,990
let's dig her up and fucker.

1108
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:26,490
I was just like,
wow.

1109
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,070
And if you're not a stand up comic,
you don't understand that because that's

1110
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:36,810
like literally he had to go to that 
level to win because if he went,

1111
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,220
because if you went like,
oh my God,

1112
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:40,730
I'm sorry.
She always over.

1113
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,110
Hey,
what's up with popsicles?

1114
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,170
You got it.
Gets too late,

1115
00:49:46,171 --> 00:49:49,050
man.
Turn your key on your key sir.

1116
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,240
We went nuclear.
Yeah,

1117
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,420
that's what it is.
They both had a turn to keep the same 

1118
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:56,420
time and activate the button.
Yeah.

1119
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,160
Ooh,
fuck.

1120
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,800
Holy Shit.
Well,

1121
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:02,190
you know what?
Fuck that guy for standing up and saying

1122
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:04,050
that he's at a comedy show,
you know,

1123
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:09,410
I understand that you might think it's 
offensive comments within the year if 

1124
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,180
you're going in,
you know,

1125
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,210
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

1126
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:15,110
I wouldn't go in,
but I support your right to go in.

1127
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,120
Just like Johnny Cash didn't really 
shoot a man in Reno just to watch them 

1128
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,360
die.
It's fucking entertainment.

1129
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:21,720
He's,
he's,

1130
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,760
he's painting a story and a guy like 
Brian Holtzman isn't really happy that 

1131
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,220
kill white for the guy who actually

1132
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,680
got shot and Reno was not in the crowd 
anyway.

1133
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,710
Yeah,
exactly.

1134
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:32,930
Well that's true.
Yeah.

1135
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,310
It wasn't a real event that he was 
shitting on,

1136
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,460
but that's part,
that's a style of comedy that's like,

1137
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,640
I love that style.
Like auto and George will do that.

1138
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,180
Dice clay was due that date.
They're over the top.

1139
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,090
Absolutely ridiculous.
And there's something really funny about

1140
00:50:48,091 --> 00:50:48,900
that.
I love it

1141
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,920
and I'm not backing down and I'm going 
to say the most ridiculous outrageous 

1142
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920
and it is.
It's a form of comedy.

1143
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,841
You might not like it,
but to sit there and then act like this 

1144
00:50:58,841 --> 00:51:02,321
guy really wants to go do it,
and it really meant it sounds 

1145
00:51:02,321 --> 00:51:06,060
ridiculous,
but if you take that quote and then all 

1146
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,310
of a sudden you put it on a new show.
I mean,

1147
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,910
just the,
the context of it.

1148
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,370
It's insane.
There's just like,

1149
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:15,371
we're just taking this one line from an 
hour load performance at a comedy club 

1150
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:16,310
in a different state.
I,

1151
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:21,311
you know,
it's so funny that when there was that 

1152
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:21,980
sort of rash of those videos,
the amount of times that people told the

1153
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:26,981
joke and it killed in the club and then 
they would be like controversy at the 

1154
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:31,241
laugh factory and then they cut to 
somebody and they tell the joke and you 

1155
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:35,141
hear it like it's like 99 percent of 
people laughed and one person gets 

1156
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:35,540
offended.
It's like there's no contract.

1157
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,870
Exactly.
It's a good joke.

1158
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,610
It's a good joke.
Yeah.

1159
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:45,710
And,
but it's an opportunity for all these 

1160
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,641
white knights to jump in and pretend 
they're offended and pretend that you 

1161
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:51,001
know,
to try to get feminine Brownie points 

1162
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:51,001
and step in and try to,
you know,

1163
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:51,001
mark some notches on their side.

1164
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:53,720
Just show up if they ever asked you to 
go on TV for what?

1165
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,750
If they were just like Joe Rogan,
this stuff you said are most likely no 

1166
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,970
take crawlspace comment,
why don't you go on the Internet and on 

1167
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:03,510
TV and defend?

1168
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,390
Because they would,
they would have control over it.

1169
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:10,391
But I would have him come on the podcast
if I felt like someone had a rational 

1170
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:10,430
point and they were like,
worth debating,

1171
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:15,670
you know,
maybe in especially if I was exploring 

1172
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,670
whether or not it was wrong.
I mean I thought I might do it

1173
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,770
and I would go on there and the whole 
time that person was yelling,

1174
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:18,970
I would just be hyping my dates.

1175
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,900
Rutherford,
New Jersey.

1176
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:28,250
We're Jacksonville,
haven't had a piece of paper just 

1177
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,320
pointing.
It would be the greatest thing.

1178
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:31,480
Like I completely don't pick up a 
calendar,

1179
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,340
a large calendar,
roll it out.

1180
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,160
This is the bill burke calender.
Look around,

1181
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:37,210
see if I'm going to be coming to your 
town billboard.com.

1182
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,560
That is a good way to handle it because 
it is a fucking joke.

1183
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:46,590
I mean you're,
you're operating within these five 

1184
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:46,590
minute clips.
You're going back and forth.

1185
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:50,590
A good solid point takes a few minutes 
to really establish and to give you a 

1186
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:55,881
point of view on a controversial topic,
you really have to cover a lot of 

1187
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:55,990
different areas and that's not what 
they're trying to do.

1188
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:58,780
They just want you to yell at you,
trying to get you to yell at each other.

1189
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,970
That would be the move.
The move would be to do that.

1190
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:02,530
Just start yelling at billboard,
going

1191
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,030
your dates.
You just completely ignore them.

1192
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,960
I'm getting good at that.
I,

1193
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,860
I had a,
had an incident,

1194
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,610
uh,
on,

1195
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,620
uh,
on the airplane going to Indianapolis 

1196
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,140
with this,
this guy like I don't,

1197
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,610
I just,
I just started like interrogating me.

1198
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,400
He thought I was some sort of flight 
risk about what?

1199
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,890
I don't know.
He was on something.

1200
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:26,580
I don't know what happened.
Like I was sitting down.

1201
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,740
So He's just a passenger?
Yeah,

1202
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:30,600
and I was,
I didn't know if he was a sky marshal,

1203
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:33,480
but he ordered a doers in the beginning 
and he just slammed it.

1204
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,610
So I'm like,
this guy's not a scar.

1205
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:37,410
My Sky Marshal,
this guy's boozing it up.

1206
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,790
So he just goes to me.
He's like a,

1207
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,090
which is sitting there and he just says 
I.

1208
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,700
He goes,
hey,

1209
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,940
you are you afraid to fly?
And I'm like,

1210
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,960
what?
He goes,

1211
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:49,650
are you afraid of flag?

1212
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,880
Oh No,
I'm not afraid to fly.

1213
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,560
And he goes,
you sure?

1214
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,800
Because you know it's okay,
you can tell me if you are immediately.

1215
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:56,700
I'm looking at this guy,
what do you mean?

1216
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:57,480
It's like,
okay,

1217
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,020
what is this like interrogation,
one-on-one,

1218
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:04,440
build a relationship with your subject 
thing that you're doing here.

1219
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,610
And I was just like,
no.

1220
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,480
He goes,
dude.

1221
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:07,800
He goes,
ah,

1222
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:12,830
because you know,
you just kind of fidgeting and looking 

1223
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:12,830
around.
I was like,

1224
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:12,830
Nah man.
I go,

1225
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:12,830
I'm cool.
He's like,

1226
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:12,870
oh,
you'd like to fly.

1227
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:13,770
I'm like,
when I'm up here,

1228
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,570
because you don't have bumped myself up 
and go on back there.

1229
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,670
I don't like it.
And then he goes,

1230
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,200
he's all right,
you know,

1231
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,180
but you know,
you,

1232
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,420
you can tell me if you're afraid to fly.
So now I'm just like,

1233
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,060
dude,
I'm not afraid to fly.

1234
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,930
So.
And he's staring at me and I put my hand

1235
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:32,880
like this to show that it wasn't shaken.
I go,

1236
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:34,740
I'm not nervous.
All right,

1237
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,870
thanks for asking.
And then he goes,

1238
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:37,860
well,
anybody can do that.

1239
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,090
And I'm just like,
oh Jesus Christ.

1240
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,020
And I just said,
look dude,

1241
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,820
I'm drinking water.
You're drinking doors.

1242
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,810
Okay.
And he goes,

1243
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:44,490
that wasn't doers right now I'm just 
like,

1244
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:48,120
I fucked this guy.
So I'm sitting there.

1245
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,710
You saw a mortar it.
Huh?

1246
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,470
You saw him order doers.
I was senator.

1247
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,500
He said,
let me get a doors.

1248
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:57,501
And she brought it over neat.
And he threw it back like he was 

1249
00:54:57,501 --> 00:54:57,501
drinking baby.
Okay.

1250
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,990
What's impressive is this guy's old 
school starting off.

1251
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:01,350
Good.
Right?

1252
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:03,960
So then there's like five minutes of 
silence,

1253
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,510
more passengers getting on,
and then the guy goes,

1254
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,380
hey,
I'm sorry man,

1255
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:09,750
I just,
I just got off on the wrong foot there.

1256
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:10,170
Right?
He goes,

1257
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:11,730
my name's so and so,
what's your name?

1258
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,410
Asked me like,
what my name is,

1259
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,240
and I was thinking of saying something 
like,

1260
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,300
Steve,
you know,

1261
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:21,310
and uh,
or some I wish I wish I said some silly 

1262
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:21,310
name,
you know,

1263
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:21,840
but I didn't think of one.
I just went,

1264
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,160
it's bill and he goes out.
He goes out,

1265
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,810
why?
Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

1266
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,790
He started doing the shit and I just 
looked at the guy and I go.

1267
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,140
I'm like,
yeah,

1268
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,900
I don't have to answer your questions.
Whoa,

1269
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,240
I don't.
He has no fucking authority.

1270
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:37,440
You're not a sky marshal.

1271
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,210
You're drinking booze,
you're an asshole.

1272
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,100
What are you on?
Are you afraid to fly?

1273
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,660
Go Fuck Yourself.
Leave me alone.

1274
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:44,570
Right?
So then he goes like,

1275
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,180
all right,
now,

1276
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,000
now I am concerned.
I am concerned.

1277
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,550
Okay,
why are you going to Indianapolis?

1278
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:52,170
Bill Wright says this,
right?

1279
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,310
And they closed the doors and that 
they're doing all this stuff and I just,

1280
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,250
I just start,
like I joked to my podcast,

1281
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:01,260
I just started smoking like Ryan 
Gosling.

1282
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:06,430
He does that little Mona Lisa smile.
We just kind of smile and I'm just 

1283
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:06,430
sitting there shaking my head at the 
guy,

1284
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,671
right,
and I'm literally taking out my eye 

1285
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,261
pillow.
I wear like a mask just to say I'm so 

1286
00:56:12,261 --> 00:56:14,901
not worried about anything that you're 
going to fucking do all this passive 

1287
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:17,391
aggressive shit this to Piss this guy 
off and he's got why are you going to 

1288
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:17,391
Indianapolis Belt?
And I just kept.

1289
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:18,420
I didn't say anything to him.
I just kept laughing,

1290
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:23,421
just kept shaking my head and um,
was taxiing down and he goes through 

1291
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:23,970
because he goes,
I fucking do for a fucking living

1292
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,620
such fff and all this stuff.
The lady in front turns around,

1293
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:31,621
starts looking at what?
Taxing down the thing because you don't 

1294
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:31,621
answer my questions right now.
I'm going to hit that call button.

1295
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:36,600
I will hit that call button.
I will stop this plane and you will be 

1296
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:36,600
fucking arrested like saying all this 
stuff.

1297
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,590
And I'm just looking at him smiling,
shaking my head.

1298
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:40,840
Like go ahead and push it down.
Let's see what the fuck.

1299
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:42,070
This goes.
Hilarious.

1300
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,770
What happens.
Does the pilot come out?

1301
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,850
There's a police car pull up to the 
play,

1302
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:49,900
no fucking clue.
So he goes to push it and you can't find

1303
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:54,901
it.
It was kind of a weird place and he 

1304
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:54,901
finally finds it and he hit the button.
I'm like,

1305
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:54,901
Oh fuck.
He hit the button.

1306
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,710
This is hilarious,
and I'm just sitting there.

1307
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,670
He goes,
now you wait,

1308
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,720
you fucking wait,
blah,

1309
00:56:58,721 --> 00:56:58,980
blah,
blah.

1310
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,950
And I'm just sitting there smiling,
shaking my head at him.

1311
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:01,360
I'm like,
dude,

1312
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,460
I don't care.
I don't get.

1313
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,830
You're not,
you have no fucking authority.

1314
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,080
You're not gonna hit me.
You're not going to do anything.

1315
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:11,980
You're on fucking something,
but I'm not getting that dude.

1316
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:13,690
If that guy had a vibe,
like he was gonna Punch me,

1317
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,070
I would have been up in the,
in the ass,

1318
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:16,450
but he didn't.
He just had that.

1319
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,220
It was like a kid throwing a temper 
tantrum.

1320
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,490
He wanted like this.
He almost seemed like he wanted to be an

1321
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:26,491
army ranger,
but he didn't quite make it or what did 

1322
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:26,491
he look like?
He was like,

1323
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:26,491
uh,
why reducing good shape,

1324
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:29,050
you know?
Why are we doing like that dude who shot

1325
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,630
trayvon Martin kid who wasn't really a 
cop,

1326
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
but he wanted to be a cop,
so he took it to the next level when I 

1327
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,330
could have squashed the whole thing and 
just been like,

1328
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:38,320
look,
I'm a comedian.

1329
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:41,260
I'm going to Indianapolis.
If you'd like to come out to the show,

1330
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,270
I could've done that,
but I'm a dick and I hate.

1331
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,720
I hate fucking.
I hate authority and this guy doesn't 

1332
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:48,720
have any,
so fuck him.

1333
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,560
So I just laughed.
Now he pushes the button,

1334
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,810
so then the stewardess comes over and 
she goes,

1335
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:53,410
yeah,
what's the problem?

1336
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,380
He goes to sky is a flight risk.
I am not comfortable flying with him,

1337
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,440
but Baba Baba Baba and all this shit.
I was surprised how few people were 

1338
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,871
looking around.
People just kind of sitting there and 

1339
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:04,750
sky was wigging out and I'm just sitting
there and then the stewardess was like,

1340
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:08,410
all right,
did anybody else see any behavior?

1341
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:09,820
And The lady was sitting in front of 
him,

1342
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,380
pointed at him and said,
yeah,

1343
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:13,420
he was breeding any point and she 
pointed me.

1344
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:15,940
He was berating him and I'm just like,
perfect.

1345
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,230
So I'm literally putting my fucking ims 
down as I'm talking to him going,

1346
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:24,270
hey,
I'm just a guy trying to go to 

1347
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,521
Indianapolis.
This guy's drinking doers and he's 

1348
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:25,521
dropping the f bomb and I'm thinking,
fuck.

1349
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:25,521
I said,
bomb,

1350
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:30,000
you know,
it's kind of a problem with it wasn't a 

1351
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,750
problem and this guy is just doing this 
thing where he wants to win.

1352
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:34,720
He wants some sort of recognition of 
what?

1353
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,010
Whatever the fuck he thinks he is still 
moving.

1354
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,140
No,
at this point,

1355
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:40,810
if fucking stopped it pulled over.
I forgot that part.

1356
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:43,540
It pulled over and stopped.
Dude,

1357
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:45,370
it's a fucking red eye.
Okay.

1358
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,640
It stops.
Another stewardess comes over and he 

1359
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:50,640
goes,
what's the problem?

1360
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,841
And he goes through the whole fucking 
thing and it's like basically the 

1361
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:55,330
captain at this point is going,
do I really have to come back there?

1362
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,850
It's like really the red eye fucking 
flight.

1363
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,550
My last flight of the day I used to fly 
combat missions,

1364
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:01,600
you know,
fucking boring.

1365
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:04,240
This is to fly this fucking bus.
I don't want to deal with this bullshit.

1366
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,300
So I really have to come back there.
And then they finally asked him,

1367
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:07,630
I said,
hey,

1368
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:09,580
are you going to be comfortable flying 
with this guy?

1369
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,180
And He,
uh,

1370
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,980
I think they acknowledged that he had 
some sort of something there because,

1371
00:59:15,981 --> 00:59:16,380
you know what?
No,

1372
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,520
it's okay.
It's gonna be okay for whatever.

1373
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:23,550
Right?
So they had some sort of something like 

1374
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:23,550
some sort of that like they checked with
him,

1375
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,280
like,
you're going to stand down sir,

1376
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,800
like whatever fucking spy he thought he 
was.

1377
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,250
So now we get back in line and what 
taxing.

1378
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:36,251
And as we're going down the runway,
I got my eye on and I'm just sitting 

1379
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:38,390
there and he's yapping in my ear,
you could think this is fucking over.

1380
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,190
You think this is fucking over at this 
point.

1381
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:45,191
I'm laughing,
I'm holding my stomach in a fucking 

1382
00:59:45,191 --> 00:59:45,740
laughing and it's driving them nuts and 
I'm having a fucking ball with this guy.

1383
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:46,700
And he goes,
uh,

1384
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:47,660
you know,
my dad's,

1385
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,300
the CEO is some fucking company in 
Indianapolis.

1386
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,990
And he starts saying that he's going to 
have any fucking arrested when I land.

1387
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:59,370
And uh,
and he starts describing the view I was 

1388
00:59:59,370 --> 00:59:59,370
going to see from the jail,
like some law and order episode.

1389
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,430
Did you get a picture of this kind of 
take a photo now?

1390
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,390
How could you not have been filming 
video this whole entire time?

1391
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,690
That would be amazing.
You can,

1392
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,610
can't you just be in the moment and not 
turn into a film crew?

1393
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,750
Just because that was the universe gave 
me this fucking moment.

1394
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,340
I'm telling this story.
I don't,

1395
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:17,960
I don't know.

1396
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,970
So he fucking uh,
so then I got my thanks.

1397
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,820
And then he finally,
he's,

1398
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,200
yeah,
he's gone.

1399
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:24,440
Yeah.
He,

1400
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:29,441
Oh,
you're going to love the view from the 

1401
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:30,461
jail.
You can see Lucas oil field and blah 

1402
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:30,461
blah,
blah blah.

1403
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:30,461
And all this shit.
And then he finally oil.

1404
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:30,710
That's where the colts play

1405
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,400
this view.
It was such,

1406
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:35,860
such hacky interrogation.
Then he finally said a.

1407
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,520
He goes,
you know what?

1408
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:39,050
I'm glad I'm glad.
You know what?

1409
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:41,810
I fucking hope you do something.
I fucking hope you do something.

1410
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:46,790
We're up there and I'm fucking burst.
It was sitting there with a blindfold on

1411
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:49,760
laughing at him.
It was driving him fucking nuts.

1412
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,090
It was great.
So then five minutes of silence,

1413
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:58,330
10 minutes of silence goes by and I'm 
finally thinking that maybe this shit's 

1414
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,710
over or is he just sitting there staring
at the side of my head and then all of a

1415
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:02,720
sudden I just hear it right as I'm 
starting to nod off.

1416
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:05,450
I just here,
why are you going to Indianapolis,

1417
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:05,720
Bill?

1418
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,980
I just laugh.

1419
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,830
So do my adrenaline was going.
I was just like,

1420
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,150
wow,
they're going to stop the plane.

1421
01:01:14,151 --> 01:01:15,230
This is fucking intense,
man.

1422
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:20,231
It's just crazy what's going to happen 
and I'm totally innocent so I got to 

1423
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:23,261
kind of watch it happen.
So then I couldn't sleep so I was 

1424
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:24,450
sitting there with that stupid mask on 
for like a half an hour and then finally

1425
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,280
just like,
fuck it,

1426
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:30,281
I gotta take it off and I got to deal 
with this guy and I take it off and I 

1427
01:01:30,281 --> 01:01:31,860
look over and he's just teach this 
passed out head hanging.

1428
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,690
This fucking special ops guy really 
passed out.

1429
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,650
You should fucking way Liam with a huge 
haymaker right in the face.

1430
01:01:40,651 --> 01:01:42,300
And then immediately pretend you're 
asleep.

1431
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,080
No,
no,

1432
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:45,150
because someone would,
someone would have seen that.

1433
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:46,740
So No,
you know,

1434
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:50,100
what I did was I immediately started 
pounding waters because I didn't have to

1435
01:01:50,101 --> 01:01:53,020
go the bathroom and I wanted to get up 
on the plane just to see if he was going

1436
01:01:53,021 --> 01:01:55,160
to fucking wig out again.
Make them so.

1437
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,510
So you've made yourself go to the 
bathroom,

1438
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,720
you would have water and you have to go 
to full of fucking bathroom,

1439
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:07,020
like you can't believe in.
This fucking guy's passed out.

1440
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:08,640
He's now.
I held it for the last hour.

1441
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,270
He didn't wake up,

1442
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:14,270
wake up until we landed and then we 
pulled up to the terminal and I got out 

1443
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,330
and I stood up and he wouldn't look at 
me and I'm thinking he probably slept it

1444
01:02:18,331 --> 01:02:20,220
off and I was feeling fucking weird 
hopefully.

1445
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,220
And The lady in front of me got up and 
she just goes.

1446
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,600
She smiled and she said,
hey.

1447
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:25,490
And I just said,
ah,

1448
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,940
that was,
that was an interesting one.

1449
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,920
And then he had the pillow like this 
Joe.

1450
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,980
He edit behind air in some weird 
position in,

1451
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:35,981
in some sort of like Alpha male way.
He tried to get some sort of tough 

1452
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:35,981
thing.
The last word,

1453
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:40,281
he took the pillow up and he threw it 
down behind it between his legs and he 

1454
01:02:40,281 --> 01:02:40,281
like grunted.
He went like,

1455
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,290
like he threw a pillow down.
That was it.

1456
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,910
That was my trip to Indianapolis.
Oh.

1457
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:48,900
And then I worked at a theater and Elmo 
was,

1458
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:50,400
there was in the big room.

1459
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:54,190
Elmo and friends from sesame street 
before mom got busted and.

1460
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:54,610
No,
no,

1461
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:54,870
no,
no,

1462
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:55,920
no.
This is just the other day.

1463
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,240
This is my past weekend.
Will,

1464
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:00,390
you know the dude who played elmo did a 
bunch of gay shit with kids.

1465
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,770
Allegedly.
Allegedly.

1466
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:02,430
Yeah.
You can't say that,

1467
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,540
right?
Yeah.

1468
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:05,720
Um,
so what,

1469
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,200
this is a different elmo.
No,

1470
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:07,470
no,
no.

1471
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:09,120
This was,
this was burt and the count.

1472
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:14,121
We're backstage.
I had to walk by him and that just like 

1473
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:14,121
chilling,
like the counts just sitting there.

1474
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:17,990
I put this video up and they made me 
take it down because I had unauthorized 

1475
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:21,921
video of them.
But like I'm standing there and I'm 

1476
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:21,921
filming and I'm like,
Holy Shit,

1477
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:22,370
there's what's going on.
Burton,

1478
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:27,380
I think burt's waving to me and he's 
really waving off like no pictures and 

1479
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:31,240
just do it in the burke costume.
Comes walking up and is trying to slam 

1480
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,510
the door in my face.
But the peg thing is there.

1481
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's a lot.
I thought it was a cute video and it 

1482
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,000
kind of went with this character.
He's a Dick on the show.

1483
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,200
It totally made sense.
But they made me.

1484
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,210
They made me take this thing down.
Why would they make you take it down?

1485
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,300
I don't know if I'm legally allowed to 
show you.

1486
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:46,380
I can show you this,
right?

1487
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:47,760
We can.
You can show it in.

1488
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,850
Our lawyers were support you.
How about hey go watch when he weighs.

1489
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:12,960
No visitors going to slam the door on 
me.

1490
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:16,610
Don't you got to see this big stupid 
head.

1491
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:21,000
I can't believe they took that down.
I think it is.

1492
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:24,210
I get it is because what had happened 
and then.

1493
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,400
And then also like if,
uh,

1494
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:32,330
you know,
I guess if kids are still like three 

1495
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:32,520
years old and somebody takes off the 
bird head or like the big bird costume,

1496
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:34,800
they just see it hanging in the corner,
like it really fucks with them.

1497
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:36,120
So I get it.
I took it down.

1498
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,680
They asked you to take it down.
Yeah.

1499
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,520
The lady,
the lady who runs the tour,

1500
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,190
she,
she knew I got video and I think uh,

1501
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,230
I may find it on the podcast.
Like they,

1502
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:47,400
she,
she did a job,

1503
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:48,420
she's,
she's on point.

1504
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,270
I had that thing up like 20 minutes and 
they were just like,

1505
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:52,230
yeah,
take it down,

1506
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,160
take it down.
And I was like,

1507
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:53,450
all right.

1508
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:55,620
All right.
I don't think you have to take it down.

1509
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,960
The way I look at the way I would 
legally argue it was legally had the 

1510
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,420
right to be there.
You left the door open.

1511
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,200
I did not walk into the backstage area.
I filmed in.

1512
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:10,080
That was somebody dropped the ball by 
having that door open.

1513
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,370
So they were at the same theater that 
you were they.

1514
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:18,390
They were in the bigger.
Elmo was playing the big room and it's 

1515
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,840
the smaller room upstairs.
What is an indy?

1516
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,310
Indianapolis.
This is there.

1517
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,260
This is after that.
Do that.

1518
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:26,110
Psycho.
The cycle on the plane.

1519
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:27,780
This is this whole.
This is this past weekend.

1520
01:05:27,781 --> 01:05:28,620
This whole transition.

1521
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,910
Past weekend.
Yeah.

1522
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,700
What do you do?
You were you doing it?

1523
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,180
Gypsum theater.
Beautiful place.

1524
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,180
Never done it.
I'm doing the Morat.

1525
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,590
You ever heard of that?
No,

1526
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:42,591
I've never done standup in Indianapolis.
Crate crate and a phenomenal time.

1527
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,200
I just did Nashville.
You ever do xannies like a zillion 

1528
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:48,200
times?
Fucking love that.

1529
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:48,460
Oh,
I saw your tweet.

1530
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:52,570
Whether it's the Museum of pictures that
you can get some comedians like,

1531
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:54,260
oh my God,
that's a ridiculous.

1532
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:59,261
I took a picture of one of my buddy.
I mean this thing had to be for my 84 

1533
01:05:59,261 --> 01:05:59,800
and he had that.
Oh boy,

1534
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:00,940
I'm gonna.
Make it that.

1535
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:03,010
Look on his face.
He know that that wide.

1536
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,270
I.
I've never been fucked before.

1537
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:07,480
And I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna name names.

1538
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:12,481
I don't name names because then what's 
going to happen is people are going to 

1539
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:12,481
go there because they got to take the 
picture.

1540
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:12,481
They're going to tweet it to the guy and
I'm going to.

1541
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,110
But there's nothing wrong with that 
either.

1542
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,530
Joe.
I'm a true friend of the guy.

1543
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:19,960
I don't do that.
You can't even throw him right under the

1544
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:24,961
bus.
Blowing rocks has really reminded me of 

1545
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:24,980
land of the lost for you.

1546
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,720
Those are a Himalayan rock salt.
I knew that.

1547
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,970
I know you did.
Of course she died.

1548
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,150
I just wanted to remind you,
you put it in there and uh,

1549
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,170
that salt,
it just like goes into your pores.

1550
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:35,640
The,
uh,

1551
01:06:35,641 --> 01:06:36,630
the headshot.
You don't,

1552
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:38,250
you don't crave bacon anymore.
No,

1553
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,230
it's done.
It cured me of everything.

1554
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,120
No more masturbating in the middle of 
the night.

1555
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,320
It's awesome.
The,

1556
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,000
um,
the headshot wall in Nashville,

1557
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,290
one of the guys on the wall was a,
well,

1558
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:51,030
there's a bunch of them that are dead 
now.

1559
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:54,520
It's weird.
Like tennis Wolfsburg was a beast.

1560
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:57,180
Richard.
Jenny paintings on the wall.

1561
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,280
He is one of my all time greats.
Fire to pick like a 10,

1562
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:07,310
top 10 all time and he was on that 
Carlin road to where he was putting up 

1563
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,640
like putting them out like boom,
boom,

1564
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,360
boom,
boom,

1565
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:10,230
boom,
like an hour,

1566
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:10,770
another hour.

1567
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,540
But unlike Carlin,
he was upset.

1568
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,660
He didn't want to do that.
He wanted to be like Jim Carrey,

1569
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,720
you know,
he wanted to be a movie star and he 

1570
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,821
wanted to be Seinfeld.
He wanted to have his own show or 

1571
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:22,821
something,
something along those lines.

1572
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:22,821
And it just didn't click for him.
Yeah,

1573
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:23,220
he would,
uh,

1574
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,080
he would always be bummed out when he 
was on the road.

1575
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:30,081
I would always hear stories from people 
that worked in clubs with them and it 

1576
01:07:30,081 --> 01:07:30,081
was just unhappy.
Didn't want to be on the road.

1577
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,110
Me and one other guy was brilliant.
No,

1578
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:37,250
sorry,
I was gonna say like you can get away 

1579
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,250
with shit.

1580
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,310
It's Kinda good to not have a TV show 
once you start selling tickets.

1581
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:42,311
And it's like,
I played hockey yesterday at like three 

1582
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:42,311
in the afternoon.
Yeah.

1583
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:42,311
He never gonna get any fresher than 
that.

1584
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,780
And you're going to get a show,
but it's not your show.

1585
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:47,450
It's this show.
I compare it to like when your parents,

1586
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:48,950
when you were a kid and they gave you a 
bicycle,

1587
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,860
you know what I mean?
It's like they gave the bicycle bicycle,

1588
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:53,230
but when you screw up,
they take the book,

1589
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,860
you get grounded and they take the bike 
away.

1590
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:57,500
So it's not really yours.
Even if it's your name on it,

1591
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:58,850
you know,
you're not an adult.

1592
01:07:59,240 --> 01:07:59,960
Yeah.
Like you,

1593
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:04,970
you're going into like the matrix.
So I would have like a real sort of a 

1594
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:09,290
funny that I've had in this business 
that I have that information now and I 

1595
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:12,911
don't know what to do with it because 
it's not like I'm going to start my own 

1596
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:12,911
network.
Like I don't know what,

1597
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:14,540
you don't have to do anything other than
what you're doing.

1598
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,300
You're a great standup comedian.

1599
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:21,330
That's the thing.
Being a standup comic allows you to say 

1600
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:21,330
whatever the fuck you want.
Like you were saying,

1601
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:25,780
nobody gets on your case if you say 
something fucked up because they're not 

1602
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:25,940
connecting you to a show.
But I'd say,

1603
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,490
Oh,
bill borough of Fox News said this,

1604
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:33,630
you know,
it's just bill burke comedian 

1605
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:33,630
advantages.
Yeah.

1606
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,470
To right where I am.
So I'm Kinda like,

1607
01:08:35,471 --> 01:08:36,110
you know,
I don't know.

1608
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,030
It's,

1609
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:42,530
do you get pressure from agents or 
something to do other things or is it 

1610
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:42,530
something you.

1611
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:46,700
I want a nice run and doing some movies 
and I did a couple of TV shows and it's 

1612
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,051
great.
But I like doing the movies because I 

1613
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:50,051
can see the light at the end of the 
tunnel.

1614
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:50,051
Right?
Like it's like,

1615
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:54,971
okay,
we have you for three to six weeks or 

1616
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:54,971
whatever.
And it's like,

1617
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:54,971
okay,
and you know,

1618
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:56,030
I'm just gonna do this,
I'm going to hammer this out,

1619
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,110
I'm going to know all my lines.
I'm going to,

1620
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,570
I'm going to be on time and be a 
professional.

1621
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,300
And once I get through this then I'm 
going to uh,

1622
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,410
you know,
on the weekends,

1623
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,430
you know,
I'll go out to like flappers in Burbank 

1624
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:11,160
to stay sharp.
And then once that's over a I go back 

1625
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:11,570
out on the road and I get going again.
But like the whole,

1626
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:16,630
the idea of being on a TV show and 
playing the same guy for potentially 

1627
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,630
five years is overwhelming to me.

1628
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:17,370
It's scary.
Yeah.

1629
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,670
It's overwhelming.
And I like,

1630
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:23,860
especially like those people who do like
one camera shows like how hard they 

1631
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:23,860
work.
Like they,

1632
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,450
they're doing like,
it's like a 12,

1633
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:28,550
13 hour days if you know.
Hey,

1634
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:29,180
how's it going?
Oh,

1635
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:33,410
it's great.
Cut back to one great cut.

1636
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,230
Alright.
You know this time do it with hey,

1637
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,070
no.
Hey,

1638
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:39,140
how's it going?
And then cut.

1639
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,490
Okay.
With turning it around,

1640
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:42,890
we got to do the master and all that.
Like they,

1641
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,610
they work harder than I've ever worked 
in my career.

1642
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:49,310
Like standup is in real time.
You go on at eight,

1643
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,340
do an hour and it's done in an hour.
You shoot an hour of TV,

1644
01:09:55,010 --> 01:10:00,010
one camera and it's like you're going to
be like those people that I have such a 

1645
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:04,490
tremendous respect for how hard people 
work on those things.

1646
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,360
And I don't think I have

1647
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:08,600
ethical single camera shows what you're 
talking.

1648
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:11,030
A lot of folks don't know the terms of 
the business.

1649
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:16,031
So like law and order or most dramas,
sitcoms with the is they'll fit little 

1650
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,430
use many cameras in front of a live 
audience and that's,

1651
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,410
even though that's hard in the 
beginning,

1652
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,290
once they get rolling then it becomes 
pretty easy.

1653
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,690
Like when you did news radio,
how soon before you guys were like,

1654
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:28,920
okay,
we don't get to come in Monday.

1655
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,210
Did you ever get to that point?
Yeah,

1656
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,360
we got to the point where sometimes we 
didn't come in Tuesday,

1657
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,900
they come in Monday or Tuesday.
We do a whole show in three days because

1658
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:40,110
they would have a problem with like the 
script.

1659
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:45,360
So it would be wrong with the script.
Like we would have script changes like 

1660
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,370
the day of like many crazy script 
changes.

1661
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:49,380
Those were the days man.
Like if I,

1662
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,420
you know,
I,

1663
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:54,240
I wish that those things would come back
because that will really.

1664
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,910
That's the dream to comes acting gig.

1665
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:02,010
Yeah.
Oh it's the greatest acting Gig of all 

1666
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:02,010
time.
But quite honestly when I did it,

1667
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,910
I really appreciated Standup,
you know?

1668
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:05,890
And when it was over I was happy it was 
over.

1669
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:10,980
I mean,
it wasn't happy because I love those 

1670
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:10,980
people that I worked with and it was a 
great show,

1671
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,420
but I wanted to do stand up,
you know,

1672
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:13,860
and the same thing,
fear factor,

1673
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,300
fear factor,
much clear.

1674
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:19,320
Like news radio was way more fun and 
satisfying to do,

1675
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,060
but same thing,
but it's over.

1676
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,110
I'm like,
stand up.

1677
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:27,111
It's just the best.
And then now stand up at podcasting 

1678
01:11:27,111 --> 01:11:27,111
together.

1679
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:31,710
Are you going to be happier than that?
I would use even the UFC,

1680
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:32,360
which is a great

1681
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,630
gig.
I love the UFC,

1682
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,400
but if anything ever came up with the 
UFC,

1683
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:35,880
said,
hey,

1684
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:37,560
you have to choose between one or the 
other.

1685
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:38,860
I'd be like,
you guys take care,

1686
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,050
you know,
and kind of.

1687
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,190
I had a good time.

1688
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,450
Yeah.
I had to bet on yourself.

1689
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,190
Yeah,
that's the game.

1690
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:45,360
Well,
not only that,

1691
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,480
they pull it out like a paranoid guy,
but they fucking pull you in.

1692
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,100
Do you know what it's like?
I met when I would,

1693
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:55,250
when I first came to New York City or 
are they would be guys who just worked 

1694
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,250
one club.
It's like,

1695
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:59,720
why would you ever do that?
Now all you need is one falling out and 

1696
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,000
you have no spots.
It's got a,

1697
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,960
you got to be playing the field so they 
can't,

1698
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,250
they can't get you under their thumb.

1699
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,650
Yes.
That's very important.

1700
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:11,651
Well,
that's what I would the comedy store 

1701
01:12:11,651 --> 01:12:11,651
when I was living in la or when I was 
working on all the time.

1702
01:12:11,651 --> 01:12:14,030
I did the comedy store every week and I 
didn't do anything else.

1703
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,940
I very rarely did anything else.
Like sometimes I did.

1704
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,670
Thanks buddy.
Sometimes I did the uh,

1705
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:24,671
the Improv,
like for New Year's or something like 

1706
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:26,861
that,
but almost every weekend I was at the 

1707
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:26,861
store and then when I had that falling 
out with the store I was like,

1708
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:27,700
what am I doing?
Like why,

1709
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:31,490
why would I allow them to have any power
over where I work or don't work?

1710
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:34,140
Like fuck.
Yeah,

1711
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:37,820
I think that's a good mentality.
And so sometimes it can hurt you though.

1712
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:42,940
Tim Allen stopped doing stand up when he
was doing home improvement because he 

1713
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,360
had that like real.
You've got to,

1714
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,340
you know,
for the time a fairly blue act.

1715
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:50,180
And he was doing this super family show 
who it was,

1716
01:12:50,181 --> 01:12:51,530
you know,
ABC.

1717
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:55,010
I think he was that blue.
I thought he was not blue,

1718
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,570
but potentially controversial.
Yeah.

1719
01:12:57,571 --> 01:12:58,370
Yeah.
No.

1720
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,420
Well look,
that guy like that in me talking about a

1721
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:05,421
guy who,
whose career started right after he got 

1722
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:05,421
out of jail.
I mean guys just like,

1723
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:07,530
listen,
I've paid my dues.

1724
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,680
Like I don't begrudge any of those guys 
who,

1725
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,130
who gets to the point where they just 
say,

1726
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,170
I just don't want to go on the road 
anymore.

1727
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,260
I'm happy with the show.
And you know,

1728
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,840
writing on a show like I,
I totally get that.

1729
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,550
Like if it's all,
you know what it is,

1730
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:25,110
it's like none of it is selling out if 
you're okay with it.

1731
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,440
Right.
What's the other thing?

1732
01:13:26,441 --> 01:13:27,330
Selling out?
It's,

1733
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:28,620
it's an internal thing.
Not,

1734
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:30,870
it's not other people saying it.
It's literally like,

1735
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:35,160
if you're,
if you're not okay with it and you do it

1736
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,650
anyways because of the money,
then you're selling out.

1737
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:39,540
But if you're alright with it and be 
like,

1738
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,470
listen,
I'm married now.

1739
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:43,470
I got a couple of kids.
This is an easy act acting gig.

1740
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,560
I can be here when my kids grow up.
Like that's not selling out.

1741
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,780
It really isn't.
I don't think anyway.

1742
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:53,930
Well,
the only thing that's selling out is if 

1743
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:53,930
you stop doing what you want to do as 
well.

1744
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,870
Like if they come up to you and say,
Bill,

1745
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:55,680
you know,
uh,

1746
01:13:55,700 --> 01:14:00,700
we,
we really liked the way you play drums 

1747
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:00,700
and we want you in the band.
God,

1748
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:03,830
I wish that would happened,
but no talking no more talking for you.

1749
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:06,240
You say you wish that would happen,
but you wouldn't be able to.

1750
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,140
I would just love somebody to compliment
my drama.

1751
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,730
You always want to come like compliments
on your hobby.

1752
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:14,110
Oh,
so much better.

1753
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,610
Oh,
can you say a dentist?

1754
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,740
Damn,
you're a good dentist.

1755
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,200
Done a million of these.
But if you actually just sit there and 

1756
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,200
be like,
why did you build those cabinets?

1757
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,200
Well,
matter of fact,

1758
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,180
I did so true.
The thing that you know,

1759
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:25,900
you suck at,

1760
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,440
it's so true.
Like my pool plane,

1761
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,460
that's probably the worst thing that I 
do.

1762
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,440
But if someone compliments me on my 
pipeline,

1763
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,490
good pool player,
I am,

1764
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:37,150
but I'm not a good pool player for pro.
If I was a professional,

1765
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:42,390
you know,
so for a regular person and they're 

1766
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,390
like,
Whoa,

1767
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,390
fucking Jesus Christ.
What are you?

1768
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,990
A professional.
But a professional said,

1769
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,250
oh,
you play good.

1770
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:46,600
See,
that's why you're so successful.

1771
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:51,810
You're trying to get.
You just don't want to like be able to 

1772
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:51,960
beat the guys down at the,
uh,

1773
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,230
Dave and busters or whatever

1774
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,420
round,
round,

1775
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:56,980
round,
round.

1776
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,530
Round was always bummed.
They never showed the Regal Beagle.

1777
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,580
Yeah.
What the fuck?

1778
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,980
They can't have another set.
How about your anniversary?

1779
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:13,350
I want to see upstairs.
We're talking three's company for the 

1780
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,200
youngsters.
Larry upstairs was crushing it.

1781
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,600
That guy was probably the first herpes 
case.

1782
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,250
What I love about him was he was just so
crushed and ass and didn't,

1783
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:26,490
didn't Karen.
And the character was not considered a 

1784
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:26,490
fence.
It's like that guy exists.

1785
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,460
That's the guy who's never in a 
relationship and he's just,

1786
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:33,760
you know,
chest hair going was the early eighties,

1787
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:34,600
right?
Wasn't it?

1788
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,450
Late seventies and early eighties.
Late seventies,

1789
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,070
early eighties.
I love that show.

1790
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,920
It's a great show.
They were both hot.

1791
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,750
Chrissy and Janet.
What about the middle one?

1792
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,120
I had no problem with any of them.
Which Chrissy was your favorite?

1793
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,920
The first one?
The first one?

1794
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:48,400
Yeah.
Suzanne.

1795
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:49,440
Suzanne somers?
Yeah.

1796
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,010
That's just like a fun person to put 
that sound like a perfect.

1797
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,840
Like I said,
that nobody threw anything at me.

1798
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:00,370
Seems like she'd be fun to do things to 
cook with her.

1799
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,130
She,
she's a perfect,

1800
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:09,150
like almost like the quintessential 
story of someone getting too big for 

1801
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,760
their britches and fucking up in the 
Hollywood though because she was on this

1802
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:16,410
massive hit show and she demanded so 
much like her management and whatever.

1803
01:16:16,411 --> 01:16:21,411
They were trying to squeeze every ounce 
of blood out of the next pharaoh.

1804
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,400
So the show like locked her out.
Like they're like,

1805
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,860
oh yeah,
you're on the phone now.

1806
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:29,190
Like you don't even like they did 
episodes where she would call in.

1807
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,830
Like Chrissy would call in like,
hey guys,

1808
01:16:31,831 --> 01:16:33,210
how you been?
Like they funded.

1809
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:35,760
The writers have writing those.
Oh they must have had so much fun.

1810
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,440
And they got.
They just got rid of her.

1811
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:38,590
Oh,
that's brutal.

1812
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:42,630
And she was fucking basically done.
I mean,

1813
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,310
what was the last thing I did after 
that?

1814
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,230
How great would it legs when she did the
thighmaster?

1815
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:52,050
She's pretty hot,
but I don't think she had legs like 

1816
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:52,080
women's sheriff.
She did that for a minute.

1817
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:55,050
We went today have um,
like muscles,

1818
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:00,380
like there's a women today,
the Doula crossfit and they do like 

1819
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:00,870
weight lifting and shit.
They have like a different shaped them.

1820
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,410
It's more of a midi shape.
She didn't have that back then.

1821
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,160
The seventies bodies.
They look pretty good to me with that.

1822
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:09,980
That I still.
The thing I just

1823
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,760
said it and I forgot it,
but thighmaster thighmaster.

1824
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,260
Yeah.
Spring stupid fucking thing.

1825
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:17,300
Actually be good.
If you were working on your guard,

1826
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:22,750
especially your half card,
like really clamped down with your half 

1827
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,330
card,
why don't you tweak it a little neck 

1828
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:25,330
like you invented it.
That would be a hilarious Joe Rogan.

1829
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:27,470
You just laying on your back,
opening your legs and closing.

1830
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,140
You want to squeeze.
You want to feel it right here.

1831
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,630
This is how you're going to tap right 
here.

1832
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,460
Oh,
oh.

1833
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,520
Oh.
Plus it's good for your pussy muscle.

1834
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,050
Yeah,
it'll be.

1835
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,710
It'll help postop trannies.
Really tighten up the junk.

1836
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,720
Especially.
Tighten up your new thing.

1837
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:46,460
There she is.
Actually.

1838
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,770
She does look very pornographic.
Delicious.

1839
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,040
Oh yeah,
dude,

1840
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,670
that's long socks.
How many cokes spoons?

1841
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:54,980
That's not her dude.
It's lady Gaga.

1842
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,750
It's a fake one.
Oh,

1843
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,430
is that?
If she gets the Suzanne summer thing,

1844
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:01,370
I actually went to her concert.
Leave a dog.

1845
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:05,300
A has a fucking sick body.
Or your mom did a monster.

1846
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,860
What is a monster?
That's a fan.

1847
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,070
If my girl wanted to see it and I went 
there,

1848
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:12,680
I was it.
I kind of ruined it for,

1849
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:14,210
I would say I had eight beers.

1850
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:19,220
I was watching a football game and I 
showed up and we took a cab.

1851
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:24,250
I'm such a jerk and I thought I was 
behaving myself and the next day I was 

1852
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:29,810
like,
she was just had that vibe around me and

1853
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:31,760
I was like,
come on.

1854
01:18:31,761 --> 01:18:32,660
I go.
I wasn't bad.

1855
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:35,120
Last night was I,
and she just kind of gives me a look and

1856
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:36,950
I was like,
I go,

1857
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,900
I was just sitting that she goes,
Bill,

1858
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,650
you screamed Jesus fucking Christ.
I go,

1859
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:47,651
I didn't want you because you did it 
like three times because she kept doing 

1860
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:52,070
this self help horseshit in between 
every song,

1861
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:57,050
every fucking song.
It was just don't worry about.

1862
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,150
We got it,
we got it.

1863
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,780
It's okay to be a freak to sing your 
fucking song.

1864
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:06,110
And then she was sitting at one point 
she goes like,

1865
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:11,111
you know,
I hope you guys are having a good time 

1866
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:11,111
because if you not,
you know,

1867
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:11,540
I don't give a fuck.

1868
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,940
And then people go,
Ooh.

1869
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:13,820
And she goes,
I said,

1870
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:15,560
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck,

1871
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,120
fuck.
Right.

1872
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:17,350
And then she goes through the debt,
the,

1873
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,610
uh,
the backup dancer like,

1874
01:19:19,611 --> 01:19:20,660
trevor,
do you give a fuck?

1875
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:22,730
He's like,
I don't give a fuck.

1876
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And it just kept calling fucking price.
Get on with the not giving a fuck dude.

1877
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:32,750
If you truly don't give a fuck you,
you don't sit around talking about it.

1878
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,180
That's like that jerk off on the play.
Golf,

1879
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:37,400
we get up there,
I'm going to x,

1880
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:38,900
Y,
and Z.

1881
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,820
Even shut up.
I'm trying to go to sleep.

1882
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,800
I got a mask on.

1883
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:47,970
How easy is this going to be?
How long ago was this lady Gaga concert 

1884
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,930
when the Patriots lost in the playoffs,
which is now no means nothing to you.

1885
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,690
We lost to the ravens.
So is that the staple center?

1886
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,670
I totally respect your pretty fucking 
good,

1887
01:19:54,671 --> 01:19:56,230
right?
There's a picture over God.

1888
01:19:56,231 --> 01:19:57,660
Damn,
I totally missed it back.

1889
01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:59,140
She got ass.
No,

1890
01:19:59,141 --> 01:20:00,170
as far as like.
Oh,

1891
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,260
is that Suzanne somers?
Yeah.

1892
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:06,630
Yeah.
They just don't have hair like that 

1893
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,101
anymore.
That like back in the day they didn't 

1894
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:08,101
have leaves back there.
Look at those legs.

1895
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:08,101
Oh,

1896
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:10,080
just delicious.
That's right.

1897
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:15,190
That's the thighmaster.
She mastered it and she's like fucking 

1898
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:15,210
50 something years old now.
It still looks good.

1899
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,090
It's pretty amazing.
I mean not real good.

1900
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:23,091
But like if you were on the walking dead
and you were in the woods with her and 

1901
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:26,160
there was no other checks and to grab 
your deck you would say let's do this.

1902
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:26,920
Oh,
you know,

1903
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,800
I mean she has,
she has the resume,

1904
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:30,920
she has the resume plus.
Yeah.

1905
01:20:30,921 --> 01:20:32,940
It's one you wouldn't want to put.
Who was your.

1906
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:36,030
Who was your when you were in the 
seventies about my age,

1907
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:36,660
right?
Yeah.

1908
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:40,480
So like in the seventies,
like who is the one parent foster.

1909
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:43,040
She just,
it wasn't even close set magazine.

1910
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,880
I mean that poster rather was on 
everybody's wall.

1911
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:49,881
Was Insane.
One Post or one photo and it was on 

1912
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:52,170
literally every fucking wall of every 
adolescent boy all throughout America.

1913
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:53,420
It wasn't girls.
By the way,

1914
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:58,440
you had those posters back then.
You remember that back in those days 

1915
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,790
they had posters of boys.
They didn't have girl idols that they 

1916
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,830
would put on their wall.
Guys had a fucking posters.

1917
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:10,050
Yeah,
something happened along the way and 

1918
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:12,681
girls started having posters of girls on
their walls and guys started having 

1919
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:12,681
posters of guys in there.
Well,

1920
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:13,070
yeah,
that's the

1921
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:19,160
dude.
I remember my dad had the playboy that 

1922
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,601
she was in where she's naked,
but she's sitting with her knees up so 

1923
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:22,601
you can't see anything but you almost 
can't.

1924
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:25,940
I think I was like maybe eight years old
and I was looking through it and I think

1925
01:21:25,941 --> 01:21:27,800
it was the first time.
I mean,

1926
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:30,020
I don't know anything about my body.
I think I had an orgasm,

1927
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:31,880
but nothing came out.
I remember I was looking,

1928
01:21:31,881 --> 01:21:33,800
I was looking at the picture and I just 
kind of went.

1929
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:37,490
I went like that,
that brief thing,

1930
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:42,491
and I was just like,
that's what I hate the fact Teresa 

1931
01:21:42,491 --> 01:21:46,880
stories talking about this.
Like don't you love to be able to go 

1932
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,241
back to that innocent where you could 
look at like a Jordan marsh catalog and 

1933
01:21:49,241 --> 01:21:52,331
you're like,
oh my some secretary skirt below blower 

1934
01:21:52,631 --> 01:21:55,280
knees and just their calves.
You couldn't believe it.

1935
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:57,690
Like I'm a kid.
Imagine touching a woman's calves.

1936
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:00,290
Like you just like,
you just never have that innocence.

1937
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,990
Well again,
that's true.

1938
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:06,510
But guys who don't get laid,
they sort of have that in real life with

1939
01:22:06,511 --> 01:22:07,870
girls.
You know,

1940
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:11,090
when they see a real girl in real life 
that you know,

1941
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,400
at work or at the gym or something like 
that where it's almost like,

1942
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:15,720
oh,
can't believe she's right there.

1943
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:18,350
But if you get laid,
it's just like up yet,

1944
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,920
that's a girl.
She probably wanted me fuck her,

1945
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:20,820
but okay.
Whatever.

1946
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:21,730
Do.
When I was a virgin,

1947
01:22:21,731 --> 01:22:24,310
when a good looking girl talk to me,
my face turned red.

1948
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:31,090
Like it was so overwhelming.
Like you didn't even know what to do.

1949
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,410
You're just like,
oh my God.

1950
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:36,370
Like I don't even know how my body's not
even functioning coco cafe.

1951
01:22:36,371 --> 01:22:40,530
This tastes like the milk at the end of 
cocoa puffs on it.

1952
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,550
And we'll talk in the seventies.
Farrah Fawcett,

1953
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:43,150
Coco milk.

1954
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,580
It's good stuff.
It's Cookeaqua.

1955
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:48,510
It's coconut water and coffee in 
Espresso.

1956
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,030
Espresso when it's fucking delicious.
Delicious.

1957
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,950
Delicious.
Kate Jackson.

1958
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,840
Oh yeah.
On the rookies when she was married to 

1959
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:58,840
Mike Danko.
I wanted to be Mike Danco.

1960
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,280
Who's the chick that was.

1961
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,260
Who's the,
who's the chicken

1962
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,620
that was on?
Uh,

1963
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,500
Tj Hooker.
Oh,

1964
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:08,920
that was the one who has been on 
everything.

1965
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,490
Tommy Lee was married to her.
Uh,

1966
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:11,950
uh,
come on,

1967
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:13,750
guys had a lock earlier.
Had the luck.

1968
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:18,940
Was that her on Tj Hooker?
Was He sure had the luck earlier.

1969
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:23,540
So one of the greatest things that,
one of the greatest like moments ever as

1970
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:24,760
a kid to see them

1971
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,230
manly,
man she is.

1972
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,420
Wow.
She was so young.

1973
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:32,421
Man.
That's so crazy to see what happened to 

1974
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:32,421
that Italian guys that the god from 
dance fever.

1975
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:33,760
Is that Danny Terrio?
Oh yeah.

1976
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:38,940
That guy was that guy.
Who is that who he is or I had to just 

1977
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,060
make that up.
I don't know what's his face.

1978
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,920
Captain Kirk was like,
I want my to pay to look like Denny Day.

1979
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:43,390
Terry.
Yeah.

1980
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,730
He went nutty with his toupee.
You've got a big fuck.

1981
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:47,920
I'm fat thick one that was all curly and
shit.

1982
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,600
I never knew.
It was a Tupac.

1983
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,830
Adrian's a med.
He was the he.

1984
01:23:51,831 --> 01:23:53,680
Yeah,
he was the host of dance fever.

1985
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,650
There was Danny Terrio and then Adrian's
a med.

1986
01:23:56,651 --> 01:23:56,980
Right?

1987
01:23:57,370 --> 01:24:02,370
It is the greatest luck.
When I was like manly moment that I saw 

1988
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,961
at that I wanted to be.
This guy was when Farrah Fawcett did 

1989
01:24:05,961 --> 01:24:05,961
like that.
Two,

1990
01:24:05,961 --> 01:24:09,050
three guests,
guest spot episode on the $6,000,000

1991
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:10,700
man.
You remember that?

1992
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:12,890
And he,
he had like whatever those fucking those

1993
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,920
Jean jackets with the matching slacks,
with the color coming out and this guy 

1994
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,350
could jump over a house,
beat up like 90 guys beat up big foot,

1995
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:26,860
right?
And Punch that guy in the face to make 

1996
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:26,860
his face come off when he fought the 
$7,000,000

1997
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:26,860
man.
You remember that?

1998
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,380
Yes.
Yeah,

1999
01:24:27,381 --> 01:24:29,450
like as I'm making that noise and all 
that.

2000
01:24:29,451 --> 01:24:31,730
And then he got to bang her.
I was just like,

2001
01:24:31,731 --> 01:24:33,530
I want to be this guy.
One of the great.

2002
01:24:33,531 --> 01:24:38,531
Can anybody pull up the clip where he 
fights those guys in the snow and the 

2003
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:42,551
black guy that got them in slow motion 
going into the air like it was right 

2004
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:43,400
when Bruce Lee hit and everyone was 
trying to imitate them.

2005
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:45,680
So the black dude is flying through the 
air going,

2006
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,220
I was doing,
my mind was blown.

2007
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,320
Show us $6,000,000
man,

2008
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,510
dude.
He fights the $7,000,000

2009
01:24:53,511 --> 01:24:55,460
man.
And we're talking about at the bus stop.

2010
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:59,840
It's like there's no way when six,
this guy's got seven.

2011
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:04,220
They get into a fight and a course.
They just build the drama like wrestling

2012
01:25:04,221 --> 01:25:07,400
with a $6,000,000
man is losing and this guy's just so.

2013
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,170
It wasn't powers booth.
Who was the actor.

2014
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:14,171
He's done a bunch of stuff.
He was awesome actor and then finally 

2015
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:15,350
what ends up happening was he punched 
the guy's face off.

2016
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,690
It was like a goalie mask.
It was really bad.

2017
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:22,900
His face comes off and then there's all 
this robotics under there and then he 

2018
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,501
takes the steel girder,
do the like in the Hollywood hills 

2019
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:28,550
filming this thing and he picks up some 
steel girder and just in pails.

2020
01:25:28,551 --> 01:25:33,551
The guy goes right through him.
It was like seeing a rated r movie for 

2021
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:33,551
me.
I couldn't.

2022
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:34,850
I couldn't.
I couldn't believe it.

2023
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,470
Yeah.
Who was the $7,000,000

2024
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:38,480
man I'm looking at.
This guy was in love with this girl.

2025
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:39,770
Who was she?
What was her name?

2026
01:25:39,771 --> 01:25:41,150
Daisy Duke.
Oh,

2027
01:25:41,151 --> 01:25:46,151
Catherine Park.
You know what the worst thing that 

2028
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:46,151
happened to her?
She stayed alive.

2029
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,630
Come on.
Hey,

2030
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,660
come on.
Well,

2031
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,580
I'm saying,
oh,

2032
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:56,730
all the things she did for you.
When you have a bunk bed times a 

2033
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:56,730
motherfucker.
My brother,

2034
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:57,090
I told you I met her.
Remember?

2035
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,030
Yeah.
Didn't she want to.

2036
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:59,500
She want you to pay for a photo?

2037
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:00,950
Yeah,
it was like six years ago.

2038
01:26:00,951 --> 01:26:02,630
She's just sitting there like,
Holy Shit,

2039
01:26:02,631 --> 01:26:05,640
there's tacy tuk right there.
And no one was talking to her.

2040
01:26:05,641 --> 01:26:06,470
Just,
she was just sitting here like,

2041
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:07,580
look,
like she was bored out of her mind.

2042
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:08,780
So I walked up like,
Hey,

2043
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,010
can I,
can I get a photo?

2044
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,520
She's,
yeah,

2045
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:11,270
$10.
I'm like,

2046
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,040
oh no,
I have my own camera.

2047
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:14,270
I just take a photo.
And she goes,

2048
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:15,200
yeah,
it's $10 a month.

2049
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,090
Oh No,
I'm sorry.

2050
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:19,310
Thanks.
Just would've felt.

2051
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,700
Go,
go.

2052
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:24,100
Uh Oh.
Shorts and everything you did.

2053
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:25,840
I hope you get another gig.
You deserve it sweetheart.

2054
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,410
Go get $6,000,000
man versus the $7,000,000

2055
01:26:29,411 --> 01:26:31,030
man.
Go check that out online.

2056
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:35,050
It will pull up a video.
$6,000,000

2057
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:40,051
man versus a $7,000,000
man is one of the most ridiculous 

2058
01:26:40,051 --> 01:26:41,110
fucking things.
I sat down and pajamas.

2059
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:46,150
It's sitting on a beanbag.
Watching that on one of those TV with 

2060
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:47,710
legs.
Just riveted.

2061
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,290
Yeah,
they were racing the $7,000,000

2062
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:55,291
man.
It's just slightly ahead of him in the 

2063
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:55,291
race,
but they're both white,

2064
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:58,800
so during the race everything has to be 
in slow motion because otherwise you 

2065
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,590
wouldn't be able to realize how 
ridiculous it wasn't.

2066
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:02,320
You would think that these fucking guys 
were special at.

2067
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:06,110
He's got the $7,000,000
man just slightly ahead of them.

2068
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:11,400
Steve Austin with his heart and his 
American knowhow just can't quite keep 

2069
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:11,400
up.

2070
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,600
Oscar Goldman,
Rudy.

2071
01:27:12,601 --> 01:27:17,601
I look at that,
look at that because they don't make 

2072
01:27:17,601 --> 01:27:17,601
Harry chess like that.
He won't get that.

2073
01:27:17,601 --> 01:27:20,630
That is classic.
I've banked every broad you've ever 

2074
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:20,630
wanted to

2075
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:22,230
down below the the solar

2076
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,940
flexes too.
If you ever get lead.

2077
01:27:24,941 --> 01:27:28,000
Can you get Lee majors on this podcast?
Is He's still around?

2078
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,580
Yeah.
What is the thing about him?

2079
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:35,650
He's.
He is in a very rare space where he was 

2080
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,320
on three shows that all went to 
syndication.

2081
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,820
Syndication.
He was on the big valley,

2082
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,640
played a cowboy.
He did the $6,000,000

2083
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:45,140
man and then he did the fall guy.
Yeah,

2084
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:47,020
and they all went.
Yeah,

2085
01:27:47,021 --> 01:27:48,190
that's true.
Heather locklear.

2086
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:52,410
I think might have had four different 
shows that want to syndicate.

2087
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:57,570
That went five years.
Like they literally like good luck 

2088
01:27:57,570 --> 01:27:59,941
charm.
So it's just like we got to get this 

2089
01:27:59,941 --> 01:27:59,941
person in this show.
It's gonna.

2090
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:00,160
It's gonna go.
I've done.

2091
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,800
Wasn't the guy who don't.
No,

2092
01:28:01,801 --> 01:28:03,130
no.
He fought a guy with black hair.

2093
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:06,130
This is a different guy.
Maybe this is the first $7,000,000

2094
01:28:06,131 --> 01:28:07,810
man.
Maybe there's more than one.

2095
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,790
I've been on two shows that have been 
syndication.

2096
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,620
I got lucky.
You got,

2097
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:17,650
you need one more,
one more and then you're in that 

2098
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:17,650
rarefied air.
Yeah,

2099
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:18,730
you'll,
you'll do it?

2100
01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:20,230
No,
I don't think so.

2101
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,880
I think I'm done.
I think this,

2102
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:26,970
this is in syndication already already.
Or wondering what kind of show could 

2103
01:28:27,371 --> 01:28:29,320
they learn you back?
I'm doing a new thing.

2104
01:28:29,321 --> 01:28:31,500
I'm not supposed to talk about it 
because I did talk about it and they go.

2105
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,480
I don't know.
But um,

2106
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:38,890
that's the new thing is it's fun.
It's crafty.

2107
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:44,190
It's going to be fun,
but it's a lot of things based on skin 

2108
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:47,070
grafts show.
After that kind of crafty you make 

2109
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:51,850
little octagon with based on lighthouse 
Ufo and big foot and shit.

2110
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:57,650
That's cool.
What do you think about that Garrett 

2111
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:57,650
guy?
The fighter that has down syndrome,

2112
01:28:57,650 --> 01:29:01,280
they.
They've been like showing him on espn 

2113
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:01,620
like crazy and at first I was like,
that's kind of up,

2114
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:03,730
but he's actually pretty good.
I don't know if you.

2115
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:08,870
I haven't seen too much about it.
I've avoided it with because I'm 

2116
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:09,930
terrified that somehow or another it 
would make it into my act.

2117
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:15,050
Right.
Then what about him fighting the 

2118
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:18,531
transgender?
I think the transgender women like men 

2119
01:29:18,531 --> 01:29:22,371
to women should fight transgender women 
to men and we'll see what's the better 

2120
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:22,371
combination

2121
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:25,850
societies should be more acceptable and 
then we'll create a whole new class.

2122
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,770
Trent 20 fights.
Yeah.

2123
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,960
You're not supposed to even say tranny.
Do you know you'll have if

2124
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:36,940
champion fighting out of the blue 
corner.

2125
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,290
There used to be a dude.
Now he's a chair.

2126
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,450
This guy you said he's good.
Yeah.

2127
01:29:47,451 --> 01:29:47,860
Yeah.
I mean,

2128
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,820
the only thing though,
it's like,

2129
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:54,820
I don't like to just like the 
transgender lady thing,

2130
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:58,660
like you don't know if he's 100 percent,
you know,

2131
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,240
like should he be able to fight regular 
people?

2132
01:30:01,241 --> 01:30:01,740
You know,
that's.

2133
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,720
Is He fighting a ball?
A regular guy?

2134
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,400
Yeah.
I think

2135
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:07,200
was,
I think in this video that's a,

2136
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,480
you can find on espn.go.com
is.

2137
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,490
I think he actually fights in this 
video.

2138
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,880
Wow.
And these fighting.

2139
01:30:13,881 --> 01:30:16,190
I'm Stephan Bonner's in his corner and 
everything.

2140
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,680
Yeah.
See,

2141
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:23,830
this is why I can't watch it.
Just immediately start thinking of bits 

2142
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:24,970
and she's not in the fight.
She's just commentating scar right here.

2143
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:30,150
Get out of the fight but a duty look at.
He's got a black eye and stuff did that 

2144
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:32,500
to him.
This guy right here,

2145
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,030
this is what's going on right here.

2146
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:34,680
Oh,
okay.

2147
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:39,681
So he got fucking power doubled quick.
Well I would think that his reaction 

2148
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:42,610
time would be not so good.
Yeah.

2149
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:46,200
I would be concerned that you're gonna,
you know,

2150
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:47,860
he'd be do more damage.
Like I don't,

2151
01:30:47,861 --> 01:30:48,480
I don't.
Yeah,

2152
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:50,260
no it's true.
Not Dr.

2153
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:52,030
Berg here thinks that,

2154
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,170
I mean it is something to consider.

2155
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,870
You just got to be another kid out there
with the same thing and then they can go

2156
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,030
at it and he got it.
He Kinda,

2157
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,150
you can't,
you can't,

2158
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,470
you can't do this.

2159
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:08,260
They're finding so much fucked up about.
He got manhandled man.

2160
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,630
You could see like the way that guy 
threw him to the ground,

2161
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,650
like as a good grappler.
I think um,

2162
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:14,440
there's,
there's,

2163
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:19,620
they're showing a lot of studies now 
more than ever about brain damage and 

2164
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,390
fighting.
And if you already have an issue,

2165
01:31:22,391 --> 01:31:23,710
I would,
I would say like,

2166
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:25,560
just get involved in Jujitsu.
Go,

2167
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,270
go grapple.
You really want to train and compete.

2168
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,990
Jujitsu is fine.
You can,

2169
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:35,020
you can have like really intense high 
level competition and you don't get hit 

2170
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,410
in the head getting hit in the head band
unless you want to fight for a living,

2171
01:31:38,411 --> 01:31:40,510
unless you want to be a professional 
fighter.

2172
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:43,030
I don't advise getting hit in the head 
at all,

2173
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:46,510
but it's good to learn.
It's good to train.

2174
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:51,750
And if you can learn from people that 
you trust when you don't hit each other 

2175
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:55,591
full blast,
like you kick hard to the body and to 

2176
01:31:55,591 --> 01:31:56,590
the head and you just punched like soft 
to the face.

2177
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,010
They say that guy is a monster tattoo 
monster energy todd to

2178
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,240
yeah,
maybe.

2179
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:06,241
Maybe they're pretty much evenly,
evenly matched because it's shitty 

2180
01:32:06,241 --> 01:32:07,670
choices.
Yeah.

2181
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,930
It's um,
well,

2182
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,560
it looks like he was all happy that he 
fought.

2183
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:12,490
You know,
I mean,

2184
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:14,350
he can't,
can't take that away from him.

2185
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:19,050
Just the problem with fighting is the 
real problem is that you're,

2186
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,030
you know,
you're,

2187
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:25,710
you're fighting on credit,
you're essentially finding on brand 

2188
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:27,920
credits and are you willing to go out 
there and throw them in and you know and

2189
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,890
see what happens.
But when you're getting tagged,

2190
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:31,900
you owe that later.
You owe that.

2191
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:33,810
It's going to come back.
It's going to come back with interest.

2192
01:32:33,811 --> 01:32:38,811
Am I come back six years from now,
five years from now I've met guys 

2193
01:32:38,811 --> 01:32:43,140
knowing them,
knowing them when they were fine and 

2194
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:43,140
then seeing them fucked up.
And it's not just one.

2195
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:47,640
It's weird to see when you know a guy 
for 10 years and then you talked to him,

2196
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:49,990
you see him like looking around.
He doesn't know where he is.

2197
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,110
He's fucking slurring his words.
It sounds like was hammered.

2198
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:57,610
It's weird because the sound drunk 
because it'll sound like a drunk.

2199
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,010
Like that's how they sound.
They sound like a guy who's just.

2200
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,720
Oh No.
Yeah.

2201
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:03,340
And it's just from taking shots.

2202
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:06,110
Yeah.
They say like nfl football,

2203
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:09,050
you know,
there's people predicting that it's just

2204
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:14,080
going to not exist.
Like at least in the form I have the 

2205
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,830
solution you got.
You got to go back to leather helmets.

2206
01:33:15,831 --> 01:33:20,831
Yes.
You just go back to that and you bring 

2207
01:33:20,831 --> 01:33:20,831
all the equipment now.
I mean this isn't like,

2208
01:33:20,831 --> 01:33:25,720
this is like A.
I'm Don Cherry talked about that in the 

2209
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,780
NHL.
What used to wear like these spongy pads

2210
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:28,150
when you played hockey,
you know,

2211
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:33,220
just get the pads I used to wear when 
you played sports now they like this 

2212
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:36,500
hard plastic and I just took up the game
and it's like dude,

2213
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,780
I've,
I've fallen on the ice with nothing.

2214
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,840
And if you feel like in my age I get hit
by a truck,

2215
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:42,990
you get all the equipment.
All,

2216
01:33:42,991 --> 01:33:43,880
dude,
it's hilarious.

2217
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:45,980
It's just you like,
you'll feel like your Robo cop,

2218
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,560
you just fall down and nothing hurts.
Now you get these guys.

2219
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:52,070
Were they how fast they can skate like 
25 miles an hour or something.

2220
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,010
And they come by and they catch you with
that hard piece of plastic.

2221
01:33:55,011 --> 01:33:57,440
It's like getting hit with a wrench.
Like I saw a guy,

2222
01:33:57,441 --> 01:34:00,740
a mark severity got hit as he was 
falling through on a shot,

2223
01:34:00,741 --> 01:34:04,490
got hit.
He spun around 180 degrees and came back

2224
01:34:04,491 --> 01:34:07,970
and he's never been back.
One hit really?

2225
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,930
One hit.
Yeah Dude.

2226
01:34:08,931 --> 01:34:09,200
I mean

2227
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:10,730
it hasn't been back Canon

2228
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:14,680
right in the jaw.
And he spun around like obviously got an

2229
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:15,780
A.
I mean,

2230
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:18,340
I don't know,
Shit like a high level concussion.

2231
01:34:18,341 --> 01:34:20,630
He was a phenomenal player.
And uh,

2232
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:26,100
so people are saying we got to go back 
to that because I like the pad you had 

2233
01:34:26,951 --> 01:34:28,900
when you were younger,
like you hit stuff,

2234
01:34:28,901 --> 01:34:30,700
you still felt it,
you know.

2235
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:32,300
And then the pads would start to wear 
out,

2236
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:33,520
but you know,
towards the season,

2237
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:34,660
you know,
and it would hurt.

2238
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:36,970
But now it's just like that,
this stuff,

2239
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:41,250
it's so incredible if like I play 
obviously non contact,

2240
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,150
so it's great.
So if you fall down,

2241
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:45,750
you don't hurt yourself.
But um,

2242
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,360
the stuff in like the Nhl they're 
talking about that they're talking about

2243
01:34:49,361 --> 01:34:52,360
like in the NFL,
like having guys starting from like sort

2244
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:54,910
of like a stand up position with the 
hands out because they,

2245
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:58,000
every place I cannot bone,
they're just slamming heads together.

2246
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:01,360
Um,
repeatedly when you play the whole game,

2247
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,940
you got like whatever,
I don't know,

2248
01:35:03,941 --> 01:35:05,290
40,
50 plays,

2249
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,440
you slammed your head into another guy's
had 50 times,

2250
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:11,920
just that game and then you play 16 
games.

2251
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:18,180
Wow.
Now this is beyond my fucking 

2252
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:18,180
capabilities.
16 Times

2253
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:18,180
anyway.

2254
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,280
You're getting hit in the head a lot.
Yeah,

2255
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:22,840
yeah,
yeah.

2256
01:35:22,841 --> 01:35:25,560
People are realizing that,
you know,

2257
01:35:25,561 --> 01:35:27,010
when,
when football came around,

2258
01:35:27,011 --> 01:35:32,011
when it became popular,
but the amount of data that they had on 

2259
01:35:32,011 --> 01:35:33,130
brain trauma and to what they have 
today,

2260
01:35:33,131 --> 01:35:34,990
it's,
it's pretty minimal.

2261
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:40,230
You know,
now we have a sort of accurate view of 

2262
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:40,230
the landscape and we know like,
okay,

2263
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:40,930
yeah,
you're taking a fucking serious chances,

2264
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:41,040
right?

2265
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,000
The helmet.
What it does is it really,

2266
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:47,690
it protects beyond a certain hit.
All it's doing is protecting the skull.

2267
01:35:47,691 --> 01:35:52,691
You won't get a dented skull but like 
your brain is just getting sloshed 

2268
01:35:52,691 --> 01:35:55,640
around so somebody has to come up with 
something.

2269
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:59,270
I don't know how big would that be or it
can kinda like,

2270
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:01,280
like your head just sits in there and 
you just

2271
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,140
the,
the hellman moves around.

2272
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,000
Do you know what video I watched 
recently?

2273
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:10,001
I'm like,
I have such a poor science background 

2274
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,001
and just started like,
like science is like,

2275
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,001
it's incredible.
Right?

2276
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,810
What was that

2277
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:13,940
dumbest thing I've ever heard?
I'm just such a moron.

2278
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:20,570
Can I leave on that day?
That was the dumbest fucking incredible.

2279
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:25,840
I'm going to go out on a limb and say 
that is the dumbest thing I'm going to 

2280
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,561
say this year.
I really hope that that was the low 

2281
01:36:29,561 --> 01:36:30,010
point.
That's where you're leaving and going to

2282
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:35,020
be fun.
Science is like really incredible cut.

2283
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,180
Have that bill on more often.
That was just so.

2284
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,360
It's super neat.
No,

2285
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:43,320
I was just watching this thing on 
gyroscopes when I was a kid.

2286
01:36:43,321 --> 01:36:45,720
They would call tops and he just spun 
him and stared at them.

2287
01:36:45,721 --> 01:36:47,210
They weren't telling you what was going 
on.

2288
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:52,240
This guy gets this gyroscope going and 
he puts it on like a cone and it's on 

2289
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:56,601
the side and in my world it's defying 
gravity and it's just going around this 

2290
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:58,330
thing and I don't get how it works.
I don't get what's going on.

2291
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,440
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of that out there.

2292
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:04,560
If you just.
Did I explain it bad?

2293
01:37:04,561 --> 01:37:05,560
You were just kinda like.
Yeah.

2294
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,950
I don't know what a gyroscope.
What does it look?

2295
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,850
Look up.
Gyroscope.

2296
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,260
Okay.
I know what a gyroscope is.

2297
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:15,430
It,
it's because it's like seventh grade 

2298
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:15,430
talking about sex.
You know what that means?

2299
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:15,990
Yeah.
I know what it means.

2300
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:18,240
Um,
what is it?

2301
01:37:18,241 --> 01:37:21,270
Just the momentum a gyroscope.
So what's in those?

2302
01:37:21,271 --> 01:37:22,560
Um,
those,

2303
01:37:22,561 --> 01:37:23,820
uh,
segways.

2304
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:25,230
That's a gyroscope.
Yeah.

2305
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:28,590
I think it's in a helicopter.
I think it's in a helicopter.

2306
01:37:28,591 --> 01:37:33,591
Makes Sense.
I mean that it would balance out the 

2307
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:33,591
helicopter.
Well,

2308
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:33,990
I finally figured I finally read.
I didn't figure it out.

2309
01:37:33,991 --> 01:37:36,390
They told me like I'm discovering 
helicopters.

2310
01:37:36,391 --> 01:37:41,391
So that back thing,
that back road or is to prevent the 

2311
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:41,820
thing from spinning around.
Yeah.

2312
01:37:41,821 --> 01:37:44,560
That's why when it gets shot and movies,
the fucking helicopters.

2313
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:49,730
I saw that and I didn't realize it that 
that's what that things function was 

2314
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,130
understanding of helicopter Gyro.
No,

2315
01:37:53,131 --> 01:37:53,370
no,
no.

2316
01:37:53,371 --> 01:37:54,600
Just,
just look up gyroscopes.

2317
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:55,560
You gotta see this guy?

2318
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:56,730
What?
What,

2319
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:59,610
what am I looking for?
Just a gyroscope.

2320
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:01,260
Okay.
This guy,

2321
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:01,920
I sweated.
God,

2322
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:06,921
he's going to do something that's a 
better magic trick that I've ever seen 

2323
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:06,921
anybody doing vegas.
It's just chairs.

2324
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:08,640
Scope on youtube of the little tiny 
thing.

2325
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,520
Let me see this.
Let's go this fresh face.

2326
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,660
Alright,
this guy right here.

2327
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,150
Now that's not it.
God Damn.

2328
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:17,340
Is that what you're saying?
Son of a bitch.

2329
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:22,810
A.
The reason why you can do it because 

2330
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:22,830
it's going so fast.
So it's pushing down.

2331
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:27,850
You know,
because gravity so like you could have 

2332
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:27,850
like on the side of a can or something 
like that.

2333
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:31,500
This fast and I hang on you guys say 
something funny is this is coming up.

2334
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,840
The first one just wondering.
Here we go.

2335
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:38,160
Farish scope.
It's online.

2336
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,540
It's up there,
Bill.

2337
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,050
Oh,
it is?

2338
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:40,560
Yeah.
Look.

2339
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:44,250
All right,
so what you want to be is get to.

2340
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:44,920
Okay.
Oh,

2341
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:46,350
I see what you're saying right here.
Yeah.

2342
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:51,351
Get to about a minute.
Forty in somebody for the love of God 

2343
01:38:51,351 --> 01:38:51,351
explained that.

2344
01:38:51,351 --> 01:38:51,351
Tell me how that works out.
I'll fuck.

2345
01:38:51,351 --> 01:38:52,280
Does that happen?
Oh,

2346
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:57,290
that's it's balancing and it's spinning 
around in a circle and it's not hitting 

2347
01:38:57,290 --> 01:39:00,700
the floor until it runs out of momentum.
Spinning,

2348
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:02,470
gyroscope,
bullet balance on a string.

2349
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:04,710
Wow.
Look at that.

2350
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,510
That's amazing dude.
That is magic to me.

2351
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:10,990
Well that's why those segways work 
somehow or another.

2352
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:12,570
Yeah.
I don't understand.

2353
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,300
I just love that.
This,

2354
01:39:13,301 --> 01:39:16,570
the technology of that and then some 
dumb ass like me can get on one like,

2355
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:20,220
well,
slam into a wall with a looped around.

2356
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:25,240
One is thinking about a phone,
you know that you use every day and 

2357
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,130
nobody knew.
If I'm ever out of like if there's a 

2358
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:29,140
power outage,
I'm getting one of these.

2359
01:39:29,141 --> 01:39:31,990
If I have to entertain guests and I'm 
just going to start spinning this thing,

2360
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,590
this lava rock right there,
people are gonna be blown away.

2361
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:36,190
Like,
look at it.

2362
01:39:36,610 --> 01:39:38,890
You could start a car caused the power 
outage.

2363
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:42,220
There's got to be done within me that 
would actually buy into it.

2364
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,180
Oh,
for sure.

2365
01:39:43,181 --> 01:39:45,790
Have you ever watched videos?
It is pretty amazing.

2366
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,880
It is pretty amazing.
What does it have to do with space?

2367
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:50,830
Hmm?
Do I swear to God?

2368
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:53,320
You could actually see how dumb the 
average person is.

2369
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:54,820
Like I consider myself an average 
person.

2370
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:56,190
You'd go to a bar with one of those 
things.

2371
01:39:56,191 --> 01:40:00,040
They literally like five bucks and you 
could just like blow minds with the

2372
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:01,550
just blah.
You're like,

2373
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,570
wait,
fuck you.

2374
01:40:02,571 --> 01:40:04,430
Is anybody ever gotten laid because of a
gyroscope?

2375
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,290
You do it.
If you're wearing a cape and you show it

2376
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:10,820
in that thing,
it's over with a big point.

2377
01:40:10,821 --> 01:40:15,821
You read things like Dracula and then 
you know you do when they ask you 

2378
01:40:15,821 --> 01:40:16,110
questions.
As you delay for a second and staring at

2379
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:18,770
them like your mysterious,
like Ryan gosling and drive,

2380
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,150
I can tell you.
Yeah.

2381
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:21,920
Ryan gosling and drive.
He did that.

2382
01:40:21,921 --> 01:40:23,320
He did let that delay thing and you're 
like,

2383
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:24,830
mind fucked.
You like what's going on?

2384
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:26,330
What's what's happening here?
Yeah.

2385
01:40:26,331 --> 01:40:28,280
He did the broken guy thing like 
[inaudible].

2386
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,290
Sky's broken.
Oh yeah.

2387
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:33,260
That's kind of emphasis and completely 
still.

2388
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:35,360
I owe him an apology.
I completely stole all of that.

2389
01:40:35,361 --> 01:40:37,310
On that flight to indy.
I was just like,

2390
01:40:37,311 --> 01:40:38,570
I'm going to do what Ryan gosling 
window.

2391
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:44,230
I'm going to have this look on my face 
like I just got done fucking your wife 

2392
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:44,230
and there's nothing you can

2393
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,380
you

2394
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,260
and I handled that much differently.
I would have.

2395
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:51,250
I would have told the flight lady,
I would have been the one son,

2396
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:56,300
please.
You got to get this guy off the fucking 

2397
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:56,300
planet.
Like something's going on right now.

2398
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,220
I wouldn't be able to fall asleep next 
to their fucking lawyer,

2399
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:00,370
schizo or autistic or something like 
that.

2400
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:04,200
Maybe these ratios to get to to another.
Like he wasn't good.

2401
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,460
I just,
you know,

2402
01:41:05,461 --> 01:41:07,150
just like no.
When you never 100 percent.

2403
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:12,151
No,
I just knew he wasn't going to do 

2404
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:12,151
anything and I knew if I didn't I was 
sort of feeding it.

2405
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:14,410
I was being a dick.
I was being a dick.

2406
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:19,770
But um,
tell me actually said a great thing 

2407
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:23,101
when,
when he came around you should have 

2408
01:41:23,101 --> 01:41:23,101
invited them to your show.
That would have been great.

2409
01:41:23,101 --> 01:41:23,410
They said you should've given them 
tickets.

2410
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:28,680
Wish the old school.
We actually had tickets opened up and 

2411
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,260
talked about it on stage.
I did open with it that night.

2412
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,640
Did you really?
Yeah,

2413
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:35,641
but I was still kind of weirded out by 
it so it kind of came out as creepy 

2414
01:41:35,641 --> 01:41:35,641
rather than.
So I just was like,

2415
01:41:35,641 --> 01:41:35,800
all right,
this is,

2416
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:37,510
this is more of a podcast story.
So,

2417
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,860
and here we are.
What percentage of your,

2418
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:42,740
uh,
your crowds in our podcast crowds,

2419
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:45,740
like people know you from the podcast?
I have no idea when you say

2420
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,730
response,
but I think that they're,

2421
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:53,010
it's like they're into the specialist 
there into the podcast and thing.

2422
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:53,850
You just,
it's great man.

2423
01:41:53,851 --> 01:41:55,950
You just carve out your own little store
on the Internet.

2424
01:41:56,490 --> 01:42:01,490
This is me.
This is what I do feel like it come on 

2425
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:01,490
out.
And uh,

2426
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,300
and then all you do is you just never 
fuck them.

2427
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:06,570
You always come out with a new hour and 
you never take a show off.

2428
01:42:06,571 --> 01:42:08,520
You just don't fuck them because that's 
the relationship.

2429
01:42:08,521 --> 01:42:13,521
When they say they love you,
it's basically I love you until you 

2430
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:13,521
suck.
Don't fuck me.

2431
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:13,980
That's basically it because we don't 
know each other.

2432
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:16,200
So I understand the responsibility of 
that.

2433
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:19,810
And I always try to have good openers.
I just want the wire to wire.

2434
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:22,260
Good show you came out.
Good time.

2435
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,230
Go out there fucking take pictures.
Kissing babies,

2436
01:42:25,231 --> 01:42:26,370
shaking hands.
It's great.

2437
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:29,310
I really like afterwards,
uh,

2438
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:34,370
at first I didn't like going out there 
but that was more my awkwardness and 

2439
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:36,090
then like my issues with that shit.
But now I've actually,

2440
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,670
I kind of know as honestly not like 
super trump.

2441
01:42:38,671 --> 01:42:39,880
Those people,
you know,

2442
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:42,270
like it was like a motor boat and your 
face just spitting

2443
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,400
and they're like complimenting uses,
like spitting in your face.

2444
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:50,070
Like that becomes.
And then it's like,

2445
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:50,440
you know,

2446
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:56,130
I have the exact same attitude,
the exact same attitude about the 

2447
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:58,921
audience,
like the camp fuck 'em and you gotta 

2448
01:42:58,921 --> 01:42:58,921
keep,
keep giving them a free shit.

2449
01:42:58,921 --> 01:42:59,170
That's why I love keeping the podcast 
free.

2450
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:00,940
That's why I love,
you know,

2451
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:02,410
the,
the,

2452
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:07,470
the idea that you're always going to 
have them there as long as you keep 

2453
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:08,470
providing good content,
you keep coming up with new material

2454
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:12,010
and you can't expect anything more on it
because I've done the same thing.

2455
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:17,280
I love bands in the eighties and then 
they started to suck and I never bought 

2456
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,270
any more of their albums.
So am I really a fast?

2457
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:21,310
Like I like you when you do good stuff.
I like it when you do stuff.

2458
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:21,770
I like,

2459
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:27,780
I have a,
I had a big fear of that when I was 

2460
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:32,050
first coming up that uh,
that guy's sort of seemed to have it and

2461
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:34,840
then lose it.
And there's a lot of guys that fall into

2462
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,900
that category that were really funny at 
first and then lost it,

2463
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:39,790
including contemporaries that I won't 
mention.

2464
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,420
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings,
but as far as dead guys,

2465
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:45,040
Kennison was my favorite example of 
that.

2466
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,880
Kennison I think in like 86,
87 was the greatest guy ever.

2467
01:43:48,881 --> 01:43:50,600
I think it was one of the funniest 
comics ever ever.

2468
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:52,250
And then when I came along

2469
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,620
and I came along and Ada,
that's more like,

2470
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:57,980
like three all time behind,
like prior and then,

2471
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,560
you know,
his body of work or a bill cosby.

2472
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:03,110
I mean you just have to like,
it's all subjective,

2473
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:05,370
but I don't.
I put Carlin,

2474
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,270
I mean a lot of people would be pissed 
at me for this,

2475
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:12,000
but I put Carlin like fourth.
What's the fourth?

2476
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,240
All time and me,
somebody's going to get mad man,

2477
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:16,800
you know,
you put Hixon for the coral.

2478
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:18,820
And because Hinduism is funny.
Um,

2479
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:24,640
I think Hicks had this sort of 
groundbreaking sort of new take on 

2480
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:29,051
standup that inspired so many other 
people to sort of like branch down that 

2481
01:44:29,051 --> 01:44:31,160
path that I always put him right up 
there.

2482
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,350
Yeah.
And it's also like a bad thing.

2483
01:44:32,351 --> 01:44:37,351
Some people like rush and neil part,
some people like led Zepplin and John 

2484
01:44:37,351 --> 01:44:37,930
Bonham and that thing that happened.
But who cares as long as you're in,

2485
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,370
you just want to be in the argument.

2486
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,320
Yeah.
For me it's prior,

2487
01:44:41,321 --> 01:44:42,310
all time,
number one,

2488
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:43,360
buyers,
number one.

2489
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:48,680
Um,
and then it's Kennison and then Hicks 

2490
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,100
and then um,
then Carla,

2491
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,020
but there's a through line to that,
that order.

2492
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,490
That makes sense to me.
Like I could see that,

2493
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:55,410
that obviously,
I mean,

2494
01:44:55,411 --> 01:44:58,470
I know that you do stand up obviously,
but like there's like that order.

2495
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:00,570
I like if I just saw someone listed like
that,

2496
01:45:00,571 --> 01:45:01,170
I'd be like,
okay,

2497
01:45:01,171 --> 01:45:03,450
this guy,
he likes this style,

2498
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:08,460
you know what I mean?
Like Kennison is,

2499
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:12,810
is like if he had just come out the 
other side where like,

2500
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,480
it seemed like he,
uh,

2501
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:20,640
like just fell into every pitfall.
Stepped in every batch alcohol,

2502
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:22,500
the whole thing.
Lazy.

2503
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,380
Like in [inaudible] 86.
Like,

2504
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,460
I mean that was one of the,
you know,

2505
01:45:26,461 --> 01:45:29,820
his first letterman spot,
dude is fucking unbelief.

2506
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:34,850
Just the vibe in the studio.
You can feel it like we have no idea 

2507
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:34,850
what this guy is going to do.
Man,

2508
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,930
this guy and he came out and did not 
disappoint.

2509
01:45:36,931 --> 01:45:41,931
But if you look at the difference 
between the first one and the second 

2510
01:45:41,931 --> 01:45:43,761
one,
it's already starting like whatever he 

2511
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:45,681
was going through.
But I remember when he got all cleaned 

2512
01:45:45,681 --> 01:45:45,681
up and he was getting.
He was coming back.

2513
01:45:45,681 --> 01:45:47,400
It was really like the Stevie Ray 
Vaughan thing.

2514
01:45:47,401 --> 01:45:51,480
Like he just got all cleaned up,
turn in and around in his life.

2515
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:52,470
Oh my God,
I can't.

2516
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,170
Even when he died,
they found cocaine.

2517
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:56,070
The system,
it was never really cleaned up.

2518
01:45:56,370 --> 01:45:58,740
La Wasn't,
could claim to be cleaning up,

2519
01:45:58,741 --> 01:46:03,741
but it wasn't clear that though,
because I know I know everything about 

2520
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:04,320
them.
I mean it's first of all,

2521
01:46:04,321 --> 01:46:05,670
his brother,
I read his book,

2522
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:09,840
read his brother's book and talked to 
will always kill my theories with facts.

2523
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:12,700
He was

2524
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,510
that a guy the other day about,
dude,

2525
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,750
you know,
and you were standing on stage,

2526
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:16,900
you were getting booed.
And I,

2527
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:18,690
and I,
it just was like,

2528
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:24,260
you know,
that really inspired me and you stood 

2529
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:24,420
there and the dude was just like,
yeah,

2530
01:46:24,421 --> 01:46:25,850
I was so high.
I didn't even hear the boom.

2531
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,280
Yes.

2532
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:32,950
Let me have that fantasy.
The fantasy

2533
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:40,020
me,
my fantasy version of who you are that 

2534
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:40,020
he didn't give a fuck.
Oh,

2535
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:42,320
that crushed me.
I got to see,

2536
01:46:42,321 --> 01:46:47,321
um,
kinison as I was an open mic or like as 

2537
01:46:47,321 --> 01:46:50,070
I was starting out,
I got to see him live at least twice,

2538
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,110
I think only twice,
but at least twice.

2539
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,560
Um,
and uh,

2540
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,470
a fucking sucked.
Both Times.

2541
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,800
The was better than him.
It doesn't even make any sense.

2542
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,000
Carla blow,
uh,

2543
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,630
who opened his opening act was funnier,
more energetic,

2544
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:04,820
better,
better material.

2545
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:07,770
I actually had material kinison was 
cheerleading by then.

2546
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,010
It was already over by 89.
It was already over.

2547
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,740
He would go up and he would,
uh,

2548
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:15,950
he would do like this cheerleading thing
about like drinking and drive.

2549
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:16,800
We got to do it.

2550
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,150
Who got drag?
Who?

2551
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,940
God,
we're going to pull it off because we do

2552
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:22,470
it every fucking.
Yeah.

2553
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:22,640
Yeah.

2554
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:25,650
But it was,
there was no jokes,

2555
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:30,680
the jokes were gone,
like all the shit about the African 

2556
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:30,680
children,
like why don't you feed them.

2557
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,350
You're right.
But it's not like you don't lose that.

2558
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:37,410
He just,
he was adjusting and right as he was 

2559
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,860
coming out of it evidently still was 
coming a bit according to you.

2560
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:43,890
Like I would have loved to have seen 
what that guy was going to do because,

2561
01:47:43,901 --> 01:47:44,370
uh,

2562
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:47,340
I don't think he was done.
And this is why I think it was done.

2563
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:49,440
I think you can only do coke for so 
long.

2564
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,240
You're crushing me here.
I'm sorry.

2565
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:56,400
I can,
I handle the hold on my dream that he 

2566
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:56,400
would have come back and he would have 
been in 45,

2567
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,260
gotten on some fucking Kale shakes,
started doing hill sprints and shed.

2568
01:47:59,261 --> 01:48:04,261
But do you know Kennison his story?
His life story is a fascinating one 

2569
01:48:04,261 --> 01:48:06,070
because he was a normal kid until he got
hit by a truck.

2570
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,670
He got hit by a truck and you know,
he,

2571
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,990
he suffered like some sort of a 
traumatic brain injury.

2572
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:14,770
And after that became reckless.
It was just wild as fuck.

2573
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:19,800
It was like a completely different kid.
It was like Kennison wanting Kennison 

2574
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,280
too,
and Kennison one was like a normal 

2575
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,950
average seven minutes.
He got cracked and he got hurt real bad 

2576
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:29,620
and from then he was reckless.
Just wild,

2577
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:32,220
you know,
and he did a lot of crazy shit man.

2578
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:37,340
And if you look back at his life,
like his impulse control was like 

2579
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,170
nonexistent.
I mean he fucked Carla Bose wife.

2580
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:42,140
Carla boat was opening right.
There was carl talks about it.

2581
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:46,810
I wouldn't say it any other work.
This carl found,

2582
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:50,500
Carl found out that his daughter's 
father,

2583
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:56,100
he thought it was his daughter and it 
was just fucking Sam Kennison who's his 

2584
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:56,100
best friend the whole time.
Yeah,

2585
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:57,820
the whole craziness,
man.

2586
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,160
Crazy.
Yeah.

2587
01:48:59,170 --> 01:49:03,580
You hate to see that.
But I learned a lot watching them.

2588
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:08,610
First of all,
I learned in the beginning what was 

2589
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:08,610
possible when I saw him,
his first HBO special specials.

2590
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:09,340
Like there's the grants committee I've 
ever seen.

2591
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:11,810
I couldn't believe this is even comedy.
Like I couldn't believe,

2592
01:49:11,811 --> 01:49:14,050
like someone figured out this new way of
doing comedy.

2593
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:17,740
But then to see him just become really 
shitty after that,

2594
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:18,400
I was like,
wow,

2595
01:49:18,401 --> 01:49:23,401
that can happen.
Like you need to know that that can 

2596
01:49:23,401 --> 01:49:23,401
happen.

2597
01:49:23,401 --> 01:49:23,401
I think you've been to water and the 
guy.

2598
01:49:23,401 --> 01:49:23,780
Really?
Yeah,

2599
01:49:23,781 --> 01:49:28,781
because he died prematurely.
You're talking about like he's still 

2600
01:49:28,781 --> 01:49:30,350
alive in the nineties.
He died in the nineties.

2601
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,000
Dude,
I'm older than he was when he died.

2602
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:33,150
Yeah.
So yeah,

2603
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:34,010
no,
I mean like,

2604
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:39,430
you know,
I'm just saying like he was pulling 

2605
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:39,430
himself out of the mud and then he,
he,

2606
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:41,720
he died.
So it's like,

2607
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:47,260
it just gets cut off.
So you have no idea you'd given them a 

2608
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:47,260
break because he's dead.
I see what you're doing.

2609
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:47,340
Yes.
Am.

2610
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:47,890
Because

2611
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,070
it's like your making it seem like those
last few years,

2612
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:52,750
that's what,
that's all he was going to be.

2613
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,700
You can't say that.

2614
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:56,950
Well your podcast,
you're right.

2615
01:49:56,951 --> 01:49:58,880
No,
it's possible that he could come back.

2616
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:00,740
There was no evidence that he was coming
back.

2617
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:03,120
The material that he was doing was shit.
It was,

2618
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:08,150
it was just poorly thought out.
It was like he never sat in front of a 

2619
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:08,380
fucking notebook and actually wrote it 
out anymore.

2620
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:10,880
You didn't.
Didn't tighten things up and.

2621
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:11,480
Right,
right.

2622
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:12,520
You're killing.
I'm sorry.

2623
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:13,570
He's my favorite.
He's,

2624
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:18,020
I mean he's right up there with John 
Bonham was your favorite drama?

2625
01:50:18,021 --> 01:50:20,310
Would you talk about those 52 shots of 
vodka?

2626
01:50:20,311 --> 01:50:21,490
A tuck.
I'm telling you

2627
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,770
was so big.
He couldn't get over to the floor.

2628
01:50:24,771 --> 01:50:26,180
Tom Say he had.
He had a floor.

2629
01:50:26,181 --> 01:50:27,020
Tom as a rack.
Tom,

2630
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:28,700
because he was so fat he couldn't get 
around.

2631
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,040
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what you just said.

2632
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:35,090
There's allegedly.
He had a 15 inch rack,

2633
01:50:35,091 --> 01:50:36,020
Tom,
by the end of it.

2634
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:37,430
What's that mean?
Gigantic.

2635
01:50:37,431 --> 01:50:38,930
It's usually see sing,
sing,

2636
01:50:38,931 --> 01:50:43,931
sing.
When the guy plays bumped down to dump 

2637
01:50:43,931 --> 01:50:45,970
down on the floor,
that's a Florida guy allegedly was so 

2638
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:47,480
fucking fat.
He couldn't get around to them,

2639
01:50:47,481 --> 01:50:51,190
so he just this giant fucking through 
an.

2640
01:50:51,191 --> 01:50:53,240
He's younger.
When he was younger,

2641
01:50:53,241 --> 01:50:58,241
he's doing is,
he's still in his triplets and he would 

2642
01:50:58,241 --> 01:50:58,880
do this thing where it was just like 
kick left,

2643
01:50:58,881 --> 01:51:00,050
right?
And then it was boom,

2644
01:51:00,051 --> 01:51:02,470
boom,
and then cross over and then back and it

2645
01:51:02,471 --> 01:51:06,170
was,
and we did it like a 90 miles an hour.

2646
01:51:06,171 --> 01:51:09,160
You see them at Royal Albert Hall at the
height of his powers.

2647
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:11,210
Dude,
unbelievable drummer.

2648
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:14,630
And then as he got older,
like his finance was,

2649
01:51:14,690 --> 01:51:16,160
was incredible.
Like he didn't,

2650
01:51:16,161 --> 01:51:17,040
he didn't,
uh,

2651
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:21,050
like he didn't have to do all that to 
get the same kind of power and a.

2652
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:24,470
But what people would do is they know 
that people like trashed,

2653
01:51:24,471 --> 01:51:29,471
like getting off the subject here.
People like what you're doing at 

2654
01:51:29,471 --> 01:51:29,471
Kennison.
They kind of did the bottom of people.

2655
01:51:29,471 --> 01:51:29,471
No,
listen,

2656
01:51:29,471 --> 01:51:30,360
I'm not,
I'm just telling the truth.

2657
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:35,100
He fucked up and it's good for any young
guy to sit are out of this.

2658
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:40,160
And a young comic,
I think it's important to see that 

2659
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:41,040
that's possible.
But it got caught up in his own wave and

2660
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:43,170
he became a caricature.
You know,

2661
01:51:43,171 --> 01:51:44,520
it became like a,

2662
01:51:45,630 --> 01:51:48,000
I just pictured you becoming a 
caricature of yourself.

2663
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:49,960
How can I do?
And you come out and all you're doing is

2664
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:54,961
just throwing kicks the fucking show.
Coming out with a speed bag comic comedy

2665
01:51:56,191 --> 01:51:58,790
speed Piscopo for this going.
Yeah,

2666
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:04,440
I do remember that.
He took a steroid test during his 

2667
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:04,740
special.
What?

2668
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:08,600
He,
he had a special where he had been.

2669
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:09,960
One was saying he was on Roids

2670
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:15,490
oh,
because he got really big on 

2671
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:15,490
bodybuilding magazines

2672
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:15,490
and stuff.
So then,

2673
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:18,260
and it all stemmed from some comment 
somebody made when he took his shirt off

2674
01:52:18,261 --> 01:52:18,920
at,
at a pool,

2675
01:52:18,921 --> 01:52:22,010
like plastic sensitive performance.
And then he just went the other way with

2676
01:52:22,011 --> 01:52:27,011
it.
It just became like shred and that guy 

2677
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:27,011
was shredded.

2678
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:27,400
That's where it came from.
Somebody like mocked his.

2679
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:33,190
I mean I've been talking about a 
magazine article I read like in the 

2680
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:33,190
eighties,
um,

2681
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:38,180
so he got all big like that.
So he has a special actor where he does 

2682
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:38,910
like axl rose and he does all these 
guys.

2683
01:52:38,911 --> 01:52:43,911
And in the beginning of it,
somewhere towards the beginning he just 

2684
01:52:43,911 --> 01:52:45,990
has a guy in a lab coat come out or

2685
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:50,990
something.
He sent a lot of people say I'm taking 

2686
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:50,990
roads or whatever.
So the band's playing.

2687
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:53,220
He goes offstage and basically I guess 
ps in this Cup,

2688
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:58,340
no way,
and he does his whole special and the 

2689
01:52:58,340 --> 01:52:58,980
special ends in this guy comes back out 
with the classic,

2690
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:03,981
I'm a doctor,
lab coats and it comes out and he's 

2691
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:03,981
like,
what's the verdict?

2692
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:03,981
And they go,
it's clean.

2693
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:04,610
He's like,
it's clay.

2694
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:09,030
And that was,
I sweat it.

2695
01:53:09,031 --> 01:53:14,031
I get so to say it out loud is so nuts.
I'm starting to wonder if it happened 

2696
01:53:14,031 --> 01:53:15,400
and I apologize if I,
if he's listening,

2697
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:17,110
I got it wrong.
I really shouldn't have done that.

2698
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:21,110
I've never been able to find it.

2699
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,910
Oh,
it's got to be out there.

2700
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:28,510
Well,
Joe Piscopo is recently been brought to 

2701
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:28,840
the limelight by Opie and Anthony Opie 
and anthony have been goofing on.

2702
01:53:28,841 --> 01:53:32,200
Joe Basketball and they had them on the 
show and they tortured him.

2703
01:53:32,590 --> 01:53:33,640
Oh,
it was beautiful.

2704
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:38,940
But um,
maybe because of that more people like 

2705
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,900
looking up his stuff because a lot of 
people started.

2706
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:46,350
They started tweeting me,
Joe Piscopo at concert links and videos 

2707
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:48,460
and posters.
Johnny dangerously.

2708
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:52,930
It shoots through schools.
I loved him.

2709
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:53,980
Yeah,
he was great.

2710
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,390
But,
um,

2711
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:58,360
steroid test get the Sinatra thing with 
Eddie Murphy.

2712
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:00,010
That was a great.
That was great.

2713
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:01,240
Yeah.
No,

2714
01:54:01,241 --> 01:54:02,020
I mean,
but,

2715
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:06,430
but it's also undeniable that he lost 
his fucking marbles and disappeared.

2716
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:08,540
Yeah.
He,

2717
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:12,160
he appeared to undergo a drug test 
during a show.

2718
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:16,720
Oh really?
That's you.

2719
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:18,560
Everybody's got that moment.
Your career you'd like.

2720
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:18,620
I'd like

2721
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:22,780
to have it back now.
Fucking watch is still on,

2722
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:25,730
in his HBO special.
Uh,

2723
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:30,770
he appeared to undergo a drug test 
during the show is appeared in anti 

2724
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:35,781
steroid public service announcements.
He became the subject of controversy in 

2725
01:54:36,301 --> 01:54:41,301
the early nineties after appearing 
appearances of his newly buff physique 

2726
01:54:41,301 --> 01:54:44,580
on the covers of fitness magazines.
It led many to speculate.

2727
01:54:44,581 --> 01:54:49,581
He was using steroids do dude too.
I mean,

2728
01:54:50,581 --> 01:54:52,290
he wasn't that big.
He just got,

2729
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:53,970
he got in great shape.
Look,

2730
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:56,400
you can,
you can pack on a lot of weight without.

2731
01:54:56,401 --> 01:54:58,710
Um,
did you ever know Brian Frazier?

2732
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:00,500
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2733
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:03,810
yeah.
When we were in Boston,

2734
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:07,470
Brian Frazier was way bigger than Joe 
Piscopo and he was 100 percent natural.

2735
01:55:07,471 --> 01:55:11,670
He's the biggest guy that I've ever met,
but I absolutely know for a fact was 100

2736
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:13,650
percent natural.
He was so big.

2737
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:16,920
He would go on stage with a tee shirt on
and I told them,

2738
01:55:16,921 --> 01:55:18,320
you can't do that anymore.
I'm like,

2739
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:21,630
you can't do that because no one's 
paying attention like I know you and I'm

2740
01:55:21,631 --> 01:55:26,631
not paying attention with the fuck 
you're talking about because he had 

2741
01:55:26,631 --> 01:55:28,940
giant arms.
He's a bodybuilder because Andrea twice 

2742
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:28,940
as big as mine.
I never fucking enormous.

2743
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:29,560
He's got.
He's got.

2744
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:31,650
He's got to come up.
You've got to have the button down.

2745
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:36,950
Yeah.
You just got gotta do something where 

2746
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:38,990
people are not getting distracted by the
fact that you've these fucking legs 

2747
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,450
growing off your shoulders.

2748
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:44,070
He was so big at big fucking.
I've never

2749
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,870
understood that.
Didn't that big like just theories.

2750
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:48,840
People where they have a too big.
That's not funny.

2751
01:55:48,841 --> 01:55:53,841
People.
People want to see somebody up like 

2752
01:55:53,841 --> 01:55:53,841
people look their theories don't have a 
beard.

2753
01:55:53,841 --> 01:55:54,810
Beard is bad.
I mean they need to see.

2754
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:59,811
Your facial expression is just so much 
horseshit that you hear those theories 

2755
01:55:59,811 --> 01:55:59,811
all.
Yeah.

2756
01:55:59,811 --> 01:56:01,650
They're just trying to define the beard.
Didn't work for him at all.

2757
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:04,960
Yeah.
Nobody can tell you anything.

2758
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:07,080
What made A.
I mean,

2759
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:12,150
look,
Hedberg used to go on stage 99 percent 

2760
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:12,310
of the time with sunglasses on.
Who would ever tell you you should go?

2761
01:56:12,311 --> 01:56:13,960
Yeah,
I've closed with sunglasses on.

2762
01:56:13,961 --> 01:56:16,600
It was awesome.
Nobody can tell you how the fuck can you

2763
01:56:16,601 --> 01:56:18,910
be a cage fighting commentator and a 
standup comedian?

2764
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:20,050
They'll tell you,
you can't do both.

2765
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:23,140
What a fucking black hole.
Just like so many,

2766
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:24,910
like heat,
like what would that guy like?

2767
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:26,710
I just,
I still kills me.

2768
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:29,080
I didn't even know him that well.
I met him a couple times,

2769
01:56:29,081 --> 01:56:31,540
but like me to same thing.
It's just like,

2770
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,820
uh,
that guy.

2771
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:35,920
I mean he was brilliant.
Oh my God.

2772
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:37,480
It's so fucking rich.
I mean,

2773
01:56:37,481 --> 01:56:39,570
I just sat there and you just became a 
fan for some.

2774
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:44,580
I saw him was in the old logo on Fairfax
and what was awesome was there was this 

2775
01:56:45,491 --> 01:56:50,491
guy who ran the room who was good at 
running the room and he had real 

2776
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:50,491
difficulty.
Like all those guys were standing up.

2777
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:54,811
Was it was so difficult,
he wasn't likable and he would just go 

2778
01:56:54,811 --> 01:56:54,950
on stage and you know,
those guys,

2779
01:56:54,951 --> 01:56:59,951
they just,
they come onstage and just for whatever 

2780
01:56:59,951 --> 01:57:02,341
reason,
whatever they're putting out the crap 

2781
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:02,341
just hates him.
Right.

2782
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:03,460
And he went up there and just flailing,
flailing,

2783
01:57:03,461 --> 01:57:05,650
flailing.
And so he's running the room and then he

2784
01:57:05,651 --> 01:57:09,370
brings up Hedberg.
Hedberg goes up there and just instantly

2785
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:13,060
is killing.
And he was doing shit.

2786
01:57:13,061 --> 01:57:15,880
Like what if he got mad at fruit?
He was this crazy jokes.

2787
01:57:15,881 --> 01:57:17,620
He was trying.
I used to just like fucking fruit.

2788
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:22,630
That's just the way he did it.
He was so fucking ridiculous and it 

2789
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:23,570
just,
you are like,

2790
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:26,610
just locked in.
It was,

2791
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:30,400
he was just one of those guys,
I don't care if you had fucking 12 beers

2792
01:57:30,401 --> 01:57:35,401
in you,
you just knew instantly I am watching a 

2793
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:35,401
genius and you would just,

2794
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:36,680
it was um,
yeah man,

2795
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:37,440
I,
I just

2796
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,870
so original the way he would like,
he would,

2797
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:43,640
he would make jokes about shit that 
doesn't make any sense.

2798
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:45,280
I mean,
like you would look at a paper,

2799
01:57:45,281 --> 01:57:50,281
you go,
how the fuck is someone going to make a 

2800
01:57:50,281 --> 01:57:50,281
joke of it?
Had the combos for double tree.

2801
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:52,960
They have a meeting,
what do you want to call it?

2802
01:57:53,110 --> 01:57:55,750
Let's call it two trees.
How about devil tree meeting?

2803
01:57:55,751 --> 01:57:56,350
Adjourn.

2804
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:05,330
I heard that he actually had the balls.
He went on Letterman and on one of his 

2805
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:09,420
sets he called back to a job he did on a
previous set on letterman.

2806
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:12,100
Just to see if anybody noticed.
I mean,

2807
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:16,270
it's just like that.
I mean I tap out right there.

2808
01:58:16,271 --> 01:58:17,530
I'm just like,
Jesus Christ.

2809
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,940
It was really clean too,
which is really funny because he's like 

2810
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:24,570
one of my favorite guys ever.
That's basically squeaky clean and every

2811
01:58:24,571 --> 01:58:26,250
once in a while when he cursed it was 
great.

2812
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,380
Yeah.
I would say a fucking them up.

2813
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,720
One of the things about being a comic in
Boston is that,

2814
01:58:33,721 --> 01:58:36,090
uh,
there was a lot of craft to me.

2815
01:58:36,091 --> 01:58:41,091
You,
you came along so a little bit after me 

2816
01:58:41,091 --> 01:58:41,200
about after my generation of open 
makers.

2817
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:43,000
Uh,
but there was a,

2818
01:58:43,001 --> 01:58:47,740
there was a lot of emphasis put on the 
craft of like the use of the word fuck.

2819
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:48,460
Like,
you know,

2820
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:51,070
you could use the word fuck,
but don't over fuck,

2821
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:53,200
don't break the fuck meter.
That's the guys would say,

2822
01:58:53,490 --> 01:58:55,760
I remember that.
I try to keep it to three,

2823
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,500
three to five bucks.
Yeah.

2824
01:58:57,710 --> 01:58:58,630
Like Donovan used to say

2825
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:04,200
Donovan was a genius man.
Donovan Donovan is one of those 

2826
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:04,200
unheralded genius

2827
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:08,810
favorite lines ever is.
He's talking about being at work and 

2828
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:10,530
their boss breaking your balls above 
going on break.

2829
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:15,620
And one of my favorite,
like most one of those blue collar 

2830
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:17,250
details that I never heard anybody bring
up on stage.

2831
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:19,060
He was imitating,
you know,

2832
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:24,150
giving shit to his boss.
He said I'll take a 20 minutes shit on 

2833
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:24,150
the clock if I want.
And I was just like,

2834
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:28,940
oh my God.
I used to work with a guy who did that 

2835
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:28,940
everyday.
Just dogging it,

2836
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:30,990
just hated his life.
He would grab the newspaper.

2837
01:59:31,470 --> 01:59:33,810
It was just like he go,
we just had to break.

2838
01:59:33,811 --> 01:59:38,811
The Roach coach pulled up.
We just had the break and he used it to 

2839
01:59:38,811 --> 01:59:42,531
get.
He was so fucking miserable to get from 

2840
01:59:42,531 --> 01:59:45,321
the break to get to lunch.
He had this routine where he would go 

2841
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:48,891
and he's like,
I have to go to the bathroom and we 

2842
01:59:48,891 --> 01:59:48,891
would all break his balls.

2843
01:59:48,891 --> 01:59:51,860
It's like jail.
You fucking went in there for like nine 

2844
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:51,860
hours,
you know,

2845
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:52,440
and he would just laugh and he would 
just walk in,

2846
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:56,430
sit down and just read the newspaper.
I don't even think he was taking a shit.

2847
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:59,910
He would just sit on this bowl just to 
have this debt.

2848
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:02,910
I never forget that shit.
Like how lucky my life is to tell jokes.

2849
02:00:02,911 --> 02:00:07,911
Let's just say that like your game plan 
is you hate your job so bad that you 

2850
02:00:07,911 --> 02:00:11,460
pretend to take his shit for 20 minutes 
every day just to get to lunch.

2851
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:14,910
That's a lot of guys that you can get 
fired for that.

2852
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:20,690
Oh,
nowadays with all the cameras and 

2853
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:20,690
everything,
they can literally break down.

2854
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:23,601
Exactly.
When you come back in the day that fuck 

2855
02:00:23,601 --> 02:00:25,401
you was six minutes,
there would be an attorney or how quick 

2856
02:00:25,401 --> 02:00:26,010
am I supposed to take a shit in,
bring it to a diet counselor,

2857
02:00:27,490 --> 02:00:29,110
try to get you.
We have to figure out,

2858
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:34,140
figure out some sort of a way to 
optimize your time better here at 

2859
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:37,500
Performance Inc,
setting the people in the cubicles that 

2860
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:37,500
you're walking by.
As you go to the,

2861
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,710
uh,
as you go to the toilet there,

2862
02:00:38,711 --> 02:00:39,820
they're pulling your load

2863
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:42,120
while you're shitting.
Oh,

2864
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:43,750
that was one of the dumbest things we 
ever did.

2865
02:00:43,751 --> 02:00:48,751
We used to,
we used to ship out like this computer 

2866
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:51,241
software.
We are the middleman between like 

2867
02:00:51,241 --> 02:00:51,241
software companies and people ordering 
software.

2868
02:00:51,241 --> 02:00:52,570
This is like the 80,
so there's no internet.

2869
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:58,170
So people would come to our company.
I mean the company I worked for where 

2870
02:00:58,170 --> 02:00:58,170
they had all this software,
Lotus one,

2871
02:00:58,170 --> 02:00:58,510
two,
three,

2872
02:00:59,110 --> 02:00:59,830
Dbas,
three,

2873
02:00:59,831 --> 02:01:02,260
all this old school shit.
And uh,

2874
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:07,090
one day we got into this stupid guy,
competitive thing like fucking morons.

2875
02:01:07,091 --> 02:01:09,250
We didn't realize it like who was 
shipping out the most.

2876
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:13,570
So we started saving them competing with
one another and uh,

2877
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:16,400
this guy shipped out 100 packages,
so the next day I did 1:20

2878
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:19,660
and then he did one 60 move fighting and
then the fucking management got room for

2879
02:01:19,661 --> 02:01:19,750
it.

2880
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,820
They're like,
oh yeah,

2881
02:01:20,821 --> 02:01:24,540
why don't you start keeping a and a,
a number.

2882
02:01:24,541 --> 02:01:29,541
And then they figured out who is being 
the most efficient and guys started 

2883
02:01:29,541 --> 02:01:29,541
losing their jobs.
So I even back then I was like,

2884
02:01:29,541 --> 02:01:30,900
dude,
guy stopped fucking doing it.

2885
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:32,260
Stopped doing it

2886
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,550
because we're,
we're literally cutting our own fucking.

2887
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:39,900
Well you're making yourself.
You put yourself in a race that's 

2888
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:39,900
there's no.

2889
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:39,900
Yeah,
but we didn't know any.

2890
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,630
Yeah,
we didn't know any better idiots.

2891
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:43,970
We were like 19,
22.

2892
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:49,010
We used to fucking go out and drink like
a 12 pack of beer and eat McDonald's at 

2893
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:52,931
one in the morning and by like 8:00
crew unloading trucks find laughing and 

2894
02:01:53,091 --> 02:01:58,091
then we would work.
We do all this shit and that during 

2895
02:01:58,091 --> 02:02:00,790
lunch hour we would go out and play 
basketball and like just regular 

2896
02:02:01,131 --> 02:02:04,790
sneakers and like five slash 11 blues 
number that the butterfly and you'd be.

2897
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,010
You'd come back and pouring sweat and 
then just keep on.

2898
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:10,580
It's the greatest shape I was ever in my
life.

2899
02:02:10,581 --> 02:02:14,750
And then in the end of work I would then
go lift and go ride a bike.

2900
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:16,430
Do remember one time I went on a bike 
ride,

2901
02:02:16,431 --> 02:02:21,431
hammered.
I was so into working out fucking bike 

2902
02:02:21,431 --> 02:02:21,431
ride.
I'm,

2903
02:02:21,431 --> 02:02:22,220
I'm like a 12 speed bike that I bought 
when I still have it,

2904
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:23,450
by the way,
am I garage.

2905
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:25,510
I refuse to throw shit out.
And uh,

2906
02:02:25,511 --> 02:02:30,511
I remember being hammered on the bike 
and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more 

2907
02:02:30,511 --> 02:02:32,960
hammered.
I was going to do this 11 mile loop that

2908
02:02:32,961 --> 02:02:33,950
it became,
oh seven.

2909
02:02:33,951 --> 02:02:38,951
And then I just kind of came back and I 
was like on the bike laughing and I was 

2910
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:42,731
like 20,
21 and was only beginning to understand 

2911
02:02:42,731 --> 02:02:46,151
the fragility of life.
And I knew that what I was doing was 

2912
02:02:46,151 --> 02:02:46,151
stupid,
but I couldn't get,

2913
02:02:46,151 --> 02:02:50,970
like I,
I just kept picturing my friends 

2914
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:50,970
laughing at me and I was literally by 
myself riding this bike,

2915
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:53,450
laughing drunk,
driving up the street.

2916
02:02:56,140 --> 02:03:01,140
I've been here for two and a half hours.
Like I'm just taking snippets from 

2917
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:01,140
fucking the ads I got.
I got nothing left.

2918
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:05,180
Used to be able to bounce back so.
Well when you're young,

2919
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:10,330
it's amazing.
When you're 20 years old you can get 

2920
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:10,330
hammered in the next day.
You barely feel anything.

2921
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:15,240
Food Donald's and tear down that place.
I would get to quarter pounders with 

2922
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:15,830
cheese,
a large fry,

2923
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:17,840
a six piece mcnugget.
And I never liked him.

2924
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:22,990
I never liked him.
I never thought an ace to try the 

2925
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:23,330
different sauces.
Mustard never tastes good.

2926
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,890
I just wanted something to fill the 
void.

2927
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:29,540
And then I would get like a couple of 
cheeseburgers and uh,

2928
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:35,680
I think just a giant coke and just throw
that down and wake up the next day with 

2929
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:36,590
a flat stomach.
And I had already drank like,

2930
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:37,070
you know,
eight,

2931
02:03:37,071 --> 02:03:40,100
nine beers.
We've got to fight.

2932
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:45,340
We got into a fight one time right under
the Golden Arches and the next town 

2933
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:45,650
over.
Um,

2934
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:47,510
I don't know what happened.
These guys came in drunk,

2935
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:52,511
classic Boston Shit.
They just come walking in and they give 

2936
02:03:52,511 --> 02:03:54,761
everybody the finger.
Of course we respond to it and next 

2937
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:56,630
thing you know,
we're out underneath the golden arches.

2938
02:03:56,631 --> 02:04:00,170
There's like five of us and two of them.
And uh,

2939
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:01,300
my buddy,
we always fought,

2940
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:06,340
he starts swinging on the big one and 
then the little one he sort of jumped 

2941
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:06,920
and it just became this big and it 
looked like wrestling,

2942
02:04:06,921 --> 02:04:11,921
you know,
and like they all come running out of 

2943
02:04:11,921 --> 02:04:11,921
the dressing to help each other on snow.
Everybody's drunk just fallen down.

2944
02:04:11,921 --> 02:04:13,550
We so fucking drunk.
The cops were there,

2945
02:04:13,551 --> 02:04:17,210
like sort of missing mace for like,
I don't know how long,

2946
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:21,450
like we didn't even see him pull up,
like being in the light.

2947
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:25,160
Then all of a sudden everybody's eyes 
are like tearing up and shit.

2948
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:30,340
And then what was hilarious was they 
just broke us up and they fuck it.

2949
02:04:31,431 --> 02:04:34,730
And then like two seconds say we're back
in our car and the same two guys we were

2950
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:38,160
fighting were coming back up to the car.
So what are the cops go?

2951
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,160
I thought it was over.
And the guys like that was a bullshit 

2952
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:43,160
punch.
I remember the little one goes.

2953
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:43,160
I said,
memory goes,

2954
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:44,790
we laugh at you.
Shit.

2955
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:52,200
It was fucking nuts.
I got to give it up to him.

2956
02:04:52,201 --> 02:04:54,450
And he was fucking four on two or 
whatever.

2957
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:56,100
And uh,
they didn't give a shit.

2958
02:04:56,830 --> 02:04:58,740
They laughed.
They definitely left in our shit.

2959
02:04:58,760 --> 02:04:59,550
They,
they didn't care.

2960
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:01,230
They hate that Mason.
They came right back.

2961
02:05:01,231 --> 02:05:06,150
They already are right up to our Ford 
escort.

2962
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:07,500
They did not give a fuck

2963
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:10,470
into the fighting.
You just got maced.

2964
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:13,630
Something happened.
I don't know.

2965
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:16,200
Nobody got it full on.
Like it was just like you're.

2966
02:05:16,201 --> 02:05:18,140
I,
I thought we thought it was the snow.

2967
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:20,510
Like they had thrown a rock salt because
we were on the ground.

2968
02:05:20,511 --> 02:05:21,440
I don't,
I don't know what it was,

2969
02:05:21,710 --> 02:05:24,020
but it was just like unbelievably 
fucking air.

2970
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:29,050
But we were hammered.
A fucking police car pulled up and 

2971
02:05:29,050 --> 02:05:29,760
nobody noticed.
That's hilarious.

2972
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:32,690
Whatever was going on.
How fucking

2973
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:35,510
common or fights in Boston though?
I mean that's the other thing we.

2974
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:40,700
I didn't realize growing up there that 
that's not normal and that there really 

2975
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:42,050
aren't that many fights in the rest of 
the country.

2976
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:44,570
I was never a fighter man.
I fucking hated that shit.

2977
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:47,910
Like I saw so many guys just like you 
just like,

2978
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:53,450
you know that youtube videos,
you see someone's already knocked out 

2979
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:53,450
and they're unconscious and they get 
that extra two,

2980
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:54,630
three boots to the head.
You're like,

2981
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:56,580
oh my God.
For the love,

2982
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:58,800
for the love of God.
Just you one.

2983
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:00,270
Yeah.
I've never been into.

2984
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:01,240
They either,
believe it or not.

2985
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,770
I was always the guy who got the fuck 
out of there.

2986
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:05,360
I never wanted to have anything to do 
with that.

2987
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:10,720
I didn't mind competition,
but in my kickboxing or martial arts 

2988
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,650
tournament or whatever,
but a fight on the street.

2989
02:06:12,651 --> 02:06:13,760
I was like,
why don't we do in here?

2990
02:06:13,761 --> 02:06:16,370
This is avoidable.
This is chaos.

2991
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:20,240
This is why my thing that I always used 
to get psyched out because I was like,

2992
02:06:20,241 --> 02:06:21,950
all right,
I'll fight my older brother and lose,

2993
02:06:21,951 --> 02:06:26,951
then I'll take the ass kicking,
but he has to deal with the fact that 

2994
02:06:26,951 --> 02:06:27,290
dad's coming home.
This guy doesn't have to stop,

2995
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:32,320
dad isn't coming home within this 
relationship and he can just keep going 

2996
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:35,560
and I've always been slow as shit so you
could literally tell me what you're 

2997
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,470
going to throw and tell me exactly what 
to do.

2998
02:06:36,471 --> 02:06:37,220
You're still going to hit me

2999
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:38,750
big head already.

3000
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:44,800
Like I really like.
If I would have died in 1980,

3001
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:47,800
if there wasn't for all this medicine 
and shit like I shouldn't be.

3002
02:06:47,801 --> 02:06:49,630
I'm one of the weak ones.
I really like.

3003
02:06:49,631 --> 02:06:52,240
I had my appendix ruptured.
I wouldn't.

3004
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:57,300
If it was the 18 hundreds,
I would have died under like a stack of 

3005
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:58,630
blankets and say sponged off my giant 
for that would've been.

3006
02:06:58,631 --> 02:07:00,790
It would've been buried out by the 
outhouse.

3007
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:03,880
I Dunno.
It was weird.

3008
02:07:03,881 --> 02:07:05,800
It just kinda was kept hurting and 
hurting.

3009
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:07,750
How old were you?
A 12.

3010
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:09,470
That's terrifying.
And it was,

3011
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,860
it was ruptured.
And they didn't know what was my one day

3012
02:07:11,861 --> 02:07:16,861
I'd be fine.
The next day I was at and my brothers 

3013
02:07:16,861 --> 02:07:20,340
convinced that he knows when we were 
playing baseball and football came up 

3014
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:20,500
and he said it hit me in the side.
I don't think it did.

3015
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:26,100
I can't remember,
but I just remembered my parents were 

3016
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:26,100
always just like,
you're fine,

3017
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:26,100
you're fine,
dude.

3018
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:31,011
I get hit by a car and they sent the 
ambulance away and we took a cab to a 

3019
02:07:31,011 --> 02:07:33,280
better hospital and my mother was going,
just stay awake.

3020
02:07:33,281 --> 02:07:34,260
Just say,
wow.

3021
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,010
Wow.

3022
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,500
Did you hear about that kid that got hit
with a disgust?

3023
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:42,580
He got hit with disgust and died.
He got hit in the hip.

3024
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:46,330
He got hit in the hip with a discussed 
in one of dying.

3025
02:07:46,860 --> 02:07:48,200
What?
They don't know.

3026
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:51,250
Some sort of a blood blood clot or 
something.

3027
02:07:51,251 --> 02:07:52,420
I don't know.
But,

3028
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:52,690
uh,
here,

3029
02:07:52,691 --> 02:07:54,910
I'll pull up the story you want to have 
you talked to them?

3030
02:07:55,190 --> 02:08:00,190
Yeah.
There's obviously major arteries that 

3031
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:00,520
connect the top to the bottom right.
I mean,

3032
02:08:00,521 --> 02:08:03,520
the blood's got to get down there.
So basically you got the four.

3033
02:08:03,521 --> 02:08:04,630
Oh,
five on one side,

3034
02:08:04,631 --> 02:08:09,631
the one on one or the other.
Fifteen year old kid in Texas died nine 

3035
02:08:09,631 --> 02:08:11,890
days after being hit with a flying,
discuss it,

3036
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:14,890
and he got hit in the hip to hip.
It wasn't any vitals.

3037
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,350
No.
I know the questions to ask.

3038
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:23,040
Yeah.
Vitals makes you sound like you know 

3039
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:23,040
what you're talking about is fucking 
crazy.

3040
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:23,100
Yeah.
He,

3041
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:27,190
he was in pain apparently and the pain 
kept getting worse.

3042
02:08:27,191 --> 02:08:32,191
He was admitted a place under intensive 
care and then dod from fucking.

3043
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:34,060
Yeah,
you're in pain.

3044
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:36,100
They elaborate.
Don't tough it out.

3045
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:38,500
You know,
now they don't.

3046
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:40,210
They don't know.
It just happened.

3047
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,790
The funeral,
it was just a couple of days ago,

3048
02:08:42,910 --> 02:08:46,270
so I think there probably were awaiting 
the results of the autopsy still,

3049
02:08:47,050 --> 02:08:49,350
but he was most likely a blood clot in 
your body.

3050
02:08:49,351 --> 02:08:51,460
So fucking fragile.
And you know,

3051
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:57,240
I've seen so many people get beat up.
I've probably seen more people get beat 

3052
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:01,201
up than anybody in human history.
Did you know what day I'm going to the 

3053
02:09:01,201 --> 02:09:04,201
hospital already?
The amount of people that I know that 

3054
02:09:04,201 --> 02:09:04,201
died and they say for three days they're
going,

3055
02:09:04,201 --> 02:09:05,110
yeah,
I just don't feel right.

3056
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:10,470
Yeah.
Like when you feel that go to the go to 

3057
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:10,470
the fucking hospital,
it's just like,

3058
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:11,410
let's do a full body cat scan.

3059
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:15,100
That's such a scab.
Find something cat scans.

3060
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,330
Why is that?
Well,

3061
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:20,080
it's been an MRI for the full body 
magnetic resonance imagery,

3062
02:09:20,081 --> 02:09:22,120
cat scans for the dome.
All right,

3063
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:27,600
you got that?
I think right now do cat scans for body 

3064
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:27,600
once.
This is.

3065
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:32,431
The guy won't admit he's wrong.
They like make you pull your knees up 

3066
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:37,570
into your fucking shoulders down there.
All the guys that I've seen get beat up.

3067
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:42,870
I mean,
how many people have seen a thousand 

3068
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:45,031
people get beat up?
I've seen at least a thousand from all 

3069
02:09:45,031 --> 02:09:48,001
the fights that I've called,
I'm an all the the trauma I've seen in 

3070
02:09:48,001 --> 02:09:50,050
person,
so normally I don't like that shit.

3071
02:09:50,051 --> 02:09:52,660
Where after the dudes knocked out and 
then the guy comes up and it's like one,

3072
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:53,200
two,
three,

3073
02:09:53,201 --> 02:09:54,470
four,
and then the breath gets there.

3074
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,620
It's just a shitty referee.
That's what that is.

3075
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:59,260
Yeah.
To the arm bars,

3076
02:09:59,261 --> 02:10:00,880
I still remember,
I forget what fight it was.

3077
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:05,880
I think it was when Matt Hughes had a.
what's his face in the arm bar and you 

3078
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:06,110
just wouldn't have the gracie family 
like Oh,

3079
02:10:06,111 --> 02:10:06,870
hoists.
Yeah.

3080
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,550
He would not have said something like,
oh my God,

3081
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:12,890
you like that?
You know when you get hyped snap.

3082
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:15,880
Literally I had to look away because I 
was like going,

3083
02:10:15,881 --> 02:10:18,310
I'm going to see two bones come through 
the skin.

3084
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:19,000
That is one of the.
Like.

3085
02:10:19,001 --> 02:10:20,790
He was just like,
fuck this.

3086
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:25,890
Like I am not.
That's one of the toughest things I've 

3087
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:28,651
ever seen.
He's so filled with adrenaline and it 

3088
02:10:28,651 --> 02:10:32,101
was his pride.
I mean he was a Jujitsu master and this 

3089
02:10:32,101 --> 02:10:35,161
guy got him into Jujitsu hold and it's 
basically going to break his fucking 

3090
02:10:35,161 --> 02:10:35,480
arm.
Straight arm bar.

3091
02:10:35,610 --> 02:10:37,480
Gosh,
that was one of the.

3092
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:39,380
It's a lot of pain,
man.

3093
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,930
It's terrible.
Terrible pain to experience.

3094
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:45,090
But no,
his whole family was like that.

3095
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:47,840
I mean his,
his dad is famous for fighting.

3096
02:10:47,841 --> 02:10:50,000
This guy named Kimora,
this big Japanese guy.

3097
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,730
His Dad got a shoulder ripped apart by a
Komora.

3098
02:10:52,731 --> 02:10:54,470
It's called a Comoran that's a shoulder 
lock,

3099
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:59,580
but you know,
Yankee cap wouldn't tap guy ripped his 

3100
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:03,721
shit apart and who knows how they pieced
them together back then because this is 

3101
02:11:03,721 --> 02:11:04,010
the 19 forties.
I mean,

3102
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:08,210
what the fuck they did to put his arm or
his knees back in the day.

3103
02:11:08,211 --> 02:11:11,290
They would just,
they tell you I shit out.

3104
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:14,450
Work at the gym where he worked out to 
ever tell you this.

3105
02:11:14,850 --> 02:11:19,850
I'm bad.
Anybody's still listening to this at 

3106
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:19,850
this point was like,
we're for sure getting married.

3107
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:20,270
This,
we always do.

3108
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:23,450
Um,
bobby or I was at the Boston.

3109
02:11:23,451 --> 02:11:28,451
It is,
we do like three hour podcasts almost 

3110
02:11:28,451 --> 02:11:28,451
every time we've done it with you,
pal,

3111
02:11:28,451 --> 02:11:32,170
you forgot already know.
I met one time over your house and I 

3112
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:34,691
woke up in my elbow coupler and the 
fucking thing was over.

3113
02:11:35,710 --> 02:11:40,710
Like I didn't realize how much I was 
sweating like my back of my knees to my 

3114
02:11:40,710 --> 02:11:41,120
ass.
It was like I ran a marathon.

3115
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:44,780
That's my shitty office man sitting in 
that vinyl fucking chair.

3116
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:47,810
It was leather.
It was a real legit,

3117
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:51,770
legit,
marbled flipped and vital in my house or

3118
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:57,100
whatever the hell it was.
Corinthian leather was just about to 

3119
02:11:57,100 --> 02:11:57,100
tell you

3120
02:11:57,370 --> 02:12:02,370
at.
You just found the last two and a half 

3121
02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:02,370
hours of know.
What the fuck was I talking about?

3122
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,070
Gracie's?
Yes.

3123
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:04,680
He looked at it.
No,

3124
02:12:04,690 --> 02:12:09,690
no.
It was past that we went past the 

3125
02:12:09,690 --> 02:12:09,690
shoulder.
Well,

3126
02:12:09,690 --> 02:12:09,940
how they put it together.
The 1940 [inaudible]

3127
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:12,480
oh fuck.
Right.

3128
02:12:12,481 --> 02:12:14,980
After that.
If somebody screaming at their car where

3129
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:19,080
you lost me,
I lost my fucking point.

3130
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,290
Come on,
let's walk back.

3131
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:23,880
It's no,
it's never coming back.

3132
02:12:23,881 --> 02:12:24,840
It's over.
Gilbert.

3133
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:26,580
I don't know what the fuck I was going 
to tell you.

3134
02:12:28,290 --> 02:12:31,740
Imagine how they built his own.
God knows what they did.

3135
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:32,730
Well,
that's that bobby.

3136
02:12:32,731 --> 02:12:33,370
Your Shit.
Oh,

3137
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:33,930
Bob.
Your.

3138
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:34,720
That's it.
That's it.

3139
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:36,060
Thank you.
Got It.

3140
02:12:36,061 --> 02:12:36,780
Thank you.
Thank you.

3141
02:12:36,781 --> 02:12:40,440
I worked at the Boston Athletic Club in 
Southie and uh,

3142
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:45,530
I was a trainer there when I was 19 and 
bobby or used to play racquetball there 

3143
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:49,200
and he had,
who knows how many knee operations.

3144
02:12:49,201 --> 02:12:54,201
He was a very nice guy.
Bobby Orr was and a super friendly to 

3145
02:12:54,201 --> 02:12:58,041
anybody would come in,
but I used to have to help him get on 

3146
02:12:58,041 --> 02:12:59,400
the versaclimber verse climbers one of 
those things.

3147
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:01,230
It looks like you're climbing it.

3148
02:13:01,230 --> 02:13:02,000
The,
like the,

3149
02:13:02,001 --> 02:13:07,001
uh,
the arms go up and your right arm will 

3150
02:13:07,001 --> 02:13:09,801
go up,
your left arm will go down and the same 

3151
02:13:09,801 --> 02:13:10,960
with your feet and you're,
it's a great exercise.

3152
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:13,510
It's great to get it made that noise.
Absolutely.

3153
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:15,710
It's a great.
Oh,

3154
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:16,590
that's it.
Yeah.

3155
02:13:16,591 --> 02:13:18,630
I remember that.
It's a great cardio exercise,

3156
02:13:18,631 --> 02:13:21,000
like one of the best Jujitsu.
Anyway,

3157
02:13:21,001 --> 02:13:25,080
bobby or gets on this thing and he can't
really bend his knees.

3158
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:27,740
His knees,
like this is a normal person's name.

3159
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:30,080
They go from here to like there.
That's how you're,

3160
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:32,100
you're nigos his knee goes like this

3161
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:33,910
clink clink.
He,

3162
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,540
he gets like 15 degrees of movement.
I mean,

3163
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:38,220
very little.
He's like bone on bone.

3164
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,380
Yeah.
So we used to have to pick him up,

3165
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:44,250
pick him up and uh,
get his feet into the thing.

3166
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:46,320
And then you had to be there when he 
wanted to get off of it,

3167
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:51,321
as well as like,
his knees would not bend correctly and 

3168
02:13:51,321 --> 02:13:51,810
when he was playing racquetball,
he would just fall down,

3169
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,980
like he would play racquetball and he 
would like go for a ball and just fall.

3170
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:58,500
I mean he just,
he didn't even try to stop it.

3171
02:13:58,770 --> 02:14:00,210
He would just allow themselves to fall

3172
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:01,830
first.
Sam Kennison not bother your.

3173
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:02,680
He just killed me.

3174
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:03,370
No,
listen,

3175
02:14:03,371 --> 02:14:06,060
Bob Yoga was a great guy.
He ate.

3176
02:14:06,190 --> 02:14:11,190
He had the same issue that uh,
a very good friend of mine has where 

3177
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:12,100
they,
they did those operations back then.

3178
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:14,380
First of all these to cut you open like 
a salmon.

3179
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:19,740
They would just,
they would just open you and then they 

3180
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:19,930
would go into the hamstrings.
They pull the hamstrings out,

3181
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:23,020
take a big chunk of it,
and then try to reconstruct your knee.

3182
02:14:23,021 --> 02:14:27,100
And it would almost always blow out.
So bobby had so many fucking surgeries,

3183
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:29,120
his knees just an up and down.
Both

3184
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:32,000
those guys out on the golf course when 
they were shorts,

3185
02:14:32,001 --> 02:14:35,210
where they have that Frankenstein car 
right over the Patella.

3186
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:36,050
Oh,
I have that.

3187
02:14:36,290 --> 02:14:36,850
You have that?

3188
02:14:36,890 --> 02:14:38,000
Yeah,
that's my acl.

3189
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:39,800
I had to,
but that one doesn't hurt at all.

3190
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:43,520
I had a Patella that's actually more 
than the new school was on the side.

3191
02:14:43,850 --> 02:14:48,850
The acl is in the middle.
The acl is what connects the two 

3192
02:14:48,850 --> 02:14:48,980
together and keeps them from moving 
forward and backward.

3193
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:53,210
And there's obviously the outside and 
there's a lot of different things,

3194
02:14:53,211 --> 02:14:55,130
but one of the ways that they,
uh,

3195
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:59,780
they fixed the acl joint is they take a 
piece of the Patella tendon joint,

3196
02:14:59,781 --> 02:15:02,540
which is the front one which goes from 
the kneecap down.

3197
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,000
They take a slice of that because it's a
big thick one.

3198
02:15:05,001 --> 02:15:08,270
Have you ever seen a cadaver?
It's very fit and you don't need it all.

3199
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:13,330
So they take a strip of that,
open you up and they open you up and 

3200
02:15:15,501 --> 02:15:20,501
then they screw it in place.
So I have a screw in one and then 

3201
02:15:20,501 --> 02:15:21,830
another screw in another.
It's still in.

3202
02:15:21,831 --> 02:15:24,210
The screws are still in there because 
it's almost like you go through security

3203
02:15:24,211 --> 02:15:25,460
at the airport.
It doesn't beep,

3204
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:27,930
but it shows up in an MRI.
I to tell them,

3205
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:29,650
you stand there and do the Jay z thing.
Yeah,

3206
02:15:29,651 --> 02:15:31,280
I do it.
You don't do it.

3207
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:33,890
You don't have to worry about that one 
because that one isn't even radiation.

3208
02:15:33,891 --> 02:15:35,620
That's actually radio waves.
So they'll look.

3209
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:39,720
This is the sharp metal object.
Anybody 12 years or younger they go,

3210
02:15:39,721 --> 02:15:41,070
okay,
go through the old school one.

3211
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:42,810
So it's like,
what is that?

3212
02:15:42,811 --> 02:15:45,510
Because that will disrupt him hitting 
puberty.

3213
02:15:45,511 --> 02:15:46,680
Yeah,
they do.

3214
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:49,680
It's because it's their little kid parts
probably.

3215
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:54,510
Well they like,
they'd probably illegal to see a picture

3216
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:55,910
of your Dick.
Oh,

3217
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:57,030
is that what it is?
Yeah.

3218
02:15:57,050 --> 02:16:02,050
Because you know a lot of those,
especially those naked imagery things 

3219
02:16:02,050 --> 02:16:02,050
like that was the thing you were getting
like

3220
02:16:02,050 --> 02:16:05,220
there's been several versions are old.
You can see that deck.

3221
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:06,630
That's okay.
That's still under age.

3222
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:12,320
Maybe they just get,
they get nervous when someones too 

3223
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:12,320
young.
Yeah,

3224
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,200
I dunno,
I just saw that.

3225
02:16:13,201 --> 02:16:14,700
I'm like,
if you hit me with enough shit,

3226
02:16:14,701 --> 02:16:16,470
the fucking kill him.
I don't want to go through it.

3227
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:19,050
I always go through the pat down.
You get a

3228
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:21,030
pat down,
always Ari Shaffir doesn't.

3229
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:23,160
He goes to,
gets a pat down and he berates them.

3230
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:26,340
Girls are thieves,
thieves and losers and idiots.

3231
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:29,010
Like I've never seen anything like he 
gets angry at.

3232
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:34,110
He doesn't anymore.
He's backed off of it and he's decided 

3233
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:36,421
now to just be polite but object and 
tell them there's other ways to make a 

3234
02:16:36,421 --> 02:16:36,490
living.
But uh,

3235
02:16:36,491 --> 02:16:37,630
they were.
He goes,

3236
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:38,740
well,
can we just go,

3237
02:16:38,741 --> 02:16:39,850
come on,
do your thing.

3238
02:16:39,851 --> 02:16:41,860
So stupid.
Nobody asked for this.

3239
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:44,050
You're not helping anything.
This is a stupid,

3240
02:16:44,051 --> 02:16:45,540
corrupt organization.
So they go,

3241
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:46,770
we're going to get our supervisor.
Oh,

3242
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:49,510
the head guy of your corrupt 
organization.

3243
02:16:49,511 --> 02:16:51,940
Bring that fucking idiot over here.
And the like,

3244
02:16:51,941 --> 02:16:53,570
say,
bring that fucking idiot elsewhere.

3245
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:54,580
He said,
yeah,

3246
02:16:54,581 --> 02:16:59,581
he was.
He was dangerously close to getting 

3247
02:16:59,581 --> 02:17:02,971
arrested.
He came with me to vegas and he was 

3248
02:17:02,971 --> 02:17:05,380
dangerously close to it all going down.
You should have recorded that,

3249
02:17:05,381 --> 02:17:06,640
joe.
I was scared.

3250
02:17:07,030 --> 02:17:09,370
I didn't want to go down to I don't want
to go down with them and I was trying to

3251
02:17:09,371 --> 02:17:14,371
think of who could open for me in Vegas,
what am I going to be able to call last 

3252
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:16,270
minute?
He's getting fucking arrested.

3253
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,130
You want to sit there and I don't 
understand that.

3254
02:17:18,131 --> 02:17:23,131
When something amazing is happening that
all of a sudden you take out a camera 

3255
02:17:23,131 --> 02:17:23,131
and start filming it.
Now it's like you watch it on this small

3256
02:17:23,131 --> 02:17:24,870
screen.
It's like you have a life license.

3257
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:30,070
Well you don't.
You just hold it up and still watch it 

3258
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,070
at the same time.
Yeah,

3259
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,070
hold it like that.

3260
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,990
But you're going to check the thing 
that's just,

3261
02:17:31,050 --> 02:17:32,670
you know,
I guess.

3262
02:17:32,671 --> 02:17:35,790
But I would like to have had that video.
When did you have liked to have seen it?

3263
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:38,020
Right now we going to watch it.
You know,

3264
02:17:38,021 --> 02:17:41,190
if you know how to tell a story,
you can paint a picture of it.

3265
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:43,530
Like you guys kind of know what that 
dude looked like.

3266
02:17:43,531 --> 02:17:48,531
You in them.
And I told her it was like a fucking 

3267
02:17:48,531 --> 02:17:48,531
eight,
nine minutes story.

3268
02:17:48,531 --> 02:17:50,020
Alright calls them all thieves.
Thieves are all thieves.

3269
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,810
They,
there's still things they still drink,

3270
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:55,720
which they occasionally do,
but you know what,

3271
02:17:55,780 --> 02:18:00,780
that's because most of them are just 
regular folks work in Shitty jobs and 

3272
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:03,520
how many people listen to this podcast 
right now goes,

3273
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:08,080
this motherfucker clears throat one more
time believing ladies and gentlemen,

3274
02:18:08,081 --> 02:18:09,850
I don't want to be doing that.
I'm sorry.

3275
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:10,870
But uh,

3276
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:16,050
you know,
right before nine slash 11 I was going 

3277
02:18:16,050 --> 02:18:18,451
through lax and I was like taking a red 
eye and a James Brown was on the radio 

3278
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:25,360
that,
that get opened up and the girl was 

3279
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:28,891
sitting there dancing and singing the 
song and I fucking shot or a look and I 

3280
02:18:28,891 --> 02:18:30,310
think she thought I was looking at her 
in a racist way.

3281
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:32,140
I was more looking like,
do you understand that?

3282
02:18:32,141 --> 02:18:37,120
Like my life is in your hands and you're
sitting over here fucking sliding across

3283
02:18:37,121 --> 02:18:38,890
the floor,
what the fuck are you doing?

3284
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:41,530
And then a few weeks later that bullshit
happened.

3285
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:43,420
Oh,
Tsa person was doing that.

3286
02:18:43,421 --> 02:18:46,780
Yeah,
defiantly singing the song staring at me

3287
02:18:46,781 --> 02:18:48,400
because she,
she caught my vibe.

3288
02:18:48,401 --> 02:18:50,380
Like what are you doing?
And then a few weeks later,

3289
02:18:50,590 --> 02:18:52,660
nine slash 11 happens and then they got 
all these guys.

3290
02:18:52,661 --> 02:18:53,970
Remember they had the fucking guys with 
the.

3291
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,540
It looked like we were in Israel for a 
second.

3292
02:18:55,590 --> 02:18:59,410
Now those guys have gone away and that's
the exact same jerk offs.

3293
02:19:00,730 --> 02:19:05,730
You know that all jerk offs.
But there's enough dead weight come on 

3294
02:19:05,730 --> 02:19:06,250
Tsa.
You know,

3295
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:08,590
there's some people that shouldn't be on
this squad.

3296
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:09,830
There's enough like,

3297
02:19:09,970 --> 02:19:14,970
well they don't get paid that much.
I mean if you're going to get people 

3298
02:19:14,970 --> 02:19:17,341
that work for essentially the same wages
that someone does and they work pretty 

3299
02:19:17,341 --> 02:19:17,341
fast,

3300
02:19:17,341 --> 02:19:21,120
that's exactly.
That's really truly gave a shit about 

3301
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:25,141
your safety.
They would get who that guy on my plane 

3302
02:19:25,141 --> 02:19:25,141
was pretending to be.
They.

3303
02:19:25,141 --> 02:19:28,160
They would get that guy in red wood.
Stand down.

3304
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:30,740
What you would feel that Desert Eagle 
vibe.

3305
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:33,280
They do.

3306
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:35,010
No.
What did they care?

3307
02:19:35,011 --> 02:19:40,011
They care is exactly as much as they 
have to and if it costs them more to 

3308
02:19:40,011 --> 02:19:41,570
make you more safe and not really 
interested in it,

3309
02:19:41,820 --> 02:19:45,330
what they're interested in doing is 
spend the minimum amount of money to get

3310
02:19:45,331 --> 02:19:48,930
people to shut the fuck up and the 
reality is you're not going to get a lot

3311
02:19:48,931 --> 02:19:53,931
of fucking attacks.
You're going to get an occasional one 

3312
02:19:53,931 --> 02:19:56,901
every decade or so.
We're going to have some shit go down 

3313
02:19:56,901 --> 02:19:56,901
and you could make

3314
02:19:56,901 --> 02:20:01,620
fuck load of profit.
I'm more concerned that they're now 

3315
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:01,620
outsourcing.
I saw,

3316
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:02,970
you know,
once again saw this,

3317
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:08,380
didn't research what are they 
outsourcing or bringing in an Indian 

3318
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:08,380
people

3319
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:08,860
just so many miles.
You have to rebuild the jet engine.

3320
02:20:09,790 --> 02:20:13,480
They're outsourcing it outside of this 
country and the FDA can't regulate it.

3321
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:15,580
Yeah,
that's all good.

3322
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:19,300
I saw a great video on youtube and on a 
jet engine forks to suck,

3323
02:20:19,301 --> 02:20:19,990
squeeze,
Bang.

3324
02:20:19,991 --> 02:20:24,250
Blow that what it's called works.
That's the principal's suck in the air.

3325
02:20:24,790 --> 02:20:28,950
You compress it and then you mix it with
the jet fuel and it fucking explodes and

3326
02:20:28,951 --> 02:20:33,951
into how you get your thrust.
We started to learn through learn shit 

3327
02:20:33,951 --> 02:20:34,520
and that's how it makes clouds to right,
and it goes through the atmosphere,

3328
02:20:34,570 --> 02:20:39,570
picks it up to that video.
Yet those cloud trails where they to 

3329
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:40,070
conspiracy theories think that they're 
spraying us.

3330
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:42,790
They're spraying this man.
Look at the clouds and this guy,

3331
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:44,160
man.
I know,

3332
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:49,420
I know a guy who uh,
said to a girl was talking about that 

3333
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:49,420
shit.
Chemtrails.

3334
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:50,830
I don't know what his name.
Yeah.

3335
02:20:50,831 --> 02:20:53,110
Chem trails was talking about that shit.
And this girl's got.

3336
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:54,160
You're crazy.
You're crazy.

3337
02:20:54,161 --> 02:20:57,550
So one day you looked up and there was 
these weird fucking tic tac toe shit and

3338
02:20:57,551 --> 02:21:02,551
the sky that you hadn't seen before.
And he just texted her the next day he 

3339
02:21:02,551 --> 02:21:02,551
goes,
yeah,

3340
02:21:02,551 --> 02:21:06,300
look up.
Well that was hilarious.

3341
02:21:06,810 --> 02:21:08,440
What?
That's fight flight patterns.

3342
02:21:08,470 --> 02:21:09,820
Oh Jesus,
come on.

3343
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:10,930
Well that's what it is.
It's like,

3344
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:16,040
it is.
You don't know what it is neither the 

3345
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:16,040
wise I looked into it.
Yeah,

3346
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:17,320
because I'm tired of arguing with Eddie 
Bravo.

3347
02:21:17,350 --> 02:21:21,040
Which wing of the Pentagon did you walk 
from the UFC?

3348
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:23,110
Come on in.
I talked to pilots,

3349
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:28,200
Bill Burr.
So what the Pio explained to me exactly 

3350
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,751
what it is,
what causes do you know how fucking 

3351
02:21:30,751 --> 02:21:33,330
annoying it is to someone who doesn't 
fly a plane to come up as the same 

3352
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:33,610
person?
Like somebody in the crowd going.

3353
02:21:33,611 --> 02:21:38,611
So like how do you get your material?
Do you trying to get Jujitsu guy friend 

3354
02:21:39,791 --> 02:21:40,570
of mine.
There's a pilot.

3355
02:21:40,650 --> 02:21:45,650
Alright.
I'm too far into this to say you're 

3356
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:47,850
right.
Here's my comments as it criss cross.

3357
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:54,070
Why is it always go in the same 
direction and they're fucking spray 

3358
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:57,250
this.
Aren't they down here too?

3359
02:21:57,251 --> 02:21:59,030
That's the problem with spraying.
No,

3360
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:04,100
but I heard it long as you up.
They put the president in time.

3361
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:07,690
Those sprays going on Air Force One.
It's in the air.

3362
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:10,750
There's so many levels under the White 
House.

3363
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:13,000
They don't even stay in there.
They have like,

3364
02:22:13,001 --> 02:22:13,930
you know,
look alikes.

3365
02:22:14,370 --> 02:22:19,370
Microchips.
Did you remember when after September 

3366
02:22:19,370 --> 02:22:19,370
11th when Dick Cheney was always in the 
bunker.

3367
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:22,250
It was in an undisclosed location in the
bunker.

3368
02:22:22,390 --> 02:22:23,990
Remember that?
He rubbed it out in there.

3369
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,040
I don't think it's hard work.

3370
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,890
Good enough for him to rub one out.
Probably.

3371
02:22:29,390 --> 02:22:31,560
Probably that's probably how I blew his 
heart out.

3372
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:34,800
Probably overdosed on by Agron fucking 
blood ticker.

3373
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,690
Scary.
If you're a.

3374
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:42,250
If you're a on nitrates that you're not 
allowed to have.

3375
02:22:42,251 --> 02:22:47,251
My Agora,
the Viagra fucks with guys that have 

3376
02:22:47,251 --> 02:22:47,251
heart problems.
They take dictate like nitrogen,

3377
02:22:47,251 --> 02:22:49,380
Nitroglycerin,
pills and nitrates.

3378
02:22:49,381 --> 02:22:54,381
Apparently that stuff mixed together.
I know a guy where he had like major 

3379
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:57,810
health problems and he had to get his 
stomach stapled so.

3380
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:02,960
And he was using Viagra and they said 
you can't use this stuff because the 

3381
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:04,080
medicine he was taking for whatever else
he had,

3382
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:05,310
they said like,
it's,

3383
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:06,030
it's thinning

3384
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:10,130
thins out your blood if you know,
if you have sex,

3385
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:15,460
I don't know,
like the blood's going to rush out of 

3386
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:15,460
your head or whatever.
Okay.

3387
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:16,880
And you're gonna fucking die.
This is true.

3388
02:23:16,881 --> 02:23:18,800
Like I'm just stupid to remember what he
said.

3389
02:23:18,910 --> 02:23:20,030
Right.
So he's like,

3390
02:23:20,031 --> 02:23:20,780
I was like,
doc,

3391
02:23:20,781 --> 02:23:21,230
you know,
if I,

3392
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:23,390
I can't fuck,
I don't want to live.

3393
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:24,650
This is the guy's like,
all right,

3394
02:23:24,710 --> 02:23:28,040
there is one way you get.
You can do it when you take the Viagra.

3395
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:33,160
Okay.
You have to be on the bottom and you 

3396
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:33,160
have to be laying down.
It's all about standing up so it doesn't

3397
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:37,841
fucking rush down.
So you've got to lay down and you can 

3398
02:23:37,841 --> 02:23:37,850
have this girl ride you,
but you have for four hours.

3399
02:23:37,851 --> 02:23:39,910
You have to lay in this bed.
And he's like,

3400
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:41,030
done,
I'm doing it.

3401
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:42,260
This is how much this guy like,
he goes,

3402
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:43,520
I can't get a pussy.

3403
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:44,450
I don't want to live.
Right.

3404
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:49,840
So he's fucking lay in and this girl 
rides him and he lays there for four 

3405
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:50,390
hours,
has no fucking problem.

3406
02:23:50,391 --> 02:23:50,650
This,
this,

3407
02:23:50,651 --> 02:23:52,310
this thing.
And then he starts getting cocky.

3408
02:23:52,430 --> 02:23:57,430
Three and a half hours,
three hours that's going on the 

3409
02:23:57,430 --> 02:24:00,131
computer.
Sometimes it gets up to early and he's 

3410
02:24:00,131 --> 02:24:00,410
getting light headed and shit.
And he goes,

3411
02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:02,960
I didn't think anything about it.
And uh,

3412
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:07,990
he fucking was walking up a flight of 
stairs and it just went black and he was

3413
02:24:08,031 --> 02:24:11,180
fucking unconscious.
And the only thing that saved him was he

3414
02:24:11,181 --> 02:24:16,181
fell backwards down the stairs and his 
legs were pulling it up and the blood 

3415
02:24:16,181 --> 02:24:17,930
came down.
At that point,

3416
02:24:17,931 --> 02:24:20,360
my fucking career banging.
It's over

3417
02:24:21,340 --> 02:24:24,000
and this guy,
I'll tell you who you know,

3418
02:24:24,001 --> 02:24:29,001
the guy,
I'll tell you who it is like you know 

3419
02:24:29,001 --> 02:24:29,001
afterwards and have him tell you the 
story.

3420
02:24:29,001 --> 02:24:29,670
Is it Ralphie?
May,

3421
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,020
Huh?
No,

3422
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:33,030
no.
That didn't sound like Ralphie did it.

3423
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:34,630
That was like Ralphie and witness 
protection.

3424
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:35,180
No,
I'm just,

3425
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:40,060
I just threw a guy out there and try to 
get you to tell me who was it,

3426
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:41,560
Jay more.
I'll tell you.

3427
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:44,960
He had to get his stomach staple.
Jade.

3428
02:24:44,961 --> 02:24:45,710
A little beer.
Wait,

3429
02:24:45,711 --> 02:24:46,070
that was it.

3430
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:49,690
He got it off.
You know who was it?

3431
02:24:51,250 --> 02:24:53,370
I'm not sure I would know him.
No,

3432
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:54,310
you know,
actually I don't.

3433
02:24:54,580 --> 02:24:56,920
I'm not sure that you would know a 
Boston guy.

3434
02:24:57,790 --> 02:24:59,070
Why are you going to Indianapolis,
Joe?

3435
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:06,620
I'm telling jokes with Tony Hinchcliffe.
We're going to be at the theater April 

3436
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:07,930
sixth.
I'm alright man.

3437
02:25:07,931 --> 02:25:09,190
You don't have to tell me who the fuck 
it is.

3438
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:11,480
That stomach stapling thing though.
Air.

3439
02:25:12,300 --> 02:25:17,300
I'll wait.
I'll wait when I'm outside thunder dome 

3440
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:17,300
here.
I'll tweet the results.

3441
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:17,840
The um.
No,

3442
02:25:17,841 --> 02:25:18,900
I wouldn't do that to.
Yeah you would.

3443
02:25:18,980 --> 02:25:20,580
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't.

3444
02:25:20,890 --> 02:25:22,440
No.
I contacted rise a close.

3445
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:22,700
They were,

3446
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:30,160
you want me to turn off the podcast 
member when it used to kiss my camera,

3447
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:31,690
you're,
you'd be like Brian,

3448
02:25:31,691 --> 02:25:36,691
turn off the camera and that really 
meant Brian Act like you're turning off 

3449
02:25:36,691 --> 02:25:39,721
the camera.
But it got to the point where I would 

3450
02:25:39,721 --> 02:25:39,721
just act like I kissed the camera.
I'm like,

3451
02:25:39,721 --> 02:25:39,721
okay,
it's off now.

3452
02:25:39,721 --> 02:25:44,460
And no one really caught it to any 
anybody sketchy that wanted to like hide

3453
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:51,810
some information.
Door cameras on hog checks in the mail 

3454
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:55,780
site is secure.
That's the new vista.

3455
02:25:55,781 --> 02:25:57,800
New a check's in the mail.
This,

3456
02:25:57,820 --> 02:26:01,720
this site is totally secure with those 
hacker fuckers isn't.

3457
02:26:01,770 --> 02:26:06,770
Nothing's ever secure anymore.
The guy who built it has some sort of 

3458
02:26:06,770 --> 02:26:09,340
backdoor.
That's how he gets pussy the back door.

3459
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:11,920
The back door

3460
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:13,430
happened with us at a,
on it,

3461
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:16,640
at the audit.com
is we uh,

3462
02:26:16,670 --> 02:26:19,190
hired a guy to do some coding for us,
for the,

3463
02:26:19,191 --> 02:26:20,240
um,
for the,

3464
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:25,350
like a gift certificates and stuff like 
that for the website and to set it up so

3465
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:30,380
you can gift people things.
So this guy decided to outsource the 

3466
02:26:30,741 --> 02:26:35,741
coding.
So we didn't even know we thought that 

3467
02:26:35,741 --> 02:26:36,620
this guy who was a reliable guy was 
going to do the coding,

3468
02:26:36,770 --> 02:26:39,890
but what he did was he got his online 
friend from Vietnam,

3469
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:44,210
gave him the password to the,
to the servers and allowed him to do the

3470
02:26:44,211 --> 02:26:49,211
coding and this guy went in and just 
started downloading all the credit card 

3471
02:26:49,211 --> 02:26:53,351
information and so the FBI we had to 
bringing the FBI to find out and it went

3472
02:26:53,571 --> 02:26:58,571
through this guy and we found out that 
that's apparently like super common 

3473
02:26:58,571 --> 02:26:59,180
because if you're paying this guy x 
amount per hour,

3474
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:01,480
he can go to Vietnam and say,
Hey vic,

3475
02:27:01,550 --> 02:27:03,410
my Vietnamese friend,
I'll give you a,

3476
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:08,500
you know,
half that you do all the work so it's 

3477
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:08,690
got kicks back,
collects fat checks,

3478
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:11,510
doesn't do a goddamn thing.
That's apparently super common.

3479
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:12,380
This outsourcing.

3480
02:27:12,510 --> 02:27:17,510
Yeah.
That's why you never never used your 

3481
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:17,510
debit card ever.
Really.

3482
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:18,330
It's your money.
Something happens.

3483
02:27:18,331 --> 02:27:21,030
That's you.
That's almost to a credit card.

3484
02:27:21,031 --> 02:27:22,590
Credit card.
That's the house's money.

3485
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:24,240
I'm not saying to rack it all the way 
up.

3486
02:27:24,241 --> 02:27:29,241
I got a buddy,
might've prosecutes identity theft and 

3487
02:27:29,241 --> 02:27:29,241
this is some real shit.
This is real talk.

3488
02:27:29,241 --> 02:27:32,750
Yo.
I'll always use,

3489
02:27:33,150 --> 02:27:35,220
always use.
If someone's going to double swipe it,

3490
02:27:35,221 --> 02:27:37,830
you want it to be their money,
so then they call up and they're like,

3491
02:27:37,831 --> 02:27:39,420
did you get a lap dance in Toronto?
No,

3492
02:27:39,421 --> 02:27:41,790
I did not have fun with that Shit.
I'm out.

3493
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:45,300
If you use your debit card now they got 
you.

3494
02:27:45,301 --> 02:27:50,301
They got your card and then it's like 
you have to go down to the fucking bank 

3495
02:27:50,301 --> 02:27:52,971
and be like,
I didn't spend 65 bucks at an auto zone 

3496
02:27:52,971 --> 02:27:52,971
and all of that shit and you have to.

3497
02:27:52,971 --> 02:27:55,260
You have to go.
Rather than it being a quick phone call,

3498
02:27:55,350 --> 02:27:57,540
you have to go through all of this 
bullshit.

3499
02:27:57,570 --> 02:28:00,120
So it's still protected by the Visa 
Card.

3500
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:03,180
That's why the visa card logos on there.
So the same rules apply.

3501
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:06,310
Well protected.
It's if it's not good,

3502
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,830
I just.
One of those things I don't want to fuck

3503
02:28:07,831 --> 02:28:09,390
with.
I mean if you want to do it that way,

3504
02:28:09,450 --> 02:28:14,450
absolutely.
It's definitely better to do it through 

3505
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:14,450
American Express or someone,
a phone call.

3506
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:15,510
I know it was.
Somebody had it recently.

3507
02:28:15,511 --> 02:28:16,990
They had to go down to the bank bag

3508
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:21,260
and I'm just so fucking lazy.
My identity.

3509
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:21,920
Jesus Christ,

3510
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:24,140
I don't want go down to the bag.
I got mine.

3511
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:27,200
I know what happened with me.
It was at a gas station because I didn't

3512
02:28:27,201 --> 02:28:32,201
use it for anything else.
And then all of a sudden I started 

3513
02:28:32,201 --> 02:28:34,070
getting these messages were they were 
saying or were you buying chocolate?

3514
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:34,970
And I was like,
what?

3515
02:28:34,990 --> 02:28:35,770
That's like,
yeah,

3516
02:28:35,771 --> 02:28:37,540
it was good dive a chocolate,
uh,

3517
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:39,500
like gift certificates for like 100 
bucks,

3518
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:40,900
500 bucks.
I'm like,

3519
02:28:41,390 --> 02:28:42,740
not that special.
It's like a lot.

3520
02:28:42,741 --> 02:28:47,741
It was like $500 with chocolate.
You're trying to get somebody's risk 

3521
02:28:47,741 --> 02:28:48,080
going to jail or like,
you know what?

3522
02:28:48,081 --> 02:28:50,120
I'm going to do godiva chocolate.
Let's hit their first.

3523
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:55,180
Well No.
The reason why they do that is to get 

3524
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:55,180
gift certificates.
That's what they were doing.

3525
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:55,490
They were getting gift.
So when they get the money and then they

3526
02:28:55,491 --> 02:28:56,200
say,
hey man,

3527
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,570
I'm doing the black voice and I don't 
know why I go to a white guy,

3528
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,600
hey man,
would you like $500 worth of Godiva 

3529
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:06,290
chocolates for 50 bucks?
And so they could sell that for 50 bucks

3530
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:07,880
on Ebay.
That's another thing.

3531
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:08,890
Yeah,
that's a good one too

3532
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:12,820
is they use the gift certificate and 
they don't use all of it and they try to

3533
02:29:12,821 --> 02:29:13,630
get the change back.

3534
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:15,450
Can you do that?
You can in some places,

3535
02:29:15,451 --> 02:29:16,440
some places you could do.
Yeah,

3536
02:29:16,570 --> 02:29:17,570
you can.
In some places.

3537
02:29:17,571 --> 02:29:20,030
I've seen people do that before.
You can do that in some ways,

3538
02:29:20,031 --> 02:29:22,130
but a lot of ways they said no,
it's a store credit.

3539
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:27,170
I got a buddy who's a lawyer whenever I 
go into the time where he prosecutes 

3540
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:27,620
because he's the shit I,
I,

3541
02:29:27,621 --> 02:29:32,621
if I have time,
if you just sit there and you watch a 

3542
02:29:32,621 --> 02:29:32,621
case,
it's,

3543
02:29:32,621 --> 02:29:32,740
it's fucking unreal.

3544
02:29:33,210 --> 02:29:34,350
Yeah.
It must be weird though,

3545
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:36,510
but what have you seen?
You've seen like a real one,

3546
02:29:36,511 --> 02:29:37,270
like a murder case.

3547
02:29:37,970 --> 02:29:42,970
One I saw drug line and like it was just
fascinating because like the first guy 

3548
02:29:43,351 --> 02:29:48,351
he brings up,
the prosecutor stewed I know was a 

3549
02:29:48,351 --> 02:29:49,950
moron,
a fucking moron.

3550
02:29:49,951 --> 02:29:51,990
And he's sitting there big,
this cop idiot.

3551
02:29:52,110 --> 02:29:54,870
And the dude literally goes like 
handsomeness.

3552
02:29:54,871 --> 02:29:56,280
He goes,
do you recognize this?

3553
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,650
And he looks at the piece of paper and 
he goes out,

3554
02:29:58,710 --> 02:30:00,060
no I don't.
And they go,

3555
02:30:00,061 --> 02:30:05,061
uh,
that's your police report that that's 

3556
02:30:05,061 --> 02:30:05,061
how bad this guy was.
And I was like,

3557
02:30:05,061 --> 02:30:08,151
oh my God,
my buddy's going to get crushed in this 

3558
02:30:08,151 --> 02:30:08,151
one.
But like when it was over,

3559
02:30:08,151 --> 02:30:08,190
he came up to me,
he goes,

3560
02:30:08,191 --> 02:30:09,120
how'd you like that?
And I was like,

3561
02:30:09,121 --> 02:30:10,610
that seemed awfully guess now,
don't worry.

3562
02:30:10,611 --> 02:30:12,360
He goes,
I always start off with the weakest one.

3563
02:30:12,361 --> 02:30:17,361
It gets the other people confident and 
then it's almost like a comedy show to 

3564
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:17,361
start off with the fucking open 
microphone.

3565
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:22,240
And then they.
And then they slowly bring the new 

3566
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,761
surround and then they actually,
it was an arraignment to see if it was 

3567
02:30:25,761 --> 02:30:25,900
supposed to go to trial.
And uh,

3568
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:29,100
the dude,
they actually had enough so this guy was

3569
02:30:29,101 --> 02:30:34,101
going to trial and when he,
in the end he walked by and he said to 

3570
02:30:34,101 --> 02:30:34,101
my buddy,
goes,

3571
02:30:34,101 --> 02:30:34,920
I'm taking this all the way,
like,

3572
02:30:34,921 --> 02:30:39,921
is he like,
I'm fighting this all the way to the 

3573
02:30:39,921 --> 02:30:39,921
top.
Like it dude,

3574
02:30:39,921 --> 02:30:39,921
it was the sickest drama

3575
02:30:39,921 --> 02:30:43,810
like ever.
And there was a couple of old people in 

3576
02:30:43,810 --> 02:30:43,810
there.
I'm like,

3577
02:30:43,810 --> 02:30:43,810
do they like not have cable?
And they just come down here and they're

3578
02:30:43,810 --> 02:30:43,850
like,
yeah,

3579
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:46,910
they come down and they want.
I felt bad.

3580
02:30:46,911 --> 02:30:51,911
Like I'm like,
this guy could go to jail and I'm 

3581
02:30:51,911 --> 02:30:51,911
sitting here being entertained by this.
I wanted to see like,

3582
02:30:51,911 --> 02:30:51,911
okay,
I'm supporting my buddy.

3583
02:30:51,911 --> 02:30:54,710
But like it was,
it was really like,

3584
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:59,890
was fucking unreal.
It was way better than like even on the 

3585
02:30:59,890 --> 02:30:59,890
TV.
And they wrap it up,

3586
02:30:59,890 --> 02:31:01,050
didn't.
She said,

3587
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:02,510
you know,
when they do this stupid like,

3588
02:31:02,511 --> 02:31:07,511
you know,
you just yell at somebody the best to 

3589
02:31:07,511 --> 02:31:07,840
actually see that the way that they do 
do

3590
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,710
it,
it's still,

3591
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:11,230
it's what it is,
is you slow.

3592
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:13,450
It's like a Boa constrictor.
Every time you exhale,

3593
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:18,720
the prosecution just gets a little 
tighter and tighter and you see the 

3594
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,100
person sitting at their body language.
They're all confident and 10 is an

3595
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:24,090
evidence is getting introduced.
You see them start kind of sitting up.

3596
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:27,660
They start doing it is fucking.
It's unreal.

3597
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:29,790
It's unreal.
Human drama,

3598
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:30,570
right?
It's hard to.

3599
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:35,600
Hard to deny somebody freedom.
I don't think I'll ever do it again 

3600
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:39,621
because I felt bad because it was.
It was unbelievably in a fucked up way 

3601
02:31:39,621 --> 02:31:42,690
was it was riveting,
was fucking riveting.

3602
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:49,070
Did you see that case with that chick 
who was accused of killing her roommate 

3603
02:31:49,070 --> 02:31:49,920
in Italy?
She was acquitted because there was some

3604
02:31:49,921 --> 02:31:54,921
sort of a problem with the evidence.
Now they're trying to retire and now 

3605
02:31:54,921 --> 02:31:54,921
she's in Seattle.
They go,

3606
02:31:54,921 --> 02:31:54,921
we're going to.
We're going to try it again.

3607
02:31:54,921 --> 02:31:56,790
Come on back to Italy.
Fuck yourself.

3608
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:02,520
While the United States not going to 
extradite her either because of the 

3609
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,350
first case was over,
there is no way I could ever sleep again

3610
02:32:04,351 --> 02:32:05,830
if that happened to me and they'll 
execute.

3611
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:07,110
Mentioned it.
It's just a country.

3612
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:09,210
Could you imagine if she actually killed
her and got away with it?

3613
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:11,670
Absolutely.
Creeping around Seattle.

3614
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:13,550
Well,
what if I just.

3615
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:15,870
Let me just.
Let's just go with my comedy angle here.

3616
02:32:18,090 --> 02:32:19,830
Dude.
You're just sleeping in Seattle.

3617
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:22,590
Just like Tom Hanks and Melanie 
Griffith,

3618
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:23,850
bless whoever.
Right?

3619
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:27,800
Throwing kicks in the night.
Right?

3620
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:31,150
And you just go to sleep every night 
knowing this,

3621
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:36,170
a country that's out to get you.
It's an entire fucking country wants to 

3622
02:32:36,170 --> 02:32:38,640
get you.
And so they're pulling every.

3623
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:43,050
It's like conversations going on in 
Washington dc about you go,

3624
02:32:43,051 --> 02:32:44,100
come on man.
Look.

3625
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:46,980
Who Do you want for this girl?
Who Do you want for Joe Rogan?

3626
02:32:46,981 --> 02:32:50,280
Like they're trading.
You write like a baseball card.

3627
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:52,950
Alright,
you got a political prisoner.

3628
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:55,960
We want for them,
but I'm not giving you phone.

3629
02:32:56,010 --> 02:32:57,410
I'll give you three and you're sitting 
there.

3630
02:32:57,411 --> 02:33:01,260
Then one day that fucking van pulls up.
Dude,

3631
02:33:01,261 --> 02:33:01,860
I,
I,

3632
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:07,060
you know,
I would have a cyanide pill on me at 

3633
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:07,060
all.
Even if I was wearing a tank top,

3634
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:10,941
I'd have it in a little scraps.
I just run to the ocean and swim as far 

3635
02:33:10,941 --> 02:33:11,160
as I could afford.

3636
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:16,160
Drone.
Want to grow up my own shield to 

3637
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:17,120
straight out,
see how far I could get.

3638
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:20,510
Tried to swim to fucking Australia.
I'll do it.

3639
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:22,540
You didn't have so much hate.
You fish with him.

3640
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:25,840
You never.
You never leave home base.

3641
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:27,870
Like you have to stay within the herd 
over here.

3642
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:32,990
You got to be in.
You can't be that little fucking thing 

3643
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:35,091
running on the side of the hurt.
Can't even go up to Canada for fucking 

3644
02:33:35,091 --> 02:33:38,271
hockey game.
Who knows what happens when you go 

3645
02:33:38,271 --> 02:33:38,271
through customs?
True.

3646
02:33:38,271 --> 02:33:38,490
Okay.
And she's right there.

3647
02:33:38,730 --> 02:33:41,040
I would be sitting there going like,
what have I got hammered one night and I

3648
02:33:41,041 --> 02:33:46,041
started driving up the five and I wasn't
paying attention and I fucking went 

3649
02:33:46,041 --> 02:33:49,761
through customs and the recipe for 
drinking and driving and then they got 

3650
02:33:49,761 --> 02:33:49,761
some.
They're in bed with the Italians because

3651
02:33:49,761 --> 02:33:51,420
they don't have good pasta up there.
They fucking hook them up.

3652
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:57,060
Next thing you know,
you're getting flied back in Vancouver,

3653
02:33:57,061 --> 02:33:57,930
Vancouver.
Okay.

3654
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:58,800
Right there.
And you just,

3655
02:33:58,801 --> 02:34:03,340
you're in that fucking jumpsuit like.
And then you,

3656
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:04,770
you know,
when you're sitting there,

3657
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:07,080
all you're thinking about it was at that
schwartzenegger movie,

3658
02:34:07,081 --> 02:34:12,081
the raw deal where he knocked the guy 
out with the elbow and then climb down 

3659
02:34:12,081 --> 02:34:12,930
the fucking landing gear and you land in
the marsh.

3660
02:34:13,330 --> 02:34:14,090
Right?
Right.

3661
02:34:14,250 --> 02:34:17,160
That's why I would be thinking of,
is that doable?

3662
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:21,220
Doable.
I know you just go like this.

3663
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:24,040
You Cross your arms like this and you 
just,

3664
02:34:24,150 --> 02:34:29,150
you jump in.
Do you ever watch any of those shows 

3665
02:34:29,150 --> 02:34:30,760
where people have to live in the woods 
like those Alaska,

3666
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:35,790
the last frontier type shows we're 
picking out like in 1963 snowmobile all 

3667
02:34:40,050 --> 02:34:41,920
the way over here to get an English 
muffin.

3668
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:50,220
Make your own English buffet date.
They are literally burning 3000 calories

3669
02:34:52,750 --> 02:34:55,070
to get five,
1500.

3670
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:59,500
How do you stay?
How you stay nourished?

3671
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:01,580
It's very hard when it's really cold.
Now you,

3672
02:35:01,581 --> 02:35:06,581
you get so fucking hungry because your 
body burns off so much fuel just to try 

3673
02:35:06,581 --> 02:35:06,581
to stay warm.
Oh yeah.

3674
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:07,510
Yeah.
They're fucked.

3675
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:08,310
Do we?
We got it.

3676
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:11,560
We got to do a new exercise video.
Just parachute out of this business.

3677
02:35:11,561 --> 02:35:13,780
We'll just do like the Alaskan workout.
You're telling me what to do.

3678
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:18,780
I'll do it now.
So what you do is you just stick people 

3679
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:19,630
in these extreme conditions,
like when it's snowing out near a mall.

3680
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:21,520
I mean you're right near Shit.
There's an ambulance there,

3681
02:35:21,521 --> 02:35:26,521
but he just make him keep going up and 
down the hill like as far as that guy 

3682
02:35:26,521 --> 02:35:26,890
goes in the middle of Alaska.
You just like,

3683
02:35:26,891 --> 02:35:28,540
dude,
you can't come back to civilization.

3684
02:35:28,541 --> 02:35:30,370
That's right there.
You can literally see a JC penny,

3685
02:35:30,371 --> 02:35:33,260
but we're not fucking letting you back 
until you go up and down this mountain a

3686
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:34,960
Zillion fucking times and that you have 
though.

3687
02:35:34,961 --> 02:35:37,390
They'll burn all that stuff and then you
take them over to the orange.

3688
02:35:37,391 --> 02:35:42,391
Julius [inaudible] sounds like prison.
That doesn't sound like a real workout 

3689
02:35:42,391 --> 02:35:44,050
exercise.
Video is slowly working towards that.

3690
02:35:44,750 --> 02:35:49,750
Like this is stupid.
What people are doing is they're just 

3691
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:52,771
blowing out their joints.
Like if you just knew how to fucking 

3692
02:35:52,771 --> 02:35:52,771
eat,
you don't have to go like,

3693
02:35:52,771 --> 02:35:54,580
these people are going to need hip 
replacement.

3694
02:35:54,581 --> 02:35:57,100
You don't go on a fucking elliptical in 
for an hour straight.

3695
02:35:57,101 --> 02:35:59,710
Do the exact same motion.
You're going to have the running the the

3696
02:35:59,711 --> 02:36:03,340
hips of James Brown to machines.
Not Bad for.

3697
02:36:03,341 --> 02:36:04,570
It's horrific.
Really.

3698
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:06,090
I have momentum.
Don't fuck with me.

3699
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:07,260
I never read.
I don't read.

3700
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:09,280
I just don't want to give anybody any 
shitty advice.

3701
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:14,470
While people text,
you shouldn't have asked me what I'm all

3702
02:36:14,471 --> 02:36:14,770
about.

3703
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:23,370
I don't think like it's bad for your 
body.

3704
02:36:24,050 --> 02:36:24,790
Well,
let's look it up.

3705
02:36:24,791 --> 02:36:29,590
Let's find out everything in moderation.
It elliptical,

3706
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:30,590
bad for hips.
Okay,

3707
02:36:30,610 --> 02:36:35,610
let's check it out.
I think the whole baby boomer 

3708
02:36:35,610 --> 02:36:35,830
generation,
they're all getting hip replacements and

3709
02:36:35,831 --> 02:36:36,480
knee,
knee,

3710
02:36:36,481 --> 02:36:40,180
a knee replacement,
osteoarthritis of the hip and the leg.

3711
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:41,830
Elliptical,
exercising.

3712
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:43,450
Oh my God.
You might be onto something.

3713
02:36:43,480 --> 02:36:46,060
I've been told by four surgeons.
Check this out.

3714
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:47,470
We'll do it.
Even the work that you're doing,

3715
02:36:47,471 --> 02:36:52,471
well,
you have to fucking consume a whale's 

3716
02:36:52,471 --> 02:36:52,471
worth official oil everyday.
She can brush your teeth.

3717
02:36:52,471 --> 02:36:53,410
I mean,
there's got to be like,

3718
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:55,360
Oh yeah,
I'm a nominal fucking shape,

3719
02:36:55,361 --> 02:37:00,361
but it's just like,
you know those joints got to last you 

3720
02:37:00,361 --> 02:37:00,361
for rent.
Well,

3721
02:37:00,361 --> 02:37:02,210
you know what the reality is is we're 
all going to be on roids soon.

3722
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:04,840
They're already doing it with old people
that synergenic late at night.

3723
02:37:04,841 --> 02:37:06,520
When they show those guys,
that's hgh.

3724
02:37:06,521 --> 02:37:09,850
They just run up old people.
I'm on that.

3725
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:12,730
I'm on.
I'm on human growth hormone and I'm on a

3726
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:14,680
testosterone,
so are you finding your organs?

3727
02:37:14,681 --> 02:37:15,990
They're getting bigger.
Just can you

3728
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:17,500
button your shirts anymore?
No,

3729
02:37:17,501 --> 02:37:17,900
no,
no,

3730
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:18,980
no.
Do you could.

3731
02:37:18,981 --> 02:37:23,981
If you went crazy and took like 
bodybuilding size doses of that Chevy 

3732
02:37:23,981 --> 02:37:28,571
once in a while you do is you slowly go 
down and you have that private pilot 

3733
02:37:28,571 --> 02:37:28,571
look on your face and then your wife's.

3734
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:33,760
I'm already in a world of shit.
I am with.

3735
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:39,140
The idea is to give your body these a 
bioidentical hormones that are the same 

3736
02:37:39,451 --> 02:37:44,100
level of the hormones when you were 
young and it gets so much more energy.

3737
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:45,870
I mean it's.
It's amazing how much better you feel.

3738
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:48,180
It's a very controversial thing.
Some people say,

3739
02:37:48,181 --> 02:37:50,550
well,
you should be worried about what happens

3740
02:37:51,180 --> 02:37:53,130
to your body or be at the forefront of 
anything,

3741
02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:58,250
but you're not.
People have been doing this for a long 

3742
02:37:58,250 --> 02:37:58,250
fucking time.
Would you have to worry about as abuse,

3743
02:37:58,250 --> 02:38:02,600
like anything,
as long as the most important thing is 

3744
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:04,611
you get your blood work done,
go do it with an ethical doctor and you 

3745
02:38:04,611 --> 02:38:06,800
can't be one of those people that the 
outsource is your blood tests like that.

3746
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,950
It's local,
but you have to worry about,

3747
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,300
um,
it's clean.

3748
02:38:13,050 --> 02:38:15,210
Yeah.
You have to worry about abuse.

3749
02:38:15,450 --> 02:38:18,150
If a person's impulsive,
they essentially,

3750
02:38:18,151 --> 02:38:21,180
they'll give you this testosterone cream
that you rub on you.

3751
02:38:21,330 --> 02:38:26,330
If you're a nut,
he just fucking take four times that 

3752
02:38:26,330 --> 02:38:26,330
dose and rub it on yourself and all of a
sudden you're like,

3753
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,720
Dick's,
like a fucking crowbar.

3754
02:38:28,730 --> 02:38:33,730
And you're,
you're red lining your adrenal system 

3755
02:38:33,730 --> 02:38:33,730
and your,
your,

3756
02:38:33,730 --> 02:38:33,730
uh,
your endocrine system.

3757
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:38,780
You don't want to do that.
You want to make sure that you do 

3758
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:38,780
exactly what you're supposed to.
Like.

3759
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:41,280
It's very minimum doses.
Like the way Keith Richards does blow.

3760
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,940
Yeah.
He probably like legend.

3761
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:45,250
Barely though.
We used to be.

3762
02:38:45,890 --> 02:38:46,640
I read his book,
man.

3763
02:38:46,641 --> 02:38:47,240
It was great.
He goes,

3764
02:38:47,630 --> 02:38:49,070
he goes,
I had that bad period.

3765
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:51,500
And that just followed me forever.
He goes,

3766
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:53,150
all these people who died,
he goes,

3767
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:57,320
you don't do a line of coke and just sit
there and do another one.

3768
02:38:57,321 --> 02:38:58,660
He goes,
you walk around and Blah Blah.

3769
02:38:58,661 --> 02:38:59,890
A couple more hours.
You take another.

3770
02:38:59,910 --> 02:39:01,310
Like he's very,
like,

3771
02:39:01,730 --> 02:39:04,480
he knew how to do it.
Slashes book was another one where he,

3772
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:07,190
he knew how to do it.
Like he was,

3773
02:39:07,310 --> 02:39:12,310
you know,
some people just use comedy as a 

3774
02:39:12,310 --> 02:39:13,781
stepping stone to get to acting.
And then there's people who just love 

3775
02:39:13,781 --> 02:39:13,781
it.
Like I love seeing the mic stand,

3776
02:39:13,781 --> 02:39:17,981
you know,
when there's nobody in there and it's 

3777
02:39:17,981 --> 02:39:17,981
lit and shit.
And I got hurt.

3778
02:39:17,981 --> 02:39:19,280
I love it.
Slash it gets a junkie.

3779
02:39:19,281 --> 02:39:21,740
Like I was reading it,
it was like he made it sound.

3780
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:23,870
He goes,
I love the whole thing.

3781
02:39:23,871 --> 02:39:25,870
I'd love copying the stuff.
I hope I'm not misquoting,

3782
02:39:25,910 --> 02:39:30,910
but it was basically the gist.
I love the whole cooking it up and he's 

3783
02:39:30,910 --> 02:39:30,910
like,
he goes,

3784
02:39:30,910 --> 02:39:33,610
I was really into it,
but it seemed like because you know,

3785
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:36,380
it's Kinda like a guy who just sits down
and plays drums and a guy could actually

3786
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:39,470
tune them and build a car,
whatever.

3787
02:39:40,630 --> 02:39:41,060
No,
no,

3788
02:39:41,070 --> 02:39:42,180
no.
You make a lot of sense.

3789
02:39:42,181 --> 02:39:45,170
And it's also,
I think if you're a guy who is well,

3790
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:47,730
like for us stand up comics,
there's not like,

3791
02:39:47,731 --> 02:39:49,110
oh,
history of heroin use,

3792
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:51,840
but for musicians,
Jesus Christ,

3793
02:39:51,841 --> 02:39:53,970
I mean how many great musicians,
Kurt cobain,

3794
02:39:53,971 --> 02:39:54,810
et Cetera,
et cetera.

3795
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:57,660
How many great musicians also had heroin
problems.

3796
02:39:57,870 --> 02:40:00,780
And I think there's a connection there.
That was the guy from Alice and chains.

3797
02:40:00,781 --> 02:40:03,000
Layne Staley,
huge heroin addict.

3798
02:40:03,001 --> 02:40:05,580
I mean there's so many great musicians 
that were also

3799
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:08,830
chunk.
Why you would ever fuck at this point.

3800
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:09,460
This just

3801
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:12,320
so much evidence that's fucking terrible
for you.

3802
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,040
Um,
I think

3803
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,280
it's supposed to be an unbelievably 
amazing feeling.

3804
02:40:17,350 --> 02:40:17,840
It's really fun.

3805
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:19,720
I,
I can move it where he's just like,

3806
02:40:19,721 --> 02:40:20,710
I'm going to do it when I'm 80.

3807
02:40:22,510 --> 02:40:24,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3808
02:40:24,650 --> 02:40:25,850
I feel that.
Well,

3809
02:40:25,851 --> 02:40:26,960
didn't,
didn't stand up.

3810
02:40:26,961 --> 02:40:28,970
Have a bit about something along those 
lines.

3811
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:34,050
Stand home.
I'm a bit about the really dangerous 

3812
02:40:34,050 --> 02:40:37,241
drugs,
like save them for when you're like 

3813
02:40:37,241 --> 02:40:37,241
really old.
The ones that kill people,

3814
02:40:37,241 --> 02:40:37,241
you know,
like when it doesn't matter anymore.

3815
02:40:37,241 --> 02:40:38,030
I forgot,
right.

3816
02:40:38,031 --> 02:40:40,450
Maybe you stand on,
but I've been told by for this,

3817
02:40:40,490 --> 02:40:45,490
we should go back to this elliptical 
thing so people know I'm for surgeons 

3818
02:40:45,490 --> 02:40:49,391
that looked in the x rays and say I have
osteoarthritis and need a total hip 

3819
02:40:49,391 --> 02:40:49,391
replacement.
I'm scheduled blah,

3820
02:40:49,391 --> 02:40:49,670
blah blah,
blah blah.

3821
02:40:49,940 --> 02:40:51,860
I used to play racquetball three to four
times a week,

3822
02:40:51,861 --> 02:40:54,200
but I had to stop.
The question is should I have,

3823
02:40:54,980 --> 02:40:56,810
should I stop using the elliptical 
machine?

3824
02:40:56,840 --> 02:40:57,700
Parental director,
director,

3825
02:40:57,720 --> 02:41:00,440
director.
That sounds like a pretty 16 condition.

3826
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:01,930
And yeah,
this is um,

3827
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:03,680
this is not what I was looking for.

3828
02:41:04,430 --> 02:41:07,430
Sorry.
Why you lift the machines are bad.

3829
02:41:07,431 --> 02:41:08,720
Okay.
Here's one that says something.

3830
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:15,340
Why elliptical machines are bad for your
body hears it says popular piece of 

3831
02:41:15,441 --> 02:41:20,441
equipment,
but it really is a elliptical machines 

3832
02:41:22,641 --> 02:41:27,641
over arrested number of calories.
Calories burned in a workout by 31 

3833
02:41:27,641 --> 02:41:27,641
percent.
Huh?

3834
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:29,180
So they don't burn nearly as much 
calories,

3835
02:41:29,270 --> 02:41:31,180
calories.
It's a,

3836
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:37,000
I love a good school.
I just want to know if it's fucking 

3837
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,371
people up doesn't seem to be due to the 
fact that you can dance during a shell 

3838
02:41:39,981 --> 02:41:44,981
when you need like a hip replacement.
Like over the years I've just kind of 

3839
02:41:44,981 --> 02:41:46,230
doing the same dance moves like prints 
James Brown.

3840
02:41:46,310 --> 02:41:48,350
They needed like replacements from 
dancing.

3841
02:41:48,650 --> 02:41:53,650
So here you are,
you're not a Hoofer prints needed a hip 

3842
02:41:53,650 --> 02:41:54,560
replacement.
But for real,

3843
02:41:54,650 --> 02:41:55,670
I thought I heard that.

3844
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:03,580
I really pay attention to how much shit 
I say and I always clarify it with.

3845
02:42:03,581 --> 02:42:04,660
I can't remember who said it.

3846
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:10,190
Well I know people would do that.
Has reportedly needed a double hip 

3847
02:42:10,190 --> 02:42:10,190
replacement.

3848
02:42:10,690 --> 02:42:11,090
Okay.
God,

3849
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:12,830
I get that.
Maybe you didn't.

3850
02:42:13,210 --> 02:42:14,470
What's that buddy?
Thank God God.

3851
02:42:14,471 --> 02:42:16,850
Just get that.
Also Lady Gaga got a hip replacement and

3852
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:19,750
I heard from somebody else cause 
sometimes they just say that were they.

3853
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:22,870
Because they can't talk anymore.
The guy may hips fucked up.

3854
02:42:22,871 --> 02:42:24,430
I'm out already.
Yeah,

3855
02:42:24,550 --> 02:42:28,130
I'm taking off the.
I got to tell you man,

3856
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:28,820
the Shit I've ever.

3857
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:33,260
Yeah.
Uh,

3858
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:37,870
apparently said something.
Yeah.

3859
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,170
He's uh,
he's,

3860
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:41,680
he's needed a hip replacement since 
2005.

3861
02:42:41,681 --> 02:42:45,280
It's saying that he learned,
he avoids it.

3862
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:46,210
Oh,
that's good.

3863
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:49,200
Every year they get better at it and 
it's like the whole hair plugs thing.

3864
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:52,870
Like I've been told by doctors that he 
needs a hip replacement.

3865
02:42:52,950 --> 02:42:57,950
Um,
the fallout from years of dancing 

3866
02:42:57,950 --> 02:42:57,950
onstage and high heeled boots.
Yep.

3867
02:42:57,950 --> 02:43:02,910
Wow.
Lady Gaga cancels entire tour prepares 

3868
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:02,910
for hip surgery.
Well,

3869
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:05,230
it might not be a replacement 
replacements.

3870
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:07,450
Rough for a young girl like that.
Um,

3871
02:43:07,451 --> 02:43:09,970
Mark Coleman,
former UFC heavyweight champion,

3872
02:43:09,971 --> 02:43:13,180
just had his hip replaced.
Fucking serious shit,

3873
02:43:13,181 --> 02:43:13,750
man.
That's a,

3874
02:43:13,751 --> 02:43:15,940
that's a rough one.
Apparently they know how to do it.

3875
02:43:16,250 --> 02:43:16,880
Got It,
got it out.

3876
02:43:16,890 --> 02:43:21,890
I had a buddy of mine,
we went to a game and he had handicap 

3877
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:22,520
plates and I thought it was like his 
grandmother's car or something.

3878
02:43:22,521 --> 02:43:22,800
He said,
no,

3879
02:43:22,801 --> 02:43:23,970
I just had my hip replacement.
I was like,

3880
02:43:23,971 --> 02:43:25,050
where?
He was like six weeks ago.

3881
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:26,460
He's just sitting there walking.
I'm like,

3882
02:43:26,461 --> 02:43:27,120
dude,
what the fuck?

3883
02:43:27,121 --> 02:43:27,510
He goes,
yeah.

3884
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:30,120
He goes,
I needed it like five years ago.

3885
02:43:30,121 --> 02:43:31,680
And the guy told me if I can tough out 
the pain,

3886
02:43:31,681 --> 02:43:33,060
just wait.
And he did.

3887
02:43:33,061 --> 02:43:35,780
And uh,
that's the thing like I'm telling you as

3888
02:43:35,790 --> 02:43:37,290
far like the hair stuff goes,
you know,

3889
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:39,190
like they're going to come up with a 
pill dude.

3890
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:42,690
But there's going to be a price you have
to pay if you want a full head of hair.

3891
02:43:42,691 --> 02:43:44,130
I think like it's,
it's like,

3892
02:43:44,131 --> 02:43:46,380
would you take a pill to get your hair 
back?

3893
02:43:46,381 --> 02:43:51,381
Right?
That like they strap you down and it's 

3894
02:43:51,381 --> 02:43:55,521
like for 90 seconds it's going to feel 
like you're fucking head's on fire is 

3895
02:43:55,521 --> 02:43:56,890
that Shit said shit grows.
But at the end you're going to have like

3896
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:57,060
games

3897
02:43:57,210 --> 02:43:59,370
show homes it 90 seconds.
Yeah.

3898
02:43:59,420 --> 02:44:01,650
No,
I've been on fire.

3899
02:44:01,730 --> 02:44:06,730
Yeah,
I would definitely do it because first 

3900
02:44:06,730 --> 02:44:08,721
of all,
90 seconds I would want to know like 

3901
02:44:08,721 --> 02:44:09,130
what they think hair on fire would feel 
like.

3902
02:44:10,220 --> 02:44:14,250
It would feel like everything else.
Everything else is so overrated.

3903
02:44:14,251 --> 02:44:16,230
Like what people talk about.
Like how much things hurt.

3904
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:21,350
Like tattoos.
I fell asleep getting tattooed to 

3905
02:44:21,350 --> 02:44:24,560
tattoos and not that painful.
This is about getting a butterfly and 

3906
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:26,610
your ass.
I've talked to my arms are sleeves.

3907
02:44:26,660 --> 02:44:29,180
I fell asleep.
Not Hard,

3908
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:30,870
but what I'm saying is if you ask some 
people,

3909
02:44:30,871 --> 02:44:31,530
they go,
oh my God,

3910
02:44:31,531 --> 02:44:34,200
it's so painful,
but it's not really that painful.

3911
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:39,540
Laser Tattoo removal supposed to be more
painful than tattooing itself.

3912
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:41,520
That's a,
that's a.

3913
02:44:41,610 --> 02:44:45,780
But I think like most people exaggerate 
about what things.

3914
02:44:46,110 --> 02:44:47,580
As long as it didn't kill you,
I'd go,

3915
02:44:47,581 --> 02:44:48,620
okay.
Ninety seconds.

3916
02:44:48,650 --> 02:44:49,990
Not that much.
I would try just to feel it.

3917
02:44:49,991 --> 02:44:50,430
It feels like.

3918
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:53,010
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

3919
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:53,760
Yeah,
you know,

3920
02:44:53,761 --> 02:44:58,761
it'd be funny is then like it would 
become like if you see a bald guy who'd 

3921
02:44:58,761 --> 02:44:58,761
be considered a pussy

3922
02:44:58,761 --> 02:45:00,740
because he can take 90 seconds.
Yeah.

3923
02:45:01,010 --> 02:45:02,660
Oh,
he's a man who accepts his feet.

3924
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:04,910
Um,
when he would argue,

3925
02:45:05,240 --> 02:45:06,860
but you know,
all those guys with the guy,

3926
02:45:06,861 --> 02:45:09,980
Smiley haircut at that point,
I can talk to them in their hair,

3927
02:45:10,250 --> 02:45:11,990
would be given them as shit.
I don't want you to do it.

3928
02:45:11,991 --> 02:45:16,991
We'll do it right here at the bar with 
their Patrick swayze roadhouse here to 

3929
02:45:16,991 --> 02:45:16,991
do it.
It'd be,

3930
02:45:16,991 --> 02:45:21,910
it'd be like the accused,
some ballgown would finally get held 

3931
02:45:21,910 --> 02:45:24,560
down.
They give them the college kid,

3932
02:45:24,561 --> 02:45:29,561
you're next.
I'm happy to do it to me in the long 

3933
02:45:29,561 --> 02:45:31,541
run,
but there really shouldn't have done it 

3934
02:45:31,541 --> 02:45:31,541
to me.
I'd like,

3935
02:45:31,541 --> 02:45:31,541
uh,
I like having my head shape now,

3936
02:45:31,541 --> 02:45:36,100
but I wouldn't do it now,
but they just see how you get more 

3937
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:36,100
active work with it.
I mean,

3938
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:39,890
I've actually,
I'm not doing anything about my hair 

3939
02:45:39,890 --> 02:45:39,890
falling out,
so eventually it's going that route.

3940
02:45:39,890 --> 02:45:41,180
And uh,
I just figured,

3941
02:45:41,181 --> 02:45:43,940
look,
I look if I was going to be a sex symbol

3942
02:45:43,950 --> 02:45:46,140
wouldn't happen by now.
I'm so clear.

3943
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:48,840
So clearly the friend.
How will you know?

3944
02:45:49,970 --> 02:45:52,220
40 four over.
It's over.

3945
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:59,500
There's nothing better than 
acknowledging that I'm keeping the rest 

3946
02:45:59,500 --> 02:45:59,500
of it looking good.
But what,

3947
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:00,680
what the fuck are you going to do?
Well,

3948
02:46:00,681 --> 02:46:05,681
I didn't acknowledge it.
I had hair transplants or they take 

3949
02:46:05,681 --> 02:46:07,130
little plastic things with hair stuck.
If you have those ones,

3950
02:46:08,130 --> 02:46:10,450
they take a slice out of the back of my 
head.

3951
02:46:10,470 --> 02:46:11,150
That one?
Yeah.

3952
02:46:11,151 --> 02:46:16,151
You take like a trip and they put it on 
the Petri dish where they just vacuum it

3953
02:46:16,561 --> 02:46:17,820
out.
They take one at a time,

3954
02:46:17,821 --> 02:46:21,430
they drop it in and see the whole.
I had a buddy of mine,

3955
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:23,280
she checks you do it,
you just fucking do it.

3956
02:46:23,281 --> 02:46:27,380
And I sat there and watched the dude.
It is a bloody fucking doesn't mess.

3957
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:28,740
Not that big a deal.
It doesn't,

3958
02:46:28,770 --> 02:46:31,130
doesn't hurt,
but I would say never do it for,

3959
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,130
for two reasons.
One,

3960
02:46:32,310 --> 02:46:37,310
because I mean I wanted to shave my head
and I have this big stupid smile on the 

3961
02:46:37,310 --> 02:46:37,310
back of my head,
but two,

3962
02:46:37,310 --> 02:46:40,200
because the just shave your fucking 
head.

3963
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:42,690
So it's really not that big a deal.
Once you do it,

3964
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:44,610
he'd go,
why would I ever get a haircut again?

3965
02:46:44,611 --> 02:46:49,611
So stupid.
It's like really getting attached to 

3966
02:46:49,611 --> 02:46:49,920
just some shit that grows out of your 
head is so weird.

3967
02:46:49,921 --> 02:46:52,350
You know?
It's the worst one is a fucking toupee.

3968
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:56,250
Like this hat you just can't take off.
Like how fucking sweaty.

3969
02:46:57,420 --> 02:46:59,850
Especially if you exercise like you ever
see those hair from him.

3970
02:47:00,090 --> 02:47:03,310
Those guys are fucking playing tennis 
and Shit and run and sweat.

3971
02:47:03,311 --> 02:47:06,120
And what is it they just.
So it's like a weave for guys.

3972
02:47:06,121 --> 02:47:07,040
Yeah.
Well you're,

3973
02:47:07,110 --> 02:47:07,290
you're

3974
02:47:07,550 --> 02:47:08,370
sitting here.
Um,

3975
02:47:08,430 --> 02:47:09,080
uh,
I,

3976
02:47:09,081 --> 02:47:14,081
I was,
when I was a young man when I was 

3977
02:47:14,081 --> 02:47:14,630
worried that I was going to go bald,
I thought about all the possibilities.

3978
02:47:14,631 --> 02:47:19,631
I looked into everything.
I wanted to find out what everything 

3979
02:47:19,631 --> 02:47:19,631
was,
but the hair club for men,

3980
02:47:19,631 --> 02:47:19,700
one,
some of them,

3981
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:24,760
they,
they're like your existing hair goes 

3982
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:27,221
through it.
So it's like a thing that they lay on 

3983
02:47:27,221 --> 02:47:27,350
top of you and your hair goes through 
it.

3984
02:47:27,351 --> 02:47:30,850
So it's some of your hair and some of 
the fake hair and then they kind of like

3985
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:35,860
glue it on its death.
I had a friend who had one for a long 

3986
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:37,180
time and then he,
uh,

3987
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:39,470
he abandoned it.
So few.

3988
02:47:39,471 --> 02:47:41,030
I actually know quite a few people that 
have had them,

3989
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:46,420
but it's a,
it's a girl's fucking sweaty thing and 

3990
02:47:46,420 --> 02:47:49,450
once you just accept it,
like you get used to the fact that you 

3991
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:49,450
don't have your hair anymore.
It's like,

3992
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:50,780
it's so freeing.
Like once I shaved my head,

3993
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:56,020
I got to the point where even though I 
had hair transplants is still look like 

3994
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:56,020
shit.
I was like,

3995
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:56,020
you know what,

3996
02:47:56,580 --> 02:47:59,160
the stuff in the back never comes out.
So we put it up here.

3997
02:47:59,510 --> 02:47:59,910
It's like,
well,

3998
02:47:59,911 --> 02:48:01,350
the rest of this shit is going to fall 
out.

3999
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:03,580
So then what's going to happen?
And also it's like,

4000
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:07,370
I feel like I'm dropping this shit 
behind enemy lines in the safety zone

4001
02:48:07,900 --> 02:48:12,900
the way I described it as like taking a 
bunch of people who are really healthy 

4002
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:12,970
and moving them into a neighborhood 
where everyone's dying.

4003
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:13,790
You go,
it's like,

4004
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:14,980
where's Mike?
He's dead.

4005
02:48:15,100 --> 02:48:16,840
But he said he's right there.
He's gone.

4006
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:17,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

4007
02:48:17,350 --> 02:48:19,460
They fly off and they never come back.
Yeah.

4008
02:48:19,480 --> 02:48:19,990
The,
uh,

4009
02:48:19,991 --> 02:48:20,520
the,
the,

4010
02:48:20,740 --> 02:48:22,150
the,
the pills though.

4011
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:23,550
When I was going to get into it was 
like,

4012
02:48:23,650 --> 02:48:26,350
I tried propecia.
That's the shit they give you.

4013
02:48:26,351 --> 02:48:27,400
Um,
for your,

4014
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:28,250
you know,
to,

4015
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:32,080
to kill that makes your hair grow back.
It kills a whatever it is,

4016
02:48:32,081 --> 02:48:35,710
the testosterone bio.
But dht,

4017
02:48:35,770 --> 02:48:40,770
dihydrotestosterone,
dht is what apparently makes your hair 

4018
02:48:40,770 --> 02:48:41,680
fall out.
But um,

4019
02:48:41,830 --> 02:48:43,840
it also kills your Dick.
Lisa didn't mind.

4020
02:48:44,680 --> 02:48:46,300
It's all Kinda like I,
I,

4021
02:48:46,310 --> 02:48:51,310
I believe in the whole.
There's no getting your cake and eat it 

4022
02:48:51,310 --> 02:48:52,050
if you get your hair back that he got to
like,

4023
02:48:52,051 --> 02:48:55,440
you got something has to be taken away.
That's what I love about the overall arc

4024
02:48:55,441 --> 02:49:00,441
of breaking bad.
It's every thing time they get to a 

4025
02:49:00,441 --> 02:49:03,531
level,
like this is something that loses in 

4026
02:49:03,531 --> 02:49:07,070
this.
Another part of their soul gets like 

4027
02:49:07,070 --> 02:49:07,070
taken away.
And I feel like that like,

4028
02:49:07,070 --> 02:49:07,140
dude,
you have no idea.

4029
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:08,010
All these drugs.

4030
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:09,720
What the fuck this is doing to your 
liver?

4031
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:11,320
I found out the other day,
uh,

4032
02:49:11,370 --> 02:49:16,370
this stuff that rhymes with tylenol pm,
I want to get you in trouble.

4033
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:20,250
I heard like taking a couple of those is
like going on a three day bender.

4034
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:25,700
Very bad for you.
I kind of went into the drugstore in 

4035
02:49:25,700 --> 02:49:28,490
because I knew I needed some.
I still take it every once in a while 

4036
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:28,490
and they fucking,
they don't have it.

4037
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:30,950
It got recalled really random,

4038
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:34,590
right?
Pm.

4039
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:36,990
Recall liver.
Yeah.

4040
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:37,330
I'm,
I'm,

4041
02:49:37,380 --> 02:49:42,380
I'm,
I'm sure that's just fucking our friend 

4042
02:49:42,380 --> 02:49:42,610
Tim Ferris says it best.
There's no biological free lunch.

4043
02:49:43,030 --> 02:49:48,030
He's like,
anything that has a profound effect on 

4044
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:48,030
your body's most likely having some sort
of a negative effect,

4045
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:50,530
whether it's positive or negative or 
just some sort of bounced back.

4046
02:49:51,430 --> 02:49:53,440
I love it.
I love how you can't win.

4047
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:55,210
Well,
not yet,

4048
02:49:55,720 --> 02:50:00,720
but you know,
you think about what you can get away 

4049
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:00,720
with now as opposed to what you used to 
be,

4050
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:04,380
which is why they have those old guys 
that are putting them on hgh because 

4051
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:06,070
that's not for us.
That's for the fucking guys up top.

4052
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:11,110
They're using them as Guinea pigs.
Let's see if we can keep these guys 

4053
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:11,110
alive.

4054
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:11,800
You'd be amazed at how many old dudes 
are doing that shit.

4055
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:16,950
You'd be amazed how many old rich guys 
and I know that are there taking 

4056
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:16,950
testosterone replacement,

4057
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:19,300
so I suppose it was guy was a fucking 
riot.

4058
02:50:19,310 --> 02:50:22,960
He was talking about how many agents he 
knew in Hollywood who would take,

4059
02:50:22,990 --> 02:50:27,990
they would take in this testosterone 
shit because they thought I gave him an 

4060
02:50:27,990 --> 02:50:30,871
edge and I was just thinking of some 
roided up guy trying to get you a 

4061
02:50:30,871 --> 02:50:30,871
fucking audition

4062
02:50:30,871 --> 02:50:32,400
for according to Jeff.
Listen,

4063
02:50:33,670 --> 02:50:34,600
listen,
motherfucker,

4064
02:50:35,880 --> 02:50:38,640
I need my guy to be the fucking wacky 
neighbor.

4065
02:50:38,740 --> 02:50:39,940
My Gosh,
your guy.

4066
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:42,460
I don't know.
Uh,

4067
02:50:42,461 --> 02:50:43,120
yeah.
Most,

4068
02:50:43,210 --> 02:50:47,080
most of those things are bad for you.
Even the regular Ibuprofen.

4069
02:50:47,081 --> 02:50:49,890
It's not so fantastic for you.
Didn't Rob Wolf Tosa?

4070
02:50:49,891 --> 02:50:53,070
Chip is terrible for us anyway.
Bill,

4071
02:50:53,110 --> 02:50:54,940
or you're the fucking man.
It was an awesome time.

4072
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:58,420
It was a howl as always synonymous with 
Albert.

4073
02:50:58,450 --> 02:51:00,980
Was it always is my brother.
Where your next work in them.

4074
02:51:00,990 --> 02:51:01,180
Powerful.

4075
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:03,750
Going through the De,
the dirty south.

4076
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:05,460
Oh,
I'm gonna go.

4077
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:06,840
Uh,
let's see.

4078
02:51:06,841 --> 02:51:09,510
What the hell am I?
What the fuck?

4079
02:51:09,511 --> 02:51:11,540
That's Fridays and fifth.
Sundays is sixth,

4080
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:14,220
seventh,
Athens,

4081
02:51:14,221 --> 02:51:15,410
Georgia.
Tenth.

4082
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:16,800
I'm at the home,

4083
02:51:16,940 --> 02:51:17,910
Alabama.

4084
02:51:18,590 --> 02:51:21,320
I'm doing a theater and a South 
Carolina.

4085
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,120
But whatever.
You're capitalist Columbia,

4086
02:51:23,570 --> 02:51:28,570
I think.
And then I got two shows at the 

4087
02:51:28,570 --> 02:51:30,251
Tabernacle on that Friday in Atlanta.
And take two days off in Atlanta.

4088
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:35,410
Yeah.
I'm going to the masters and then I go 

4089
02:51:35,410 --> 02:51:35,410
golf.
Golf.

4090
02:51:35,410 --> 02:51:35,410
Yup.
Oh,

4091
02:51:35,410 --> 02:51:36,490
you're a big golf fan.
I,

4092
02:51:37,090 --> 02:51:39,020
I'm a sports fan.
I love going there.

4093
02:51:39,021 --> 02:51:41,360
And I think tigers back.
He just fucking.

4094
02:51:41,390 --> 02:51:46,390
He looks.
So I think he's going to do what I can 

4095
02:51:46,390 --> 02:51:46,390
do.
That's Jordan with a golf club.

4096
02:51:46,390 --> 02:51:46,460
Um,
and then uh,

4097
02:51:46,580 --> 02:51:49,880
I'm going to go on Monday night.
I got two shows at Tampa,

4098
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:52,400
Tuesday,
two shows at Florida state.

4099
02:51:52,401 --> 02:51:55,820
And then the Wednesday I'm at the Jackie
gleason theater in Miami beach.

4100
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:57,080
Billboard Dot Com.

4101
02:51:57,130 --> 02:51:58,930
Doing a run.
Go and check it out.

4102
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,660
I'm the Tabernacles where I filmed my 
last special.

4103
02:52:02,110 --> 02:52:02,620
Oh,
it is.

4104
02:52:02,621 --> 02:52:04,150
It's fucking great place.
Loved it.

4105
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:05,170
Oh,
amazingly.

4106
02:52:05,250 --> 02:52:06,010
I'm Atlanta is

4107
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:07,990
amazing.
It's a great town.

4108
02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:13,140
It's so integrated.
You know what I like about Atlanta is 

4109
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:13,840
like people are like black people and 
white people.

4110
02:52:13,841 --> 02:52:16,600
You still like hanging together.
And so it seems like completely normal.

4111
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:18,880
But then when you get outside of it,
it becomes the south again.

4112
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:22,450
Word Bill.
Burr ladies and gentlemen,

4113
02:52:22,451 --> 02:52:26,290

out if you're a fucking mess up.

This t plus testosterone will tell you 
right now,

So if you have something that you like 

4168
02:54:35,611 --> 02:54:36,580
tasting,
I've been thrown into my protein drinks.

4169
02:54:36,581 --> 02:54:39,790
I don't do that anymore because my 
protein drinks the hemp protein.

4170

Hemp,
hemp force tastes awesome.

4171

Yeah,
carbohydrates right after working out.

02:54:50,650 --> 02:54:52,480
I'm going the other way.
Go the other way.

4176
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:53,890
No protein,
carbohydrate.

4177
02:54:54,070 --> 02:54:55,930
I like how you do that.
You're a contrarian.
