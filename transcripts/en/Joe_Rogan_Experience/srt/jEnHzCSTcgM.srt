00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,540
Do you have this a desire to
like keep upping the ante?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,500
Is that an issue?

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,473
Um,

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,093
not really.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,421
No.

7
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,254
I just like,

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,930
ultimately I just like creating stuff
and I liked making videos and I liked

9
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:17,770
exploring places.

10
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:18,580
I like heights,

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,210
I like jumping between stuff and Latin.

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,100
Like the natural progression for me is to,

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,900
is to get higher and things get bigger.

14
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,160
That's just how it is.

15
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,960
So it just happens but bright.

16
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:29,950
But I'm not thinking about it.

17
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:30,700
I'm not thinking like,

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:30,941
okay,

19
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:31,721
I've just released this,

20
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,400
so now I need to do something bigger.

21
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,230
Like it's just there.

22
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,300
It's just natural mean.

23
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,140
So how do you go about making a video?

24
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,060
If you decide I'm going
to make a new video,

25
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,650
what do you have a thought in your head?

26
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,180
Like I need to get on the Eiffel Tower.

27
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,280
Like what do you do it?

28
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,940
You know what the Eiffel Tower was never,

29
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,960
never a plan.

30
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:47,794
I never saw.

31
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,930
Let's go to Paris and do the Eiffel Tower.

32
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,870
Did you do the Eiffel Tower?

33
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:51,704
The Eiffel Tower?

34
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,830
So how'd you do it?

35
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,701
If it's not a plan,

36
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:55,241
how'd you do it?

37
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:58,960
So I was in Denmark just traveling around
with a bunch of friends and instead of

38
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,020
getting in the minivan and driving
all the way back to London,

39
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,621
I was like,

40
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:02,771
no,

41
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,900
I don't want to sit in a van for 15 hours.

42
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,720
Let's just fly somewhere
and continue this adventure.

43
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:12,721
So me and my friend flew to Paris and
then the next day we ended up climbing.

44
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,074
Now for tower.

45
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,130
Do you think this kind of stuff was being
done before people were videotaping?

46
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,720
It must've been.

47
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,363
It must've been.

48
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,410
I feel like for certain
people it's just a,

49
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,000
it's just in them to kind of explore
places you shouldn't really explore and I

50
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:28,450
think he's,

51
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:28,860
yeah.

52
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,390
Well for you it seems like
something that was fostered though,

53
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:31,750
right?

54
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,980
Because you started off just doing the
par course stuff and this became of it.

55
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,961
But you know what?

56
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:37,601
When I was a kid,

57
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:38,140
I was like,

58
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,250
I was annoyed little kid.

59
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,680
I was always to do things I shouldn't.

60
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,523
No Way.

61
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,863
Yeah,

62
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,290
man.

63
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,190
Now I'm just a big,

64
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,290
just a big version of what I was then.

65
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,363
Wow.

66
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Ooh,

67
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,450
some pretty cool videos.

68
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:54,930
If you look up on youtube of like urban
exploration or people were finding weird

69
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,190
pathways and like,

70
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,701
Oh shit,

71
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,170
looked on 60 feet underground,

72
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,540
we made it and there's this shit
that's been buried under here.

73
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:04,620
Wonder why it's buried and look old
electronics and stuff like that.

74
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,880
Like under like uncovering
the hatch and lost.

75
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,340
So it'll sort of like that.

76
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:08,481
Yeah,

77
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:09,314
I can find this stuff like,

78
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,520
yeah,

79
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,860
well that's,

80
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,230
that's very interesting to me.

81
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:16,231
But what I'm really most fascinated by
is this willingness to put your life in

82
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:17,950
mortal danger

83
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,220
and that how exciting this
is for people to watch.

84
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,050
Like what's the most
viewed video that you have?

85
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,100
How many hits does it have?

86
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,511
A,

87
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,830
I think just over 4 million.

88
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,820
That's fucking people.

89
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,693
Yeah.

90
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,800
This one's got a few million.

91
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,790
I think this is you.

92
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,843
You get,

93
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,731
so we climbed it.

94
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:38,120
We went,

95
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,230
we just pushed it too far.

96
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,930
Like we went up to the very top platform.

97
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,813
If you've been to Paris,

98
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,520
no,

99
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
it didn't say off the top.

100
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,430
So you can take the lift up,

101
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:46,830
right?

102
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,181
You can,

103
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:47,851
you can walk.

104
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,700
Can you take the stairs
to the second platform?

105
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,230
That's the highest you
can take the stairs too.

106
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,550
There is stairs to the top,

107
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,160
but they don't allow it because
they're like weird and narrow.

108
00:02:55,161 --> 00:03:00,161
And so you take the lift to the top and
then there's like a door that's manned

109
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,040
by a security card that is
the door to that staircase.

110
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,840
And that's where we came
up from the backside.

111
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,710
So we,

112
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,610
we went up and for some reason we just
had the urge to just go inside even

113
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,300
though it's lit up,

114
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,860
even though there's cameras everywhere.

115
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,811
We opened that door,

116
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,800
I step in to the top platform
and then I just hear this,

117
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,300
this walkie talkie just go like,

118
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,110
ah,

119
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,880
like you go crazy and French.

120
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,081
And I was like,

121
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:23,914
Shit,

122
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,200
we've definitely been
seen less disappears.

123
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,280
And then we ran down,

124
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,850
we climbed out of the
staircase and then on each,

125
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,540
on opposite corners of the
tower in the main beams,

126
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,100
there's like kind of like a little
pocket inside the beam that you can jump

127
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,880
into.

128
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,740
It must be like two by two.

129
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,270
Like size.

130
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,530
I barely fit into it,

131
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:44,711
right?

132
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,544
Cause I'm huge.

133
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,080
My friend is small.

134
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:47,620
So you just like,

135
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,910
Brooke disappeared into this hole and
then we sat on opposite ends of the tower

136
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,800
and hid and the lifts.

137
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,860
You start hearing lifts coming,

138
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:55,061
you're up,

139
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,990
you start hearing people running up
and down the stairs you see taught is

140
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,660
everything's kicking off and
we're hitting these little holes

141
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,420
and they're searching for us and I'm just
like hiding in this hole and I'm like,

142
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,550
I've got one shoe off
because it wouldn't fit in.

143
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,260
I've got my knee wrestling on my shoe,

144
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,830
I've lost all feeling in my leg
because the blood circulation has gone.

145
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,310
My head's sticking out the top and I've
got like my tee shirt over my head,

146
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:23,170
like a little Ninja and there's people
with torches going up and down looking

147
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,004
for us.

148
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,130
So do you have video,

149
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,610
that little pocket that you were in?

150
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,870
Uh,

151
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,780
in this now I do have is only
on two sides of the tower,

152
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,614
which is strange,

153
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,510
but it's kind of similar to this gap here.

154
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:37,641
Oh,

155
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:37,990
I see.

156
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,491
It's there.

157
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,220
I see on the right,

158
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,940
it's in that corner there and it's
like a foot and a half by a foot.

159
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:43,301
And a half.

160
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,620
I think I barely fit in.

161
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,840
So how long did they wait?

162
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,720
So we were in the [inaudible]
coming up right now.

163
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,171
Yeah.

164
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,970
This is what it was starting to open up.

165
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,230
This was like as we,

166
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,580
so this is like right where as here,

167
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,414
just before we go.

168
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:55,980
Yeah.

169
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,830
So we've tucked in,

170
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,690
this was just before we got caught.

171
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,310
So how'd you get caught?

172
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,440
Because the lifts start coming up cause
the staff start coming up to work or to

173
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,660
clean or something and they just saw us.

174
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,720
We're just like running around these
beams and there's lifts everywhere.

175
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,380
So what happens then?

176
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,100
So with like,

177
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,830
so we're still in this hole and we
sit in this whole for like two hours,

178
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,200
at least two hours where
they're going up and down.

179
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,521
It goes quiet.

180
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,600
So I jumped out of the hole.

181
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,740
I have a look around,

182
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,561
I go and see Stevie.

183
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,690
Stevie's like half asleep,

184
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,360
just chilling in the hole and then

185
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,210
come back to the whole.

186
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:31,481
I'm like,

187
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:31,631
yeah,

188
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,550
this seems like pretty clear now.

189
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,440
I think they must've thought that we
jumped off with parachutes and we,

190
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,220
because they couldn't find us.

191
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,451
And then I was like,

192
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:40,631
yeah,

193
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:40,881
this,

194
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,860
this seems pretty clear.

195
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:45,100
And then every single light on the tower,

196
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,800
because the whole thing lights up.

197
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,670
And this isn't like the twinkly lights
that they have on every hour at night.

198
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,700
This is like internal lights
that are like this big,

199
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,420
like the whole fucking tower up.

200
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,490
So I jumped straight back into the hole.

201
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm not sure what's going on.

202
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,100
And then lifts again,

203
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,800
people up and down the
stairs again looking for us.

204
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,830
So when we sat in these
homes again for ages

205
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,163
and then,

206
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,910
and then it finally goes quiet,

207
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,300
but the lights are still on for a little
while and then the whole thing just

208
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,440
shuts down and that,

209
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,640
I think that was it.

210
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,541
So I jumped out,

211
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,374
I had a look around,

212
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,840
went and got Stevie and
then it was ours again.

213
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
And then we were up there until
like 9:00 AM I think it was.

214
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,760
How long was that?

215
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,623
How many hours?

216
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,220
A 1:00 AM til 9:00 AM.

217
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,270
Wow.

218
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,150
So you were climbing around and
I think for eight fucking hours,

219
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,200
that's nuts.

220
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,710
Running that French chocolate Barb.

221
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,553
She's really good.

222
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:40,941
Oh,

223
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,521
that's all you eat.

224
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,111
It's all we had.

225
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:42,944
Yeah.

226
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,870
So he came down because you were hungry.

227
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,120
We came down cause we got caught now.

228
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,970
And so you would have stayed
there for the rest of the day.

229
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,580
Um,

230
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,010
I,

231
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,010
the idea was to like wait till it opened
and then get into a place where you

232
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:59,540
could hide like near the second platform
and then just drop into the second

233
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,670
platform and just merge
in with like the tourists.

234
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,530
But we didn't get that far.

235
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,910
That would have been calm.

236
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,710
So the plan was to wait for it to
open and sneak out with the crowd.

237
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,020
Just jumped out of the
beam into the crowd,

238
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,130
disappears into a lift.

239
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:13,341
Done.

240
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:14,540
So when you get caught,

241
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,860
then what happens?

242
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,190
So we got seen by like a
big group of people in,

243
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,670
in one of the lifts and
we were just like waving.

244
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,400
And they're like,

245
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,780
ah,

246
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,670
like angry looking people,

247
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,620
but like angry people and happy people.

248
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:27,891
They're like,

249
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:28,820
what the heck's going on?

250
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,983
And then,

251
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,560
uh,

252
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,310
we would like to above slightly above
and maintenance platform where they have

253
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,080
like lifts that take workers up.

254
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,950
And then,

255
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,510
so we had to climb down and we met people
on the maintenance platform getting

256
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:41,900
the left.

257
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,190
There's like five of us,

258
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,440
like to me and Stevie and
they're like few other people,

259
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,161
security,

260
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,110
just like private security for the tower.

261
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,700
And then we come down to
the basement lifts open.

262
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:56,701
It's just like a room full of policemen
and we're like go see in the movie.

263
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,990
And when they do that bit,

264
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,610
I had to hide every single SD card
and everything that I had on me.

265
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,631
How'd you do that?

266
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,401
Three kinds of people.

267
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,400
But no,

268
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:07,730
no,

269
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,563
it was an option.

270
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,770
That was the only option.

271
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,803
Yeah.

272
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,100
I haven't had to do that yet.

273
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,180
But he had a condom.

274
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,060
You tie it in and not
put them in the condom,

275
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,051
put your finger up,

276
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:18,350
move on.

277
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,060
That's right.

278
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,301
All right.

279
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,240
So how do you,

280
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:20,600
um,

281
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,590
hide the SD cards?

282
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:21,741
I mean,

283
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,050
they must've went through
your stuff for the flight.

284
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,581
I thought they would,

285
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:26,414
but they didn't.

286
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,423
I don't know.

287
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,070
Paris,

288
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,731
they don't give a fuck,

289
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,170
they're turning delayed drink wine.

290
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,960
Chocolate had like a big
five d like a big DSLR.

291
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:37,961
And then I had I think two GoPros and so
to Mike arrestees and one like CF card

292
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:38,720
from the,

293
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,553
from the big one.

294
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,390
And I had like this bag that I
had like little tiny pen pockets,

295
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,310
like really thin pockets.

296
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:46,880
Right.

297
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
And I just stuffed the mark cresty
cause down there and I had like a,

298
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,360
a little rip in the
back padding of the bag.

299
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:58,200
So I just threw the CF card in the back
of the bag and it just fell down and I

300
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,130
just hoped.

301
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,010
And then when we got
to the police station,

302
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,270
they were like,

303
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,950
you have so many cameras on you,

304
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,930
clearly you've been filming.

305
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,620
And I was like,

306
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,453
no,

307
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,720
I forgot the SD cards.

308
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,650
Cameras died.

309
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,113
And they,

310
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,840
they believed that I had to
surrender everything on my phone.

311
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,533
I um,

312
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,110
he had to surrender
everything on your phone.

313
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:19,351
Yeah.

314
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:19,640
So,

315
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,670
so I had three cameras,

316
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:20,971
right.

317
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:21,630
So I was like,

318
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,040
I had three cameras and my phone,

319
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,321
so I like,

320
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:27,450
I'm going to have to give something
up to try and save the most valuable,

321
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,220
the most valuable footage.

322
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,170
So I was like,

323
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,531
they were like,

324
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:34,410
did you feel most like only filmed in
my phone because my camera's died and I

325
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,640
forgot my SD cards.

326
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,780
And then they went through like the
footage on the phone just made me delete.

327
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,380
Oh that's cool.

328
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:40,701
So the,

329
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,990
the footage and the phone was like a ruse.

330
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,960
The footage on the phone
was like me in the,

331
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,940
in the little hole filming,

332
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,300
talking to the camera and like filming
the people looking cause I was like this

333
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,390
and I put my phone out.

334
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:52,910
Great.

335
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,390
That you had something to give them.

336
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,290
Yeah.

337
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,770
Yeah.

338
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,030
So then what happens?

339
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
How long did they detain you?

340
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:58,561
Uh,

341
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,790
we were there for like eight hours,

342
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,790
so another eight hours hours.

343
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,050
So when you're eight hours
up there climbing around,

344
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,913
how do you pee?

345
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,110
You pee off the edge of the town.

346
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,100
Oh my God.

347
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,030
That's probably why I got arrested person
on his French people as if life throws

348
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,080
and clicked on them enough.

349
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,951
Yeah.

350
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,390
I think by the time it gets to the ground,

351
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,220
it's kind of all spread out and we're not,

352
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,480
or it's a fucking raging river of piss
around on some little Old Lady's head.

353
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,290
Yeah.

354
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,490
It seems like if you were just pee on
the tower that way it dribbles down

355
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,421
slowly.

356
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,440
It doesn't hit anybody in the head.

357
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,350
I mean if you were still on the Eiffel
Tower and you needed to pay and there was

358
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,810
no one below you because
it's like 4:00 AM oh okay.

359
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,830
You'd pay off the edge.

360
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,200
Maybe you don't know how
much that's even ruder.

361
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:38,971
I'm sorry.

362
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,900
Tough enough person.

363
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:40,830
If I did peel on them,

364
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,110
maybe it's a romantic
couple going for a walk,

365
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,250
maybe it would have really worked out.

366
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,220
All of a sudden the girl goes to the
lighter cigarette and you piss running her

367
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:52,080
head and she gets mad and the fucking
evening ends poorly and they could have,

368
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,640
it could have been a perfect relationship,

369
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,300
but you ruined it.

370
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,133
I killed it.

371
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,130
So he come down and then another
eight hours of detention.

372
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,820
Yeah.

373
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,690
And what do they do to you?

374
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,280
Handcuffed us to a chair.

375
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,810
We just sat in the middle of the,

376
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,280
of this police station.

377
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:10,380
There's like sales behind us with people
going crazy and like people bleeding

378
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:11,580
from the eyeballs.

379
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:14,950
And we just sat there like people
bleeding from their eyeballs,

380
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,690
from other crimes,

381
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,020
like nighttime fights and stuff
like that and just drunk people.

382
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,030
And we would just sat there for ages.

383
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,570
And then we finally got taken into like
separate rooms where we were questioned

384
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:25,920
by some high up.

385
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,941
I had a woman,

386
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:31,800
he had a dude and we were both questions
for a couple of hours and then we were

387
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,110
back out handcuffed to the chairs again.

388
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,690
And then they took all of our
stuff and they searched it.

389
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:37,480
And I was like,

390
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,770
well,

391
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,670
if they find it,

392
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,470
they're going to be like,

393
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:40,741
okay,

394
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,480
you just told us that you feel nothing.

395
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,910
And we've just found hours
and hours of footage,

396
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,460
like what's the deal?

397
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,120
So I was like,

398
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,953
oh,

399
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,793
please,

400
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,430
no cards.

401
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah.

402
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,200
And then um,

403
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,110
they finally brought the,

404
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,101
brought the bags back.

405
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,030
Like it must've been an hour.

406
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:55,864
They had them for,

407
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,850
and I thought they were going
to go through everything,

408
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,500
but they brought it back.

409
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,400
I checked it and I was like,

410
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,263
stomach,

411
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,800
the gods are still here.

412
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,633
And then we just like,

413
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,601
we just lost it.

414
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,291
We were so happy.

415
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,820
But the policemen,

416
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,170
I had no idea what we were doing.

417
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,930
So do they kick you out of the country?

418
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,240
They had no record.

419
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,121
Nothing.

420
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:13,390
It's all,

421
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,250
so I had to go back in that room.

422
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,440
I had to sign an agreement that said,

423
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,070
I promise I will not climb the
Eiffel Tower for three years.

424
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,241
For three years.

425
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:22,840
That's it.

426
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,321
That was it.

427
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:23,770
Yeah.

428
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:23,981
Wait,

429
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:24,400
a magnum,

430
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,233
right.

431
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,130
How can they only give you how come out?

432
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:28,210
I'll take forever.

433
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:28,661
Ever.

434
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,494
I

435
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,780
think they must like it.

436
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,490
Yeah.

437
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:32,920
You know what?

438
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,110
You're a woman that was interviewing me.

439
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,953
He loved it.

440
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,501
She did.

441
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,334
She was like,

442
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,050
you really shouldn't be doing this,

443
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:39,870
but how did you do this?

444
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,753
It's incredible.

445
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,740
Like she loved it.

446
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,560
Why Oak?

447
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,091
He loved it.

448
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:43,330
Yeah.

449
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:43,661
Well,

450
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:45,550
I think once they realize
that you're polite,

451
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,320
you're gentleman,

452
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
you're a very nice guy,

453
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,710
you're just a thrill seeker.

454
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,911
They're like,

455
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:49,060
okay,

456
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,980
this is not a threat to society,

457
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:51,761
skies,

458
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:52,600
and a terrorist.

459
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,080
Yeah.

460
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,850
So the second question she asked me was,

461
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,140
did you leave a bomb up there?

462
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,100
Oh God.

463
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,821
And I just laughed.

464
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,360
I was like,

465
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,990
what?

466
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,823
Come on.

467
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,550
Oh Wow.

468
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,880
Well,

469
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,680
that's something that they
have to take any consideration.

470
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,670
They have to actually trust you.

471
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:03,941
Right?

472
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:04,810
If they let you go,

473
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,550
it turns out you did leave a bottom up,

474
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,393
down.

475
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,441
Then they have to,

476
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:08,680
like,

477
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,290
they would have to comb over the
building with a fine tooth comb.

478
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,700
Who's going to say he's going to be like,

479
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:13,150
yeah,

480
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,470
you know what I did?

481
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,543
I left the boom up there.

482
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,971
No,

483
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:16,810
no one would write.

484
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,760
So they really have to trust you.

485
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,750
Yeah.

486
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,740
Fucking Europeans.

487
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,383
Ridiculous,

488
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,220
ridiculous people.

489
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,113
Three years.

490
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:25,761
Fuck you.

491
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,040
You throw me in jail forever.

492
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,061
It was America.

493
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,500
They put you right in Guantanamo Bay.

494
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,740
They throw a dog in there with you.

495
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,083
Cool.

496
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,590
[inaudible].
