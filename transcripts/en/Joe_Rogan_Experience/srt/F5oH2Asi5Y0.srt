1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,351
Du du,
Du,

2
00:00:01,351 --> 00:00:03,630
Du,
Du du Du four,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,643
three two one my brother and the man who
got me into instagram for it wasn't for 

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,390
you.
I would have abandoned net member.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,243
You're the whining and I still got like 
40,000 followers and you got like 4 

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,340
million.
I don't have that many.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,510
I don't even think I have 2,000,002 men.
Whatever.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,950
Uh,
you got me into it man.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,610
Hey Stacia [inaudible] what does that 
mean?

10
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,160
You say that all the time slot.
You is like the Gaelic Irish.

11
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:29,994
A salute.
Slungshot it's like s l a I n t e with 

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,570
like one of them crazy marks on it.
Oh,

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,470
that's a,
it's so gaelic gaelic is a function,

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,690
real wrangled language to read or try 
and pronounce some shit.

15
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,524
It'll be like somebody's name will be 
gary and it'll be spelled with like six 

16
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,570
17 letters.
Say Shit.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,320
Crucifixes rooms,
crucifix with the circle.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,043
I was just,
I think it was among those rooms and 

19
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:00,630
shit.
I don't know dude.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,750
Does anyone speak Gaelic?
Couldn't you go have a conversation with

21
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,700
some oak in Ireland?
People do for sure.

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,690
So it was,
you're like,

23
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,230
um,
like kind of fading away thing,

24
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,420
but there you'll find pockets that 
definitely do.

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,360
It's fucking crazy.
When you stopped thinking about how many

26
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,390
different languages that are,
like if you done much touring in Asia,

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,150
um,
it really only Japan.

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,283
I haven't hit crew.
I've never been to Korea and never been 

29
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,090
like,
um,

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,923
China.
Never been in Indonesia or anything 

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,070
that's not written.
Yeah.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,081
Indonesia,
yes,

33
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:28,914
Sorta Asia.
I've only been to Japan and only for a 

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,020
few days.
Can you imagine?

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,690
Oh,
it's amazing.

36
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,950
The people are so nice and polite and 
it's,

37
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,100
it's fascinating.
Culture works.

38
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,100
One of the reasons I love it so much too
is it's like you go to Europe,

39
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,110
you don't feel foreign necessarily.

40
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,150
You know what I mean?
It's really the forerunner experience.

41
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:48,380
When you're there you go.
Here I am now out obvious outsider.

42
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,390
I'm tollard most people and I'm 
Caucasian,

43
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,224
you know?
And there's a lot of places they're 

44
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,031
like,
I tried to go to,

45
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,864
like,
I'd get the low down on a Sushi spot 

46
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,500
from somebody that I knew there.
And then you go there and be like,

47
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,251
oh no,
no guys,

48
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,100
you can,
we don't serve them.

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,820
We don't serve you all here.
Like still places like that.

50
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:03,654
You know what I mean?
When you're trying to get the down low 

51
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:08,150
anthony bordain treatment like Anthony 
Bourdain,

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,600
you might not have no luck,
you know,

53
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,960
show up at that 0.0 crew.
Yeah man.

54
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,740
It just,
um,

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,573
they're so different than us in their,
their culture that it's like this crazy 

56
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,180
immersion into like an alternative 
world.

57
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,260
Like Japanese writing is so different 
than American writing to sound.

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,720
Their languages is so different than the
sound of English.

59
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,400
Then when you go there you're like,
wow,

60
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,600
this is like,
look,

61
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:35,601
I'm literally peering into a coexisting 
alternative world.

62
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,654
Like what if,
what if there was no different 

63
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,410
languages?
It was just language.

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,090
Like everybody knew what everybody 
spoke,

65
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,983
right.
And your language was the s the sounds 

66
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:45,894
that they make and the way they 
interpret things and the way they 

67
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,120
interpret things shapes the way they 
look at reality.

68
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,610
I sure that's,
I mean it's a weird,

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,940
like our culture is in a lot of ways 
almost like an operating system.

70
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:01,330
I think Terence Mckenna described that 
way and thinking kind of makes sense.

71
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,290
It is like an operating system.
Yeah.

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,330
We learn a basic set of parameters and 
rules that we all kind of Obi yeah,

73
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,450
we're all individuals within it,
but like there's,

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,091
you know,
hey,

75
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,924
you know,
in this society this is what's 

76
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,080
acceptable and this is what it isn't and
here's how we peer it.

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,170
And when you see something like we were 
talking about this book,

78
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,260
dear reader,
Michael Milas who was on and a yesterday

79
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,483
who was just amazing podcast guest,
but it was talking to us about North 

80
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,110
Korea.
Like that's a different,

81
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,500
totally different operating system and 
that shit is going on right now.

82
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,080
Right now there's like a whole country 
that's imprisoned.

83
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,943
Yeah.
What's amazing to me is that that many 

84
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,840
people can be subdued to me in that 
manner.

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,870
Like wears you out,
you read throughout history.

86
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:41,411
It's like,
you know,

87
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:45,430
people got sick and tired of some shit 
after a while and just bucked up.

88
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,050
Yeah.
Where are they?

89
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,040
What,
what is going on?

90
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,050
There wasn't mastery to these dudes have
that.

91
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,360
It's crazy.
I mean I look at it and there's millions

92
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,194
of people that they're starving and 
still accept and this dude's living in 

93
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,370
is whatever,
golden palace,

94
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,570
whatever kind of lifestyle.

95
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,900
And nobody's really like trying to 
revolutionize started revolution or buck

96
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,410
up and make a cool would be a problem.
Cause I think the old guys around him or

97
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,310
even crazier,
but,

98
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,173
well malice was telling me why he was 
saying that the way that society is 

99
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,464
structured,
everybody reports on everybody else 

100
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,003
about what you did wrong.
Like if you and I were hanging out 

101
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,914
together,
we'd be forced to report at the end of 

102
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,220
the day,
I would have to report on everything you

103
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,054
did wrong.
Like maybe you didn't cry long enough 

104
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,160
when something happened.
Maybe he didn't express enough grief.

105
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,023
Like you'd have to,
there's like rules to the way you 

106
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,484
grieve.
People who didn't grieve heart enough 

107
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,214
got six years,
six months rather of hard labor for not 

108
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,740
grieving hard enough when Kim Jong and 
go later.

109
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,940
Yeah.
Whoa.

110
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,813
That's so they tell on each other.
So they have this crazy culture of 

111
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:47,080
television that podcasts was 
fascinating.

112
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,310
Man.
That dude is a really,

113
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:52,300
really interesting guy.
Scary that that's a worlds,

114
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:57,040
it's happening right now.
It exists and next door it South Korea,

115
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,580
which is driving and pop culture galore.
Yeah,

116
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,800
crazy plastic surgery.
Those girls,

117
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,600
I'll get a,
those are not those all of them,

118
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:07,780
but a high percentage of girls get their
eyes changed.

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,690
They get this crazy surgery that makes 
your eyelids,

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,480
they shrink your eyelids so they don't 
have the Asian look.

121
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,580
Oh,
there's inner,

122
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,413
I tried it for a more of a round.
I think they tried for a mortar of an 

123
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,720
anime thing.
Oh,

124
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,140
the big guy.
Have you seen it?

125
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,340
I think I have.
I,

126
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,260
but I don't.
I don't think it was an Asian girl.

127
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,960
I think I saw some,
some girl on Internet who just trying to

128
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:29,710
look really much talking about Barbie 
Lady.

129
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:30,970
Right.
The party leading.

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,590
It's crazy.

131
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,120
Yeah.
There's people that go do,

132
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,440
it's like,
how do you think like that?

133
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,274
How's your brain working?
I mean like you're not looking in the 

134
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,940
mirror and seeing the same thing.
I mean this is your,

135
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,290
this is giving you satisfying,
I don't understand.

136
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,530
I think it's just body dysmorphia.
It's the same thing as like a,

137
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,364
a person who's a bodybuilder who just 
can't get big enough or a woman who 

138
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,070
can't get fake enough breasts.
Like they keep wanting to get bigger and

139
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:51,601
bigger ones.
You,

140
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,980
you don't see yourself how everybody 
else sees you.

141
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,980
So it's almost like a disease.
And I that um,

142
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,843
it's always funny cause I've always 
thought it was a pretty fucking awesome 

143
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,880
dude.
Yeah.

144
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:02,714
Well it's called self esteem.
She pulled those pictures up so the 

145
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,600
checkout what they do,
see if you could see good ones.

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,590
Three reasons why one gin,
plastic surgery for ice,

147
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,483
eyelid surgery shit,
but show some like before and afters 

148
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,010
because they kind of a little one,
right?

149
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,460
They're kind of crazy.
Some of them are kind of crazy.

150
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,080
Like they look like a totally different 
human.

151
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,120
Like if you went to high school with 
her,

152
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,180
you be like,
what?

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,200
That seems totally normal right there.
There's been some extreme ones.

154
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,260
See if you could fire her whole face is 
different shaped at that point.

155
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,200
The one you just passed.
It was more than just eyes done there,

156
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,810
man.
It's interesting seeing that younger and

157
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,030
younger girls are having that kind of 
stuff done too.

158
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,930
Whoa.
Damn,

159
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,750
whoa.
That one was very successful.

160
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,330
That was a good decision.
Yeah,

161
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,610
it was an excellent decision.
But how do we know these are real?

162
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,140
You know?
That's another thing could be getting,

163
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,460
fuck.
Holy Shit.

164
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,294
Look at that one.
This is something I wanted to talk to 

165
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:51,860
you about.
Anything.

166
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,693
How do we know what it's like?
How do you know what the fuck is true 

167
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:56,780
anymore?

168
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,400
It's almost impossible to come because 
everybody's mastered the half truth.

169
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,680
Yeah.
You mean that I got a piece of the truth

170
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,270
and then I spin it the way I want to 
spend it.

171
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,070
So a certain amount of people are going 
to see it that way.

172
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:07,904
That's what,
that's how they,

173
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,010
they really,
the whole,

174
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,700
I,
I trip on this whole system.

175
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,030
I know I don't give a fuck about trump,
Clinton,

176
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:14,721
any of that.
All right.

177
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,950
You know,
fuck all of them.

178
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,050
They're all lying crooks as far as I'm 
concerned.

179
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,903
Right.
But peep game on how they have blue 

180
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,200
states red.
We're like bloods and crips here,

181
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,034
they,
and they're making it more like that 

182
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:26,714
every day.
Like the hatred between this blue and 

183
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:28,971
red.
It's like,

184
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,760
what the fuck is this?
Yeah.

185
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,633
It's like people got along just six 
months ago and now at each other's 

186
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,680
throats and there used to be a thing 
when we were young,

187
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,813
when the new president was elected and 
he became president and we all kind of 

188
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,780
sat back and said,
okay,

189
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,160
that's our president.

190
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,850
Let's see what,
right.

191
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,010
I'm not saying we're not even gonna get 
into dude.

192
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,560
Right.
I'm talking to you as a,

193
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:50,550
as a just as a principle.
That's that exchange of,

194
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,160
but we all sat back and said,
okay,

195
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,750
let's,
let's give the guy a shot at least.

196
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,790
Right.
And again,

197
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,624
we're not even gonna.
I'm not even interested in getting into 

198
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,150
all the individual in question.
Right.

199
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,903
That doesn't exist anymore.
It's like the minute this dude's 

200
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,753
precedent,
the next fucking campaign starts and 

201
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,450
like,
it's just fucking crazy.

202
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,190
Is it that as crazy as I think it is,
Joe,

203
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,390
or am I just sitting at home?
Everything is crazy dad world of,

204
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,240
of taking care of these babies and going
on tour and I just turn on the TV and it

205
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,210
blows my fucking mind blowing 
everybody's mind,

206
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,044
man.
I mean there's a weird line that's 

207
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:25,640
happening now too and like,
this isn't really even a criticism,

208
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,910
but Newsweek had an article that they 
tweeted and the article shows how Molina

209
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,430
rejects trump's hand.

210
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,200
I mean this,
this was kind of awesome.

211
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,270
I saw it.
It was kind of locked it away.

212
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,650
It's cool.
It is kind of,

213
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,490
but who knows what's going on.
Maybe she gets public gangs,

214
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,390
anxiety and she hasn't like holding 
hands when she walks.

215
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,980
Like he doesn't necessarily have to mean
anything.

216
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,550
The fact that it's a fucking story that 
Newsweek tweets out is stir range.

217
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,860
CNN had it on,
I believe.

218
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,890
Uh,
they got a whole article after hand.

219
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,660
Swat.
Let me,

220
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,500
this is nothing.
It's like they touch hands for a second,

221
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,690
back it up again.
I'm no trump supporter here,

222
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,980
but look,
Newsweek,

223
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,780
I'm not,
don't get me wrong.

224
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,000
He does anything wrong with what you're 
doing.

225
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,610
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with putting this up.

226
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,530
I watched it.
I'm glad you put it up.

227
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,410
You would watch it.
It's not news though.

228
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,353
We are all part of the biggest reality 
TV show ever created in the universe 

229
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:25,020
now.

230
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,730
Yeah.
It seems like trump as the host.

231
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,740
Yeah,
I see it as and that's,

232
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,170
and this man is actually living out his 
goddamn fantasy right now.

233
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,450
Like we have all given this guy,
and again,

234
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:34,800
I don't care.
I'm not even gonna say,

235
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,730
Hey,
love whatever.

236
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,320
Fuck them all.
It's fascinating.

237
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:41,430
But this dude is like king of the 
fucking universe in his mind right now.

238
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
There's nobody can fucking touch him.
And that's the fucking,

239
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,570
that's why the show is going to get so 
hilarious.

240
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,890
It's just going to be great.
Well,

241
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,320
I think he's,
he's not dot stupid.

242
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,273
Like he's aware that there's been a lot 
of criticism and he's trying to iron 

243
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,514
things out.
But what he's doing is he's taking this 

244
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,100
approach that he's made become this real
estate magnate,

245
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,881
this,
you know,

246
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,370
big tycoon,
big businessman,

247
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,413
which is why he was always this 
rambunctious sort of flamboyant 

248
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,160
personality,
right?

249
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,993
He always put his name in gold letters 
on these buildings and we didn't mind 

250
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,774
that when he wasn't running the country.
It's just when you run the country and 

251
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:19,530
you start doing the same stuff,
like the criticism that he's getting,

252
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,830
his kind of each,
you can't kind of do the same thing when

253
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,530
you're the president.
You can't like talk to him about it.

254
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:28,230
I was showing the number one thing,
it's a bigger than yourself thing.

255
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,210
You just nailed it.
In fact,

256
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,130
you have to let go of self to a certain 
degree.

257
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,480
You know what I mean?
To be a good one.

258
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,314
And I'm not saying I'm not going to sell
you one guy has been better than the 

259
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:37,350
other.
We all know we have our opinions on that

260
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:37,741
shit.
You know?

261
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:38,574
I mean,
and honestly I grew up in an age where 

262
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,180
politics and religion,
whether if it was going to be bad news,

263
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
you didn't bring it up with people you 
like.

264
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,610
Do you know what I mean?
And now it's just the,

265
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,553
the hatred.
I see like even from people I respect 

266
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,330
the red and white,
red and blue hen they cripping and blood

267
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,710
now here,
hard man,

268
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,813
hard for their parties.
And it's stupid because none of them 

269
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:02,070
care about you.
None of them want anything from you,

270
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,740
but more of your tax money.
No matter how much they're going to tell

271
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,150
you,
they're going to cut your taxes.

272
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,540
You know what I mean?
They,

273
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,470
if they're going to find a way to 
fucking get that money,

274
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,090
they might make it look good to you.
But Hey,

275
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,790
guess what ms,
middle class family and $36,000 a year,

276
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,700
whatever.
We here's two grand.

277
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,534
You don't have to pay in taxes a year,
which just seems a lot when you're in 

278
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,510
that level of living.
You know what I mean?

279
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,190
Yeah.
I blow that on fucking sneakers.

280
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm ashamed to say.
You know what I mean?

281
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,703
But the point is they don't give a fuck 
cause they just stole it out the back 

282
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,574
end of your health care or they just 
took it off the top of not rebuilding 

283
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,530
all the roads.
This is their game.

284
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,364
They run the game.
And so these motherfuckers come up with 

285
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:39,090
some shit where money comes out of the 
politics.

286
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,583
I don't respect any of it.
I would like to think that some of them 

287
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,584
have your best interest in mind that 
there's just a crazy competitive system 

288
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,560
and that we may be,
you know,

289
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,830
maybe it's just like what the system 
makes like the system kind of corruption

290
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,840
because of lobbyists,
because of the way it's set up.

291
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,940
It's almost like you can't pull it out 
of it.

292
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,950
I totally agree with you that there's 
plenty of good ones.

293
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,570
It's just like cops.

294
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,520
I know a lot of cons and they're all 
good guys.

295
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
When the shit storms pop up,
but when the shit storms pop up,

296
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,123
they don't bug out and say like,
you know what that was wrong and go 

297
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:14,350
against what the group of cops are.
Politicians is saying either one.

298
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,040
I could be either one they side even in 
wrong times when they shouldn't.

299
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,810
Where are those voices?
I want to hear him.

300
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,850
Don't you think there's way more?
That's where you get respect.

301
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,570
Yes,
I do.

302
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,710
Politicians.
But,

303
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,993
but my point is there's a code,
I'll use a code and that good cop will 

304
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:31,390
fucking not shit on a backup.
Maybe he will back him,

305
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,224
but he's still,
there's a time when you got to shit on 

306
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:36,010
that thing or person or that act,
that,

307
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,400
and,
and,

308
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,680
and there's this code and politicians 
and,

309
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:39,514
and,
and cops where they don't call out the 

310
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,490
bullshit.

311
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,151
Yup.
You know what I mean?

312
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:45,310
And that's where I lose all the respect 
for everything.

313
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:45,761
It's like,
oh,

314
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,590
and I just sit back,
I'm on some Carlin Shit,

315
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:48,424
man.
I got a front row seat to the freak 

316
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,220
show.
You watch it go down.

317
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,130
You're asking them to do the impossible 
job.

318
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,993
You're asking them to be around violence
and lying and danger and they're the 

319
00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,704
enemy.
You're asked him to be the professional 

320
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,880
enemy to professional criminals.
That's what you're asking them to do all

321
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:04,714
the time.
And so like there's a reason why they 

322
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:10,150
bond together like that because they're,
they're all in the war together and it's

323
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:13,150
us and them and it's,
we on the outside,

324
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,300
I don't think we understand what the 
fuck they go through.

325
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,080
That's why they have this bond with each
other.

326
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,320
It's no doubt you wouldn't want that you
will really would want,

327
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,700
but there comes a time.

328
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,773
You're right.
And there's been a few of them lately 

329
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:24,931
in,
in,

330
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,500
in recent history.
Oh yeah.

331
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,353
Well,
there should have been an overwhelming 

332
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,280
coming in condemnation by a group of,
of,

333
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,150
of a smaller group of that group's 
actions.

334
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,963
Um,
examples that Eric Gardner case in New 

335
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,900
York where they choke that guy who's 
just selling cigarettes.

336
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,780
They didn't have to do that.
There was no reason to do that.

337
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,460
That guy didn't even have any cigarettes
on him.

338
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,220
The whole thing was fucked up.
They were saying he wasn't complying.

339
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,750
Why should he comply?
He didn't,

340
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,670
he wasn't doing anything.
You can't,

341
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,410
and you can't tell when you went to the 
video,

342
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,080
was he not complying enough to die?
You know what I mean?

343
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:56,914
Well,
I think the dude had like an asthma 

344
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,680
attack or something,
but obviously the vote bark,

345
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,660
they have choke there.
The gas choke though.

346
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,310
It was more like,
honestly,

347
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,144
I mean it was a choke hold,
but it was more like the way he was 

348
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:13,270
applying it was like a restraining thing
more than it was.

349
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,070
I want to see it.
Let me see it again.

350
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,790
Maybe I'm remembering it wrong,
but without a doubt the forearm is under

351
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,340
the neck.
Like if I was in a colony in a fight,

352
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,130
I would say this guy's getting choked.
Right.

353
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,260
Honestly,
did not even go down that road.

354
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,630
But the point of this conversation I 
believe was just saying like,

355
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,493
oh,
that overwhelming larger number of good 

356
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,400
folks,
whether it's cops,

357
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,780
politicians,
soldiers,

358
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:35,614
whatever.
Right.

359
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,390
I do believe that exists,
that the majority of them are decent,

360
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,960
good people,
but when the shit hits the fan,

361
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,530
they don't collectively say that's wrong
and that's fucked up.

362
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,440
No.
They all band together and say like,

363
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,280
all right,
we'll try and bury this and hide it or,

364
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,700
or just deny it kind of thing.
And that as a group loses you respect.

365
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,534
When people are seeing you know,
that are interested in justice and 

366
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,030
interested in fair and interest in that 
seed,

367
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,750
these things happen.

368
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,583
They lose faith.
You and I think there's no faith in 

369
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,080
anything right now.
The way I see.

370
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,210
I see the way I see the division in this
country on it,

371
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,243
there's no faith in anything open.
It's just a wave and it's going to come 

372
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,130
back.
It will.

373
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,193
I mean that's what I'm,
I'm thinking that we're going to react 

374
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,140
to,
I just hope it doesn't come easy.

375
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,830
We really fucked up ways because 
sometimes when that wave crashes,

376
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,010
it breaks shit.
You know what I mean?

377
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,160
Well,
it shouldn't.

378
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,640
The problem is it's so easy to think 
that we're against each other.

379
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,503
It's so easy to dig your heels in and 
argue one side or argue the other or 

380
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,700
pick a team and be totally committed to 
it.

381
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,250
Whether it's red,
blue or whether it's black,

382
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,920
white people get on these goddamn teams.
We do it.

383
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:40,700
Men and women.

384
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,180
Did you see it?
It gets real divisive online with people

385
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,750
separating men and men.
Women like criticizing men,

386
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,880
all men in general,
criticizing women,

387
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:53,270
all women in general.
It's the same shit it exists.

388
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:55,820
Whether it's Democrat versus Republican,
it's,

389
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,510
it's the same shit.
Vegans versus carnivores.

390
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,463
It's the same shit.
People pick a fucking team and they 

391
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,420
fight for it and they think they're 
right and they have many,

392
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,370
many good reasons for thinking that 
right,

393
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,683
but I think all of us or are way better 
off if we're taught about these team 

394
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:14,984
ideas early and recognize when you see 
them in yourself and do something like 

395
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:23,861
self governing and avoid those,
avoid those and we'll find common ground

396
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:27,110
on a lot more shit than we think.
It's pretty much,

397
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,980
we can sum that up but like no,
think for yourself.

398
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,100
Yeah.
It's hard to do,

399
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,090
especially when you're bombarded the way
we are now.

400
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,953
That's another thing about how we 
started this conversation is a how do 

401
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,850
you know what the fuck is really true?
If you really want to know what the fuck

402
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:43,940
is true or at least get a good semblance
of it,

403
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,310
you have to look at more than one 
fucking thing.

404
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,144
If you read some story on facebook that 
outrageous you and fucking makes you so 

405
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,220
pissed off,
maybe it was intended to do that.

406
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,530
Maybe you should go look further,
look down the road,

407
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,330
look at a paper you would never look at.
Look at it.

408
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,290
I,
I like to look when I,

409
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,143
when I get interested in the news,
which isn't as much as it used to be 

410
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:05,380
because I have my own things,
which I'm sure we'll get into it.

411
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,600
I tried to be like,
all right,

412
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,093
I see CNN is on at my studio a lot 
without the sound because we'll be 

413
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,010
making music and whatnot.

414
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,780
And mostly I just read the ticker 
because if,

415
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,570
you know,
nowadays news is on the ticker,

416
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,870
opinions are what are coming out the 
fucking speakers when the,

417
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,093
when the personalities are talking.
News is just the facts that roll scroll 

418
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,280
along down on the bottom and you know,
there's some spin on it and whatnot.

419
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:32,060
But I try not to listen to the talking 
heads cause they,

420
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:32,894
you know,
Fox has to pro Democrat guys that no 

421
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,220
matter what the Democrats do,
they're going to defend it.

422
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,310
And CNN has a couple of trump guys that 
no matter what goes on,

423
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,970
it's a game.
They're playing a game.

424
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,010
It's a game.
You know what I mean?

425
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:43,370
They're,
they're all,

426
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,480
it's all a game.
It's a,

427
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,314
it's a television show.
I was watching it that not too long ago 

428
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,840
when CNN came on after a commercial and 
the studio was lit up,

429
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:52,674
red and Korean stars were everywhere and
there was nuclear missile launches like 

430
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,360
pictures in the background.

431
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,130
And I was like,
oh my God,

432
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,030
what the fuck is going on?
Did they just launched missiles and the,

433
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,963
and nothing like it had happened.
They were just discussing the 

434
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:08,940
possibility of the future of if they got
a missile that was capable and it's like

435
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,030
this is,
and people are tuned into this shit.

436
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,160
And is that,
like I said,

437
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,994
it's on in the background cause I just,
God forbid that breaking news and you 

438
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:19,440
want to know,
I mean it's reality TV honestly.

439
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,423
And again,
it's what we're talking about people 

440
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,210
acting as groups and did above.
It heals groups.

441
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,690
I watch it.
I see too.

442
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,510
It's entertaining to me.
But my,

443
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,350
my,
my,

444
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,020
my deeper self,
brain,

445
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:31,854
whatever you want to call it,
the whiskey starting to fucking talk to 

446
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,060
me right now.
So that has a conscious,

447
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,540
my conscious,
my soul know,

448
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,830
evaluates why I'm being entertained by 
it and finds it disturbing a lot.

449
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,450
Like in wants to say like,
hey man,

450
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,523
we should all fucking take a step back 
and I love you because you're the love 

451
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:51,180
shit.
I've always have had love in my life.

452
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:54,090
I've been a very fortunate man.
But like coming in here has grown men.

453
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,190
And when I first started doing your 
podcast,

454
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,053
you would always be preaching love.
And you know how many Joe Rogan's a 

455
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
tough guy,
he kicked the shit out of 90% of the 

456
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,610
fucking people around.
He's not interested in it.

457
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:10,611
He just wants to love life is better if 
you just hear about it started me down a

458
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,800
pad dude where I was like,
I've explored almost every religion,

459
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,240
you know what I mean?
There is,

460
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,231
um,
and I,

461
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:17,850
and I,
I don't really practice any,

462
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:22,440
but I have a philosophy that's taken its
own good parts from all right.

463
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,363
And,
um,

464
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,560
lately I've been reading a lot of 
Buddhist stuff.

465
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,610
I'm not a Buddhist at all,
but like this tick not Han guy and a few

466
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:30,444
other things I've been reading.
But these things are also kind of 

467
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:37,260
started here because connecting with you
in a weird way,

468
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,010
it made me open my mind up to it.
Like,

469
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,050
like there's a lot of things we don't 
think alike at all on,

470
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,970
you know what I mean?
But it doesn't,

471
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,710
that's,
that doesn't fucking matter.

472
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,550
I know talking to people that I don't 
necessarily exactly,

473
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,250
but I respect it.
That's like one of my fit,

474
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,650
some of my favorite conversations.
That's the best kind you can get that.

475
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,603
And that's the point of what they're 
trying to keep from happening in this 

476
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,331
world.
Whether it be,

477
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,164
I mean,
just this whole online shit has taken 

478
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,201
us.
Yeah,

479
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:06,000
there's a lot of great things that have 
happened from this,

480
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,240
but this social networking shit is 
anything but social.

481
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,590
We're working it out.
You know,

482
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:11,424
he didn't say anything but social.
Well for a lot of people it's just way 

483
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:15,480
too distracting.
A lot of wicked evil,

484
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,850
just venom that like,
you know,

485
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,710
I've learned from either very once in a 
while,

486
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,390
every once in a while I'll cater in 
their office.

487
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:23,880
I'll let her do no online like,
hey motherfucker,

488
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,220
you really don't.
You really don't know.

489
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,150
That's,
you know what I mean?

490
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,980
Hey whatever.
You really don't know.

491
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,220
I pee addresses are easy to you know,
and that kind of shit.

492
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,233
And you know what?
Nine Times out of 10 when I do fuck up 

493
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,330
that rare occasion,
it's a Joe Rogan Fan.

494
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:38,310
It's like,
hey man,

495
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,520
take the high road dude.
Chill to ask Joe.

496
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,391
You know what I mean?
I'd be like,

497
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,280
Oh fuck yeah.
Shit.

498
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,730
All right,
you're right and I'll and boom,

499
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,880
that's over.
Yeah,

500
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,830
kind of thing.
You know what I mean?

501
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,933
This show is being

502
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,933
like a real serious not just to show you
me and you having a little friendship 

503
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,980
cause I've hung out with you a lot since
it's been three years.

504
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,800
We've got though,
it was where we were trying to figure it

505
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,251
out.
We're like,

506
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:59,350
why does it not feel like three wheels?
Let me explain.

507
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:04,060
Three years now since we were,
since I couldn't come in for a while and

508
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,540
I explained this to you on the phone and
when we hung out a couple of times,

509
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,440
my mother was passing from Alzheimer's 
and then when she did pass it was like I

510
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,160
was emotionally and capable.
If I would have to,

511
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,013
I couldn't even have said those words.
I would have been a blubbering idiot on 

512
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:18,210
your show and you know,
you know,

513
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,570
whatever.
Some people might've been like,

514
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,380
hey that we'd been great radio.
I mean you were the one that said,

515
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,700
hey,
get your shit together.

516
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,580
Do you know what I mean?
Cause I wanted to come here and hey boy,

517
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,803
I said it like that.
That would be like Joe Case shit 

518
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,480
together.
So your mom's dead Bro.

519
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,700
It's us talking.
You know what I mean?

520
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,320
That's how I said it.
I know what you mean.

521
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,920
But it would be more like,
you know,

522
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,680
looks today was I went to,
it was the last four years,

523
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,590
probably started probably last right 
before I stopped.

524
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,453
The last time I came on the show,
there was like a big law suit over jump 

525
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:52,480
around that I actually wound up winning.
But like if froze money that I depend on

526
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,760
Brian,
like mailbox money,

527
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:55,594
we call that those checks,
they just kind of come in and then know 

528
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:58,924
jumping around,
it's been really good to me to jump 

529
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:03,820
around is one of my favorite hip hop's 
25th anniversary this year,

530
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,660
the whole first album.

531
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,980
So,
but point being,

532
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,013
so I got out when I first started 
hanging out with you because I was such 

533
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:10,530
a fan of that song,
I was like,

534
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,364
I can't believe I know this dude.
I remember you were weirded out when I 

535
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:16,150
lit a joint in the club and then you 
were like,

536
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:16,961
what are you doing?
I was like,

537
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,520
what do you mean what am I doing?
I'm lying to join.

538
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,200
And everlast goes,
he goes,

539
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,190
you want to get high?
I go,

540
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,660
fuck yeah and,
and I go,

541
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:26,620
where you want to go?
He goes,

542
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,420
go.
That goes,

543
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,610
Yo,
we ain't going nowhere.

544
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,900
But it looks to me like sideways,
like go splash it right in the club.

545
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,101
And I was like,
oh,

546
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:41,110
this is hilarious.
And that wasn't,

547
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,963
that wasn't that that same night that 
you performed on stage and there was a 

548
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:48,730
bunch of musicians and it never worked 
together on stage.

549
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,950
Dave Navarro is,
you know,

550
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,784
that was a day Camp Freddy.
They had like a band or they just did a 

551
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:53,764
bunch of covers and I remember being a 
fucked up and they weren't calling me a 

552
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,180
bunch of like three or four times 
before.

553
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:06,181
I'm on to what is like a fucking drunk 
night.

554
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,450
That's us all.
We're barbecue.

555
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,940
God,
I can't see my eyes.

556
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,750
That's exactly the spot we were smoking 
a joint in too,

557
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,400
right?
It's exactly where it was bad.

558
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,970
I just never remember you looking at me 
sideways and go and go fuck up.

559
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,420
Go hide in the bathroom and smoke a 
joint of here.

560
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,560
I took way too good for that bullshit.
Especially in Vegas.

561
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,770
If any place in the world you're going 
to be over outlandish tipper,

562
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,920
be there because you'll get away with 
murder.

563
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,510
Almost literally the valets,
we'll say like,

564
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:43,810
all right,
Yo,

565
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,880
the cops are on their way.
You put it,

566
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,910
get the fuck on it.
I'm sure they want to keep them.

567
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,744
Checks come in.
Cops are coming whether you like it or 

568
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,380
not.
Imagine being a Carbon Vegas,

569
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:54,500
Jesus Christ who regardless how many 
people they have down there,

570
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,334
robin casinos and shit.
Crazy movie style heads with masks on 

571
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:03,980
and machine guns and shit taking over 
casinos.

572
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,873
But um,
oh I was talking about so that I was 

573
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,574
like so much money got froze.
So I was having like bust my ass crazy 

574
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:13,610
heart like on the road trying to make up
the difference for awhile.

575
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,940
And then my mother started going way 
downhill kind of fast over two years,

576
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,260
you know,
it was like dealing with that is anybody

577
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,900
going through that is is,
you know,

578
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,743
gets,
I mean there's a lot of things that go 

579
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:26,630
on in my life that I'm getting my heart 
sent out to those people.

580
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,230
But watching somebody you love just 
disappear.

581
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,690
It was tough man.
That was,

582
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,920
that was spective right.
It changes your perspective.

583
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,020
You realize that this is,
this is how it ends.

584
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,170
I had a lot of guilt involved because 
with a kid with cf,

585
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:42,990
I couldn't have my mom in home with a 
nurse in any infections that she could.

586
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,720
She was getting lung infections all the 
time.

587
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,910
So I had her in a home,
a really beautiful home.

588
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:48,830
They took a magnificent care of my 
mother.

589
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,900
But there was a lot of guilt.
I was,

590
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,763
I was fricking for a while,
like with a lot of darkness that I was 

591
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,360
swimming through.
And as that guy,

592
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,830
he's just wasn't good for me to come 
through.

593
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:58,940
And then,
you know,

594
00:24:58,941 --> 00:24:59,774
and then after cheap has,
and like layla has just been like a 

595
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:02,781
learning,
you know,

596
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,200
I'm only just me and my wife now,
it's,

597
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,240
she's seven years old and I think,
I'm not saying we got anything licked or

598
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,280
co,
but like the life we have to live,

599
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,320
we've been able to figure out with her 
cystic fibrosis,

600
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,880
cystic fibrosis.

601
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,040
Oh cause there's all,
I mean it's heavy.

602
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,903
There's a lot of shit you got to worry 
about infections and any common cold 

603
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,104
cause senator to the hot.
It's like so much pressure on a person 

604
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,190
to do that.
It's,

605
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:33,130
it's,
it's my wife and I like,

606
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
you know,
I won't fucking make it funny.

607
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,970
We,
we've been very close to the brink a few

608
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:38,804
times,
but we've finally gotten to a stage 

609
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,054
where it was like,
Nah,

610
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,740
none of that's going to break us.
You know what I mean?

611
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,574
We're good and we're good and we're good
in this life and theirs and we accept 

612
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,320
where we are and we're going to make 
sure this,

613
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,213
this young lady is,
is going to make it as deep and as far 

614
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,140
into this life as she can.
You know?

615
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,430
And it's been some medical innovations 
too,

616
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:57,051
right?
I haven't,

617
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:58,310
they're working on some stuff,
man.

618
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,143
There's a,
there's a couple of drugs that aren't 

619
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:03,280
quite for her yet because this drug has,
in the,

620
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,020
on the DNA level of the chain,
there's,

621
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:09,080
there's mutations.
Layla has two different mutations.

622
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:14,081
One's called the a D Delta f five five 
Oh eight I believe it is.

623
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,040
You've got me hiring a little drunk 
care,

624
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:16,940
but like,
no,

625
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,650
no,
no.

626
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,483
People know.
People who know know it's easy to find 

627
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,410
out what she has the most common.
That's the most common one.

628
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:24,110
Like the Delta five Oh eight,
and then she has this other,

629
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,840
a weird kind of off shoot one.
There's one for some people have a w.

630
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,540
Dot.
What they call a double delta.

631
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,703
There's a drug right now that's really 
working well for the people with the 

632
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:35,990
Double Delta.
They're starting to experiment it on,

633
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,453
on it for people with the single now 
does she have to be on a special diet 

634
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,740
like uh,
uh,

635
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,320
the only diet we did,
we just need her to,

636
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:45,390
she needs to do,
they have a problem gaining waves.

637
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,920
Cystic fibrosis,
they um,

638
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,350
uh,
they don't process fats properly.

639
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:51,330
They have to take enzymes with 
everything they eat.

640
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,820
So gaining weights,
a real serious issue.

641
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,710
Um,
Laila actually has a g tube,

642
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:59,430
a feeding tube that she gets sick,
shake protein shakes a day,

643
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,370
pumped into her stomach.
Oh Wow.

644
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,960
She again,
if you're,

645
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,380
my daughter very rarely is down about 
this.

646
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:08,640
She'll have her moments,
don't get me wrong,

647
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,820
where it's like frustration and anger 
overheard it,

648
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,290
but it's,
this is life.

649
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,690
She's never known anything else.
So it's like at the same time,

650
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,420
like we post a lot about it.
We've made a decision.

651
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,270
Layla has her own page,
people are free to try and follow it.

652
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,104
If my wife will approve you,
if you can get by the security 

653
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,683
clearance.
Her thing is layla l a I l a beauty oh 

654
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:29,784
nine.
She wanted her own page because we 

655
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:32,694
start,
I've never posted anything without 

656
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:34,230
asking her.

657
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,063
Right.
Even when she was like barely able to 

658
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,040
understand,
I tried to be like,

659
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:38,874
can I post this picture?
A lot of people will see it and she'll 

660
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,833
say,
okay daddy.

661
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,990
And now she's,
you know,

662
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,310
she's sharp.
And uh,

663
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,520
about a year or so ago she was like,
I want my own instagram page.

664
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,000
I want to share my life,
like cystic fibrosis with people.

665
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:51,834
And so she's doing that and we,
this is may actually assisting fibrosis 

666
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,274
awareness month.
So we've been posting and she happened 

667
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:00,510
to be in the hospital the last 10 days.
She's home right now.

668
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,520
Recovering.
Um,

669
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,443
Chelsea pneumonia.
Do an article on a cystic fibrosis 

670
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:06,840
treatment.
And what was that?

671
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,520
It was a while ago.
I don't know,

672
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,780
but my wife and I are,
I did it involve CBDS?

673
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,823
I don't remember because I read a send 
me things and we're investigating some 

674
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,694
stuff on that level right now because 
there are a lot of good things going 

675
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:21,510
along with this because it's one of 
them.

676
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,363
It's one of the best anti inflammatories
there are with no side effects and all 

677
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:27,180
kinds of stuff.
We're not using it all my daughter yet,

678
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,090
but we're investigating like what kind 
of uses there are you,

679
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:30,924
I forget.
I might have to go back through my 

680
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:34,080
emails or whatnot and so I remember you 
did send me something.

681
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,080
I don't remember if it was cbds or stem 
cells or some shit,

682
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,170
but I just saw lapsed and now there are 
a lot of levels they're working on,

683
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,333
on the stem cell level there.
There's a lot of things going on where 

684
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:45,900
it's like if they can create correct 
things on a cellular level,

685
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,940
at some point it's going to be,
yeah,

686
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,010
there's never going to be a cure.
It's a genetic disease,

687
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,710
so you can't say cure in that sense.
You know what I mean?

688
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,760
Like the way it works is my w two p the 
two people that are,

689
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,100
that fathered a child have to each have 
the gene.

690
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,530
All right.
So me and my wife are known as what,

691
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,380
what are known as carriers,
which we never knew cause we've searched

692
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:07,650
our whole history after we found out.
Nobody in my family's ever,

693
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,920
ever had this.
Nobody in her family ever,

694
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:12,660
ever had this.
But we're known as what's carriers.

695
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,450
So when we got together and we had a 
child,

696
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,530
there's a one in four chance that child 
is going to have cystic fibrosis,

697
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,860
there's a two and four chance that 
they're going to be a carrier.

698
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,383
Oh Wow.
There's a one in four chance they have 

699
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:29,310
no nothing at all,
which is our other daughter Sadie.

700
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,050
So we kind of represent the whole 
spectrum.

701
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,041
Yeah.
Like our family,

702
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,874
you know,
and Layla,

703
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,480
her mom,
me and Sadie.

704
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,530
Um,
which is another reason I go,

705
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,900
I'm not having six kids cause I love 
being a dad,

706
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:42,370
but it's like two cystic fibrosis

707
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,700
children in the same household is even,
and a lot of people do it.

708
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,930
It's hard because they pass infections 
and it's very,

709
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:52,360
as it [inaudible].
I can't even imagine how the people with

710
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:53,194
multiple,
two or three kids with cystic fibrosis 

711
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,223
pull it off.
I hats off because I know what his 

712
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,370
language,
just one that's kind of the,

713
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,233
um,
of not just t must be changing you as a 

714
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:05,464
person.
Like think about like how much more 

715
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,474
compassionate this has made you and how 
much more appreciative of Hell I've had 

716
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:14,440
to also accept and learn how to deal 
with a lot of anger.

717
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,790
Yeah.
A lot of anger.

718
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,450
Like,
um,

719
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:16,820
uh,
I,

720
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,910
I consider myself a pretty spiritual 
person.

721
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:20,770
Like I said,
I've explored a lot of religions.

722
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,030
Um,
I find religions confining,

723
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,361
you know,
I mean,

724
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,970
I believe in a greater power,
greater high,

725
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:28,900
whatever,
something bigger than us.

726
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,220
I kind of believe in that,
you know,

727
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:35,221
whether you want to call it God or just 
are connected collective energy,

728
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,760
you what I mean,
whatever it might be.

729
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,700
Somewhere in between their lives,
something greater than us.

730
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,990
Um,
I felt for another reason,

731
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:46,730
the last three years is,
is um,

732
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,340
what's the captain's name?
And,

733
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:50,380
uh,
in forrest gump,

734
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,360
Captain Ed is,
or no captain,

735
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,910
oh,
Captain Dan,

736
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,400
Lieutenant Dan,
I for the last couple of years,

737
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm Lieutenant Dan on the top of that 
fucking sailboat.

738
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,510
Like,
fuck you,

739
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,240
that this is what you're going to do to 
this little kid,

740
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:04,571
you know?
I mean,

741
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,180
watching my child suffer,
you know what I mean?

742
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:09,150
And there's greater,
there's huge injustices and world.

743
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,660
And,
and let me tell you another thing,

744
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,900
having to take my daughter to children's
hospitals all the time,

745
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,200
I see people that have it worse.
Do you know what I mean?

746
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,420
Angela,
do you not know?

747
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,310
I'm a huge fan.
I don't know him personally,

748
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,020
but I'm a huge fan.
He's a great dude.

749
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,300
But one of the things he said to me,
I'll never forget,

750
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,860
he was talking about the secret.
Do you remember when the secret was this

751
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:30,694
big movie,
the book traction and people are going 

752
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:35,800
to manifest their own destiny and they 
were going to make it happen.

753
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,080
And everything in your life you created 
in your mind.

754
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,540
And he was like,
fuck you.

755
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,220
You're telling a young sick kid that she
made that herself.

756
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,370
She made that he,
she made herself have leukemia.

757
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,060
She made herself have cancer.
You're telling me that fuck you.

758
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,650
Fuck you.
And when he said that,

759
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:54,311
I was like,
wow,

760
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:57,280
I never thought about it that way.
But he's totally right.

761
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,680
That's exactly what it is.
Like you can't,

762
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,573
that's ridiculous.
You're dealing with a bunch of people 

763
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,080
that have become successful and told you
why.

764
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,630
Cause I saw it happening.
What about the people that saw it happen

765
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:11,500
and it didn't happen?
This is bullshit or a far greater number

766
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,870
by that.
It's a part of life.

767
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,780
It's not the whole key to manufacturing 
a life.

768
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,740
It's an excellent like being a positive 
person,

769
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,530
being healthy,
having a good vision and focus.

770
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,780
All those things are like contributing 
factors.

771
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,973
But kids that are sick or the monkey 
wrench in any idea that we've created 

772
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,310
our own reality,
I don't buy,

773
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,540
you can't make a baby responsible for 
cancer.

774
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,733
That's crazy.
You also can't make a god responsible 

775
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:39,111
for like,
uh,

776
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,100
God has a plan.

777
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,530
You know,
sometimes there's not a fucking plan.

778
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,053
Sometimes there's a glitch in the 
goddamn matrix and you just gotta deal 

779
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:48,980
with it.
You know,

780
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:52,160
you got to handle it.
And the more important thing for me,

781
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,803
that second most important thing in my 
life other than keeping layla is 

782
00:32:56,301 --> 00:33:00,380
healthiest possible,
is making sure she knows that you know,

783
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,333
she can still achieve and all she can.
She's at an age now where like she 

784
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:07,190
kinda,
and I,

785
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,010
you know,
I'm not trying to have her hate me in 10

786
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,110
years if she ever hears this,
like we're giving up her business,

787
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:16,430
but like she's in a stage right now 
where she's very resentful of Xi ix.

788
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,320
She expresses it well,
she'll say,

789
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,400
she'll say,
I hate this.

790
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,440
I hate that I have this.
I just want to be normal.

791
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,250
I just want to have a normal life.
And it fucking rips your heart out man.

792
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,900
But you can't,
you have to say,

793
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:27,950
hey,
hey,

794
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,900
you are normal.
This is your life.

795
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,970
Your life is normal.
It's like Carla,

796
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,180
I'm a big Carlene guy.
You know what?

797
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,053
I know you're studied student of it,
but it's like he had his routine where 

798
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:40,130
it's like about being home made or all 
natural.

799
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,500
He's like,
everything's fucking all natural,

800
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,210
right?
Ain't no matter what you do with it.

801
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:46,700
It's all fucking natural.
And that's Kinda how I tried to approach

802
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,020
it.
Whether it's like you are normal,

803
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,150
this is your normal life.
You know,

804
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,650
you're not in any better or worse or you
know what I mean?

805
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,690
You have to,
there's,

806
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,883
there's fights.
People fight that you don't even see 

807
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:57,080
Layla.
You know what I mean?

808
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:58,910
That you don't understand.
Yours is obvious.

809
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,650
Yours is here,
right here in front of you to fight.

810
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:01,940
Some people are going to fight demons.

811
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,550
They'll never meet.
Yeah.

812
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,570
This is a phrase on that.
Uh,

813
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,450
what is it?
Comparison is the enemy of happiness.

814
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000
Thank you.
I'm fucking going to use that Joe.

815
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,740
That's a,
I'm going to look it up and I'm going to

816
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,050
find out.
Find out whose quote that was.

817
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,350
Comparison is the enemy of happiness.
I really liked that.

818
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,970
That's a,
that's a very useful,

819
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,363
the inspiration sentence.
You should get inspiration from other 

820
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:29,960
people,
but comparison is not really healthy.

821
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,590
Who was it as Theodore Roosevelt said,
comparison is the thief of joy.

822
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,311
Oh,
there you go.

823
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:36,890
Perfect.
That's so somebody probably me.

824
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:39,140
I probably fucked it up,
but that's even better.

825
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,580
God Damn Theodore Roosevelt.
You've had mother fucker.

826
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,840
He was a bad ass motherfucker.
Motherfucker writing without charging up

827
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,970
the hill and San Juan and all that shit,
man.

828
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:47,860
Right?
Comparisons.

829
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,630
Theodore.
The other one was,

830
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,860
well,
this is the guy that made the,

831
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,660
he,
he set aside,

832
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,730
um,
the national parks system.

833
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,000
He set aside like Theodore Roosevelt was
the reason why we have the grandkids,

834
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,200
which our current guys trying to 
dismantle,

835
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,470
not the Grand Canyon.
I know.

836
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,900
Cam was happy about that shit.
No,

837
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,400
everybody's upset about it.
It's,

838
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:07,940
um,
well,

839
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,320
shout out to duke.

840
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,430
He's in Alberta Right now.
I know.

841
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,580
I see him giving you a hard time.
I Cam and you,

842
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,370
he's so nice.
He's a nice guy.

843
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,800
Nice.
And people threatened him.

844
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:19,371
He just put,
Hey,

845
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:20,480
look,
this guy's threatened me.

846
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:21,231
We what?
I threatened you.

847
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:25,250
I went and threaten you and kill you.
Well,

848
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:26,600
the whole,
but I wouldn't eat you.

849
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:29,270
That's why I won't kill you.
It's a lot of people in other countries,

850
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:30,104
man.
A lot of people that get mad about is 

851
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,980
hunting pictures.
They're from some other country.

852
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,350
They're all,
a lot of them are from South America,

853
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,710
like a Yam.
You're going to be,

854
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:40,020
oh God.
When the electricity all goes out,

855
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:42,270
they're going to become an ia man.
They're going to be coming to you.

856
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,553
There'll be happy as fuck,
and I need a recommendation on the 

857
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:46,770
beginner bow.
I'll,

858
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,610
I can hook you up.

859
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,360
Oh,
there we go.

860
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,380
We've got Joseph.
Oh Man.

861
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,570
Now Dude,
I'll get a hoyt to send you one.

862
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,690
You really want to learn.
Yeah,

863
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,500
that'd be the Shit I do.
All right,

864
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,260
well next time I'm hanging out with John
Dudley,

865
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,510
I'll have him come and coach you and 
we'll make a little video.

866
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,030
Let me know.
Maybe I can attend me.

867
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,893
I can jump in.
I want him to coach you and teach you 

868
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:06,540
how to shoot.
That's amazing.

869
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,830
That would be perfect.
We'll do it.

870
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,480
We'll make that happen.
We'll make that happen.

871
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,720
Yeah,
so that's three years kind of a lot.

872
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,093
Condensed Reader's digest version is I,
I mostly wasn't in prepared to be here 

873
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:20,340
and hang out and have fun.
I would have been like the,

874
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,680
I would have been the like episode that 
everybody's like,

875
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,543
oh,
you gotta hear this heart wrenching 

876
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:25,200
fucking,
oh my God.

877
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,850
Well,
it's heart wrenching now man.

878
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,430
But I'm glad she's doing better now,
but it's heart wrenching.

879
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,650
But,
but um,

880
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,490
I can stay in here like a man and be 
like,

881
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,061
look,
here's,

882
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,470
I've been through it.
You know,

883
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:36,150
you didn't want to see me.
And it's like you didn't,

884
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,420
it's like you don't want to see me 
cowering in the foxhole now the battle's

885
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,070
over.
It's like,

886
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,903
yeah,
I cowered in the Fox hole for a little 

887
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:43,674
while,
but then we got out and we won the 

888
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,080
battle or you know what I mean?
That's,

889
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,830
that's where I want it to be before I 
came and I didn't have any,

890
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,510
and I know I didn't need anything to 
promote,

891
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,840
but all of a sudden it's like I did this
free project and I was like,

892
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,380
I really just put it out in my fans have
found it,

893
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,170
but the response has been so good behind
it.

894
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,003
It's like,
I want to get this out there a little 

895
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:04,620
further.
So it gave me an excuse to be like,

896
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,270
I think it's time for me to be on the 
podcast yet and if you want to buy a CD,

897
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,090
they still have no we don't.
You don't.

898
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,850
You could maybe at our shows.
All right.

899
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:14,684
Cause if we bring them there and we've 
charged basically what they cost us to 

900
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,700
make them and ship them wherever we got 
to take them and try reading that shit.

901
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,091
Yeah,
you don't.

902
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:22,180
You can't read it.
That's the luck.

903
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,910
It's fucking gangster calligraphy.
Shout out,

904
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,460
shout out to big sleep whenever he's one
of the finest out to big sleeps.

905
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:30,181
You win.
Yeah.

906
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,014
There you go.
Shout out to big sleeves for the 

907
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:34,920
calligraphy.
That's gangster stuff.

908
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,630
Read it.
You weren't built to read it.

909
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,220
That's all it means.
I get it.

910
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,053
Now that you've explained it,
I can read it and it's just a picture 

911
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,443
like old school,
old English calligraphy and then mixed 

912
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:45,570
with gangster letters.
Yeah.

913
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:46,404
And you can see I struggle with the R 
and because it comes back up like it 

914
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:52,290
comes down and then it bang,
Bang.

915
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,570
That's his artistic.
That's art man.

916
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,411
I understand.
Let me,

917
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,120
let me explain his mind.
Made up a letter,

918
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,510
let me know and seems to me like a made 
up letter.

919
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,523
That's some Gaelic Shit.
Old School data end is actually pretty 

920
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,240
old school.
English,

921
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,980
old English.
Do you know what that is?

922
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,410
Jamie does.
Ellery can end to you at the end.

923
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,700
It looks cool.
That looks like an end.

924
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,200
You.
Where do you see the end?

925
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,850
The end here.
Wait a minute.

926
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:17,820
That's not the Ar,
but where's the fucking are?

927
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,020
Oh my God.
This is ridiculous.

928
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,050
That's the are that is to add.
Oh,

929
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,700
okay.
All right.

930
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,350
Let's see.
Here is the art without the arm down.

931
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,820
Listen to it all.
It's beautiful.

932
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:36,430
Don't get me wrong.
First of all,

933
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:38,720
if you can't read it,
that's why it's art.

934
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,970
All right.
Oh,

935
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,410
okay.
And it's gangster shit.

936
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,570
Every gangster,
if you go to Pico Union,

937
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,400
those guys will read that shit like it 
ain't,

938
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,720
it's going to be,
oh yeah,

939
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:47,830
that's his war porn.
Oh,

940
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:49,060
that's fun.
Hilarious.

941
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,270
But the point is,
all right,

942
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,300
I was struggling to make my next singer 
songwriter ish hip hop kind of.

943
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,233
I was kind of revisiting the Whitey Ford
formula a little bit and expanding on 

944
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:00,394
it,
but I got kind of stuck halfway through 

945
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,063
because I was just,
after all of this stuff that I went 

946
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,990
through,
I thought it would be smart to judge.

947
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,740
I kind of,
another thing about cystic fibrosis,

948
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,574
it's really isolating because you get 
really protective of your child and 

949
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:17,710
other people who were sick.
I mean,

950
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:19,300
I remember at first I used to come and 
be like,

951
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,560
everybody's going to be all right at the
studio,

952
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:21,371
right?
Nobody's sick.

953
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:21,890
I mean,
you know,

954
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,840
I trust you now.
I know.

955
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,760
It's like if you were sick,
you'd tell me.

956
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,800
Um,
but you still,

957
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,263
I understand what you live that life and
you get tired of asking your friends 

958
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:31,774
every five seconds.
And so the invitations to hang out 

959
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,250
become a little less,
it's not an intentional thing.

960
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,770
It's this slow kind of isolation of 
yourself.

961
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,200
My friends didn't do it to me.
I did it to myself.

962
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,873
And I'm coming out of that now.
Like I'm hanging out with a lot of my 

963
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:46,180
old friends and seeing things,
which is great.

964
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,750
But,
so like I was stuck in a studio,

965
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,570
it was just me and like an engineer kid 
who,

966
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,830
I had a guy that worked for me for many 
years who moved up north and then I,

967
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,050
I had this new guy who's good at his 
job,

968
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:01,930
but it was like I w I there was no,
but you're Kinda your own boss.

969
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:02,764
Right?
So how do you decide when you're going 

970
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:04,204
to go into the studio?
How do you decide when you're going to 

971
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:06,100
write just,
well,

972
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:06,934
because I don't know how you think about
life because we don't live by the 

973
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,320
paycheck rules.
You know what I mean?

974
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,740
We,
so I'm thinking six months out,

975
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,323
I know I'm good for Pri right now.
I could sit on my ass for a year before 

976
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,620
cash ran out,
let alone other stuff.

977
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,320
So,
but I'm always thinking six months.

978
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,154
All right.
Like if I creating something now that's 

979
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:29,374
going to generate like you're writing 
your next stuff for whatever your next 

980
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,360
special is going to be,
you know,

981
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,220
what do you get at one of those two of 
those a year?

982
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,080
Like a solid hour?
I mean,

983
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:41,380
am I,
when I boil it down after two years,

984
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,410
it's like a real good hour and 10 
minutes.

985
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm sorry.
So that's what I'm saying.

986
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,170
So you're thinking on kind of that time 
level.

987
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,004
You're like,
I'm working this out to get to this 

988
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:50,470
point.
That's what my schedule is.

989
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:52,570
Now.
You know,

990
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,150
anybody who files my career,
whether it was house of pain or everlast

991
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:56,984
psych,
I've never been this like some cats are 

992
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:00,760
like clockwork with their product.
They a year,

993
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:01,960
every year,
every year and a half,

994
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:02,771
there's an album,
bang,

995
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:03,171
boom,
boom,

996
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,090
bride.
Me,

997
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:06,040
I've had two year intervals,
three year intervals,

998
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,993
four year intervals.
One know never a one year in it will 

999
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:09,970
never,
I'm never that guy.

1000
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,440
I have to be inspired.
I have to,

1001
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:16,710
but I know if I'm not creating something
and sometime the show money,

1002
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,480
which is what I live off from now,
basically we,

1003
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:21,950
besides the mailbox stuff,
um,

1004
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,740
gets smaller as long.

1005
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,540
As long as you're,
if you can always just make,

1006
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,700
you don't even have to have a hit at my 
stage of career.

1007
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:28,660
You know what I mean?
I don't need hits.

1008
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:29,494
I just need new material where it's like
I got something to promote that gives a 

1009
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:34,490
promoter.
You and I do a lot of work in Europe.

1010
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,740
I do more work in Europe than I do here.
Yeah.

1011
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,670
Yeah.
Way More.

1012
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,190
I'm about to wait six weeks in Europe.
Wow.

1013
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,260
I got,
I leave literally day after tomorrow.

1014
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,880
Um,
whew.

1015
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,500
That's a lot for us.
I go to Napa,

1016
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:46,334
actually,
I got a festival in Napa and then I 

1017
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,610
could come home for a day and then I go 
to Europe for six weeks.

1018
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,593
Nap is a trump and I made,
if I do well in pockets in the United 

1019
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,793
States,
and there's a lot of places like the 

1020
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,450
south,
I think I would do great,

1021
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:58,700
but I've never gone as like,
promoters don't call.

1022
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,770
I don't know what it is.
I don't chase it.

1023
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:01,630
Here's the,
you know what?

1024
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,660
I'm,
I hope I'm not all over this.

1025
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,790
I've never chased this.
I've never ran it down.

1026
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,683
I've,
I'm where I am because I just looked at 

1027
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:11,360
the signs on the road and said,
oh,

1028
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,520
go that way.
And I go there.

1029
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,950
I'm not the guy who thinks I'm the worst
social media.

1030
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,130
I got 40,000 fucking instagram 
followers.

1031
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:19,964
You know,
I've sold millions and millions of 

1032
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,590
records.
I don't,

1033
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,220
I don't try.
I don't want it.

1034
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,500
I don't know what it is.
I I get extreme amounts of joy.

1035
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,540
I think we talked about this on the 
first podcast.

1036
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,374
I already did that.
My music is more famous than my face 

1037
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,930
like that.
I think it,

1038
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:34,764
cause I did say like,
I like to go to Ralph's and get it to 

1039
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:36,764
all of bar and just fucking get olives 
and nobody knows who the fuck I am and 

1040
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:39,750
jump around.

1041
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,660
It's actually playing in the supermarket
or something.

1042
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:42,494
You know,
it's fucking hilarious to me that Steve 

1043
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,523
Miller was like one of the greatest rock
stars of all time because nobody knows 

1044
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:50,980
what the fuck he looks like.
Take the money and run diseases.

1045
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,450
So I'm happy with Joe.
Bobby sue.

1046
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,540
Fuck is that guy look like cause I'm a 
smoker.

1047
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,010
It was that much older boy and I'm a 
midnight toker.

1048
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:02,990
Yeah,
the joker.

1049
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,330
Um,
jungle love.

1050
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,250
I was another great jam.
Damn.

1051
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,900
He had some great jams.
So I'm sitting in the studio by myself,

1052
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:14,100
stuck.
Um,

1053
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,413
uh,
uh,

1054
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,110
a friend of mine asked me to do a 
feature on his rap record,

1055
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:19,040
which I really wasn't,
you know,

1056
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,551
I mean,
it wasn't,

1057
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,384
I don't do a lot of that anymore.
How long had it been since you had done 

1058
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:22,731
it?
Well,

1059
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:24,880
I made the first La Coka Nostra album.
I was,

1060
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,390
it was,
I was part of the whole album.

1061
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,190
That was a few years back.
That was oh eight.

1062
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,113
Oh wait,
oh wait.

1063
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,703
And I've done it.
A wrap here are wrapped there for 

1064
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:35,090
friends for a long time to go between 
that and war porn.

1065
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,880
You new project war porn.
When did you guys start that?

1066
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,591
What happened?
I'm,

1067
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:41,090
I'm getting to it is,
is this cat asked me,

1068
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,760

1069
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:45,530
Just do Raju.

00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,300
plenty of shops on this show,
Jamie.

1071
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,150
Like,
like the fight or from a street fighter,

1072
00:43:50,151 --> 00:43:50,984
you know what I mean?
Right.

1073
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,370
He has an album out.
Um,

1074
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,830
and I did a song on there and it came 
out of May.

1075
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:59,420
That was so like in love with what I did
like after all these years,

1076
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,254
like wow,
I busted a fucking really dope rhyme on 

1077
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:04,400
that thing that him and I was like,
Yo,

1078
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:06,680
we should do a little mix tape thing 
just to help promote this,

1079
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:07,514
whatever,
whatever.

1080
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,700
Something happened.
He just couldn't be involved.

1081
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:13,080
And then I immediately thought of my 
friend and,

1082
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,620
and,
and,

1083
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,520
and,
and,

1084
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,100
and,
and partner now,

1085
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,383
uh,
this guy's sick jacken from a group 

1086
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:21,470
called psycho Rome Latin,
excellent names,

1087
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,840
sick Jagat and cycle where he was going 
to be,

1088
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,510
he's going to come next time he,
I called him today and I was like,

1089
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:27,344
Yo,
I totally space if you want to come do 

1090
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,930
this.
Very is the ball guy right there.

1091
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,880
Uh,
and then divine did all the beats and he

1092
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,980
rhymes on the project.
But the way it came back,

1093
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:37,080
it was like when Dude couldn't do a 
divine already,

1094
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:38,850
he was making the beads.
I Call Sick Jack.

1095
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:39,241
I was like,
Yo,

1096
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,380
I got this project.
He came,

1097
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:45,381
heard all the beats and we literally 
made this record in like a week and um,

1098
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,870
a divine styler,
a short background.

1099
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,810
I would not be in this business.
I would not be making music if it wasn't

1100
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:52,644
for that man.
Um,

1101
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,330
he's the first guy that ever told me I 
could rap.

1102
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,403
I used to want to be a graffiti artist.
He was an amazing graffiti arts and I 

1103
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:58,014
was just following him around is like a 
16 year old trying to learn like styles 

1104
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:02,364
and shit.
And I would bus wraps because they were 

1105
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:07,380
making music to like make fun of Shit 
like your mom or this or that.

1106
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:08,460
And they would always be like,
Yo,

1107
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:09,294
you can rap.
You should like make a tape when you 

1108
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,110
just was adr.
Yeah.

1109
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,430
Does it get you high?
No,

1110
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,570
not really.
I mean not,

1111
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,270
not in the sense that,
I mean maybe a collect after a while you

1112
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:20,760
might feel a little different,
but like you were mass and shit.

1113
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,830
I'll do they wear a mask.

1114
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,400
Well now they were rude ones.
We used to just tie Bandanas and Oh,

1115
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:25,234
okay.
And cause I would imagine if you're 

1116
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,280
standing there like some of those I 
passed.

1117
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,693
If you were like in a room like this and
tried to paint that whole wall 

1118
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,950
ventilation,
you'd probably would.

1119
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,990
But this is mostly outdoor on the wall,
on the bus on in La,

1120
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,490
the the,
the scene was like down.

1121
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:42,760
We had a yard.
Every crew,

1122
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,613
you'd have a yard somewhere,
like in an industrial area between 

1123
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:46,404
buildings where there's like a brick 
wall in two buildings and you'd just 

1124
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,490
bombed it would be called your yard.
You know what I mean?

1125
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,610
This cruise yard or that crew yard,
the other crews,

1126
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:55,650
yards and you'd like bomb over there 
pieces.

1127
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:56,580
That's not good.
Right.

1128
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,350
It's like it's,
it's a game almost.

1129
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,660
Except this little snake.
Yes.

1130
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:01,710
If they caught you for sure.

1131
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,050
Kick your ass and steal your pain.
Oh No.

1132
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,200
You Know David Show is,
you know David,

1133
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,423
I love David Chaum.
David's got these crazy fucking videos 

1134
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:13,860
he's putting up on instagram now.
Three m thrown paint all over the place.

1135
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:16,830
Floor fumes.
He's high on paint films.

1136
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,830
He's going crazy.
He's like some industrial building.

1137
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:22,140
Just,
I love that dude.

1138
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,153
Taking a trailer,
like running it around like he's so far 

1139
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,940
out there,
there's no map.

1140
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,550
No one's got a fucking map.
David Choe land.

1141
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:34,690
I mean he's got a cart and he's just 
pouring paint on the ground.

1142
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,880
Savage.
He's also super smart.

1143
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,760
He's a great dude.
This is on purpose.

1144
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:43,320
This is,
there's purpose to what he does,

1145
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:44,310
man.
I believe that.

1146
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,031
No,
David,

1147
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:46,590
he's a sweet,
sweet guy.

1148
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:49,470
Like I really like him as a person.
I don't know if he still does it.

1149
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:50,304
I did his podcast,
I think I kicked his podcast because he 

1150
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:55,430
heard me on yours and he was like,
comment,

1151
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,710
please bring your guitar and you know,
he doesn't now bank something.

1152
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,543
I take very serious pride in the fact 
I'm the first guy to ever do music on 

1153
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:04,261
this thing.
I don't,

1154
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,610
and I think it's honey,
honey,

1155
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:06,444
the only guy,
other people that have really done 

1156
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:08,470
music.
Gary brought us,

1157
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:12,000
Gary Clark Jr brought his guitar band.
Dude,

1158
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,970
I love that guys the best.
He's such a nice guy too,

1159
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:15,970
man.
Oh Man.

1160
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:19,260
It's such a sweet music man.
I'm really a big fan of that dude.

1161
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,153
I'm a big fan of him as a person and as 
a musician and I went to see a honey 

1162
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:24,564
honey played in downtown La.
They had like this midnight show on a 

1163
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,980
Wednesday night and I'm Gary Clark 
joined

1164
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,070
them on stage and Gary Clark Jr and 
honey honey.

1165
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,630
God Damn.
It was good.

1166
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:36,280
And I was like,
you know,

1167
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,460
10 feet away and there was a hundred 
people in the room and it was Gary Clark

1168
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,350
Jr just Jammin with honey honey.
And it was,

1169
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,810
he's one of the baddest motherfuckers on
the guitar ever.

1170
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:52,000
He is a beautiful sound,
like he's got such a distinct,

1171
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,571
oh,
here it is.

1172
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:54,270
Jamie's got it a,
I put it on my instagram.

1173
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,540
I think I remember this.
You hear this?

1174
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,213
No,
it's him.

1175
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:41,840
Is there a

1176
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,673
flare or am I not seeing him or,
well the bass player is the dude in 

1177
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:49,150
front of us that's been,
he's just been and everything.

1178
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,660
Mentors.
He played another guitar.

1179
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:51,980
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1180
00:48:51,981 --> 00:48:52,791
That's like,
it's hard.

1181
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,150
It's not a big pick up a bass.

1182
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,340
Oh well somebody is putting down some 
nice low end.

1183
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,280
He must've had that Gary queued.
Somebody has an acute.

1184
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:02,140
Isn't that it sounded good.
That's all I was making the point of.

1185
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,250
Yeah,
man.

1186
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,600
God Damn,
I don't have a bass player.

1187
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,430
My keyboard player,
Brian who comes through here,

1188
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,530
he's got the meanest fucking left hand 
on the keys.

1189
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:10,900
Like he plays all his keys with the 
right and the base is left.

1190
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,370
Oh Wow.
That's amazing.

1191
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:13,620
We're a trio now.
Like me and my,

1192
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,493
when I do my band stuff,
it's just me and two other got drummer 

1193
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:17,380
in him.
That's amazing.

1194
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,000
And we sounded like six guys.
It's crazy.

1195
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,490
Gary Clark has got his own sound.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1196
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:25,030
Like you hear his sound like Stevie Ray 
Vaughan is a perfect example of that.

1197
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,073
Like I hear some Stevie Ray Vaughan and 
I'll hear like one or two bars and I'd 

1198
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:29,770
go,
that's Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1199
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,063
He's got that sound.
You know this is like a certainly 

1200
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,140
gibbons slide.
Yeah.

1201
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,251
Yes,
yes,

1202
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,084
yes.
The minute played on a album of mine on 

1203
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:41,050
a couple of songs.
I love Warren,

1204
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:41,884
the ghost of Whitey Ford.
And he came in with this little crate 

1205
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,710
amp head,
which crate is not a fancy company.

1206
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:50,110
It's like a cheaper,
not cheaper,

1207
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,630
I won't call it him,
but like it wasn't like super hot.

1208
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,290
It was like some regular fucking head 
and this one pedal and live sound.

1209
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,900
I was like,
how the fuck did you get?

1210
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:01,600
And it's just something that some guys 
have a magic man.

1211
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,240
Some guys have a magic about the sound.
Me,

1212
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:06,190
I play acoustic.
That's what I'm best at.

1213
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,380
I know how to make that sound good.
There's,

1214
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,510
I have electric guitars but I could 
never get my,

1215
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:11,344
I could have that same fucking guitar is
Gary Clark Jr right there and the same 

1216
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:19,321
equipment and set it the same way and it
probably won't sound the same.

1217
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,970
Yeah.
So in the neighborhood,

1218
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:22,804
but I'm saying there's something,
there's some people that just got to 

1219
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,610
inherit and magic about feel on an 
instrument.

1220
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,760
You know what I mean?
It's crazy amazing about someone who can

1221
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:35,540
play an instrument like that is that 
they're making some sound,

1222
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,380
that it syncs up with our brains so 
well.

1223
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:44,090
It syncs up with our hearing so well 
that it just gives you pleasure,

1224
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,321
you know?
And by the way,

1225
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:49,280
folks that's with an iphone,
can microphone and camera.

1226
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,510
I mean that is a terrible recording 
device as far as like getting good audio

1227
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:54,880
quality.
So when you're there,

1228
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,740
I really fucking good.
There's more computing power in here.

1229
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,590
Then there was it then when they 
supposedly send people to the moon,

1230
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,240
you know what I mean?
To the moon.

1231
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,074
Alice supposedly.
Do you think they sent people on the 

1232
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,400
moon?
You know what?

1233
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,200
That's one of them things.
How do you know the fucking truth?

1234
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,120
But I'll tell you one fucking thing for 
sure.

1235
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,100
The earth is not flat.
Fuck you.

1236
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,230
See,
that's where it gets tricky,

1237
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:16,064
right?
How do we know these scientists could 

1238
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:20,894
all be like,
Ooh,

1239
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,320
look at the mood that's Brown,
but wouldn't be interesting if so,

1240
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:25,970
what is the only one that wasn't?
And that was,

1241
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,000
that was why everybody was trying to,
Hey,

1242
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:31,440
I'm just trying to see both sides.
Just asking questions.

1243
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,601
I'm cool with the,
Hey,

1244
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:33,434
it makes her fun arguments.
But the moon landing is my favorite day 

1245
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,080
next to big full moon landings.
My favorite aspect to me,

1246
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:41,370
let me say that there's a lot of things 
I've seen you on TV.

1247
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,500
Either suspect,
Hey,

1248
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:45,770
I saw a movie maybe 15 years ago called 
wag the dog.

1249
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,300
That fucked everything up for me.

1250
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,870
Like when I see the news,
I wa I see wag the dog all day long.

1251
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,430
Those a great movie.
Yeah.

1252
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,990
And then do you remember when the CIA,
um,

1253
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:59,930
it came out to the CIA had pad a half of
million dollars to make the fucking isis

1254
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:01,190
videos.
What was it?

1255
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,390
How much?
How much was it?

1256
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,170
Was it a half a million dollars?
$500,000 to make may?

1257
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,920
It might've been more than that.
I am.

1258
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,710
I am.
I like way selling it short.

1259
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,420
Was it like $500 million?
No,

1260
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:12,680
I think it was a half.
How much was it?

1261
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,300
I think it was half a million to make 
videos,

1262
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,210
but still like to make homemade looking 
very,

1263
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,870
it was like half a million dollars.
That's a lot of money.

1264
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,460
I think it was more than that.
540 maybe it was five 540 million.

1265
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,430
Half a billion.
Okay,

1266
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,520
thank you.
Yeah,

1267
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,250
when I said 500,000 I was like,
no,

1268
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,310
that sounds cheap.
Half a billion.

1269
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,140
Yeah,
and so what they stop to think about how

1270
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:39,290
many x men movies you can make for a 
half a billion.

1271
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,273
I mean what kind of a ship return on 
your investment and ferb fake out kind 

1272
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,440
of videos.
Know what that is?

1273
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,860
Know what that is right there.
That's two motherfuckers.

1274
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,310
The guy who owns that from is the buddy 
is somebody you know.

1275
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:51,144
That's,
that's the thing I was talking about 

1276
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:54,620
earlier where they figure out how to get
the fucking money.

1277
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:55,550
Anyways,
that's it.

1278
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,533
That's it.
That's the kind of shit I'm talking 

1279
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,520
about.
Well that is about a clear,

1280
00:52:58,521 --> 00:52:59,354
as an example,
as you can get where it's 540 players 

1281
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:02,174
back when,
remember what it was at 20 years ago 

1282
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:04,244
when they came with the whole thing 
where like a Pentagon was paying like 

1283
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,243
thousand dollars a hammer.
You're like your toilet seats were like 

1284
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,670
seven grand and you know,
it was like,

1285
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,020
I'm over that $540 million is a crazy 
number two.

1286
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,160
That's like,
wait,

1287
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:17,360
Whoa,
what the fuck?

1288
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,153
Jesus fully,
we talked a lot of money man or pores 

1289
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,260
war porn.
So like I said,

1290
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:25,160
divine was,
he's,

1291
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:25,830
he's,
he was,

1292
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,070
he's

1293
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,680
my mentor.
He's like back in the day before,

1294
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,683
it used to be if somebody,
like if you were the son of somebody 

1295
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,533
that was like your mentor,
like now it's kind of almost like they 

1296
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:37,200
treat it like an inch.
So if I was device,

1297
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:39,210
I'm the son of divine styler in this 
game.

1298
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,910
That's how I look at it.
I learned style from him.

1299
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:42,744
I learned how to rap from him.
He encouraged me to do it at first and 

1300
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:46,854
then I went on my own journey.
So coming back to do this project with 

1301
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:49,891
him was fun.
It was,

1302
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:50,724
this was strictly just in my mind,
an art project like literally we're 

1303
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:54,690
going to give this away.
We're going to,

1304
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,960
we're just going to make a few cds and 
make some fun art to surround it and you

1305
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:02,220
know it.
We'll call it a day and then it came out

1306
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,070
amazing and I'm not selling myself 
short.

1307
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:10,070
That shit is fucking banging hip hop and
it's free and you can get it at war porn

1308
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:13,530
industry's dot com and click on the mix 
tape and download it.

1309
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:14,311
It's free.
Well,

1310
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:15,810
I've been enjoying the videos,
man.

1311
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,580
It looks like he's having a video.
I'm going to play a good time to,

1312
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,620
it's the been the most fun I've had in 
forever.

1313
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,180
It's the point of like what?
Like I said,

1314
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,014
I was,
I was stuck in this Rut and then these 

1315
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:31,041
guys came into my studio and brought it 
alive again and I realize it's communal.

1316
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,480
Yeah.
What I do,

1317
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,860
even even when I'm trying to just 
express my own thought and idea,

1318
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,300
you got it's communal.
You need some people around you that are

1319
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:43,340
going to,
you need a,

1320
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,410
I'm sure guys like Joey Diaz or this for
you.

1321
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,080
Oh yeah.
When you have an idea for a routine or a

1322
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,760
Jew joke,
it'd be like,

1323
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,300
what do you think?

1324
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,133
Should I pursue that?
There's a guy that you'll turn to and 

1325
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:54,930
he'll be like,
fuck yeah,

1326
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,670
that's the move.
Or fuck no,

1327
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:58,590
don't do that.
It's better when there's a lot of,

1328
00:54:58,591 --> 00:54:59,750
yeah,
you feed off each other,

1329
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:02,220
you don't have fun and you,
you also like,

1330
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:06,090
it's very important to be happy for 
other people like Ge,

1331
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,953
like seeing other people.
Kick ass should make you feel better 

1332
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,973
like and being around bad motherfucker.
Shit like this in the studio when the 

1333
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:14,634
three of us are,
the official name of the group is war 

1334
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:19,650
porn industry's war.
Porn is the first record.

1335
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,540
Why War Porn?
What does that mean?

1336
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,430
Because it's fucking cause.
Exactly.

1337
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,190
What does it mean because,
exactly because everything's war porn.

1338
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,290
Turn on your TV.
It's war point.

1339
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,770
I'm reading this script.
I'm even more confused.

1340
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,560
This script.
No,

1341
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,393
it's the same thing.
We just separated it and made an ark 

1342
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:33,770
out.

1343
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,400
It's too confusing.
Oh well good.

1344
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,510
The logo is bad ass though.
I'm an old band.

1345
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,363
She was demand.
Let's shut down his right heel goes 

1346
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:43,450
dope.
But that,

1347
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,370
that is just going to reaffirm ideas of 
devil worship and pornography.

1348
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,730
He people are your monsters.
You're what's wrong.

1349
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,830
I intend to scare you about dope and 
manly and images you can get.

1350
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:57,630
There's a skull where the pussy should 
be.

1351
00:55:57,631 --> 00:56:01,410
There's thei had legs.
It's a death's head.

1352
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:06,220
Moth is the overall concept and this 
fishnet stockings involved with guns.

1353
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:07,054
That's the spine of the wings.
Trust and neat and he's a fucking bad 

1354
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,120
ass.
Dope as fuck and guns were that.

1355
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:16,070
I would consider getting that tattoo 
that somewhere like I'm like,

1356
00:56:16,071 --> 00:56:18,210
I might have,
it might be my my back piece.

1357
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:20,490
It might be,
that's a good back piece.

1358
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,290
That's a strong back piece.
No bullshit,

1359
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,400
but straighten out the words.

1360
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm just kidding.
Keep it as is.

1361
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,940
It's your lingo.
Imagine going to the Japanese people and

1362
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:31,331
go,
hey man,

1363
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:34,240
your language is a fucking too weird a 
English.

1364
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,340
Can you use English?
Use Ours.

1365
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,190
But on her.
So we got a few videos.

1366
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:41,140
What you got up right now?
You got anything close to up?

1367
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,500
Which one is this one or we got three 
videos.

1368
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,334
So one let's crank.
This one is the first one was called 

1369
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:47,464
world's end.
Do we want to go in chronological order 

1370
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:53,701
or we should if it's a piece sort of.
Here we go.

1371
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,020
Shout out to John.

Shout out to Grandpa from the great 

1373
00:57:14,061 --> 00:57:15,790

I hope you looking down,

1374
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,110

We drove in with Jesus.

1375
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,880
This is shot at the uh,

1376
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,600

apparently at the top of the Soto in the

1377
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:28,680
valley.
Really?

1378
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,710
Yeah.
Yeah,

1379
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,423
you're fine.
Put the needle of plates and rock final 

1380
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,640
fingers.
You get the plates in far cry.

1381
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,250
No whiskey bread scattered or fresh.
So rough.

1382
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,103
Why?
No is saw nine or we should get on your 

1383
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,920
idol.
Six cycle homicidal but titles,

1384
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:06,610
Glib spray on the random who the target 
is 10 and the way he had to stay on the,

1385
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:13,161
that sounded pulling away from me.
What I'm missing.

1386
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:31,190
Jack is one of the most slept on 
underrated MCS ever.

1387
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,940
Mccool weaponry,
green smoke.

1388
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,390
My remedy.
Passive aggressively choke my enemy,

in the building.
Baby is that old man rap.

1397
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,340

Now is this profile of the new world is 
broken.

1403

We're going to make many more records

It's cool to hear and you wrap again for

1414
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,673
a site is fun.
I really enjoyed your transition until 

1415
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:48,180
like more acoustic stuff.
I'm still doing that too,

1416
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:49,130
but yeah,
this is,

1417
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,890
this is fun.
Like this is unadulterated for me.

1418
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,040
Like you were talking about you need 
cats to push.

1419
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:56,874
You are golden.
The studio is like when Sig Jack comes 

1420
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,460
off the mic from saint averse,
he wants me to look at him and be like,

1421
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,200
fuck you gotta go,
Oh fuck dude.

1422
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:11,340
Your lyrics or no lyrics so sharp it,
both of those dudes that are,

1423
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,370
that are on either side of me in this 
are retarded when it man you,

1424
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:18,180
if you really sit back and analyze 
divine styler like speaks in tongues,

1425
01:01:18,181 --> 01:01:18,890
man,
I don't know.

1426
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:19,723
That dude's on some super scientific and
sick Jack is on some street level hood 

1427
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:24,960
shit.

1428
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,270
But the way he puts it together is so 
crazy.

1429
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,440
It's almost like we a representation of 
like almost like physical,

1430
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,473
like a mental and spiritual.
Like mine is more mental like you guys 

1431
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:37,463
like see no evil,
hear no malls cobbled together and when 

1432
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:44,340
we get together the shoot,
all three of us will tell you it's,

1433
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,850
it's the energy that we create with each
other.

1434
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:49,920
Yeah.
We don't find it anywhere else.

1435
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:50,521
We,
we've,

1436
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:51,990
we're,
we're addicted to this right now.

1437
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,520
That's why I'm telling you it's going to
be way more.

1438
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:57,060
We're really working on the next one.
So I think that can't be overlooked man.

1439
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:57,894
Because I think that there's a,
you get a lot of the people that you're 

1440
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:01,194
around all the time and I think you're a
different person when you're around 

1441
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:04,980
different people.
Absolutely.

1442
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:06,390
Sure.
I'm sure you experienced that,

1443
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:07,410
right?
Absolutely.

1444
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:12,120
And I think that being around a bunch of
bad motherfuckers on a regular basis,

1445
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:12,954
like you are in war porn,
like everything is probably like 

1446
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:16,410
everybody sharpened.
Everybody's not,

1447
01:02:16,411 --> 01:02:19,020
everybody is also aware of the full body
of work.

1448
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,010
All real hip hop

1449
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,780
fans.
So you aware of like nozzles,

1450
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:26,781
Best Shit and Jay z's best shit in the 
bar gets so high and so sharp,

1451
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:30,630
the edge gets sharp.
So like that riff right there,

1452
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:33,210
that's,
that's like one of my all time favorites

1453
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,680
that I've heard in the last couple of 
years.

1454
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:35,130
Right.

1455
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,580
That's great.
You should feel like,

1456
01:02:36,581 --> 01:02:37,680
like in,
in my opinion,

1457
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,150
you know,
and I come from a certain era,

1458
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,400
I'll give that to people.
You know,

1459
01:02:40,401 --> 01:02:43,550
there's a new era of kids and I don't 
shit on them or hate them.

1460
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:44,384
They have this whole thing hating on 
these kids call it mumble rap and I 

1461
01:02:47,511 --> 01:02:49,130
don't,
I don't really got a problem with it.

1462
01:02:49,131 --> 01:02:51,230
You know what I mean?
My only problem was is like,

1463
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:52,064
Hey,
there are certain cats that are kind of 

1464
01:02:53,211 --> 01:02:55,820
disrespecting the past and it's like,
hey,

1465
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:57,200
be you,
be new,

1466
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,520
be different.
That's cool.

1467
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:00,830
Be What you want to be,
but don't fucking shit on cats.

1468
01:03:00,831 --> 01:03:01,664
Like biggie.
And I'm not even gonna call out names 

1469
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,850
and all was right,
but anybody who's listening to me and is

1470
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:08,060
really hip to the game knows there's 
these youngsters that are kind of almost

1471
01:03:08,061 --> 01:03:08,894
trying to,
they're almost trying to make noise by 

1472
01:03:10,311 --> 01:03:12,200
disrespecting and it's like,
listen,

1473
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,243
the path that was walked before you is 
the only reason you could fucking wear 

1474
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:18,140
that fucking cheesy fucking shit 
jewelry.

1475
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,920
You get and fucking act so ignorant.
You know what I mean?

1476
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:23,840
And go to the met ball and gallon on is 
when you ain't nobody,

1477
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,800
and next year you're not going to be 
anybody at the met,

1478
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:27,410
the met gala.
You know what I mean?

1479
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:30,850
You're just,
this year's fucking like not a novelty.

1480
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,873
I don't know.
Your Business does the music game in 

1481
01:03:34,371 --> 01:03:37,490
general,
the older dudes had been around.

1482
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,320
There's a lot of youngsters that are 
like,

1483
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,860
don't know the history and I don't say 
you need to know biggie's every album,

1484
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,900
but don't fucking come on shit.
You can't show,

1485
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:47,420
come on shit on POC,
but it come out and act like they didn't

1486
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:49,130
exist or you don't know anything about 
them.

1487
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,730
That's unfortunate.
And when they're few and far between,

1488
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,800
but they've made big headlines and 
that's why this,

1489
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:58,430
there seems to be this disrespectful 
hate for the young,

1490
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,260
right.
I don't got that because listen,

1491
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:01,183
I always said like I just don't ever 
want to sound like that old fucking 

1492
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:07,130
bitter dude.
I'll tell you I don't like that.

1493
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:11,240
I'm not a fan of that song or that guy,
but get go do what you,

1494
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:13,310
I might be old,
maybe I don't get what you're doing.

1495
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,190
You know what I mean?

1496
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,023
As I've gotten older I give less of a 
fuck about what other people enjoy and 

1497
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:19,234
when I was younger I had to,
for some reason I felt like I had to 

1498
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,104
argue with I enjoy versus what you enjoy
and that doesn't make any sense to me 

1499
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:27,364
anymore.
It's like we're all so fucking 

1500
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:29,944
different.
The idea like you meet people and 

1501
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:33,170
personalities vary so much.
They,

1502
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,013
in other words,
I'm going to like to see that shit 

1503
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,560
crazy.
Qualify

1504
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,393
what I was just talking about actually,
cause really what I was talking about 

1505
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,400
wasn't young people.
If you want to be,

1506
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:40,234
if I want to be perfectly clear,
what I was talking about was people my 

1507
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:47,161
age that I hear throwing a lot of hate 
and a lot of just like just like,

1508
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,480
oh that ain't rap or that ain't hip hop 
rain.

1509
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,453
Maybe not to you,
but you really just sound old and 

1510
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,210
bitter.
You know what I mean?

1511
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,860
Let them kids get there.
You know what I mean?

1512
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:57,843
I made the record I wanted to make,
I didn't try to make a record that 

1513
01:05:00,491 --> 01:05:01,324
designer or future or any of these cats 
that are doing it now would make cause 

1514
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,810
that would look stupid.
I would look like a thirsty idiot.

1515
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,730
Right.
Cause that's not what I do.

1516
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:10,983
That is what they to to sort shit on.
It is shitting on them and I don't know 

1517
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:15,701
them.
I don't know anything.

1518
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:16,534
And honestly I've heard future and I've 
heard designer records and they're not 

1519
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:20,950
the worst things I've ever heard.
I'm just not a fan.

1520
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,080
I've just don't,
that's not my thing.

1521
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:27,070
It's not garbage.
And I don't like when I hear people just

1522
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,320
calling shit out for garbage that isn't 
garbage.

1523
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,880
If it's garbage,
called it garbage,

1524
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:32,650
like Mr Brainwash or something like 
that,

1525
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:34,480
that's garbage.
You know what I mean?

1526
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,980
You don't even know who I'm talking to.
You and I talked,

1527
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:40,870
I don't know any of these people,
but I do know what you're talking about.

1528
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,153
You know?
Here's what beautifying crochet that 

1529
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:43,960
was,
that was,

1530
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,100
that was,
that wasn't even cool,

1531
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:47,140
but it's not at all.
I don't,

1532
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,063
I will tell you,
I don't know what the fuck's going on 

1533
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,710
the rap world,
but what I do now,

1534
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,800
not to even talking about rap,
he knows,

1535
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,330
you know?
Tell me what you're talking about.

1536
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,820
It's an artist.
You just answer like fake fucking street

1537
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,280
artists like stole everything he ever 
did was anybody.

1538
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,780
You see the banks,
the banks,

1539
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:05,550
he won't be the guy that fucking like 
faked it till he made it like this.

1540
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,000
That's who I'm talking about.
Okay.

1541
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,010
He's garbage dude.
Like that's garbage.

1542
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,710
That's garbage.
You got to be right to be offended.

1543
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:13,780
Is there somebody,
you know what for you,

1544
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,230
it's the equivalent of like Carlos 
Mitzia.

1545
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,400
Yes.
Mr Brainwash.

1546
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:19,510
Okay.
Okay.

1547
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,060
Exact.
That's a perfectly legitimate,

1548
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:23,790
yeah.

1549
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,470
Correlation.
Is that the right word?

1550
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,570
Correlation.
Correlation.

1551
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:28,423
Yeah.
Thank you.

1552
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:30,630
I said coalition.
I know what you're saying.

1553
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,160
I know,
I know what you're saying.

1554
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:32,751
I'm talking,
well,

1555
01:06:32,751 --> 01:06:37,050
how many two glasses deep into whiskey.
Jack Daniels.

1556
01:06:37,051 --> 01:06:39,060
Single Barrel Rye,
the real shit.

1557
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,530
You owe me a case now.
Jack Daniels,

1558
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:41,880
Lynchburg,
Tennessee,

1559
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:43,470
send that shit to the crib.
All right.

1560
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,430
This is where we got this man.
Y'All can't drink it there.

1561
01:06:47,431 --> 01:06:49,110
I see the commercial.
Y'All can't drink it.

1562
01:06:49,111 --> 01:06:52,320
They're sending an extra case this way 
to the Joe Rogan experience.

1563
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,453
Isn't it amazing that we were like 
interested in stuff that like sits in 

1564
01:06:56,101 --> 01:06:58,400
barrels that have been fire brewed.
Like they,

1565
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,900
they take fire,
they burn the inside of the barrels.

1566
01:07:00,901 --> 01:07:01,734
Right?
Isn't that like part of the process of 

1567
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:03,354
making this stuff?
A lot of the new shit too is the darker 

1568
01:07:04,861 --> 01:07:06,750
versions is like,
some people will use the,

1569
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,333
actually get the,
the whiskey that's soaked into the wood 

1570
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:11,520
and somehow get that out.

1571
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,680
And that's where you get these dark 
versions of like,

1572
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:17,260
um,
what Jameson caskmates and uh,

1573
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,310
other stuff like that.
And then there's a new,

1574
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,050
there's a new movement or I don't know 
how new it is.

1575
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:24,870
I'm talking out of my ass a little bit 
because I've had a few,

1576
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:25,913
but the where they like by old aol like 
Guinness or like beer once and then put 

1577
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,970
whiskey and no reason like yeah,
there's like con like where they kind of

1578
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:35,130
cross chases.
They're crazy.

1579
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:38,280
These kids today.
I just love the fact that that's how you

1580
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:39,900
make this.
Like I'm not,

1581
01:07:39,901 --> 01:07:42,240
I'm not selling this,
but like when you talk about like,

1582
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:46,110
like a whiskey taste.
I'm a James Guy but this is nice.

1583
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,310
This is nice.
Look,

1584
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,630
it's an acquired experience.
Sick Jack Gentleman,

1585
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:53,310
Jack Guy.
He loves the gentleman Jack.

1586
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:54,144
So I'm,
I'm,

1587
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,330
I'm,
I'm hit Koolaid.

1588
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:00,390
Tastes good.
This is an exotic mouth experience.

1589
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,580
Okay.
It's like a,

1590
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:04,020
there's something going on.
Have you gone to a tasting like a scotch

1591
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:04,854
tasting or something like that?
Because I'm a grown man who has other 

1592
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:09,950
things to do.
Go to Scott stays take to fuck out here.

1593
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,020
It all tastes like fucking Turpentine.

1594
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:18,890
Like some of it tastes.
Okay.

1595
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:20,810
Ms. Dot.
Koolaid right.

1596
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,970
It's not,
gatorade are only like a couple.

1597
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,073
There's a lot of them I don't like,
I don't like to admit it but I like our 

1598
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:31,150
cold coke one.
I no one of those coke zero that what it

1599
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,993
is.

1600
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,860
I call it coke one.
I know it's but sometimes that

1601
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,150
is what I want.
That tastes good.

1602
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:43,080
If that could get you drunk.
Oh here's a funny story.

1603
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,423
So my wife gives me a present the other 
day and it's like this key chain with 

1604
01:08:47,521 --> 01:08:48,354
this elongated like metal tube looking 
thing on it and I open it up and it's 

1605
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,780
just empty and she's like,
ah.

1606
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:54,630
I just thought,
you know,

1607
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,464
if you smoked a joint you could put it 
in there and it wouldn't stink up your 

1608
01:08:57,451 --> 01:08:58,650
car.
And it was a smart idea.

1609
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,630
Trust me.
But I'm looking at it and I'm looking at

1610
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:02,460
it and I'm like,
Babe,

1611
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:05,490
um,
I think this is a coke file actually.

1612
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:07,290
I think that's really the intention for 
this.

1613
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,401
She was like,
you know,

1614
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:10,500
it's funny cause there were smaller ones
too.

1615
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,650
I thought that's really small.
I wonder what that could be for now.

1616
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:16,110
It totally makes sense.
So I got this bullet looking thing.

1617
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,830
I put joints in it,
but it's like it's a coke vile dude.

1618
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,123
You imagine what would have happened if 
they made coke legal like a long time 

1619
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:25,980
ago?
Like how am I,

1620
01:09:25,981 --> 01:09:26,814
how much would,
how much would culture change of coke 

1621
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:29,994
was like beer

1622
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,630
just,
I mean he could drink yourself to death.

1623
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:36,910
We all know someone who's drank 
themselves to death.

1624
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:38,643
I think our obesity problem would 
probably be John to be the weight I 

1625
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:47,260
wanted to be,
you know,

1626
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:49,980
I might be closer to the weight.
I really truly want to be,

1627
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:50,814
you know,
I have a theory and my theory is that 

1628
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,083
much like how we,
you take sugar out of things and then 

1629
01:09:58,871 --> 01:10:00,580
just have like processed sugar and you 
eat.

1630
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,500
It's terrible for your body because it's
not as numb.

1631
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:05,200
All the natural fibers,
it's very dangerous.

1632
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,210
Like you,
like you get fat.

1633
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,210
It's not dangerous.
I'm not saying it's like nuclear power,

1634
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:14,950
but my theory is that I bet those coca 
leaves are exactly the same way.

1635
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,993
I bet if you just chew those coca leaves
like those people do up in the 

1636
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:19,690
mountains,
I think it's great for you.

1637
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:22,720
I think it's just like eating fruit is 
really good for you right now.

1638
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:24,940
Like if you have a bowl of fresh 
blueberries,

1639
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,880
that's not just because it had some 
sugar in it that's really good for you.

1640
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:30,070
Rich and antioxidants,
rich in vitamins,

1641
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,870
strawberries.
Delicious.

1642
01:10:31,871 --> 01:10:33,310
Good for you.
Not Bad for you,

1643
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:36,520
good for you.
But like spoons or sugar in arguably not

1644
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:37,390
good for you.
Right?

1645
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:41,290
I mean not the worst though.
What you're talking about right there is

1646
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,570
something process versus something 
that's natural.

1647
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,460
Yeah,
it's exactly the same thing.

1648
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,570
You know what?
I would actually,

1649
01:10:46,571 --> 01:10:49,120
if I with all my heart issues,
I got a heart valve.

1650
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:52,150
If you sat two plates on and have played
a coke and you said you had to do one of

1651
01:10:52,151 --> 01:10:53,590
these and here's some cocoa leaves,
I'd be like Oh fuck,

1652
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:54,424
I'll chew those.
Cocoa leaves all one and I want to 

1653
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:56,314
experience that man.
I want to know what that's like because 

1654
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:58,923
they,
things I'm writing about are like pets 

1655
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:02,230
that work in those,
cause that's mountainous area.

1656
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,450
They liked chewing them all day and work
and do shit.

1657
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,460
It's just like coffee to them in a weird
way,

1658
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:07,300
you know?
Maybe a little,

1659
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,163
you know,
I don't think it's stronger than coffee 

1660
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:11,080
man.
I don't think it is.

1661
01:11:11,081 --> 01:11:14,070
I think from everybody that describes 
the describe it as

1662
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,240
like just a mild stimulant and it makes 
you feel good and it also has like,

1663
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:21,000
what did they call flavell chewing on 
it.

1664
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,280
It's getting yourself so Lima is 
dissolving.

1665
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:24,114
You're processing it through a digestive
system instead of just banging it 

1666
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:28,890
straight to your brain in a power of 
powder form.

1667
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:30,360
You know what I mean?
I think it's Prob,

1668
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,610
I mean obviously I'm speaking way out of
line here.

1669
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,450
I don't know anything about [inaudible].
Does it take to make a line?

1670
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,520
That's another thing you don't know.
It might be 400 coca leaves.

1671
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,550
Like how many strawberries does it take 
to make a good tablespoon of sugar?

1672
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:46,500
Exactly.
That's a good,

1673
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,630
that's a good analogy.
Interesting.

1674
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,180
There's whiskeys.
Really Nice.

1675
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,014
So feeling good.
God Damn this California marijuana is 

1676
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:55,590
also very effective.
Yeah.

1677
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:56,910
Can't complain.
Can't complain.

1678
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,710
But we sparked up again.
There's,

1679
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,550
there's a whole thing right there of,
of this whole new ae.

1680
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:05,130
I've smoked my share fair share of some 
dabs and whatnot here,

1681
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,120
but like now we're talking about let's,
if we're going to keep it 100% honest,

1682
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,080
we've always kind of sat around and 
smoked joints and be like,

1683
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:14,790
hey,
we don't really do drugs.

1684
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:18,270
You know what Dabs of you do dabs.
You do drugs.

1685
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:22,240
That's a drug that's weed being 
processed into an actual work,

1686
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:27,650
potent,
more compact form form to smoke.

1687
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,540
It's drugs.
It's the math of weed dabs,

1688
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,430
like phrase tattoos.
They're like,

1689
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,650
you went too far fucker,
which is slow down.

1690
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,150
Settle down.
Okay.

1691
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,670
Don't,
don't turn your nose.

1692
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,123
Nose had my fair share of DABS and I 
would partake under the right 

1693
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:44,250
circumstances.
Boom Bap.

1694
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,290
I'll have a little dab,
but what I'm saying is I,

1695
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:49,710
it's too much good movie here.
I'm okay.

1696
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:50,880
I'm fine.
Pens though.

1697
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,930
You're smoking pens though as dabs.
I actually don't smoke.

1698
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,610
Uh,
too many different ones,

1699
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:59,850
but I have some that organic,
it's still adapt.

1700
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,631
No,
it's an oil.

1701
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:02,100
It's oil.
Same fucking team.

1702
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,513
Same as her smoking wax.
And he has seen different people who 

1703
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:10,580
were interested in soldering irons and 
fucking verily I'm more into,

1704
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,970
I'm not personally a little bit more 
into what they call the solventless like

1705
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,230
ice hash and shit like that.
Like a little bit different.

1706
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,270
I mean,
Bho scares me a little bit.

1707
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:19,104
Sometimes I'll just like a thing as a 
trigger that hits me when someone says 

1708
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,980
you want to do dabs?
Like oh no,

1709
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,391
no,
no,

1710
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:24,721
no,
no.

1711
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:26,400
Cause you're one of those people that 
does dabs.

1712
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,630
Like I'm not,
I'm not doing no,

1713
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,051
no,
no,

1714
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:30,441
no,
no,

1715
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:30,960
no,
no.

1716
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,793
You're the dude who calls in sick to the
country club because you're too fucking 

1717
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:35,880
high to drive,
right?

1718
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:36,840
No,
no.

1719
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:38,220
We're not doing dabs together man.

1720
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,670
Get your shit together.
You don't have to get that high.

1721
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:42,990
Come by the studio there Joe.
Cause you're doing the DAB.

1722
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:45,460
Now if they come by my studio,
it's like I'm going make you do at least

1723
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:47,303
glasses of wine or do you do want to 
drink glasses of whiskey where you can 

1724
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:54,480
drink glasses of wine and enjoy it?
If you drink glasses of whiskey,

1725
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:56,430
you'll be fucking dead.
Okay.

1726
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:01,740
That's like dabs.
You went too far into the dark land son.

1727
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,370
You met the shy,
you know how much weed you smoked,

1728
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,300
the orks you're,
you're wrong about that.

1729
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,190
Some people,
you're right about it.

1730
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:09,024
You're right about it.
Like the average Joe cat like that 

1731
01:14:10,681 --> 01:14:13,860
doesn't know much.
What if you know how much we use smoke?

1732
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,063
I don't get that fucked up from a dad 
because you know I have smoked a lot of 

1733
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,050
weed for 20 fucking years.
You know what I mean?

1734
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,513
But what it will do if you smoke,
what I don't want to do about that shit 

1735
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:27,640
from what I understand is why I don't do
a ton of it is because it'll,

1736
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:31,950
you'll stop getting high from actual 
weed if you do too much of that be,

1737
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:35,080
that'd be good.
If that's what the best way to be is get

1738
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,263
high.
So often that you can be high and not 

1739
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:42,790
even feel like your high,
like maybe that's the best place to be.

1740
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,070
Hi though.
I want to know that I'm Ha.

1741
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,440
No,
no.

1742
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,360
It's like letting go.
I don't want to like get,

1743
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,640
well now you're talking about being a 
junkie.

1744
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,300
You're talking about and not know you're
high,

1745
01:14:56,301 --> 01:14:58,220
but be high.
That's called getting well,

1746
01:14:58,221 --> 01:15:03,221
you're sick plant man.
I smoke taxes,

1747
01:15:06,771 --> 01:15:07,604
man.

1748
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:10,450
There's no point to me smoking if I'm 
not getting a buzz.

1749
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,590
What I'm saying man,
I'm,

1750
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:16,591
what I'm saying is achieve a perpetual 
vibration of uh,

1751
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:17,743
let's call called elevation.
Let's could not call it being high to 

1752
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,693
achieve a perpetual state where it's so 
common and normal that you don't even 

1753
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:28,420
feel like you're high.
How do we live?

1754
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,760
Isn't that how we live?
Pretty close.

1755
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:31,860
Pretty far.
Pretty close.

1756
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:33,430
I take days off though.
Do you take days?

1757
01:15:33,431 --> 01:15:34,264
Absolutely.
Honestly more than I like since in the 

1758
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:38,164
last seven years,
way more than it used to because of my 

1759
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:42,190
kids.
I want to give away before my kids,

1760
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,220
I was perpetually high.
I was high from the morning.

1761
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,083
I woke up to the moment I went to sleep 
and I don't even look at that as a bad 

1762
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:51,180
thing or like I like smoked weed.
Yeah,

1763
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,690
I was perpetually high.

1764
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:53,583
I know a lot of people that are very 
productive and very smart who also do 

1765
01:15:56,141 --> 01:15:58,600
that now and they enjoy it more.
The wife and I,

1766
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:02,050
at the end of a long day,
we'll go out in the backyard and because

1767
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:04,530
we don't smoke anywhere near the kids 
cause of cystic fibrosis and other,

1768
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,760
but like we will just like that.
And you know what?

1769
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:08,950
Fuck anyone who doesn't like it,
Ma,

1770
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,890
I know that are alcoholics and shit.
You know what I mean?

1771
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:12,783
It's illegal now.
He's decompressed from a day of doing 

1772
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:18,350
fucking nebulizer treatments and fucking
give a shit.

1773
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:21,880
Yo.
It works for us and it's cool.

1774
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,210
But if I wasn't getting as in smoking or
to get even,

1775
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,240
I wouldn't even do it anymore.
Like if I didn't get a buzz,

1776
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:29,650
you know what I mean?
It's a happy thing.

1777
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:32,440
I'm not saying get even,
I'm saying state elevators,

1778
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:35,380
but no,
you're elevated the entire time.

1779
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:36,403
No,
just like you know you're breathing in 

1780
01:16:37,211 --> 01:16:38,044
oxygen,
but do you pay attention to it on a 

1781
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:42,310
regular basis?
Well then just like knowing I liked it,

1782
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,160
I liked the conscious actual like,
oh,

1783
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,380
I'm in a relieve state of pain right 
now.

1784
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,363
Listen,
you're right.

1785
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,840
I'm just,
I'm a essentially army cookies man.

1786
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:53,674
I'm not looking for cookies or anything,
but maybe it's because I live in a 

1787
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:58,990
slightly elevated level of stress than 
the average person.

1788
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,640
By appreciate it.
Know the difference.

1789
01:17:00,641 --> 01:17:03,540
I want to feel that cushion.
It's like the pillow on the bed for me.

1790
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:06,790
I want to feel the pillow.
I don't want to just accept it's there.

1791
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:07,624
I don't want to go Buddhists like that 
and washing the dishes just to wash 

1792
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:09,630
dishes.
Right?

1793
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:10,040
I want to get

1794
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,680
high to get the fuck Outta here for 
fucking five minutes.

1795
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,543
You know what?
I find that it's one of the most 

1796
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:15,860
beneficial things about being high as 
it.

1797
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:16,694
I've only thinking about a few things,
but I'm thinking about them very 

1798
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,900
intensely,
simply and very intently.

1799
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:25,280
Instead of thinking about a whole host 
of things peripherally where it's almost

1800
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:27,770
like there's too much data coming in 
from all these other things that I don't

1801
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:30,230
really care about or need.
Look,

1802
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:31,423
you care about all sorts of things in 
your life that you're not going to deal 

1803
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:34,454
with right now and take to harbor.
Even a chunk of that in your 

1804
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:38,534
consciousness is it robs the rest of 
your resources for thinking about other 

1805
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:43,784
things.
And that's one of the most apparent 

1806
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:47,870
things about pot to me because like when
I,

1807
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,860
here's a perfect example,
when I smoked pot and then I play pool,

1808
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:55,820
I am 20% better,
like a legitimate 20% better.

1809
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:00,290
And I really think that it's because I'm
not thinking about,

1810
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:04,010
oh I gotta do this and then I got to 
call that guy and then this guy,

1811
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:06,980
I got to respond as to his text.
I got to respond to that person's email.

1812
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,830
When I get high,
I just see balls,

1813
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,903
I see balls and green cloth.
And either one step further is you're 

1814
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,104
also not even thinking about it.
I got to beat this fucking guy you're 

1815
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:19,010
thinking about and I want to make sure 
Shannon douchebag.

1816
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:19,341
No,
no,

1817
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:21,980
but you want to make the shot.
It's more about the shot though.

1818
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:22,814
Like I want to make it a shot.
I want to fucking win this game cause I 

1819
01:18:24,321 --> 01:18:26,630
want to make the shot.
I want to do you see the angle?

1820
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:27,643
There's a zen to it for sure.
There's a thing that happens with pool 

1821
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:34,250
that happens the same way in archery and
then in archery,

1822
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:37,820
like when you hit a target there's an,
it's so foolish.

1823
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:38,653
Like of course it's just a a hay bale 
with a target on it with a little paper 

1824
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:46,010
target that has a yellow center and you 
hit the yellow center.

1825
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,960
Whoop de do nothing changed in the 
world.

1826
01:18:47,961 --> 01:18:51,520
I understand that like rationally as my 
Dick was say hard.

1827
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:52,550
If I do that though,
I'd be like,

1828
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:57,320
oh,
but the thing about doing that is that I

1829
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:00,860
don't know why,
but when you do something correctly,

1830
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:04,400
when it all flows in harmony,
just like with pool,

1831
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:07,430
it's the same thing when you have a long
shot and it goes in.

1832
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,490
If you've ever been at a bar,
when you watch people play pool and some

1833
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:11,324
dude makes or some woman makes the 
craziest shot ever for the win and 

1834
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:16,520
everybody goes crazy.
Oh Shit.

1835
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,563
Because we know how hard it is to do and
there's something poetic and beautiful 

1836
01:19:21,351 --> 01:19:22,490
about watching it happen.

1837
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,540
It's the that you just described.
Why Gulf makes any sense at all?

1838
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:27,853
I live on a golf course basically.
I like to hit the balls and fucking I 

1839
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:34,880
suck.
But what keeps you coming back is you'll

1840
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:39,881
play that 18 whole day and one time.
Do you feel you'll hit the shot that you

1841
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:45,200
meant to hit the way you meant to hit it
and it went where you're meant to go and

1842
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:48,140
you're like I can do that again.
I know I can too.

1843
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,120
I don't play Golf Jason.
It's like crack.

1844
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:52,460
You're chasing that first fucking high 
forever.

1845
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,353
I'm not disrespecting anybody who plays 
golf cause I know I would get addicted 

1846
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,010
but I don't play golf because I know I'd
get it.

1847
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:01,670
Because you would,
your whole personal it would cause you'd

1848
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:04,490
hit that one shot the first day and 
you'd be like,

1849
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,530
Oh shit,
same reason I don't coke.

1850
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,693
Yeah.
It's the same reason I've never done 

1851
01:20:09,901 --> 01:20:11,190
coke.
The exact same reason.

1852
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,260
My friend in high school,
Jimmy Lawless,

1853
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,960
good buddy of mine to this day when we 
were back in high school,

1854
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:18,960
we went to a party and uh,
people were doing coke and he goes,

1855
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:19,950
Joe,
don't do it.

1856
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,120
You'd fucking love it.
It's like Dewey Cox for movie was like,

1857
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,440
you don't want this.

1858
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,940
I trust your buddy.
I go,

1859
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:32,520
I'm fucking done here.
I'm done with this.

1860
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:33,570
And I've told him,
I've said this before,

1861
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:34,404
but this is a real thing that happened 
where it was on two lane road and we 

1862
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:39,750
were driving side this car that had the 
dome light on.

1863
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,170
And I looked over and there was this 
chick and I'll never forget her arms.

1864
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:46,350
She had these big arms like shit,
like almost like,

1865
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,243
like,
like she had a sleeveless shirt with 

1866
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:49,164
like thick arms.
Like it was kind of girl that would 

1867
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:52,560
punch him in the face.
Okay.

1868
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:53,543
And she was doing coke in the back seat 
and she looked over at me with the Dome 

1869
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:58,470
light on and she just goes,
fuck you.

1870
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:01,740
She just says it to me like I'm just 
looking at her.

1871
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,050
I'm just looking at her.
You're doing coke,

1872
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,970
you're on the,
you're on a two lane road.

1873
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:08,220
There's the only two cars in the road.
I'm watching you do coke.

1874
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:11,820
I'm seven feet away from you doing coke 
and you're saying fuck you.

1875
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,760
Like whoa,
fuck coke.

1876
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,900
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah.

1877
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,153
We used to call it a,
I had a few experiences with coke in my 

1878
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:19,740
life,
but here,

1879
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,680
here's the breakdown of cocaine and why 
it's evil.

1880
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,083
We used to call it amongst a few people 
that I actually trusted enough to 

1881
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,900
partake of it in my life.
We called it the sneaky pouch.

1882
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:31,973
Sneaky.
Because what would happen is like you 

1883
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:35,070
get some coke and it'd be like in a 
fold,

1884
01:21:35,071 --> 01:21:36,450
you know,
like a paper fold.

1885
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:38,520
Everybody would put in for some coke and
every,

1886
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:40,830
you'd go somewhere and every once in a 
while,

1887
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:41,370
you know,
be,

1888
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,200
Hey,
let me get past some,

1889
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,840
go to the bathroom real quick and 
whatever.

1890
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:45,743
Right,
right.

1891
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,690
When you went to that bathroom,
the nature of coke,

1892
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:50,933
you would take a little piece of that 
off of yourself and put it in your own 

1893
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:54,380
little dollar bill.
Yes,

1894
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:55,810
you're sneaky Boucher.
Sneaky,

1895
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,890
sneaky pouch.
But what it says about,

1896
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,010
and everybody did it,
the whole crew,

1897
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,350
like nobody made cop to it and nobody 
fucking,

1898
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:05,184
it got analogy.
But it's like we all know we took a 

1899
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:08,400
little piece for ourself.
You know what I mean?

1900
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:11,130
Off of the cook file and whatever,
whatever sneaky pouch.

1901
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:11,561
It's,
it's,

1902
01:22:11,561 --> 01:22:12,394
it's,
it's,

1903
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:14,400
it's a deceitful,
are you writing this?

1904
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,213
Uh,

1905
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:23,210
so it's like kind of just describes the 
nature of what that what mind state that

1906
01:22:23,211 --> 01:22:23,991
puts you in.
It's like,

1907
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:25,820
well fuck everybody else.
If this goes,

1908
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:27,650
if everybody's sniffs,
who's sniffing,

1909
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:28,580
you know,
it's just like,

1910
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,830
that's what that drug creates.
And that's why,

1911
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:31,723
you know,
the,

1912
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,800
I think three times in my life I've done
it

1913
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,173
well.
Any drug that radically changes your 

1914
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:37,304
brain chemistry,
whether it's whiskey or whether it's 

1915
01:22:39,771 --> 01:22:41,000
coke or eat,
you know,

1916
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:43,580
honestly even pot,
especially pertaining to edibles,

1917
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:46,520
we should watch it very carefully.
What happens when people take it,

1918
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,653
you know?
And I think that's one of the things 

1919
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:48,884
that I've been guilty of and I know a 
lot of other people have been guilty of 

1920
01:22:50,661 --> 01:22:52,250
it too,
just to totally come clean.

1921
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,383
I defend pot so much that I never look 
at the potential negative consequences 

1922
01:22:57,441 --> 01:23:00,380
of people doing pot if they're too young
because I didn't do it when I was down.

1923
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,350
I mean did a few times,
maybe like a handful of times before was

1924
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:08,650
30 and then when I was 30 I met Eddie 
Bravo.

1925
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,950
We started getting blazed all the time 
and it just changed the entire west.

1926
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,950
Second Pot.
I smoked pot was 14 I'd,

1927
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,860
well I definitely smoked it younger than
that.

1928
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,693
I smoked when I was eight.
My stepdad gave me someone I was eight 

1929
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:25,420
just to a puff cause I was curious.
I was like,

1930
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:26,770
what,
what and what happens when you do it?

1931
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:27,730
He goes,
do you want to try it?

1932
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,830
I said,
how much should I breathe in?

1933
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,540
He goes on breathing in a lot,
just breathing a little bit.

1934
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,553
This is obviously like sketchy memory.
I did it once when I was eight and then 

1935
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:39,780
the next time I did it I was probably 
like 14 and then I did it probably maybe

1936
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:40,730
again when I was sending him

1937
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:44,840
teen when we cut school and some of the 
kids,

1938
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:48,230
a couple of kids that were the cool guys
that I kind of took a liking to me and I

1939
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:48,850
was like,
cool,

1940
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:49,683
like coke is like me.
I'm going to go hang out with these 

1941
01:23:50,931 --> 01:23:51,764
dudes.
They smoke weed and I remembered I hit 

1942
01:23:53,391 --> 01:23:55,410
it and very,
and they were telling me like,

1943
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,170
have you ever smoked weed or no,
I never spoke with her.

1944
01:23:57,171 --> 01:23:58,004
I'm,
nothing might happen to you the first 

1945
01:23:58,371 --> 01:23:59,204
time.
But I remember vividly hitting this 

1946
01:24:01,611 --> 01:24:05,840
joint with these dudes and literally 
spending probably an hour and 30 minutes

1947
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,150
laughing my balls off that.
Nothing.

1948
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,480
And I thought it was the greatest thing 
ever.

1949
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,220
And from then on I was like,
I quit baseball.

1950
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,750
No,
it popcorn became an artist.

1951
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:21,260
Well I started drawing and painting on 
walls.

1952
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:22,940
I was like,
I was a different person.

1953
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:23,774
That changed my life.
We eat is another thing that's probably 

1954
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:26,384
semi responses.

1955
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:27,243
Well from my path I had a very important
moment when I was 16 like I only smoked 

1956
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:33,910
weed a handful of times before I was 30 
years old,

1957
01:24:33,911 --> 01:24:34,744
like less than 12 like legitimately and 
a one time when I was 16 it was me and 

1958
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:43,930
my girlfriend and my best friend who 
went over her house and uh,

1959
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,793
I had stole some weed for my Stepdad and
we'd rolled up a joint and we got so 

1960
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:52,144
high we were teleporting.
We would like find ourselves in the 

1961
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:57,000
kitchen,
astro bleeding type show.

1962
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:57,834
I'll be staring at each other on the 
couch and then all of a sudden we'd be 

1963
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:01,930
in the backyard.
We were barbecued.

1964
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,913
We were were fucking 16 I think my 
girlfriend at the time was 15 had josh 

1965
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:08,350
was my age,
he was,

1966
01:25:08,351 --> 01:25:13,030
he was 16 and we were just time 
traveling all over the fucking building.

1967
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:14,830
It was,
we were way too high.

1968
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:16,870
That's how I,
I

1969
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:20,690
described the for the first and only 
time I ever smoked dust.

1970
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:21,913
Oh Jesus.
He did that while I hung out with like 

1971
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:27,240
when I was one of the neighborhoods I 
moved into this.

1972
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,810
Is there a fucking gateway drug to dust 
and tell me what it is.

1973
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:34,350
It's called Solos.
Cholos.

1974
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,620
Did they go right from Diet Pepsi to 
dust?

1975
01:25:36,621 --> 01:25:37,454
I don't know.
Here's my story is I moved onto this 

1976
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,070
street called Independence Avenue in,
in the valley.

1977
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:46,460
It's like West valley kind of Desoto 
Sherman Way Ish.

1978
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:51,890
And it was heavily Latino neighborhood 
and like we moved in and it was cool.

1979
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,930
I mean like I lived here,
I came friends with a lot of people,

1980
01:25:53,931 --> 01:25:55,490
but like,
um,

1981
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:59,390
I went from like the end of elementary 
school into junior high,

1982
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,970
right in that era.
So like once we hit the junior high,

1983
01:26:01,971 --> 01:26:05,060
it's like a lot of the Mexican kids I 
was hanging out with started hanging out

1984
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:05,894
with you a little bit older Mason 
candidate kids and a lot of them were 

1985
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:09,590
dealing in like kind of gang life over 
there.

1986
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:11,240
Um,
uh,

1987
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,020
it's just part of the way they get down 
and so,

1988
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:16,130
and a lot of them like to fucking do 
dips,

1989
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:21,050
which is like a fucking sherm cigarette 
dipped into my fucking angel angel dust.

1990
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:24,980
Sounds like healthy choice dude's out.
It's how I wound up with this,

1991
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:27,650
this little tattoo right here.
The first Tattoo I ever had in my life.

1992
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:30,110
This little three dots normally is 
supposed to be up here,

1993
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:31,820
but I wasn't in a gang.
Oh,

1994
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:32,654
I'm so,
it's like for some reason I was so 

1995
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:35,390
fucked up.
This is what wound up,

1996
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:37,430
I mean this,
this represents what they call them a Mi

1997
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,080
Vida loca.
It's like little three dots here.

1998
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,213
But it's like that happened because I 
smoked dust because these dudes pass me 

1999
01:26:43,341 --> 01:26:45,070
the showroom.
I didn't really know what I was,

2000
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,363
I was like this bang,
and the literally the way you just 

2001
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:49,370
described that time traveling and it was
like,

2002
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:52,130
I felt like if I thought of something to
do,

2003
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,490
by the time I was finished with the 
thought of thinking to do it,

2004
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,510
I had already done it.

2005
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:02,980
I'm going to call my mom because my mom 
was like fucking nuts.

2006
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:07,020
I fucking never experienced anything 
like that.

2007
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,900
I was terrified.
I was terrified,

2008
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,690
terrified.
I didn't know what the fuck is going on.

2009
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:14,190
It was almost like,
you know what I mean?

2010
01:27:14,191 --> 01:27:15,024
It gave me a lot of feelings is if you 
remember the first Friday movie when 

2011
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,530
Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody 
snuck him a little piece of dust,

2012
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:22,700
any fucking line.
It's,

2013
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,710
I didn't lose my mind naked,
all that shit.

2014
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:27,380
But I feel like I was the butt of a joke
that night.

2015
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,940
Like,
like somebody gave me some dust.

2016
01:27:28,941 --> 01:27:29,774
It was like,
let's watch fucking the white boy 

2017
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:31,244
fucking trip on dust on it.
But it made for a good story on Joe 

2018
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:38,950
Rogan.
So now we're either,

2019
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,153
I had an ex boxing coach who had his 
finger bitten off when he was on dust 

2020
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:51,680
and he had his toe removed and a his 
second toe replaced his index finger and

2021
01:27:52,831 --> 01:27:57,490
he made it curled so that he could keep 
throwing right hooks because he did.

2022
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,790
So when you'd shake his hand,
you'd shake his hand.

2023
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,950
He would get like,
yeah,

2024
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:04,793
you get a tow boat.
So when you shake his hand and get a 

2025
01:28:06,601 --> 01:28:09,960
little of this,
and he's a big Ole Irish gorilla,

2026
01:28:09,961 --> 01:28:12,270
you don't want to say shit cause you'll 
beat the fucking,

2027
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:18,840
the dude as a toe or next figures can be
written into a movie that is a savage.

2028
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:23,670
That's like something at a snatch.
I knew a lot of savages when I worked in

2029
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:25,770
Boston,
when I worked in South Boston,

2030
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:28,920
I worked at this place called the Boston
Athletic Club in South Boston.

2031
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,870
That you did that to my poem.

2032
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:34,170
I hear you man.
Yeah,

2033
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,630
Dude.
I worked at the Boston Athletic Club and

2034
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:38,400
then I worked at,
um,

2035
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,820
Nautilus plus in revere.
I met a lot.

2036
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:43,790
Revere Massachusetts is like,
well,

2037
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:48,360
what's that place in Brooklyn that's 
like all guineas and what does it,

2038
01:28:48,361 --> 01:28:49,280
Bensonhurst and,
right.

2039
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:53,020
Yeah,
that was like the bents and Hersa Boston

2040
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:57,300
was like revere and I uh,
I worked in a gym there,

2041
01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:01,800
so I was around a lot of crazy people.
I was around lot of people that,

2042
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,720
I was around a few people that that got 
indicted for murder.

2043
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,380
Like this one dude,
he didn't get indicted.

2044
01:29:10,381 --> 01:29:11,214
He got arrested.
I don't know if they ever even tried 

2045
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:13,944
them.

2046
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:15,603
Anyway,

2047
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,610
long story short,
I don't say,

2048
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:24,070
I don't know how much I can talk about 
this guy's life.

2049
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,520
Oh,
he was a nice guy,

2050
01:29:27,521 --> 01:29:29,350
but I think you might have fucked a few 
people up.

2051
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,090
Well,
there's nothing weirder to me.

2052
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:37,000
Would not even weird.
I don't know if that's the right word,

2053
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:42,940
but strange and uncomfortable as being 
around.

2054
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,513
And I'm not talking about like ex 
marines are guys who have been in the 

2055
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:48,490
war or anything like that I'm talking 
about,

2056
01:29:48,491 --> 01:29:49,324
but like a civilian person and I've been
around quite a few of these kinds of 

2057
01:29:52,151 --> 01:29:52,984
people,
whether it be biker gang guys or 

2058
01:29:54,461 --> 01:29:55,420
whatever.
To that,

2059
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:56,770
you know?
Yeah.

2060
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,020
You know,
you know have fucking killed,

2061
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,370
you know,
you know that.

2062
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,233
You know what I mean?
And you're not feeling threatened by 

2063
01:30:02,471 --> 01:30:03,304
them.
You don't think they're going to kill 

2064
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:05,230
you.
But like you know it's,

2065
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:06,064
there's a d

2066
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,970
I used to train a guy who was in yt 
bolgers gang.

2067
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,190
He was like,
no.

2068
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,320
He was like,
I don't know if he was a Hitman,

2069
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:15,750
but that was like the room or the room 
one at least.

2070
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:16,584
But he asked me why I was teaching him.
He asked me if I was going to kill 

2071
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:20,640
someone,
what's,

2072
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:24,030
what's the best place to hit him?
And we sat around talking about,

2073
01:30:24,031 --> 01:30:24,864
it were,
me and him were talking about this when 

2074
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:27,120
I was a black bow and he was a white 
belt.

2075
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,250
So it was a,
it was like a valid conversation for him

2076
01:30:29,251 --> 01:30:33,450
to be having with a 20 year old kid.
And that was like the neck.

2077
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:34,560
I got it.
I would,

2078
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,190
I would hit someone in the neck like a,
your next very vulnerable and people get

2079
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:40,290
knocked out very easily if they get hit 
in the neck.

2080
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:42,660
Sometimes even more so than the head.
And he was like,

2081
01:30:42,661 --> 01:30:44,580
yeah.
And we looked at each other.

2082
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:45,414
I'm like,
okay,

2083
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,800
this is what I want you to work on right
now.

2084
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:47,634
We're going to work.

2085
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,340
It's like,
that's funny because I had a cousin when

2086
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:51,990
I was young,
like before,

2087
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:52,824
like any of the house,
probably 1918 I was in California 

2088
01:30:56,221 --> 01:30:59,070
visiting and he was a correctional 
officer,

2089
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,293
oo in upstate New York.
And he said the thing they were taught 

2090
01:31:03,361 --> 01:31:04,194
first is cause all they walk around and 
there's only like maybe 30 guards at a 

2091
01:31:06,931 --> 01:31:11,430
time on duty and what 600 to a thousand 
prisoners.

2092
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,333
Right.
And depending on what the circumstances 

2093
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:15,900
are and all they have is a big metal key
ring.

2094
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,033
And they're taught,
the first thing you fucking do is punch 

2095
01:31:18,231 --> 01:31:19,850
a dude right in his fucking throat.
Yeah.

2096
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,600
If you feel like you're any kind of 
thing.

2097
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:22,434
That's the,
and he told me that like that he was 

2098
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:24,354
like,
if I was going to give you any advice 

2099
01:31:24,721 --> 01:31:27,200
and you felt like you were fucking,
he's like the first thing you do.

2100
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:28,243
And I and he explained it well enough 
that I knew and as even as a young man 

2101
01:31:31,231 --> 01:31:33,120
like you're playing with a person's 
life,

2102
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:35,520
punching them in the fucking Adam's 
apple or something,

2103
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:36,354
you know what I mean?
With a kill them with like full like he 

2104
01:31:37,771 --> 01:31:39,720
was like well what's that?
Well you can just put your fist.

2105
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:40,554
If you hit him rake you would be amazed.
You'd be amazed at how much damage 

2106
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:44,180
people can take.

2107
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,013
I actually,
I'd rather get punched in the Adam's 

2108
01:31:46,071 --> 01:31:46,904
apple.
Then I would get kicked in the side of 

2109
01:31:48,231 --> 01:31:51,800
my head like around here cause this is 
what shuts you off.

2110
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,780
It seems like,
again,

2111
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:56,420
many things can shut you off just with 
the caveat.

2112
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:01,360
Like you can get shut off with a kick,
even like to the top of your chest snaps

2113
01:32:01,361 --> 01:32:02,194
your head back so much and get shut off.
But there's something about neck kicks 

2114
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,840
like Bang Dude,
just go.

2115
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:11,140
They just crumpled and sometimes they 
crumbled from Chin shots.

2116
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,393
But I think it's the same thing.
I think with the Chin shot is doing is 

2117
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:19,000
somehow or another pinching the garden 
hose that is the spine.

2118
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:21,400
And shutting the system off.
It's also,

2119
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:22,690
if I'm not mistaken,
your,

2120
01:32:22,691 --> 01:32:23,524
you know,
your brain sits in that little bit of 

2121
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:26,890
fluid and if you have your scope moves 
fast enough,

2122
01:32:26,891 --> 01:32:29,530
the brain doesn't move as fast and it 
touches the,

2123
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,393
once a short rain touches the skull,
that's lights out that that absolutely 

2124
01:32:33,401 --> 01:32:33,940
too.

2125
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:34,773
Also,
I think the same principle like rear 

2126
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:37,984
naked chokes and um,
head kick knockouts are not the same in 

2127
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:45,070
that a rear naked choke is way safer.
Like if you get choked unconscious,

2128
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:48,100
you're going to be fine.
If you get head kicked unconscious,

2129
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:50,110
Ooh,
you got to take some time off.

2130
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:54,730
Like you could just got fucked up.
But the mechanism behind them is kind of

2131
01:32:54,731 --> 01:32:57,640
similar in that it's cutting off the 
circuitry,

2132
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:01,120
not like specifically cause the choke is
like stopping the blood.

2133
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:02,163
But the head kick is just jolting.
It's like rebooting your computer head 

2134
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:06,760
kick.
I would imagine.

2135
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:09,580
I've never experienced it nor can I 
throw one that high.

2136
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,633
Uh,
but I would imagine why it might be 

2137
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:14,440
worse is because like right,
you can punch and it's the motion of the

2138
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:18,310
head almost.
And the brain not moving that is causing

2139
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:18,760
the knockout.

2140
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,860
If you get kicked like this,
it's a shin.

2141
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:21,723
It's everything.
Your head doesn't even get to move so 

2142
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:23,344
the brain is actually just cause getting
slammed against the other side of the 

2143
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:28,300
fucking skull.
I've made this point really recently and

2144
01:33:28,301 --> 01:33:31,390
even yesterday I think people should 
have no gloves on when they fight.

2145
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:34,780
I think fighting with gloves is like,
it makes it easier to punch people,

2146
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:35,614
which is more an more unrealistic and 
getting kicked in the head is way worse 

2147
01:33:39,161 --> 01:33:42,370
than getting punched in the head wound.
That argument for Olympic head gear.

2148
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,233
That's why it's going away.
It causes more problems than it's 

2149
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:46,234
actually worth it at this point.
I also think it's unrealistic in terms 

2150
01:33:48,311 --> 01:33:49,144
of like the limitations of your body,
like there's limitations of your body 

2151
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:52,444
with punching people and that's the your
risks bend like anybody's ever punched 

2152
01:33:55,691 --> 01:33:59,620
someone or condone tape or just no bra,
no bra.

2153
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:00,550
I that's,
yeah,

2154
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:01,973
it was taped is really what the problem 
is that when you take this risk like so 

2155
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:07,210
well that I can't really fuck it up.
I'm going to,

2156
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:10,660
I'm going to throw it with abandoned.
Well also it's like no abandon you.

2157
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:11,440
Right.
If you can,

2158
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,273
if you can tape.
Here's what we're thinking with Noah 

2159
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,003
band.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

2160
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:19,000
with two people agreeing with a like a 
rule set.

2161
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:19,834
Like they agree,
okay we're going to wear gloves and 

2162
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:23,170
we're going to wear khaki pants,
like things along those lines.

2163
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,183
But like if you could work gloves,
gloves for a striker or the equivalent 

2164
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,950
of [inaudible] pants for a really good 
Jujitsu guard player.

2165
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:30,933
Like if a guy like Eddie Bravo is 
allowed to wear Gucci pants and he gets 

2166
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:36,760
you wrapped up.
If you'd like some regular dude,

2167
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,340
you're going to sleep,
you're going to get fucked up.

2168
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,870
You know,
unless you're like some highly even like

2169
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:45,310
coiler Gracie fucks up when he's wearing
the geek pants cause he knows that those

2170
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:48,190
g pants provide insane amounts of 
friction and traction.

2171
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,730
Clamp a hold of you and he could do some
shit to you that you're just going to be

2172
01:34:51,731 --> 01:34:54,190
super uncomfortable with.
In a way,

2173
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:56,920
that's as much of an advantage for him 
to be able to wear.

2174
01:34:56,921 --> 01:35:00,260
The g pants as it would be for a striker
to wear the gloves,

2175
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:02,120
but only as tracker gets to wear the 
gloves,

2176
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,133
like the grapplers have to wear shorts.
Like it's really kind of interesting 

2177
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:06,674
because having your knuckles taped up 
and having your knuckles padded up is a 

2178
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:15,320
real advantage for someone who knows how
to hit things because you can,

2179
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:19,700
you can be like much more a relaxed and 
liberal with your use of punches.

2180
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:21,320
You don't have to worry about hitting 
bones,

2181
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:24,470
but you would never allow that the other
way,

2182
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,333
like giving,
like giving the option of a striker to 

2183
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:29,780
wear hand pads and then a grappler to 
where g pants,

2184
01:35:29,781 --> 01:35:30,614
it's really,
it's like we have a very accepted idea 

2185
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,130
of what civilized.

2186
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,870
One of the things is you cover your 
knuckles.

2187
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:38,690
It's kind of stupid because you don't 
have to cover your elbows,

2188
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:42,170
but people are smashing and slashing 
people up with their elbows.

2189
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,500
My case against it is that it's not 
logical.

2190
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,630
It's just historical.
We're just,

2191
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:51,590
we're just going by a tradition and it's
not a logical tradition.

2192
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:52,890
Right.
Still Queens,

2193
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:55,110
mark's barry kind of,
it is up,

2194
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:55,983
but these are,
these are limitations that we inherited 

2195
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:03,380
from a single discipline,
so it's also like think back back,

2196
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,690
not,
not that long ago,

2197
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,980
a 75 round fight isn't,
wasn't unheard of.

2198
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:12,140
Yeah.
They didn't have no cte.

2199
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,390
There was no will smith movie.
There was no,

2200
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,253
no one knew what the fuck was going on.
There was no real sports with Bryant 

2201
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,673
Gumbel and nobody had any idea that 
getting the hit in the head for that 

2202
01:36:21,711 --> 01:36:23,360
long would be that bad for you.

2203
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:25,370
Crazy.
Yeah.

2204
01:36:25,371 --> 01:36:26,204
It's,
it's kind of fascinating when you think 

2205
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:27,764
about it,
but I really do think that the gloves 

2206
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:30,440
are,
I think we're doing a huge disservice to

2207
01:36:30,441 --> 01:36:31,274
the art of fighting because I think we 
have unrealistic expectations based on 

2208
01:36:34,731 --> 01:36:37,940
the idea that you could just punch 
someone with padded knuckles.

2209
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:39,800
I think if we didn't have padded 
knuckles,

2210
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:42,290
we'd be much more clever and how we use 
our hands,

2211
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,213
because you might break your hand in any
shot and it would be easy to choke 

2212
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:46,514
people.
So jujitsu be more effective to have 

2213
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:49,124
those things are way better for the 
athletes and way better for the the 

2214
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:55,520
honest interpretation of what fighting 
is.

2215
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,640
The problem is no one's going to agree 
to that because people got up from home,

2216
01:36:58,641 --> 01:36:59,710
they're going to look at it and go,
oh,

2217
01:36:59,711 --> 01:37:01,760
this is barbaric.
This is horrible.

2218
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:02,594
They don't even have gloves on their 
bare knock or the first time a guy 

2219
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:08,160
catches a tooth in his fast and it's,
and it's just push open.

2220
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:09,013
They're going to be in your elbow,
which essentially it fixed in your chin 

2221
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:14,030
or,
yeah,

2222
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:16,670
me,
but what's the difference between a,

2223
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:19,790
you catching one and your knuckle or 
catching one in the end of your foot?

2224
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:23,270
When you kick someone's face sideways,
you can wheel kick them in the head with

2225
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:24,104
your heel,
but you can't punch them with bare 

2226
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:27,530
knuckles.
It's stupid.

2227
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:28,723
It's a dumb rule.
It's the whole six to 12 things and 

2228
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,120
stupid too.
It doesn't work,

2229
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:33,043
but I'll leave that.
I'll leave that and take no gloves any 

2230
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:36,104
day.
I really think there should be no 

2231
01:37:36,501 --> 01:37:38,540
gloves.
I think even for strikers,

2232
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,561
I think,
yeah man,

2233
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:40,870
you pad some dudes up.
You,

2234
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,490
you fucking give a dude like tyrone's 
loves.

2235
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:45,520
Just like protecting your lane.
Blood skin,

2236
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:47,800
but no taping.
What if that w would you,

2237
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:49,640
why urban text?
Your knuckles and skin.

2238
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,500
Why?
What are we looking at?

2239
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:53,760
We're looking at the why.
How can you look it up on my elbows,

2240
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:56,010
devil's advocate on that.

2241
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,280
We're looking at exchange of bodily 
fluids.

2242
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:01,350
If I punch you in the teeth,
you know what I mean?

2243
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,540
Silly.
You're getting that from everything.

2244
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:08,290
You getting that from arms choke.
People really like people getting bitten

2245
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:10,450
when they've been choke.
When you choke like a rick,

2246
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:13,870
like you watched Damien Maia versus rick
story and he's going like right over his

2247
01:38:13,871 --> 01:38:16,090
face and you don't think he's getting a 
little bit of bite.

2248
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:18,150
You get bites and your arms.
You don't even,

2249
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:19,003
they're not even trying to bite you.
They're trying to breathe and you're 

2250
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:22,240
crushing your bar.

2251
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,770
Rarely do you see his arm come away,
bleeding or something.

2252
01:38:24,771 --> 01:38:25,604
I'm saying there's the rare occasion of 
like though but but a far less rare 

2253
01:38:29,031 --> 01:38:29,864
would be if there was no gloves and 
you're punching a guy and a 

2254
01:38:31,581 --> 01:38:33,740
modification,
you're going to catch them teeth.

2255
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,840
You going to be a lot more cutting of 
the hands too.

2256
01:38:35,841 --> 01:38:37,010
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

2257
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:39,360
Devil's advocate.
Here is a solution.

2258
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:42,240
Double Mouth Guard in enforce the rule 
of a devil mouth guard,

2259
01:38:42,241 --> 01:38:43,074
which means that there's a space and a 
metal version too like an old school 

2260
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,770
like no,
no,

2261
01:38:46,771 --> 01:38:47,131
no,
no,

2262
01:38:47,131 --> 01:38:47,964
no.
It goes lower teeth and the upper teeth 

2263
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,213
and then you have a space in the middle.
Bernard Hopkins always used to fight 

2264
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:52,884
with one of those and it covers your 
lower teeth and your upper teeth and 

2265
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:56,154
there's a space in the middle and you 
breathe through that and you breathe 

2266
01:38:57,901 --> 01:39:01,710
through your nose and you get used to 
doing that and the lower mouth guard.

2267
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:05,100
The problem with having only an upper 
mouth guard is most people do that,

2268
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,010
but only in upper mouth guard will work 
for the most part.

2269
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:09,870
But there is,
if you're bare knuckle,

2270
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:10,843
there's,
there's a real argument for using an 

2271
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:14,690
upper and a lower because you're dealing
with different situations.

2272
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:15,481
Joe.
Well,

2273
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:17,940
even then you would just have it fitted 
to your face.

2274
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,890
Just devil advocate.
I understand what you're saying.

2275
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:20,820
What I'm saying is

2276
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:22,280
shut up either,
but know our dough.

2277
01:39:22,281 --> 01:39:24,560
Bernard Hopkins,
my favorite fighter of all time.

2278
01:39:24,561 --> 01:39:25,630
Personally.
I know.

2279
01:39:25,631 --> 01:39:26,750
Hey,
whenever my favorite,

2280
01:39:26,751 --> 01:39:28,920
he's my favorite boss.
I'll tell you why.

2281
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,230
He's my favorite.
I'll tell you why is my fear,

2282
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,450
first of all,
I saw his last fight.

2283
01:39:32,451 --> 01:39:34,700
I was there in the forum and it was,
it was a bummer to me.

2284
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,013
You're better than that and I'm,
your fucking career will be forever 

2285
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:42,350
because here's what I knew.
Bernard Hopkins was the fucking man.

2286
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:43,730
All right.
He was,

2287
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,623
I be real.
I've always been surrounded by Latin 

2288
01:39:47,211 --> 01:39:48,044
guys.
Alright.

2289
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,210
That's just all the dudes I know are 
Mexican,

2290
01:39:50,211 --> 01:39:51,560
Cuban and these kind of guys,
you know,

2291
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,060
be real is one of my best friends on 
earth.

2292
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,730
Um,
sick jacket,

2293
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:56,510
that's another,
you know,

2294
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:58,550
these are all of that and dues.
These are all Spanish guys,

2295
01:39:58,551 --> 01:39:59,384
Mexicans and whatnot.
So anytime a fight like that would come 

2296
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:03,230
up,
you know,

2297
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:05,930
they're all taken de Felix Trinidad or 
the whoever it was.

2298
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:07,850
Of course when he was fighting Felix 
Trinidad,

2299
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:09,523
we were all watching at [inaudible] 
house when his mother fucker took the 

2300
01:40:12,951 --> 01:40:13,784
Puerto Rican flag.
He was in Puerto Rico Talking Shit on 

2301
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:18,223
Felix Trinidad at the time.
The fucking all mighty fucking son of 

2302
01:40:23,361 --> 01:40:26,540
all Puerto Rico,
the Puerto Rican flag,

2303
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:27,374
which if you know about Puerto Rican 
guys and I know plenty of Puerto Rican 

2304
01:40:29,241 --> 01:40:30,710
guys,
you put that flag on anything.

2305
01:40:30,711 --> 01:40:31,850
They've got so much pride.
They'll,

2306
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:32,870
they,
they'll buy it,

2307
01:40:32,871 --> 01:40:34,220
they'll wear it there.
Is it a flag?

2308
01:40:34,221 --> 01:40:35,900
Is Everything.
They get crazy.

2309
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:39,620
He took this flag in Puerto Rico.
Dude on the ground is stepped on it.

2310
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:41,020
Jesus.
Why go back you?

2311
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:41,863
I'm sure it's on youtube where he'd 
steps on the Puerto Rican for the end 

2312
01:40:44,811 --> 01:40:48,050
point in a room and I literally told my 
friends if he gets off that island,

2313
01:40:48,051 --> 01:40:50,150
nobody on our speaking his ass.
I was like,

2314
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,333
cause they should be trying to fucking 
kill him right now if know anything 

2315
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:53,980
about

2316
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,813
Puerto Rican people,
what me and when he got the fight came 

2317
01:40:57,461 --> 01:41:00,070
that day.
I bet everybody and be,

2318
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:03,200
be real used to throw like barbecues 
every fight like it would be,

2319
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,300
that's where we be.
That was,

2320
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:05,490
that was our routine.
We got it.

2321
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:08,680
And then it was always anytime it was 
like a black guy versus like a Spanish,

2322
01:41:08,681 --> 01:41:10,720
Spanish guy.
It could be any kind of Spanish guy.

2323
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:14,800
I would always like bet against the 
house and more times than not I won.

2324
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:15,813
But like Yo,
he stomps on the God damn flag and got 

2325
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:20,260
out of that island.
We threw it,

2326
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:23,710
he took it away from fields to on the 
ground and then he beat his ass.

2327
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,080
I feel like he killed him and the ninth 
round and my car.

2328
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:26,914
I feel like he killed him right there 
while he definitely landed a sack of 

2329
01:41:30,231 --> 01:41:31,900
working with,
owed him right there.

2330
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:35,500
Cause it's like if you didn't get 
stabbed before you got off the island of

2331
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,120
Puerto Rico,
that's a win.

2332
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,830
He put a lot of pressure on himself 
though.

2333
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:39,664
That's how,
that's why I always knew I was like the 

2334
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:42,220
is my man.
I'm just,

2335
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:45,220
but just for the ball factor of that,
that's a big ball factor.

2336
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:47,950
I mean if you would have pulled that in 
New York,

2337
01:41:47,951 --> 01:41:51,040
I would said you were fucking crazy in 
Puerto Rico.

2338
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,473
Jesus man,
that took huge nuts that we took the 

2339
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:56,014
dude who was in jail for most of his 
life and was living off commissary 

2340
01:41:58,571 --> 01:41:59,404
donations.
It was a brilliant performance too in 

2341
01:42:00,941 --> 01:42:05,530
that fight.
He kicked ass Yo Bernard until the last,

2342
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:07,960
he'd beat the shit out of fields.
Five,

2343
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:10,120
six fights of his,
he'd beat the shit out of everybody.

2344
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:12,670
Well,
you got to realize he's like 51 which is

2345
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:17,470
incredible when this fight,
I want to say he was 34 35 well,

2346
01:42:17,471 --> 01:42:20,920
he was old when I did 36 spent so much 
time in jail.

2347
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:22,930
Oh my God.
What a beautiful counter punch,

2348
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:24,880
but you know what this show is always 
about him.

2349
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:25,980
Is he live like a monk?
Yeah.

2350
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:28,660
It was always in training.
He never fucking partied.

2351
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:29,850
Never any smoke?
No.

2352
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,560
Just us foods is the big thing he was 
saying.

2353
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:36,280
He eats very healthy and clean.
He was one of the early advocates of the

2354
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:40,520
raw diet kind of thing.
I know he also was a brilliant boxer and

2355
01:42:40,521 --> 01:42:43,670
I just loved executional.
Came out with the mask duty.

2356
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:48,770
You got to realize this guy got passed.
He got past 12 rounds and Sergey Kovalev

2357
01:42:48,941 --> 01:42:49,774
without getting knocked out and he got 
rocked and dinged several times in that 

2358
01:42:53,111 --> 01:42:55,900
fight.
He fought cove 11 is prime cove left,

2359
01:42:55,901 --> 01:42:59,740
who my opinion is top three or four 
pound for pound in the world.

2360
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:04,810
I mean it's arguable at least number one
right now or a fight.

2361
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:06,690
Dude,
he wanted that first four could have,

2362
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,800
I feel like he'd get [inaudible] 
opinion.

2363
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:10,720
I thought he was my humble opinion.
I agree with you.

2364
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:15,700
I would have to like go over it with a 
real legitimate boxing judge and like,

2365
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:16,633
I don't,
I mean I know what I think about boxing 

2366
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,473
towns.
Crawford fight where he put it on that 

2367
01:43:20,621 --> 01:43:24,150
Cuban or whatever he is,
put the fucking crowd he's,

2368
01:43:24,151 --> 01:43:27,480
and he's in the argument for number one 
pound for pound in the world is,

2369
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,710
I feel like it's changing.
Tito got beat,

2370
01:43:29,711 --> 01:43:31,540
right.
Controversial fight,

2371
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:33,180
but closer yet to handle those 
decisions,

2372
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:34,900
see the fight.
But I heard it was controversial.

2373
01:43:34,901 --> 01:43:37,260
Some people disagreed with it,
but my ma,

2374
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,750
what I feel is that like terrence 
Crawford and Loma Chanko or the guys who

2375
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:44,140
put it on people to the point where he,
they just run away from it.

2376
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:47,800
Just set the fight and run away from it.
But they just set the big fight.

2377
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:50,780
The fucking triple.
Yeah,

2378
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:51,590
yeah,
yeah,

2379
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,010
yeah.
What's

2380
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
your thing?
What's you think it's a very important 

2381
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:56,090
fight?
It's a very important fight because like

2382
01:43:56,091 --> 01:43:58,730
you look at how good can l looked 
against Julio,

2383
01:43:58,731 --> 01:44:02,750
Cesar Chavez Jr [inaudible] come on.
Let's be real respect to pop's.

2384
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,770
Respect to pops all the way that got 
cheetos.

2385
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:07,280
Junior was never,
ever,

2386
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:08,660
ever,
ever anywhere.

2387
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:10,490
He shouldn't have been in there.
The only thing he got to read,

2388
01:44:10,491 --> 01:44:12,740
only reason he got in his,
cause his name was Chavez Jr man.

2389
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,603
Honestly,
you're 100% correct other than the few 

2390
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:17,960
good.
He's had some good performances.

2391
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,900
Sergio Martinez and once he got busted 
for that we shit.

2392
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:22,810
It seemed like after that it was 
downhill.

2393
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:25,310
The kid just didn't care anymore.
You know what?

2394
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,410
I equate it to this personally.
I don't know the guy,

2395
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:28,244
I'm not assuming my take on it is he 
just got tired of fucking trying to be 

2396
01:44:32,631 --> 01:44:33,590
the fucking his dad.

2397
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:35,710
What a hundred and something and how 
many losses?

2398
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:36,613
Just the cop.
That was one of the greatest of all 

2399
01:44:37,461 --> 01:44:39,030
time,
if not this right here.

2400
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:40,760
This floyd mayweather,
like 40 and something.

2401
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:43,010
Oh,
didn't dude go like 70 something and Oh,

2402
01:44:43,011 --> 01:44:43,844
why does that,
no,

2403
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:44,380
no,
no,

2404
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:45,201
he didn't.
He didn't.

2405
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:46,470
He didn't and my trip man.
Yeah,

2406
01:44:46,471 --> 01:44:46,940
yeah,
yeah.

2407
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:49,100
The then my phone for facebook.
Fake News.

2408
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:50,210
What was the,
uh,

2409
01:44:50,211 --> 01:44:51,044
what was Google,
what was Julio set up since I shot 

2410
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:58,790
record before he lost,
there's two amateur fights or something.

2411
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:02,330
Before the Loma Chanko was only had one 
amateur loss.

2412
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,920
He's got one professional laws,
one batch,

2413
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:08,540
a lot check in boxing because I've 
become such a UFC fan.

2414
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:09,620
I'm like,
I'm some cats.

2415
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:11,750
I have friends like my buddy vinny pass 
from,

2416
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:13,250
from,
from any paths.

2417
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:16,530
He fucking hates him.
It made fucking hates it.

2418
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:21,450
This task please Joe.

2419
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,023
Joe,
I'm there that day when vinny comes 

2420
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:30,050
invitation,
invitation,

2421
01:45:30,051 --> 01:45:31,780
any paths.
What do you do it in July,

2422
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:33,530
July 8th.
July 8th?

2423
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:34,573
No,
that it,

2424
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,520
I don't think I'll be back,
but if he wants to go call.

2425
01:45:38,530 --> 01:45:38,821
No,
no,

2426
01:45:38,821 --> 01:45:39,061
no,
no,

2427
01:45:39,061 --> 01:45:39,291
no,
no,

2428
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:39,531
no,
no.

2429
01:45:39,531 --> 01:45:44,090
I want to be there.
But if you change that opinion out cause

2430
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:46,130
he's a boxing,
but he is,

2431
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:48,030
I told him the Natto,
he loves the [inaudible].

2432
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,470
I know he is.
I know what he looks.

2433
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:52,400
Disrespects the MMA game to a certain 
degree where I'm like,

2434
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,470
okay,
what's your little like comments,

2435
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:55,260
dude?
You know,

2436
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:56,540
he's real fighting.
You know,

2437
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:58,400
in the streets.
Floyd Mayweather,

2438
01:45:58,401 --> 01:45:59,234
we'd get his fucking ass busted by 
Connie [inaudible] wouldn't even be 

2439
01:46:02,391 --> 01:46:04,550
close,
but it was more destruction.

2440
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:09,650
It would be connor mcgregor,
grading floyd mayweather's face into the

2441
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:14,060
pavement like parmesan cheese.
That's what it would be in real life.

2442
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,760
It was just rip his legs out.
That's it.

2443
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:16,603
Floyd didn't tag him with a knockout 
punch from the first few seconds of the 

2444
01:46:18,621 --> 01:46:19,454
fight.
Connor would be way away from him 

2445
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:23,070
kicking his legs out.
Hands out.

2446
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:24,290
I read this article.
I don't know.

2447
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:26,630
She probably saw about like,
what if it was like a,

2448
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:27,464
what if article?
What if connor took the flight with 

2449
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:30,680
mayweather and just came out,
picked him up,

2450
01:46:30,681 --> 01:46:33,210
slammed him on the fucking ground and 
dismantle them and like rip design.

2451
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:36,860
It's just to do it.
He could do it and he really could do it

2452
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:40,400
if you wanted to take them down and just
lost all their money and everything,

2453
01:46:40,401 --> 01:46:41,410
but I still kicked his ass.
He's,

2454
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,700
that's nothing.
MMA destroys fucking,

2455
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:46,160
he would go to jail or something would 
happen because it would be,

2456
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:47,780
here's a problem.
There'd be betting,

2457
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,860
right?
It'd be all these people bet against it.

2458
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:52,710
What do you do there?
Because Floyd winds by disqualification.

2459
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,813
You knew you were going to do this and 
you didn't go into this with good faith 

2460
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:58,200
class action lawsuit against conor 
Mcgregor.

2461
01:46:58,230 --> 01:46:59,063
Wow.
You're taking a what if article way too 

2462
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:00,864
far.

2463
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,040
That would be funny.
It's what I do with everything.

2464
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:06,460
It's my problem.
No,

2465
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:10,050
I love it.
I go deep too deep on this thing,

2466
01:47:10,051 --> 01:47:11,890
man.
It's going to be an interesting fight.

2467
01:47:11,891 --> 01:47:14,040
If they fight,
I think she fight with no gloves.

2468
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,520
See what the fuck is really going on.
Hey,

2469
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,770
one other,
that's my thing since I'm really,

2470
01:47:19,771 --> 01:47:23,160
I'm really glad joe started me drinking 
whiskey before the podcast.

2471
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:25,890
Two in the afternoon.
I ain't mad at you.

2472
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:26,881
Come on.
Don't,

2473
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:28,590
don't act like you didn't say,
let's drink some whiskey.

2474
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,730
Everlast to say no,
let's drink some whiskey.

2475
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,540
Then you have made the full pot.
But what I want to say real quick,

2476
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:39,270
it's because I've been drinking and I 
haven't been there in awhile either.

2477
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:41,220
My good friend Jason Ellis,
just one,

2478
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,430
his king of the cage match won by 
submission,

2479
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:45,091
right?
Yes.

2480
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:47,730
He won outright by submission.

2481
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:48,863
Congratulations.
[inaudible] you fucking worked hard for 

2482
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:55,200
that and that that inspires me.
That kind of shit inspires me when I see

2483
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:57,030
Jason Dude and I'm like,
fuck,

2484
01:47:57,031 --> 01:47:57,864
I'm making a lot of excuses for shit.
He did real strength and conditioning 

2485
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:03,060
with like no train deal.
First of all,

2486
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:07,260
he beat up a couple of MMA guys.
I mean rape or what it was gay Rutenbar,

2487
01:48:07,261 --> 01:48:08,160
whatever.
He beat that.

2488
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:10,130
I was there when you beat him up,
man.

2489
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,940
Watch me beat him up.
All right.

2490
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:13,863
That's actually fights.
Whatever you want to say about all the 

2491
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:16,254
weight cuts he missed on the ultimate 
fighter said that guy's a professional 

2492
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:18,714
fighter.
Jayson beat the shit out of him and 

2493
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:21,830
knocked him out.
All right.

2494
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:24,240
When I heard about this fight,
I was texting him like,

2495
01:48:24,241 --> 01:48:25,350
you're going to win this fight,
dude.

2496
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:26,460
I know you went,
but Yo,

2497
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,470
you fucking won that fight dog.

2498
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:30,600
Real deal.
Love you.

2499
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:32,010
Congrats.
Yeah.

2500
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:32,903
And did everything he had to do like did
the real shit to get in shape that 

2501
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:38,723
that's what I'm saying,
he's inspired that that Kinda guy is 

2502
01:48:39,781 --> 01:48:40,760
inspiring to me.
Remember,

2503
01:48:40,761 --> 01:48:42,990
because what he does is he chooses 
something and he says,

2504
01:48:42,991 --> 01:48:46,020
I'm gonna commit to it.
I was saying,

2505
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:49,350
I think earlier I'm here because I 
follow road signs and I just,

2506
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:50,243
I,
I consider myself adept at reading the 

2507
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:56,700
signs of life and where I'm po when 
there's the forks in the road.

2508
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:59,190
I happen to be good at making the right 
choice.

2509
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:00,653
There's certain guys that don't give a 
fuck about the fork in the road and 

2510
01:49:02,761 --> 01:49:04,860
determine their own fucking path and 
decide.

2511
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:07,470
You're kind of one of those dudes.
And I admire that.

2512
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,120
I mean,
admire what I do.

2513
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:11,160
I know,
I recognize there's a skill and a talent

2514
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,503
and a blessing and what I do,
but there's something about being of 

2515
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:15,594
decide something and fucking make it so 
even though maybe it's not supposed to 

2516
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:25,581
be so,
and that is my next chasing life.

2517
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:29,940
Maybe not to it.
If I,

2518
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:31,830
even if I don't achieve it,
to understand it,

2519
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:33,960
how it's possible,
how could I be that guy?

2520
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:37,620
How could it at 20 maybe I have under 
understood a little bit differently,

2521
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:41,970
so maybe by the time I'm 70 God willing,
it's an illusion.

2522
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,013
This is the illusion.
The illusion is that looking at the 

2523
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,460
ultimate results

2524
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:52,270
from your perspective and you're saying 
how,

2525
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:56,080
how do I tune myself in?
How do I,

2526
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:56,973
how do I get totally connected with what
I really want to do and not be 

2527
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:04,420
influenced by the opinions and the ideas
of others?

2528
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:08,050
How do I find my true sweet spot,
right?

2529
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,180
The problem is we all look at other 
people's destination.

2530
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:15,670
Again,
like that crazy quote,

2531
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:20,200
that comparison is the enemy of joy.
It's really kind of the same thing.

2532
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:21,420
The thief of joy.
Yeah,

2533
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:22,263
the thief of joy,
that the whole key I think to anything 

2534
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:27,550
you do,
whether you're a guy who makes furniture

2535
01:50:27,551 --> 01:50:32,551
or a woman who paints or whatever the 
fuck you do where you were a rapper or a

2536
01:50:33,161 --> 01:50:33,994
blues singer,
a standup comedian or an author or 

2537
01:50:36,971 --> 01:50:39,400
whatever the fuck you do.
The thing,

2538
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:42,430
the thing is,
and this is a cliche expression,

2539
01:50:42,431 --> 01:50:43,264
but it's re there's a reason why people 
keep expressing and over and over again 

2540
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,170
get out of your own way.

2541
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:48,543
Half of the reason why you're not tuning
in perfectly good to whatever fucking 

2542
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:53,524
vibration is available to you in the 
universe as you get in your own fucking 

2543
01:50:56,681 --> 01:50:57,514
way,
you get in your own way with insecurity 

2544
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:04,711
and with ego and with expectation and 
with pressure and with all the different

2545
01:51:06,071 --> 01:51:10,650
judgments you cast on different forms of
art that you may or may not like,

2546
01:51:10,651 --> 01:51:14,770
like you're wasting time.
You're wasting energy.

2547
01:51:14,771 --> 01:51:17,500
It's clogging up your gears.
You only have a certain amount.

2548
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:18,483
You got to manage your attention the way
you would manage oxygen if you are in a 

2549
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:23,410
space ship.
You got to say,

2550
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:25,990
I can't give away this stuff to 
bullshit.

2551
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,990
I can't be sitting around wondering if 
you know w,

2552
01:51:28,991 --> 01:51:30,700
W,
w whatever the fuck it is.

2553
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:31,534
If it's not relevant to your life,
you will be wasting way too much time 

2554
01:51:34,151 --> 01:51:34,760
thinking about it.

2555
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,720
This,
okay,

2556
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:37,660
let me come at you.
Okay.

2557
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:40,070
And this is personal.
This is personal.

2558
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:41,553
Oh

2559
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:45,520
I accept everything you just said as 
truth,

2560
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:48,190
but let me throw a personal angle at 
you.

2561
01:51:48,191 --> 01:51:51,310
Yes sir.
I want to be in much better shape.

2562
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:52,360
Okay.
Okay.

2563
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:54,160
We can do that.
We can get that.

2564
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:54,650
No,
here,

2565
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:56,180
let me gets to the,
the,

2566
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,830
the,
the circumstances.

2567
01:51:57,831 --> 01:52:01,210
Every,
I have a life that

2568
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:01,850
okay.

2569
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,980
Presents me with a lot of problems that 
can

2570
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:10,510
make emotional conflictions yes.
With what I'm trying to achieve in life.

2571
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,070
Right.
Legitimate ones.

2572
01:52:12,130 --> 01:52:12,963
Right.
You know what I mean?

2573
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,580
Cause certain,
I won't call myself ever depressed cause

2574
01:52:15,581 --> 01:52:16,414
I don't like that word.
I mean I do get depressed but I want to 

2575
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:19,720
use the word like,
oh I had depression.

2576
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:20,554
I think a lot of people lean on some 
shit and like try to actually milk it 

2577
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:24,550
in.
Especially in media.

2578
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:27,420
Do you want to see something right now 
before you keep talking to this going to

2579
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:28,254
change your life.
That's going to like lock into exactly 

2580
01:52:29,921 --> 01:52:32,560
what you're saying and you don't even 
know what am I finished saying but yes,

2581
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:33,423
I'm going to show you the way Jamie,
go to my twitter page and pull that 

2582
01:52:35,861 --> 01:52:36,850
Jocko.
Good.

2583
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:38,920
Watch this.
Watch this.

2584
01:52:38,921 --> 01:52:40,540
This is very important,
my friend.

2585
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:41,374
Please is very important and I trusted 
you enough to be like all the back end 

2586
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:46,030
from the beginning.
I won't picket fence that you

2587
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:48,480
didn't hear the finish my store.
Bring it to the beginning.

2588
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,333
We put it up on the screen and we're at 
least going to play one more war porn 

2589
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:56,510
video cause I promised my guys give it.
Give us some volume.

2590
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,583
Listen to this.

2591
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:01,460
One of my direct subordinates,
one of my guys that worked for me,

2592
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:02,323
he would,
he would call me up or pull me aside 

2593
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:05,024
with some major problem,
some issue that was going on and he 

2594
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:08,913
taped.
So we got this and that and the other 

2595
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:11,270
thing.
And I look at him and I'd say,

2596
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:12,523
good.
And finally one day he was telling me 

2597
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:18,840
about some issue that he was having some
problem and uh,

2598
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:20,670
he said,
I already know what you're going to say.

2599
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,461
I said,
well,

2600
01:53:22,461 --> 01:53:24,260
what am I going to say?
You said you're going to say good.

2601
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,840
Uh,

2602
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:27,903
he said,
that's what you always say when 

2603
01:53:28,721 --> 01:53:33,130
something is wrong in going bad.
You always just look at me and say good.

2604
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,071
And I said,
well,

2605
01:53:36,071 --> 01:53:39,940
yeah,
when things are going bad,

2606
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,690
there's going to be some good that's 
going to come from it.

2607
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:44,920
Okay?

2608
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:47,440
Didn't get the new high speed gear we 
wanted.

2609
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:49,720
Good.
Didn't get promoted.

2610
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:55,170
More time to get back.
Oh,

2611
01:53:55,171 --> 01:53:56,920
mission got canceled.
Good.

2612
01:53:57,150 --> 01:53:59,400
We can focus on the older one.
Didn't get funded,

2613
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:03,060
didn't get the job you wanted.
Got Injured.

2614
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:05,340
Sprained my ankle,
got tapped out.

2615
01:54:05,610 --> 01:54:07,310
Good.
Got Beat.

2616
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:12,983
Unexpected problems.
Good opportunity to figure out a 

2617
01:54:18,601 --> 01:54:19,434
solution.

2618
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:23,100
That's it.
When things are going bad,

2619
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:26,640
don't get all bummed out.
Don't get startled.

2620
01:54:26,641 --> 01:54:27,750
Don't get frustrated.

2621
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:37,710
Can say the word good.
Guess what needs,

2622
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:39,630
need.
You're still alive.

2623
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:43,700
It means you're still bleeding.
And if you're still breathing,

2624
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,420
you still got some fight left in.

2625
01:54:50,910 --> 01:54:53,520
Get up,
dust off.

2626
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,360
Reload,
recalibrate,

2627
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:00,300
reengage.

2628
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:02,150
Yeah,

2629
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:03,590
go out on the attack.

2630
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:09,940
Jocko willink,
changing motherfuckers lives right now.

2631
01:55:09,941 --> 01:55:14,320
Live in America.
Coming to you from southern California.

2632
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:15,263
I jocko rhino goosebumps right now.
My kids got pneumonia and her fucking 

2633
01:55:19,721 --> 01:55:20,554
left.
Learn to a degree that nobody fucking 

2634
01:55:21,971 --> 01:55:22,804
knows what to do and fucking even the 
doctors are perplexed while you write 

2635
01:55:25,391 --> 01:55:26,950
about that,
what he's talking about.

2636
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:31,980
This is my question.
This is why I was saying I'm not asking,

2637
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:33,873
I'm not asking of,
I'm saying I actually came on the show 

2638
01:55:35,681 --> 01:55:36,471
today.
A say of if,

2639
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:37,304
if something in this room,
if somebody in the valley area or La 

2640
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:41,840
Greater area,
my twitter's,

2641
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:43,720
Oh gee.
Everlast my uh,

2642
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:44,760
everything's the same.
Oh Gee.

2643
01:55:44,761 --> 01:55:47,730
Everlast or Erik Schrody on facebook.
Legitimate.

2644
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:50,760
I need a little help.
I need a little help in the sense that I

2645
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:55,620
want to be in better shape,
but I travel so much and then at home is

2646
01:55:55,621 --> 01:55:57,870
a stress of like,
I want to go to the gym.

2647
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,970
I couldn't go to the fucking gym for the
last 10 days.

2648
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:00,804
It was either me or my wife at the 
fucking house and you hear somebody 

2649
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:04,830
don't know.
I don't wanna make you feel bad at all.

2650
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:07,260
I want to say it's like that's,
that was beautiful.

2651
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,640
Whoever,
who is that guy again?

2652
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:10,740
Jocko willink,
Jocko willink.

2653
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:11,883
That is fucking supremely motivationally
on any level except what I'm trying to 

2654
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:15,654
say is like skating your way around this
fucking kind of emotional fucking 

2655
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:23,520
dilemma of like it's hard.
Of course I'm here saying it's hard.

2656
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:28,650
I'm actually bringing it up to say no 
one's denying failing in certain ways at

2657
01:56:28,651 --> 01:56:29,484
at what I'm trying to achieve.
And so like that's what I mean when I 

2658
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:36,120
say I'd see Jason and I know again,
I got a little extra,

2659
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:37,920
I got a little extra to deal with.
I got a little,

2660
01:56:37,921 --> 01:56:41,790
my backpack has a little more weight 
emotionally and mentally.

2661
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:44,520
Okay.
But I'm not making that an excuse.

2662
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:47,670
What I'm saying is is like how do I be 
more like that?

2663
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,920
How can that,
I want that.

2664
01:56:49,921 --> 01:56:50,790
I'm asking.
Well,

2665
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:51,624
what he's given you is talking about 
very specific situations given you 

2666
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:57,970
opportunities that Rick Carson was,
I got down,

2667
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,650
I'm fucked up.
It's when it's this other thing,

2668
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:02,513
this other,
this is a whole different level of like 

2669
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:05,693
mental challenge to it.
I'm not saying what he's saying is 

2670
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:08,970
wrong.
I'm not saying it doesn't work,

2671
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:12,690
but how do I find that in that?
That's tough.

2672
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:13,530
It's,
it's a sin.

2673
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:14,363
What he's proposing,
the principles that he has the answer 

2674
01:57:16,471 --> 01:57:17,304
please fucking Holler at no listen man.
The principles that he's proposing when 

2675
01:57:20,551 --> 01:57:22,620
he's saying that you can apply them to 
everything.

2676
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:23,783
Figure out how you can take whatever 
situation you're in and improve your 

2677
01:57:27,361 --> 01:57:30,780
position.
Do 400 curls a day and be as buff as Joe

2678
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:30,870
Rogan.

2679
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:32,200
I can't,
how do I get to,

2680
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:35,200
I'm making fucking,
I don't even,

2681
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:37,140
you're acting like literal with this 
literal.

2682
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:39,150
Don't get literal with me.
Alright.

2683
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:41,280
Cause to drinking whiskey or drinking 
water,

2684
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:43,230
that's whiskey.
I only got to drive a block.

2685
01:57:43,231 --> 01:57:45,690
You got to drive however far 
interesting.

2686
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:49,740
Someone's comparing joy.
I'll walk thief,

2687
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:52,820
thief of joy that's crept into our 
travel pillows.

2688
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:55,020
Actually just meant to be like a little,
you know,

2689
01:57:55,021 --> 01:57:56,640
but um,
I want that.

2690
01:57:56,641 --> 01:57:58,260
I,
that I found that very motivating.

2691
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,123
But what I'm saying is like,
there's this hurdle I understand of cap 

2692
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:06,330
or lieutenant Dan that's got some real 
fucking anger issues.

2693
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:07,141
I'm working,
I'm out,

2694
01:58:07,141 --> 01:58:07,990
I'm working on him.
I'm,

2695
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:08,980
I'm,
this is the real,

2696
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,960
hey,
the whiskey,

2697
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,720
I'm being more honest than I even 
thought I would be today.

2698
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:13,663
Okay.
Okay.

2699
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,190
But you're,
I mean,

2700
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:21,270
you don't get on a fucking platform like
Joe Rogan and say,

2701
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:23,040
Hey,
I'm failing at this,

2702
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:25,470
unless you're fucking trying to do 
something about it.

2703
01:58:25,471 --> 01:58:29,250
You know what I mean?
I want to achieve,

2704
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:31,650
I don't want to be you,
but I'm like,

2705
01:58:31,651 --> 01:58:33,530
I see the way I love to watch it.
I,

2706
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:36,710
you know what I'm saying?
But I've been watching your videos about

2707
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,220
running,
about running.

2708
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,860
I do.
Another thing that has also gotten to me

2709
01:58:40,861 --> 01:58:42,040
and me to,
when I

2710
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,600
do get to work out,
it's because I hear Joe Rogan tell me,

2711
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:49,390
don't let the inner bitch fucking get 
you.

2712
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:51,320
Yeah.
And I can extension.

2713
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,770
And that that's been a big motivator for
me as I,

2714
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:54,933
but there's,
it's not an inner bitch to be disturbed 

2715
01:58:57,461 --> 01:59:02,461
and upset and your life up heaved by 
this thing is dad.

2716
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:04,900
Absolutely not.
It's absolutely not.

2717
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,160
Do you feel where I'm coming from?
Right?

2718
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:08,260
Think but what he's saying in this 
video,

2719
01:59:08,261 --> 01:59:11,860
what is applicable and you can argue 
whether or not solve,

2720
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:13,673
but I'm asking you on a personal level.
I sit on a personal level and I'm not 

2721
01:59:16,481 --> 01:59:17,314
trying to argue with you or be 
argumentative as I'm saying on a 

2722
01:59:19,241 --> 01:59:21,490
personal level.
That's the level of it with it.

2723
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:26,380
The level of that that are that that 
inspirational message is great,

2724
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:30,180
but I'm struggling.
Of course you are with this part of it.

2725
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:31,670
Like how do I,
I,

2726
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:35,740
if I got my arm broken and snapped by a 
guy who tapped me out or,

2727
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:40,060
or life just kicked my ass and I didn't 
get the job I or the opportunity,

2728
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:42,880
I wanted an good,
I understand that.

2729
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:48,200
But I am personally struggling with he 
as an excuse,

2730
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:53,820
not using this but the truthful 
emotional fucking agony of like seeing a

2731
01:59:53,861 --> 01:59:58,690
child tow you like and not just tell you
but go through this hospital of the last

2732
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:00,640
two weeks.
These things of like,

2733
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:03,150
how do I be stronger?
How do I,

2734
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:03,993
you and anybody and what I'm saying,
I'm not being argumentative with you 

2735
02:00:06,161 --> 02:00:07,900
again is saying,
please,

2736
02:00:07,901 --> 02:00:10,390
if you've got a book throw,
it's tweeted to me.

2737
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:12,880
If you're the dude who fucking is local 
and says,

2738
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:13,743
I know how to help.
Plus I understand I have a heart valve 

2739
02:00:16,601 --> 02:00:18,480
replacement,
my workout.

2740
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:24,550
Let me tell you why working out gets 
weird for me.

2741
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,710
I'll start,
I'll do good.

2742
02:00:26,711 --> 02:00:28,960
I'll drop 15 pounds,
bang,

2743
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:29,620
boom,
boom.

2744
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:33,220
And then I'll start to push myself and 
I'll,

2745
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:38,760
I'll get distrustful of my own heart,
like a pain or a tinge that really might

2746
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:43,270
not be anything will come along and 
fucking scare the shit out of me because

2747
02:00:43,271 --> 02:00:44,104
there's nothing,
I never was afraid of anything in my 

2748
02:00:45,881 --> 02:00:50,140
life until I had children.
And the only thing I'm afraid of on this

2749
02:00:50,141 --> 02:00:53,080
planet is not being here for my 
children,

2750
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,210
my life or death.
I do not care.

2751
02:00:55,211 --> 02:00:57,070
I've died twice,
literally.

2752
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:00,220
All right,
I don't care about that.

2753
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:03,460
But now there's this fear of like these 
children,

2754
02:01:03,461 --> 02:01:04,900
these girls,
not even boys.

2755
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,620
I honestly even feel I would feel 
differently if I had two boys.

2756
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:09,783
Like there'll be all right.
I can instill the manly shit into him 

2757
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:12,844
while I'm here.

2758
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:15,630
But my girls,
I'm of the,

2759
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:18,160
my biggest fear in life is not being 
here for them.

2760
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,540
And I'm good.
I'm healthy.

2761
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:22,090
I,
except for about 25 pounds of weight.

2762
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,740
I'm actually,
my blood works,

2763
02:01:23,741 --> 02:01:26,070
all that.
My doctors are all very happy with me,

2764
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:27,063
the only complaint they ever have.
And the only complaint I ever have is I 

2765
02:01:29,351 --> 02:01:30,980
have some back pains.
Sometimes I'm asleep.

2766
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:32,950
Right.
Let me stop [inaudible] go ahead.

2767
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:33,933
Let me stop you with all of his talk 
because you have a lot of reasons why 

2768
02:01:36,641 --> 02:01:39,850
things aren't working physically the way
you would like them to.

2769
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:41,930
Cousin,
I'm definitely,

2770
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:43,553
I would like help.

2771
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:44,483
I understand you are,
but there's too much extra energy spent 

2772
02:01:48,271 --> 02:01:49,104
on things that aren't helping you like 
you and I know you have these time 

2773
02:01:52,951 --> 02:01:53,784
constraints,
but to focus on them is 

2774
02:01:55,051 --> 02:01:55,884
counterproductive because you have the 
time constraints that time constraints 

2775
02:01:58,441 --> 02:02:02,310
rob you of your time and then the 
focusing on the time constraints and the

2776
02:02:02,311 --> 02:02:05,730
agony of those time constraints and the 
fucking frustration of having those time

2777
02:02:05,731 --> 02:02:08,670
constraints robs you have more time and 
more energy.

2778
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:11,100
You just got to accept it.
You've got to be zen about it.

2779
02:02:11,370 --> 02:02:14,430
I had a friend and he's on it.
He's a comedian from Boston,

2780
02:02:14,431 --> 02:02:16,410
his name is Tony Vee,
and he said something to me once.

2781
02:02:16,411 --> 02:02:17,244
It's very important and it applied to 
the rest of my life and it was a very 

2782
02:02:19,651 --> 02:02:20,484
simple statement.
He was driving from Boston to New York 

2783
02:02:22,921 --> 02:02:23,754
several times a week,
several times for some job he got and 

2784
02:02:27,301 --> 02:02:28,470
I'm like,
how do you do that?

2785
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:29,573
And he goes,
you know what I found when I get in the 

2786
02:02:30,961 --> 02:02:32,820
car I just go Zan.
I say,

2787
02:02:32,821 --> 02:02:34,530
this is what I'm doing.
I don't,

2788
02:02:34,531 --> 02:02:38,100
I don't concern myself with the fact 
that will wash the dishes.

2789
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:42,060
I don't concern myself with the fact 
that I can't believe I have to do this.

2790
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:43,620
Oh my God,
woe is me.

2791
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:44,730
He goes,
I just do it.

2792
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:45,803
And then I thought about that that day 
and then I applied that to my life 

2793
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:53,510
because that's the best advice anybody 
could ever get it from you.

2794
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:55,440
Anybody who's doing anything they don't 
like to do.

2795
02:02:55,530 --> 02:02:56,363
Of course you don't like to do it,
but to concentrate on the fact that you 

2796
02:02:59,671 --> 02:03:04,671
don't like to do it compounds the not 
like to do it aspect of it.

2797
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:06,450
It makes it worse.
No,

2798
02:03:06,451 --> 02:03:06,880
no.

2799
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,880
Actually it was describing is actually a
lot of the stuff I'm reading right now,

2800
02:03:09,881 --> 02:03:12,470
which is like the art of mindfulness,
which is again,

2801
02:03:12,471 --> 02:03:14,440
when I keep saying wash the dishes,
wash the dishes,

2802
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,303
it's,
it's kind of like saying exactly what I 

2803
02:03:16,151 --> 02:03:18,520
like.
Wash your dishes to wash your dishes,

2804
02:03:18,521 --> 02:03:19,354
don't wash your dishes to get to the 
next thing because then you're not 

2805
02:03:20,831 --> 02:03:22,450
living life.
You're not breathing in.

2806
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,293
I live in,
in your moment.

2807
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:24,213
So I'm working on that.
But at the same time I'm still saying 

2808
02:03:26,621 --> 02:03:27,454
like,
ah.

2809
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:28,320
Also,
ah,

2810
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:31,390
you know what I found in the last couple
of years,

2811
02:03:31,391 --> 02:03:32,224
especially through like the little 
social media that I managed to be 

2812
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:35,404
successful,
that,

2813
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:38,470
that people want to know the real deal.

2814
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:44,260
Shit ain't fucking perfect over here.
There's a lot of things about me.

2815
02:03:44,261 --> 02:03:46,300
I'd like to be better.
Right.

2816
02:03:46,330 --> 02:03:47,163
You know what I mean?
Just because I make good money and I 

2817
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:51,610
ain't hungry.
I could eat philemon you own.

2818
02:03:51,611 --> 02:03:52,740
And while that every night,
you know me,

2819
02:03:52,741 --> 02:03:54,850
I could live really.
I do live really nice.

2820
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:59,590
I'm very fucking grateful for my life,
but there's a lot of fucking dark.

2821
02:03:59,591 --> 02:04:01,480
You don't see that.
If you saw,

2822
02:04:01,481 --> 02:04:06,360
maybe you wouldn't all this fakery 
there's a lot of instagram,

2823
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,070
how dare you,
whatever.

2824
02:04:09,071 --> 02:04:10,450
And you go bring him up.
But um,

2825
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:10,961
yeah,
that,

2826
02:04:10,961 --> 02:04:11,794
you know what that is?
Jamie's been bringing up a little balla 

2827
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:14,193
nonstop.
Just the Cherry on top of fucking 

2828
02:04:16,481 --> 02:04:17,890
fuckery,
you know what I mean?

2829
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:20,500
So what he got called out for,
but he was on a flight,

2830
02:04:20,501 --> 02:04:21,700
at least he was like,
you know,

2831
02:04:21,701 --> 02:04:25,780
on a plane in first class was even,
wasn't really my business.

2832
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:27,790
At least I fly,
I don't fly first.

2833
02:04:27,791 --> 02:04:29,890
I fly business as long as I can lay 
down,

2834
02:04:29,891 --> 02:04:31,240
as long as the tape,
things like this.

2835
02:04:31,241 --> 02:04:34,300
When I fly to Europe I'm cool.
But you know,

2836
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:38,630
and the few times I have flown private,
I instagram that shit.

2837
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:41,550
Hell yeah.
Cause I don't fly private dude.

2838
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:43,740
I know what it really costs.
Right.

2839
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:46,590
It ain't cheap.
When I hollered data like,

2840
02:04:46,591 --> 02:04:50,280
hey can I catch it lifted the last 
flight and I don't get a response back.

2841
02:04:50,281 --> 02:04:53,970
I know it ain't cheap cause that's my 
dude.

2842
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:55,380
If it was cheaper,
you'd be like,

2843
02:04:55,381 --> 02:04:56,400
yeah,
come on.

2844
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:59,340
That's funny.
I think you have to log you.

2845
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:03,380
Exactly.
Why has ever last going?

2846
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:06,000
I play my song and every event.
How's that?

2847
02:05:06,001 --> 02:05:07,650
Is that good enough?
Important.

2848
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:10,020
Every event and I love Dana for that.
Thank you man.

2849
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,333
I love that fucking 35 cents I get for 
that shit every cause that what'd you 

2850
02:05:13,761 --> 02:05:14,160
get?

2851
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:14,993
Probably something that anybody,
if it's one time in an arena but 

2852
02:05:17,431 --> 02:05:18,264
thinking about pays 35 cents.
Well the radio only plays five so I'm 

2853
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:22,710
going to just assuming that,
wait a minute.

2854
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:25,530
Every time your song gets played on the 
radio,

2855
02:05:25,531 --> 02:05:28,230
you get five sentence basically 
somewhere in that neighborhood,

2856
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:31,080
somewhere between five and 10 probably.
What a weird deal.

2857
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:32,313
Hey Dude,
it gets played a lot because the checks 

2858
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:37,020
I'm sure are fat because you deal with a
lot of countries,

2859
02:05:37,021 --> 02:05:37,854
a lot of humans,
7 billion people that 5 cents as the 

2860
02:05:40,351 --> 02:05:43,680
fuck up.
He does mailbox money.

2861
02:05:43,681 --> 02:05:46,060
We call that.
It's a good way to describe them.

2862
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:46,950
Like I said,
you know what I mean?

2863
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:48,450
It's just like,
hey man,

2864
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,620
I'm honestly like saying,
Hey,

2865
02:05:49,621 --> 02:05:51,210
throw it out there.
There's somebody local,

2866
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:52,970
my diet,
my diet is working on it.

2867
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,813
I told you so knows my fucking enemy as 
bane of mindless crap hole is it is 

2868
02:05:58,590 --> 02:05:59,040
cracked.

2869
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,480
What?
Coca Cola is my crack.

2870
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:02,190
Don't,
don't ingest poison.

2871
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:05,190
You drink coffee in the morning?
Yes,

2872
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:06,300
I don't.
I hate coffee.

2873
02:06:06,301 --> 02:06:08,400
I drank.
That whole story makes you live forever.

2874
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:10,713
What was the article that I retweeted?
I said I want to believe and it said 

2875
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:15,810
coffee can make you live longer.
I didn't even read it.

2876
02:06:16,290 --> 02:06:19,350
I read that article for like half a 
paragraph.

2877
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:20,663
I might've got into paragraph number two
was clicked my email unless play it 

2878
02:06:24,511 --> 02:06:28,320
another war.
Porn video cause it's fucking dope.

2879
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:29,760
Let's play another war.
Porn video.

2880
02:06:29,761 --> 02:06:30,594
Jamie.
Plus I gotta pee bad but I'll be right 

2881
02:06:34,621 --> 02:06:35,970
back.
You need whiskey,

2882
02:06:35,971 --> 02:06:38,640
bladder,
brother days.

2883
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:40,140
This was the second one.
Here we go.

2884
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:48,280
[inaudible] last night,
last night.

2885
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:58,743
All Gas.
No choice in the street with the 

2886
02:09:10,230 --> 02:09:12,280
scratching.

2887
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:05,330
Perfect timing and your back.
Yes sir.

2888
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:09,620
Had it released some whiskey.
I understand.

2889
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:12,680
I did as well.
Shout out divine styler.

2890
02:10:12,681 --> 02:10:14,910
He did all the tracks for the record 
shout.

2891
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:17,030
You know what I mean?
I gave him like four already,

2892
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:19,910
but still I think this is the most shout
outs on a podcast.

2893
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:21,350
Well,
I'm going to say shout out Joe Rogan.

2894
02:10:21,351 --> 02:10:22,320
How'd you like that?
What up?

2895
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,410
You know what I mean?
Shout out to everlast.

2896
02:10:24,411 --> 02:10:25,244
You know what I mean?
Shout out every bravo shout out a tape 

2897
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:31,310
flight.
Hottest podcast I ever did in my life.

2898
02:10:31,311 --> 02:10:34,370
Get some fucking air conditioning in 
that building and take the word no,

2899
02:10:34,371 --> 02:10:35,060
no,
not here.

2900
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:37,140
No.
At Eddie's spot a problem.

2901
02:10:37,141 --> 02:10:40,130
And there was like 400 water bottles 
when they did his shit.

2902
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,050
Yeah.
They don't have a mate.

2903
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:42,950
Is that van eyes?
Yeah.

2904
02:10:42,951 --> 02:10:47,951
Over there somewhere by the spearmint 
rhino down.

2905
02:10:48,590 --> 02:10:51,380
People are going to find him.
Yeah,

2906
02:10:51,381 --> 02:10:52,214
he's a what's hilarious.
I did it once and there was a dude 

2907
02:10:54,411 --> 02:10:59,060
playing drum solos next door,
like some dude in the building next door

2908
02:10:59,061 --> 02:10:59,894
was playing the drums.
He could hear it through the fucking 

2909
02:11:00,970 --> 02:11:02,470
walls like,
oh yeah,

2910
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:03,261
okay.
That makes it,

2911
02:11:03,261 --> 02:11:04,094
yeah.
It was kind of a rehearsal studio and I 

2912
02:11:08,661 --> 02:11:09,171
was like,
dude,

2913
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:10,280
does this happen often?
He's like,

2914
02:11:10,281 --> 02:11:11,510
sometimes it happens,
you know,

2915
02:11:11,511 --> 02:11:13,580
he's got to get a smoke serpent remixes 
on,

2916
02:11:13,581 --> 02:11:14,840
you know?
Yeah man,

2917
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:16,970
that's my dude.
I liked that guy.

2918
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:18,223
He keeps offering,
introduced me to a dude out there in 

2919
02:11:20,091 --> 02:11:24,590
corona near where I live to work out to.
Uh,

2920
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:26,110
uh,
he said he got a black belt off there.

2921
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:28,080
Then once,
you know,

2922
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:28,540
I,
I,

2923
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:29,373
you know,
I was doing a little Brazilian Jujitsu 

2924
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:32,620
with Marcus Vanessa's over at,
uh,

2925
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:33,913
beverly hills one just so I was 
literally probably one lesson away from 

2926
02:11:37,191 --> 02:11:39,430
my blue belt when I just everything 
sign.

2927
02:11:39,430 --> 02:11:41,720
It kind of went haywire in my life.
Layla was born and all this,

2928
02:11:41,721 --> 02:11:44,450
all of this stuff happened and I kinda 
moved south.

2929
02:11:44,451 --> 02:11:45,770
I didn't live here anymore.
Well,

2930
02:11:45,771 --> 02:11:47,840
you're friends with Joey Diaz.
You should go with Joey.

2931
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:50,420
Joey does it in Burbank.
If you can make it up,

2932
02:11:50,421 --> 02:11:51,500
you bring it back.
I live in,

2933
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:54,680
I live an hour and a half fucking one.
Find a place near,

2934
02:11:54,681 --> 02:11:56,470
you mean I'll find what I want his 
privates.

2935
02:11:56,471 --> 02:11:57,304
I want,
I'll set up my garage with a little pad 

2936
02:11:58,581 --> 02:12:00,560
system that cause the,
here's the deal.

2937
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:04,850
I know it doesn't happen often,
but anything like staff or anything like

2938
02:12:04,851 --> 02:12:07,610
that is so dangerous for Layla.
That is,

2939
02:12:07,620 --> 02:12:08,453
it's really scary.
So like working out in a gym with like 

2940
02:12:10,731 --> 02:12:12,830
40 guys working out,
there's too scary.

2941
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:16,310
There's too frightening things for me.
Working out in a normal Jujitsu class,

2942
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:17,543
the fucking average novice that doesn't 
realize he's fucking stupid and fucking 

2943
02:12:20,151 --> 02:12:20,984
pulls my left arm out or my right arm 
out and I can't play guitar for fucking 

2944
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:27,170
six weeks or a month or six months even,
you know?

2945
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:29,540
So I only trained with the teachers.
That's my,

2946
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:30,530
what I just said,
hey,

2947
02:12:30,531 --> 02:12:32,870
I'll pay for that.
Whatever little extra of private,

2948
02:12:32,871 --> 02:12:33,770
whatever.
You know what I mean?

2949
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:36,920
But obviously brought I,
Eddie doesn't live out that way so,

2950
02:12:36,921 --> 02:12:38,000
but he told me,
he was like,

2951
02:12:38,001 --> 02:12:39,920
I got a fucking guy out there who's 
awesome.

2952
02:12:39,921 --> 02:12:41,690
He's a fucking black belt.
He's fucking awesome.

2953
02:12:41,691 --> 02:12:42,524
And I just,
I haven't followed up as much as he 

2954
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:46,160
hasn't gotten back,
you know what I mean?

2955
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:49,070
So it's not like he's like ignoring me 
or anything.

2956
02:12:49,071 --> 02:12:51,860
I'm just saying I got to follow through 
on that and get that going to,

2957
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:55,700
cause if I lose and I've lost about 15 
pounds honestly with all this talk we're

2958
02:12:55,701 --> 02:12:57,050
saying and recently,
uh,

2959
02:12:57,410 --> 02:13:02,410
it's called the great American worry 
diet has been a week in the hospital and

2960
02:13:03,401 --> 02:13:04,234
lose 15 pounds,
especially at one that doesn't serve 

2961
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:08,720
meat or caffeine,
you know,

2962
02:13:08,721 --> 02:13:09,580
so those,
you know,

2963
02:13:09,740 --> 02:13:10,573
shout out to the seventh they advocates 
who don't eat meat or caffeine and the 

2964
02:13:14,630 --> 02:13:17,540
most stressful situations ever.
Yeah.

2965
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:20,460
But you know,
honestly I won't even say the,

2966
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:21,753
they,
they took such amazing care of my 

2967
02:13:22,971 --> 02:13:24,470
daughter.
I love every single one of them.

2968
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:25,693
That's awesome.
Now they're non meeting non coffee 

2969
02:13:27,531 --> 02:13:29,510
drinking assets.
I loved them.

2970
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,650
Maybe try that diet.
Let's keep,

2971
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:32,310
keep riding

2972
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,143
it.
It's working.

2973
02:13:34,250 --> 02:13:37,320
What do you,
what you said about the worry though?

2974
02:13:37,321 --> 02:13:40,320
I just get the worry part of the worry 
diet is the hard part,

2975
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:41,040
you know,
of course.

2976
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,950
That's the whole reason of what I kind 
of brought up earlier.

2977
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:44,793
It's like how do you get around that?
How do you get around worrying about 

2978
02:13:48,271 --> 02:13:49,104
your own kid?
You're going to have to read some books 

2979
02:13:50,551 --> 02:13:52,290
on strategy,
how to do that.

2980
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:55,560
I'm trying,
but I'm also here.

2981
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:57,750
I'm feeling myself.
I've smoked a little,

2982
02:13:57,751 --> 02:13:58,830
I've drank a little,
right?

2983
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:02,910
I trust the Joe Rogan person and his 
audience that,

2984
02:14:02,911 --> 02:14:03,744
hey,
if there's an interesting idea out 

2985
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:05,550
there,
go ahead and shoot it.

2986
02:14:05,551 --> 02:14:06,384
I'm sure someone will find me.
There's going to hae and I know I'm 

2987
02:14:08,701 --> 02:14:10,980
going to get like 400 fucking shitty 
ideas,

2988
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:13,050
but if there's one good one out there,
great.

2989
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:14,003
Yeah,
this is going to be dudes who recommend 

2990
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:15,593
video games.

2991
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:20,010
Bro.
Fucking solved all my problems,

2992
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:21,013
dude,
bro.

2993
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:24,420
Jump Rope and virtual road a fake bomb,
dude,

2994
02:14:24,421 --> 02:14:25,920
ping pong changed my life,
man.

2995
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:27,631
You know what?
You're,

2996
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:28,230
uh,
you're,

2997
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:30,960
you've been given a very difficult test 
by whatever,

2998
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:34,070
by life itself.
And the truth of the matter is,

2999
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:37,500
up until that man,
I had an easy ride he had.

3000
02:14:37,501 --> 02:14:39,480
Okay,
so don't feel bad for me.

3001
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:41,070
Right?
But if he got a suggestion,

3002
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:42,930
please shoot it my way because I'm,
oh,

3003
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,440
I'm at this point in life like I've 
understood again,

3004
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,453
the communal,
I think beyond the music lesson of it 

3005
02:14:50,611 --> 02:14:51,980
being communal,
right,

3006
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:55,050
is as a human being,
we are communal people.

3007
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:56,073
Yeah,
and even hails back to the beginning of 

3008
02:14:58,141 --> 02:14:59,730
what we talked about,
the blues and the reds,

3009
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:00,833
they are trying to separate us because 
we're communal and if we all actually 

3010
02:15:04,081 --> 02:15:07,800
sat down,
even the most fucking worst opinion over

3011
02:15:07,801 --> 02:15:09,000
there in the worst pain over there.

3012
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:09,833
If we were only in the room together,
we could find somewhere over here where 

3013
02:15:13,261 --> 02:15:17,040
we could both at least be the least bit 
angry at each other.

3014
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:19,740
I honestly think we should eliminate 
political parties.

3015
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:20,753
Thank you.
Think what we should have is just a 

3016
02:15:21,511 --> 02:15:23,670
bunch of people with money out of 
politics,

3017
02:15:24,410 --> 02:15:27,260
money pull money here.
Let's hear she.

3018
02:15:27,261 --> 02:15:28,094
Interesting idea.
Here's an interesting idea about 

3019
02:15:29,641 --> 02:15:30,630
England,
right?

3020
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:32,003
England announces their elections.
There are three months from the 

3021
02:15:35,551 --> 02:15:40,551
announcement of the elections till the 
election for you to legally campaign.

3022
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:44,580
Why is that good?
It's better because of what?

3023
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,920
Again,
hailing back to what we said earlier,

3024
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:47,933
the day after the presidents elected,
it seems like they're talking about 

3025
02:15:50,311 --> 02:15:52,800
who's going to run in 2020 already.
Right.

3026
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:53,500
All right,
and,

3027
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:54,241
and this,
hey,

3028
02:15:54,241 --> 02:15:58,050
we might be in a particularly weird 
circumstance now in America again,

3029
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:00,480
I won't,
I won't even delve into that.

3030
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:05,340
What I want to say is the day after our 
president is elected,

3031
02:16:05,341 --> 02:16:06,174
we shouldn't be talking about who's 
going to be the next fucking president 

3032
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:12,540
until that guy fucks up enough to say 
who's going to be the next president.

3033
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:14,820
There should be this,
and again,

3034
02:16:14,821 --> 02:16:19,350
we are in some extremely absurd and 
weird circumstances at the moment,

3035
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:21,890
but under normal circumstances,
I would,

3036
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:26,920
this is my argument would just be we're 
Americans.

3037
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:31,210
This guy got elected through the process
we agreed to and even now I'll say that,

3038
02:16:31,211 --> 02:16:32,044
but dude's already fucking again.
That's why I don't want to visit that 

3039
02:16:33,881 --> 02:16:36,100
because that's a whole fucking four 
hours on his own.

3040
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:37,323
Honestly,
I don't,

3041
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:40,270
I don't and I just don't want to even go
there,

3042
02:16:40,271 --> 02:16:45,271
but give America a fucking chance.
You know what I mean?

3043
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:49,690
Am I making any sense?
You make four whiskeys now brother,

3044
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,613
I make Ma,
I mean what your idea is of America 

3045
02:16:53,171 --> 02:16:54,850
versus what everybody else's idea.

3046
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:56,860
We need to come some sort of 
clarification.

3047
02:16:56,861 --> 02:16:59,320
My ideas this,
and I don't mean to interrupt you,

3048
02:16:59,321 --> 02:17:00,154
my idea is this,
is that you could be the furthest away 

3049
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:02,464
from me.
You could be and I could be way over 

3050
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:05,704
there,
but if we were in the same room 

3051
02:17:06,371 --> 02:17:07,204
somewhere,
we in here we'd find a place that we'd 

3052
02:17:09,641 --> 02:17:10,474
be like,
all right,

3053
02:17:11,350 --> 02:17:13,830
I can live with that.
That's the idea.

3054
02:17:13,831 --> 02:17:14,664
We need to figure out what these things 
are that we're talking about living 

3055
02:17:16,331 --> 02:17:18,160
with.
Cause I don't think there's very many of

3056
02:17:18,161 --> 02:17:18,994
them that were very agreeing,
disagreeing rather on between the left 

3057
02:17:21,881 --> 02:17:22,714
and the right.
I think there's a lot of bullshit and I 

3058
02:17:24,011 --> 02:17:25,600
think it's a lot of what we were talking
about earlier,

3059
02:17:25,601 --> 02:17:28,690
this tribal boohoo,
those in the sand,

3060
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:31,510
the people who elected this personal 
president right now.

3061
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:32,450
Personal.
Yeah.

3062
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:34,660
Personal president is a personal 
president.

3063
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:37,000
This is a,
a very few amount of people.

3064
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:39,460
There's really truly very few people 
that are his base.

3065
02:17:39,461 --> 02:17:43,000
35% let's keep it real.
Let's keep it real.

3066
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:44,410
Let's keep it fucking room.
Yeah,

3067
02:17:44,411 --> 02:17:47,500
cause a lot of bailed on him because 
they realize what they voted for was not

3068
02:17:47,501 --> 02:17:48,334
what they fuck.
They voted in protest almost a lot of 

3069
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:52,420
people.
What's his approval rate?

3070
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:53,241
It's pretty low,
right?

3071
02:17:53,241 --> 02:17:56,560
It's fucking the lowest in history.
Is it below and again,

3072
02:17:56,561 --> 02:17:57,394
I don't care.
What I'm saying is like a lot of people 

3073
02:17:59,141 --> 02:17:59,974
said,
fuck the whole system and for a second 

3074
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:02,134
they bought into the fact that this guy 
actually might think the same when this 

3075
02:18:04,781 --> 02:18:07,330
guy has spent his entire life fucking 
over the working class.

3076
02:18:07,331 --> 02:18:08,320
Dude.
In fact,

3077
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:09,393
as much as I'm a,
I would have voted the other direction 

3078
02:18:11,171 --> 02:18:13,000
for whatever you want to say.
And I again,

3079
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:14,560
I don't give a fuck about Hillary 
Clinton.

3080
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:15,393
I'm not telling you the fucking world 
would have been saved by Hillary 

3081
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:17,980
Clinton.
Fuck that shit.

3082
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:19,023
All right.
That was an entitled motherfucking 

3083
02:18:19,871 --> 02:18:20,704
person who was only given that fucking 
position because for some reason the 

3084
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:26,420
people,
the,

3085
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:27,253
the,
the elite of that party thought it was 

3086
02:18:28,931 --> 02:18:30,820
her turn or something.
I don't know.

3087
02:18:30,970 --> 02:18:31,803
That was wrong.
That's just as much their fault for 

3088
02:18:33,641 --> 02:18:36,190
losing as fucking really shouldn't be 
talking about politics.

3089
02:18:36,191 --> 02:18:38,020
We're way too stupid already there.
I'm drunk.

3090
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:39,663
What I'm saying is this is that dude is 
going to give me a tax break if he's 

3091
02:18:44,201 --> 02:18:47,650
successful and the guys that actually 
voted for him,

3092
02:18:47,651 --> 02:18:48,484
the union guys and the fucking working 
class guys are going to get fucked over 

3093
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:53,163
and at the end of the day they'll be 
regretting it as much as like some of 

3094
02:18:56,921 --> 02:19:00,220
the things he spitting at you and saying
to you or appealing,

3095
02:19:00,490 --> 02:19:02,560
he's not that fucking die.

3096
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:05,170
Just like,
Fuck Hillary Clinton.

3097
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:07,810
Fuck Donald Trump.
So you can't be mad at me.

3098
02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:09,363
Fuck all of them.
Bernie Sanders was probably our most 

3099
02:19:12,341 --> 02:19:13,900
logical choice,
but I said,

3100
02:19:13,901 --> 02:19:18,370
fuck him because I read his tax pan plan
and he would have fucking raped me.

3101
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,490
So it's like there's gotta be,
I don't know,

3102
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:24,520
there's gotta be a whole new system 
where the money is.

3103
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:29,570
There has to be a flat tax kind of thing
where every fucking person,

3104
02:19:29,571 --> 02:19:32,480
firm corporation.
The problem is too many corporations are

3105
02:19:32,481 --> 02:19:35,090
considered legally talking way too much 
about politics.

3106
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:37,700
You're freaking me the fuck out.
I can't do this anymore.

3107
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:39,430
Jma.
No,

3108
02:19:39,730 --> 02:19:41,090
here.
I understand what you're saying.

3109
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:45,380
I'm just saying this is as a person,
everybody is good politics.

3110
02:19:45,381 --> 02:19:48,470
It's like explore the fact that they are
separating and dividing.

3111
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,453
You could be a white supremacy,
you could be a black fucking 

3112
02:19:50,811 --> 02:19:52,760
nationalists,
whatever you want to be there.

3113
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:56,210
Fucking playing on that.
They're playing on that.

3114
02:19:56,211 --> 02:19:58,670
These,
this is designed facebook,

3115
02:19:58,671 --> 02:20:02,060
all that.
These algorithms are fucking designed to

3116
02:20:02,061 --> 02:20:04,400
design.
What do you want to see on your page?

3117
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:05,661
Well,
it's,

3118
02:20:05,661 --> 02:20:06,494
remember that Eddie,
you want to see this conversation right 

3119
02:20:09,111 --> 02:20:12,380
now if everybody will just remember 
there or no,

3120
02:20:12,381 --> 02:20:15,590
I just think it's been fact of the way 
they set up programs.

3121
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:16,903
They set up a program to say what's 
going to be most like the guy who 

3122
02:20:19,131 --> 02:20:22,370
invented facebook,
Mark Zuckerberg get his team,

3123
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,350
whoever's his team,
once his,

3124
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:26,360
his,
the people who use his product to be the

3125
02:20:26,361 --> 02:20:28,610
happiest they can be with it.
Correct.

3126
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:29,953
I'm assuming.
Here's the direction we're going with 

3127
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:31,850
this.
Okay,

3128
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:34,580
so if they look at the things you click 
on,

3129
02:20:34,850 --> 02:20:35,683
right,
and start developing a pattern in an 

3130
02:20:36,831 --> 02:20:37,664
algorithm and you click on these 
extremely right things or you click on 

3131
02:20:40,371 --> 02:20:42,740
these extremely left things,
sooner or later,

3132
02:20:42,741 --> 02:20:44,360
that's all it's going to be on your 
page.

3133
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:46,730
Instagram even changed their fucking 
algorithm too.

3134
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:48,880
It's not like what was just last posted,
right?

3135
02:20:48,930 --> 02:20:53,120
It's what was last posted that's most 
popular and what's appealing to you that

3136
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:55,220
you like.
You know what I mean?

3137
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:58,340
That's where I'm going with this is that
these people are,

3138
02:20:58,460 --> 02:21:01,160
they don't understand.
You're being catered to your being fed.

3139
02:21:01,310 --> 02:21:03,620
You're being fed ideas.
You want to be fed.

3140
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:06,730
You're not being challenged,
and I've always said this about pr,

3141
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:08,240
even personal,
my art,

3142
02:21:08,330 --> 02:21:09,163
if there's not somebody,
it goes back to being in a room by 

3143
02:21:10,821 --> 02:21:13,130
yourself and why I got stagnated.
We're making a record.

3144
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:17,690
If there's not somebody in that room 
somehow to challenge your idea,

3145
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:23,860
your idea isn't the best it can be ever.
I understand what you're saying,

3146
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:25,364
but I think that an alternative point of
view would not be that you're getting 

3147
02:21:28,461 --> 02:21:29,990
fed.
Would that be?

3148
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:34,990
These algorithms recognize your 
interests and whether it's golf or South

3149
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:38,750
American fishing or fucking skydiving,
whatever the fuck you're interested in,

3150
02:21:38,751 --> 02:21:41,780
and you start searching for that,
it'll give you things that you can start

3151
02:21:41,781 --> 02:21:44,470
just what you're searching.
That's what you're liking and it's,

3152
02:21:44,620 --> 02:21:45,290
it's,
it's,

3153
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:46,123
it's like you're saying the 
conversations that you've best had in 

3154
02:21:48,201 --> 02:21:49,034
your life or almost alternative opinions
and those start getting filtered out of 

3155
02:21:53,571 --> 02:21:58,571
your feed and then you're seeing only 
your own choices if you choose to go,

3156
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,593
why don't you just search out things 
that are alternative to what you are 

3157
02:22:02,301 --> 02:22:04,550
because you're Joe Rogan and you think 
like that.

3158
02:22:04,551 --> 02:22:05,384
We're talking about the guy who works 
fucking 40 hours a week who gets on 

3159
02:22:07,641 --> 02:22:11,000
facebook and sees what comes down is 
feed guy that he's no different than you

3160
02:22:11,001 --> 02:22:12,470
or me.
He's listening to you.

3161
02:22:12,471 --> 02:22:13,580
I'm sure.
I hope he is.

3162
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:15,890
I hope he's listening to you,
but you hear what I'm saying though,

3163
02:22:15,891 --> 02:22:16,724
right?
Like it's not a fucking dismissed idea 

3164
02:22:18,621 --> 02:22:19,454
that there's guys who got their heads 
fucking down just trying to get their 

3165
02:22:22,311 --> 02:22:23,144
pay check for the next week to get the 
mortgage paid and they look up for a 

3166
02:22:26,281 --> 02:22:27,114
long enough time and maybe facebook is 
the one thing they look at a week and 

3167
02:22:30,061 --> 02:22:32,100
then that's where they get their 
information from.

3168
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:34,200
Yeah,
but that's not facebook's fault.

3169
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:35,093
Good.
Facebook creates an algorithm that 

3170
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:40,530
reinforce what your injuries be aware.
I understand what you're saying,

3171
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:41,603
but you're saying it also in the way of 
like almost like these people are 

3172
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:44,424
victims of this.
This is just a simple algorithm 

3173
02:22:45,991 --> 02:22:47,810
themselves,
but it's not even there,

3174
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:49,650
but they don't even,
they're not even aware of that,

3175
02:22:49,651 --> 02:22:51,390
that are victims of themselves and they 
are.

3176
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:52,283
I would,
I would save if they're creating their 

3177
02:22:54,181 --> 02:22:56,940
own universe,
the Europe completely creating,

3178
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:58,830
and this thing is allowing that.

3179
02:22:59,150 --> 02:22:59,861
All right,
it's Phil.

3180
02:22:59,861 --> 02:23:00,694
You can block whatever you want out if 
you don't want to see something you can 

3181
02:23:04,051 --> 02:23:04,884
create.
And what do they call it in the fucking 

3182
02:23:06,910 --> 02:23:09,920
and cure rate.
Your own universe.

3183
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:11,073
All right.
And let me tell you something about 

3184
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:19,320
resistance.
What I find interesting,

3185
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:22,800
like Keith Olbermann resistance sort of,
sort of,

3186
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:24,390
he's sometimes he,
okay.

3187
02:23:24,391 --> 02:23:26,430
He can be a propagandist too.
I'm just kidding.

3188
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:28,200
He's a propagandist too.
Like Michael Moore,

3189
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:31,110
everybody.
There's no true center right now.

3190
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:34,170
That's why I keep coming back to like,
how do you know what's truly true?

3191
02:23:34,250 --> 02:23:36,060
Right?
And you want to know where I find truth,

3192
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:36,983
where Comedians,
comedians are the new punk rock 

3193
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:42,083
comedians,
truthfully are the people who are 

3194
02:23:44,761 --> 02:23:45,594
challenging the status quo right now,
whether you're talking about the guy on 

3195
02:23:47,971 --> 02:23:51,000
Hbo who has the last week tonight show 
or the daily show kind of news,

3196
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:54,000
more Americans,
and this is a studied fact,

3197
02:23:54,270 --> 02:23:58,140
trust,
comedic news as truth.

3198
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:01,170
Then they do fucking Anderson,
fucking vanderbilt,

3199
02:24:01,171 --> 02:24:02,520
cooper,
vanderbilt,

3200
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:05,010
vanderbilt middle name.
He's a vanderbilt.

3201
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:06,300
I'm just throwing it out.
You know,

3202
02:24:06,301 --> 02:24:07,134
he's uh,
he's not saying I means he comes from a 

3203
02:24:08,671 --> 02:24:11,190
very fucking privileged family dog,
you know,

3204
02:24:11,191 --> 02:24:16,191
and he represents a very leftist Stan.
It's fakery is what I'm saying.

3205
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:17,970
He's a vanderbilt.
Alright,

3206
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,073
that's what I'm saying.
It's like saying he's a rock of fucking 

3207
02:24:20,821 --> 02:24:22,350
feller.
All right?

3208
02:24:22,351 --> 02:24:24,570
And if you don't follow me on that,
he rockefeller,

3209
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:27,570
Rockefeller Not Rockafella.
Oh,

3210
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:29,940
alright.
Rockefeller like the fucking evil.

3211
02:24:29,941 --> 02:24:31,290
Fuck that just died.
Oh,

3212
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:33,000
he's a bad guy.
Bad Guy.

3213
02:24:33,370 --> 02:24:35,040
All right,
1%.

3214
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:37,770
He's a one percenter.
All right.

3215
02:24:37,771 --> 02:24:38,604
Trust that.
Trust the people you're watching that 

3216
02:24:40,321 --> 02:24:41,970
you trust.
Fox News,

3217
02:24:41,971 --> 02:24:44,040
CNN,
all this bullshit and hey,

3218
02:24:44,190 --> 02:24:45,023
I might get a lot.
I ain't even been look at twitter 

3219
02:24:46,141 --> 02:24:47,850
letters later,
so fuck all y'all.

3220
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:49,980
You know what I mean?
I don't look at twitter.

3221
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,750
I don't care.
So if you hate what I'm saying,

3222
02:24:51,751 --> 02:24:54,840
I don't care.
I'm going to say it anyways.

3223
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:57,240
Do you know what I'm saying?
Is for the greater good.

3224
02:24:57,241 --> 02:24:59,610
It's like I'm not telling you I'm left.
I'm right.

3225
02:24:59,611 --> 02:25:00,444
I'm saying there's a place in the middle
where we're all fucking people and we 

3226
02:25:03,421 --> 02:25:04,254
all give a fuck about the same shit like
our lives and our children and our 

3227
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:10,800
eating and our fucking having a roof 
over our head.

3228
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:11,813
And there's no reason that the richest 
fucking planet on Earth can't figure 

3229
02:25:14,731 --> 02:25:15,564
these fucking problems out.
And the only reason there are problems 

3230
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:18,393
because they want there to be problems 
and for you to fucking be fighting with 

3231
02:25:20,791 --> 02:25:21,624
each other.
Your blue or your red choose a crip or 

3232
02:25:23,621 --> 02:25:27,340
you blow.
This is something that they've chosen.

3233
02:25:27,341 --> 02:25:29,260
You cripping or you blood and what 
you're doing,

3234
02:25:29,261 --> 02:25:30,094
you a blood,
you a crip in this political fucking 

3235
02:25:31,451 --> 02:25:32,910
environment and you a blue state.

3236
02:25:32,910 --> 02:25:34,450
Are you a red state?
My man.

3237
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:37,060
What up?
That's what they doing.

3238
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:39,970
That's what they're doing.
And I know we didn't want to go here and

3239
02:25:39,971 --> 02:25:41,770
I know I tried to push it off for like 
hours,

3240
02:25:42,370 --> 02:25:43,203
but I ain't making it personal about a 
president or I think I'm saying there's 

3241
02:25:46,091 --> 02:25:46,924
a system in place that's fucking keeping
us locked down and it's fucked up and 

3242
02:25:51,161 --> 02:25:53,710
it's money related.
And if we took money out of it,

3243
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:54,723
we could get more of an honest 
politician who would actually give a 

3244
02:25:56,711 --> 02:25:57,544
fuck about your kid and whether there's 
fucking power lines going over your 

3245
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:02,680
house or whether you got healthcare over
the,

3246
02:26:02,681 --> 02:26:04,270
you got this or that.
Until then,

3247
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:09,360
don't expect me to give a fuck about any
of y'all [inaudible] y'all that buy into

3248
02:26:11,891 --> 02:26:12,724
this system and ain't ready to change 
something and say that something should 

3249
02:26:16,031 --> 02:26:16,864
be different.
I think everybody thinks I'm no they 

3250
02:26:18,491 --> 02:26:20,470
don't because they're not doing shit 
about it.

3251
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:22,480
They're not doing shit about it.
Joe,

3252
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:24,220
and I'm not trying to be angry with you.
I love you.

3253
02:26:24,221 --> 02:26:25,660
You know I love you brother.
Okay,

3254
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:27,430
but not even,
but all bullshit aside.

3255
02:26:27,431 --> 02:26:28,600
What are you doing?
There is no bullshit.

3256
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:29,463
There's no bullshit in this,
so he still shouldn't have been put 

3257
02:26:31,061 --> 02:26:32,080
aside.
What I'm saying is like,

3258
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:33,093
until people want to realize that 
there's an answer and the answer is 

3259
02:26:35,441 --> 02:26:37,840
pulling corporate and fucking it,
if you can't,

3260
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:40,210
there should be a limit on what you 
could donate to.

3261
02:26:40,211 --> 02:26:44,350
A fucking politician should be like $100
or $1,000.

3262
02:26:44,351 --> 02:26:49,120
Let's make it $1,000 of facebook,
like whatever.

3263
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:50,193
There should be some kind of system that
says it's not fucking the coke fucking 

3264
02:26:54,041 --> 02:26:54,874
brother pumping billions into a dude.
Whether it's through into ms direction 

3265
02:27:00,970 --> 02:27:03,550
or fucking with it.
Let's keep it fucking real.

3266
02:27:03,551 --> 02:27:05,470
Man.
This is this.

3267
02:27:05,770 --> 02:27:08,500
We're getting fucked as a people.

3268
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:10,990
Hey,
I do well.

3269
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:15,490
I'm doing myself a disservice by even 
saying shit they gonna come get,

3270
02:27:15,491 --> 02:27:17,230
you know,
but I think it,

3271
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:20,320
they're going to tax me more if I,
if I keep the chicken,

3272
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:24,340
if I keep preaching the style of life,
I believe I will pay more taxes.

3273
02:27:24,341 --> 02:27:27,970
You really think that they come get you 
more to come get me.

3274
02:27:27,971 --> 02:27:30,770
You're fucking playing me like I'm dumb.
You're doing the,

3275
02:27:30,910 --> 02:27:32,410
you're doing the entertainment thing 
right now.

3276
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:34,720
I'm being so real right now,
Joe.

3277
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:38,140
Is that I'm saying they will fucking tax
me more.

3278
02:27:38,141 --> 02:27:40,720
Yes.
If the government and the way of life,

3279
02:27:40,721 --> 02:27:41,554
I think I should pay more yes.
Than the fucking person who makes 

3280
02:27:44,081 --> 02:27:46,180
$36,000 a year.
But you know what?

3281
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:48,460
If my accountant smart enough,
I don't have to.

3282
02:27:48,970 --> 02:27:50,770
That's honesty.
All right.

3283
02:27:50,890 --> 02:27:53,520
I can fucking figure out a way not to 
pay as much taxes,

3284
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:57,760
but because I have legally,
even legally or illegally,

3285
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:59,260
I'm talking about totally legally.

3286
02:27:59,650 --> 02:28:00,483
I'm talking about what your president is
pulling right now that he's never shown 

3287
02:28:03,671 --> 02:28:05,290
you his taxes.
All right?

3288
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:07,300
He's pulling the,
it's,

3289
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:11,500
you can easily skirt a lot of taxes if 
you have a little bit of information,

3290
02:28:11,710 --> 02:28:14,770
like a lot of mother fuckers are dumb 
enough to buy cars.

3291
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:17,890
All right?
I don't buy cars.

3292
02:28:17,891 --> 02:28:21,740
I'll keep it fucking real with you.
I don't buy a fucking car.

3293
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:24,080
I lease a fucking car.
You know why?

3294
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:28,280
Because it's a fucking basically almost 
a hundred percent fucking tax write off.

3295
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,560
I guarantee you bill baer bought his 
car.

3296
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:32,840
Bill Burr owns his house.
Bill,

3297
02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:33,883
I love you.
You're one of the funniest guys ever 

3298
02:28:35,721 --> 02:28:37,940
play games at tiff.
You fucking lease cars.

3299
02:28:37,941 --> 02:28:41,150
You can write off the fucking payments 
he was in front of you right now.

3300
02:28:41,151 --> 02:28:42,050
I'd be like,
fuck you.

3301
02:28:42,051 --> 02:28:43,160
I want to own it.
Good.

3302
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:44,600
Good on it.

3303
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:46,760
And then when you want a new,
I like new cars.

3304
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:49,700
So guess what?
I get a new one every fucking two years.

3305
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:52,040
Christ aggressive with this car thing.
No,

3306
02:28:52,041 --> 02:28:52,874
but what I'm saying is there's games 
that are played that you're not even 

3307
02:28:54,861 --> 02:28:57,620
tripping on because they sold you on the
opposite angle.

3308
02:28:57,710 --> 02:29:00,410
They got rappers telling you that 
fucking owning your shit out right?

3309
02:29:00,411 --> 02:29:02,410
It's perfect.
So pay $100,000 for that car,

3310
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:03,740
drive it off black,
get a dent in it.

3311
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:05,450
It's we're fucking 40 grand.
Now.

3312
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:07,100
I understand you're very passionate 
about this,

3313
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:07,934
but I could see both sides.
I could see that someone would want to 

3314
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:12,290
lease something because it'd be a nice 
tax write off,

3315
02:29:12,291 --> 02:29:16,020
especially if you're incorporated,
which I'm sure you are and I am,

3316
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:20,180
but I'll see someone who says I left 
who's got money,

3317
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:21,073
has the games down because I have the 
guys who give me the information just a 

3318
02:29:24,071 --> 02:29:27,080
lot of guys and they say,
well this off.

3319
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:30,110
No you don't have it.
Being Incorporated doesn't involve being

3320
02:29:30,111 --> 02:29:32,060
rich.
I understand that.

3321
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:33,193
Yeah,
but the fleet leasing is Nissan Sentra 

3322
02:29:35,091 --> 02:29:35,924
doesn't and he could actually 
incorporate himself and fucking write 

3323
02:29:39,111 --> 02:29:41,570
off his fucking $300 or even a month 
payment.

3324
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:42,573
Like there's ways to get yo,
there's fucking games that are being 

3325
02:29:44,781 --> 02:29:46,850
played that people don't fucking know 
about is my point.

3326
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:47,863
I understand this is a deep game.
It is going in thank games that are 

3327
02:29:50,341 --> 02:29:51,500
being played that people don't know 
about.

3328
02:29:51,501 --> 02:29:52,334
I love you.
And I feel like maybe I'm drawing as 

3329
02:29:53,031 --> 02:29:55,080
you're looking at me like I'm talking to
stupid shit.

3330
02:29:55,200 --> 02:30:00,050
Definitely drunk a little bit,
but we're bust drunk.

3331
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:01,990
Drunk.
I'd be trying to fight you joe.

3332
02:30:02,260 --> 02:30:03,081
Well,
let's not do that.

3333
02:30:03,081 --> 02:30:05,600
We're friends.
Um,

3334
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:07,050
war porn industry is,
when is it?

3335
02:30:07,051 --> 02:30:09,290
When are people gonna be able to 
download this now?

3336
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:10,190
Right now,
right?

3337
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:14,980
This second war porn industry's dot com 
war point.

3338
02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:15,943
It will,
you could probably do this show for 

3339
02:30:16,791 --> 02:30:18,860
another two hours until we both sober 
up,

3340
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:20,023
but I've got to get the fuck outta here.
So war porn industry's dot com you can 

3341
02:30:23,361 --> 02:30:25,070
get it now.
Good Dad gang.

3342
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:27,020
Good Dad gang.
You know about that,

3343
02:30:27,021 --> 02:30:28,130

3345
02:30:31,011 --> 02:30:31,900
for you.
You're going to be a,

3346
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:33,860
uh,
a fully licensed.

3347
02:30:33,890 --> 02:30:36,980
I just want some to slip in my wife when
I get pulled over by the cops.

3348
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:37,843
You're going to be so,
and you're going to be able to start 

3349
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:40,720
your own chapter.
Excellent.

3350
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:42,650
All right.

3353
02:30:45,651 --> 02:30:47,750

My man terminology,

3354
02:30:47,751 --> 02:30:48,584
who's on the war porn album?
A rapper started it as a movement for 

3355
02:30:51,411 --> 02:30:52,244
like,

3356

Good.
And I'm going to get you a bunch of 

3359
02:30:58,701 --> 02:30:59,380

02:30:59,380 --> 02:31:00,213
you can go get it all.
So a good dad gang.com I make not a 

3361
02:31:03,111 --> 02:31:05,990
goddamn thing off it.
That's a shout out to that fucking whole

3362
02:31:05,991 --> 02:31:08,060
floor shout outs.
This is insane.

3363
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:10,260
This is a record number of shout outs.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

3364
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:14,090
I hope you've enjoyed the show as much.
Am I playing myself or something joe?

3365
02:31:14,091 --> 02:31:16,840
Because you guys got to get over.
Is this just a good podcast?

3366
02:31:16,841 --> 02:31:17,720
It was fun.
Okay,

3367
02:31:17,721 --> 02:31:20,100
because you need,
and that's two things.

3368
02:31:20,101 --> 02:31:22,050
Either we did a good cop podcasts where 
it's like,

3369
02:31:22,051 --> 02:31:24,060
oh my God,
everybody has played on some this whole,

3370
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:24,933
it's a good time the whole time.
Just understand that whatever I say and 

3371
02:31:28,591 --> 02:31:33,591
whatever I do is only intended to 
express love for love for humanity.

3372
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:37,560
I don't give a fuck if you voted for 
Donald Trump.

3373
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:39,330
I don't give a fuck if you voted for 
Hillary Clinton.

3374
02:31:39,331 --> 02:31:40,164
All that political shit.
What I was trying to point out with 

3375
02:31:41,491 --> 02:31:42,810
that,
and I'll end it on this,

3376
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:47,400
is all of us are not involved in the 
game that's being played.

3377
02:31:47,401 --> 02:31:50,820
We are victims of the game is being 
played in a lot of ways and that doesn't

3378
02:31:50,821 --> 02:31:52,590
mean we can't change shoe.
There's,

3379
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:55,380
it's easily changed,
but we're told it's not easy.

3380
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:57,023
We are in a hurricane.
Get the fucking money lady texting 

3381
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:04,380
illogical brothers can't donate to a 
fucking party.

3382
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:07,890
They can affect the fucking election.
This is a hail storm.

3383
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:11,760
Some of these ideas were good.
I hope you enjoy it.

3384
02:32:11,761 --> 02:32:13,530
Good.
Some of them were buzzed,

3385
02:32:13,531 --> 02:32:16,530
some of them were fucking fun to listen 
to and entertaining.

3386
02:32:16,710 --> 02:32:19,710
I hope if you take anything out of it,
it's Jocko willink video.

3387
02:32:19,711 --> 02:32:21,420
Good.
That's it.

3388
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:25,240
No,
that's what that's going to get part.

3389
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:27,780
It's good part of this good 
inspirational thing,

3390
02:32:27,781 --> 02:32:31,230
but dude was already on the Internet.
This was brand new.

3391
02:32:31,350 --> 02:32:32,580
I'm asking him,
Jules,

3392
02:32:32,581 --> 02:32:33,870
buddy,
I love you.

3393
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:35,310
I love you.
Give you jewels.

3394
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:37,740
I agree with those.
Those jewels are powerful.

3395
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:39,480
One more war porn video.
Before we go,

3396
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:41,330
let's end it on.
I got to leave.

3397
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,150
Be Real.
I've got to eat your shit.

3398
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:44,863
Shut you down bro.
Tell people where to go and gain 40 set 

3399
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:47,821
on it.
Joe.

3400
02:32:47,821 --> 02:32:50,670
Can't do it cause I got to do ads.
Do the ads.

3401
02:32:50,671 --> 02:32:51,960
Why can't I can't.
I can't.

3402
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:53,010
Honestly,
I'm late already.

3403
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:57,910
Everlast I love you.
I love you too.

3404
02:32:57,911 --> 02:32:59,550
Yet Jamie,
I love you.

3405
02:32:59,551 --> 02:33:00,384
Joe Rogan.
