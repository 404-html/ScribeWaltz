1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
You know the background?
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,760
Eventually that's what it'll be for 
right now.

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:09,390
It's coughing.
This episode of the Joe Rogan Experience

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,700
Podcast,
I fucking center.

5
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:12,570
I set my own name.
I hate doing that.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,850
The podcast.
It's very dueschy.

7
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:19,851
When someone says their own name,
unless you really have to like someone 

8
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:20,130
asks you what your name is and you go,
my name's Joe Rogan.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,930
Then it's okay,
but if you say it,

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,530
especially if someone's tuning into a 
podcast as your name on it,

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm just trying to not be as Douchey is 
possible.

12
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,040
Folks.
It's hard.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,220
It's very hard.

flowers.

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,930
It's mother's Day freaks.
It's right around the corner.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,460
Was it the Sunday?
Yes.

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,510
It's always the Sunday,
right?

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,190
It's always on Sunday's mother's Day was
on Sunday.

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,400
Should be suck.
If your mom had mother's Day,

40
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,620
that was on Tuesday,
that would be some bullshit.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,870
Mother's deserve credit.
They deserve respect.

42
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,820
Without them,
you would not be alive.

43
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
your mother gave birth to you.

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,460
Deal with that and go to one 800

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,480
Tim Kennedy or worldly man with a shekel
worth.

47
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,980
Uh,
I have no idea.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,010
This is a shackled to dollar ratio.
I just know it has something to do with 

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,860
Jews.
You got to be careful when you shekel.

50

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,340

My mom is moving to Mexico.

69
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,100
Crazy bitch.
It's just crazy.

70
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,930
I mean bitch,
with all due respect,

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,460
I call myself a bitch.

Call everybody a bitch.
I don't really mean like a female dog or

73
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,620
a a bad person.
I mean if you're really thinking about 

74
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:44,620
moving to Mexico,
you're fucking crazy.

75
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,820

some money and hook your mom up.

If you did,

78
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,050
were also brought to you by [inaudible] 
dot com.

79
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,650
That's o n n I t official sponsor of Tim
Kennedy.

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,980
We gotta figure out a way to sponsor 
fight is actually in the UFC.

81
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,981
The UFC has a,
there's a Mussel farm monopoly right 

82
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:07,981
now.
We have to break that.

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,280
I don't care.
I wouldn't care if it was actually good 

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,300
products,
but muscle farm is not.

85
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,110
I don't think so.
I've never used it with protein powders 

86
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,740
and stuff like plastic that fills your 
stomach up.

87
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,880
I don't know what his muscle farm.
They make all the typical,

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,650
you know,
the pre workout,

89
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,330
post workouts,
proteins,

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,180
toilet stuff,
you know,

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,620
like Jack's,
your heart rate up to one 80 before your

92
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:36,640
workout and then afterwards when it 
supposedly it tastes good.

93
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,970
It's just full of sugar.
I know.

94
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,180
I've never had a good experience with a 
single muscle farm product.

95
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,110
Obviously.
I like on it.

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,220
Whoa.
Tim Kennedy just laid down the law.

97
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,940
How rude.
Um,

98
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,150
I have nothing bad to say.
I'm about farm.

99
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,600
I have no relationship with them.
I have no experience with them,

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,380
but I do have a deep,
long and storied experience with on it.

101
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,530
Uh,
our protein powder is 100 percent 

102
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,711
natural and also 100 percent sugar free.
The only sugar is one gram of sugar,

103
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:06,510
which is naturally occurring per 
serving.

104
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,910
That comes from the hemp.
I have to answer this,

105
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:13,911
I have to say this every episode,
but just because I get asked all the 

106
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:13,911
time,
if you eat him,

107
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,750
you will not test positive for 
marijuana.

108
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,840
Hemp does not have any thc in it.
But again,

109
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,840
if you read poppy seed Bagels,
you will test positive for heroin.

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,820
It sounds crazy,
but it's totally true.

111
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,090
Hemp force,
we use the finest available protein 

112
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,210
powder that we can buy,
which we have to buy from Canada because

113
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:32,970
the laws are fucking goofy in America 
and we're not allowed to grow hemp.

114
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,180
We can buy it,
but we can't support American farmers,

115
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:41,181
which drives me fucking crazy.
Hopefully laws have been changed and 

116
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:47,001
hopefully soon we will be able to 
support farmers and by our own when 

117
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:51,490
we're supporting Canadian farmers,
but we'll hopefully be able to support 

118
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,860
American farmers and maybe even get our 
own hemp farm.

119
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,490
Right now though.
It's a little too sketchy and I don't 

120
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,970
want to go to jail,
so we buy it and then we sell it.

121
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,900
We sell the best shit that we can find,
whether it's strength and conditioning 

122
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:04,980
equipment.
We sell a need,

123
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,750
just the finest kettlebells and steel 
maces and clubs,

124
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,360
weight vest.
If we find something and it's good,

125
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,830
we find something.
It's beneficial,

126
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,831
whether it's a supplement or a food.
We sell it and we try to get it at the 

127
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:21,230
most reasonable rates possible and we 
find the best quality stuff.

128
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Whatever it is,
whether it's the best quality protein 

129
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,170
powders,
where's the best quality walnut,

130
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,200
almond cashew butter,
anything we sell raw organic coconut 

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,031
oil.
We just try to sell the best shape 

132
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:37,031
available and we try to sell it to you 
as cheaply as possible.

133
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:41,030
If you use the code name Rogan,

supplements.
Tim Kennedy is here.

135
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,420
Let's cue the music.
Why fuck around

136
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,750
the Joe Rogan experience.

137
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,890
Joe Rogan podcast.
Jim Kennedy,

138
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:02,891
ladies and Gentlemen,
I've been wanting to talk to you for 

139
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:02,891
awhile.
Dude,

140
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:03,860
you're an interesting cat.
You've been around the world saying that

141
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:04,850
you laughing like you're not.

142
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,670
Nope.
No,

143
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,130
I'm not laughing that I'm,
I'm,

144
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:07,770
uh,
interesting.

145
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Uh,
but I had wanted to talk to you in the 

146
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:12,860
octagon for a really long time.
So we took a while.

147
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,750
It didn't take long time like wow,
12 years as a pro to finally get a 

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:17,750
little

149
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,270
Jill interview.
But the interview was a,

150
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,130
you couldn't ask for a better 
environment to do that first interview,

151
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,000
do it when the UFC fight for the troops,
you know,

152
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,420
to do it and do it after that 
spectacular knockout.

153
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:34,560
And that was intense man and it,
it wasn't just intense because you won.

154
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,120
What was really intense for me is,
um,

155
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,800
and I've always experienced this in 
these fights for the troops.

156
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,490
First of all,
it's great to be able to go to them and 

157
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,001
put on these fights and have them in 
these hangers and that these tight 

158
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,001
environments and just the appreciation 
and the respect that everybody has for 

159
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:57,141
the fighters is really intense.
But you eat,

160
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,210
first of all,
you being a veteran and you,

161
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,280
you being unabashed in your love for 
soldiers and your respect for your,

162
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,740
your,
your fellow military members.

163
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,010
When you got on top of that cage and 
after,

164
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:16,011
you know,
they were all cheering and you were 

165
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,011
yelling out to all those people that you
love them.

166
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,620
I mean this is all off camera,
man.

167
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,780
We'd cut to commercial and you're on top
of the cage and you're just yelling and 

168
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,520
all those people letting them know that 
you loved them.

169
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,920
That was some intense,
intense shit.

170
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,030
Yeah.
Overwhelming emotional near shutdown.

171
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,820
Yeah.
I'm walking out to the cage.

172
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,280
I see this dude.
He flies for the one 60th,

173
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,010
which is like the special forces wing of
aviation.

174
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,570
The last time I saw that dude was 
handing him my shot buddy.

175
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,830
You know,
I'm like,

176
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,660
it's a big thing in special forces 
community.

177
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:45,420
We're real tight,
you know,

178
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:50,421
like I'm handing him my brother that has
bullet holes in him and I'm a.

179
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,220
and I'm like,
I don't wanna let him go.

180
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:52,760
And he's like,
Hey,

181
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,140
I got this.
This is what I do.

182
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,340
You go do what you're supposed to do and
get back to work.

183
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,230
That was the last time I saw this dude 
was handing him my buddy on a medivac.

184
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,640
Then I'm walking out of the cage and I 
was like,

185
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Holy Shit.
There is that dude from the 68 that I 

186
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,330
handed my shot buddy to totally 
overwhelming.

187
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,690
They have to go in there and fight.
And then uh,

188
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,020
you know,
Nice.

189
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,030
Fifth Special Forces group is co located
there.

190
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,600
So I saw a bunch of dudes from like the 
Green Brae regiment.

191
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,680
That was entirely too much emotion.
I just wanted to curl up and cry.

192
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,430
Yeah,
it's a completely different kind of.

193
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,950
There's you on top of the cage up there 
in that photo.

194
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,440
That's just an intense,
intense picture.

195
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,620
That picture should be framed and on 
your wall somewhere because that is one 

196
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,921
of the greatest pictures have ever seen.
Have you could cut me out and just have 

197
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:37,921
the dudes,
Nah,

198
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:37,921
Nah,
Nah,

199
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:37,921
Nah,
Nah.

200
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,500
You need to be in there for reference.
I mean,

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,650
but that's your attitude.
What you just said,

202
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:44,800
cut me out and leave the dudes that 
there really is your attitude.

203
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:49,801
You really don't want that.
You were saying while you were up there 

204
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:52,180
that my job is,
is in here is easy.

205
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:54,310
What you guys do.
You guys are my heroes.

206
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,520
You good memory?
Yeah.

207
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,000
I remember everything.
It's disturbing.

208
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Scary.
Don't get in a fight with Joe Rogan 

209
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,580
verbally not go well for you.
I remember things well.

210
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,550
I remember important things and that was
a,

211
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:09,220
that was a deep moment.
You know,

212
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:12,910
there was um,
I wrote a thing a long time ago about,

213
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:17,911
uh,
one of the fights for the troops about 

214
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:17,911
the,
uh,

215
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:17,911
the national anthem.
And I recorded it.

216
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:20,770
I filmed it on my phone when someone was
singing the national anthem and you turn

217
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:24,640
around and you know,
I was filming the crowd while it was all

218
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:29,641
going on and the feeling the air,
the electricity in the air of hearing 

219
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,140
the national anthem while you were 
around.

220
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,470
Active duty soldiers who are in a war 
currently have had friends who had loved

221
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:42,871
ones die,
have experienced firefights have been 

222
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,650
there if comeback.
And now they're here in time off getting

223
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:47,720
to enjoy a fight.
And everyone's standing up in this whole

224
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,570
tricity in the air.
Man,

225
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:52,060
you're fucking.
EHRS are standing up on your back.

226
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,330
It's crazy.
It's,

227
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,180
it's intense.
It's intense.

228
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,000
Two totally different experience.

229
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,240
It's there.
I don't know.

230
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,110
I don't understand the whole realm 
outside of like what you can physically 

231
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,380
see,
but there is no way to describe,

232
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,450
you know,
like moments like that where you're 

233
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,631
surrounded by these heroes that these 
selfless freaking superstars of humanity

234
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,180
and um,
you know,

235
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,680
they bleed in every sense of the word 
for their country.

236
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,680
And then the national anthem,
Kamala and,

237
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,490
or the flag goes up and you see them all
and there,

238
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,520
there's,
there's this energy there that just 

239
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:28,520
can't be described.
It can only be experienced.

240
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:28,520
It's surreal,

241
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:28,710
you know,
that's the,

242
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,530
that's the really intense,
uh,

243
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,660
aspect of it is that there's,
there's a lot of resistance and blow 

244
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:41,991
back towards war and towards the 
military industrial complex and towards,

245
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,520
both of which are horrible.
Yeah.

246
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,060
But what the,
what's important is the people ever.

247
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,850
Everybody wants everything to be black 
and white and there's no black and white

248
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:55,851
in this world.
There's this gigantic of shades and 

249
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:56,770
there's.
There's positive and there's negative,

250
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,620
there's good and there's bad,
but there are real heroes in the world.

251
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm Pat Tillman is a perfect example of 
a guy who was a real hero in my opinion.

252
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,180
A guy who saw what was going on and 
said,

253
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,950
you know what?
Fuck this NFL career.

254
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,951
I don't need millions of dollars when I 
needed to do is do what's right and I 

255
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,770
need to fight for my country.
He goes over there and then when he gets

256
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:19,771
there,
he experienced chaos and nonsense and 

257
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:23,721
he's super vocal about it and completely
as is his brother and that's to me a 

258
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:27,160
perfect example of that.

259
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,610
There is no black and white.
There's a lot of.

260
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,300
There's real heroes.
There's people that have heroic content 

261
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,360
and there's people that have heroic 
ideals and they really do love and 

262
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,131
respect the idea of freedom,
but they get thrust into a situation 

263
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,620
where everything is completely out of 
control and chaotic and a garlic.

264
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,860
Pat Tillman was very vocal about it and 
well spoken,

265
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,350
very well spoken as is his brother,
you know,

266
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,310
it's,
it's a very intense thing and when,

267
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:00,520
you know,
people were anti war and you know,

268
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:00,920
it's,
it's,

269
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:04,730
it's Kinda,
it's fashionable to be anti war,

270
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:09,731
you know,
it's a thing that a lot of people put 

271
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:09,731
on,
like an outfit.

272
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:13,440
They just sort of jump into the 
sentiment that we shouldn't have a 

273
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,291
military and we shouldn't have wore.
The real problem is human beings are 

274
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,920
still animals and a lot of research,
a lot of respects,

275
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,950
a lot of senses and probably nobody 
knows that more than a guy like you 

276
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:22,950
who's been there.

277
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,780
War is horrible.
I hate war.

278
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,810
I am anti war.
I've been anti war my whole entire life 

279
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:30,810
with,
you know,

280
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,010
uncles that fought in world war two or 
in Vietnam,

281
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,060
you know,
grandparents that fought in world war 

282
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,060
two.
Um,

283
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,430
but with that position of being anti 
war,

284
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:46,951
I don't think you should be able to be 
anti war unless you understand at a 

285
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,060
fundamental level how awful and horrible
war is not.

286
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,500
That doesn't mean they have to go and 
serve.

287
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:51,300
But,
um,

288
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,260
it's necessary,
you know,

289
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:53,950
it's,
um,

290
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,280
I don't,
I wouldn't wish what I've seen in my 

291
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,280
life on my worst enemy,
you know,

292
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,650
there's no way I'd want the people.
I hate to have to see know what a little

293
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:05,290
girl looks like when she's been,
had acid thrown on her because she tried

294
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,550
to go to school.
I want that,

295
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,230
want that on my worst enemy.
But,

296
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,630
um,
there's people that do those things,

297
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,990
you know,
there's people that go and kidnap 300 

298
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,800
girls in school this week because they 
were going to school,

299
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,870
you know,
those people don't.

300
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,440
They have to answer to somebody and the 
only people they would answer to or guys

301
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:27,040
like me or guys that are better than me 
that are still doing it.

302
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,650
And uh,
and it's a necessary evil.

303
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,180
You know,
you fight fire with fire,

304
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,870
you fight evil with just a more violent,
better version of evil,

305
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,380
which is,

306
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,720
that's a crazy way to look at the world.
But in a lot of respects,

307
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,750
there's no other options.
And in some situations there are no 

308
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,261
other options unless you let evil,
overwhelming area or evil overwhelm a 

309
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:50,950
group of innocent people.
There's almost no.

310
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,100
And to denied the existence of evil is 
completely fucking ridiculous.

311
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,990
Especially if you just look at human 
history,

312
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,690
look at human history from recorded 
times,

313
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,240
from the beginning when people started 
writing things down.

314
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,160
People always did awful shit.
If they could get away

315
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,560
to get away from,
get away with it.

316
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,990
For evil to prevail all it takes us for 
good men to do nothing.

317
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:13,610
Right?
So great quote.

318
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,110
Yeah.
Just have to do something even if it's 

319
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,110
horrible.
How long were you over there for?

320
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,710
I was eight years active duty,
um,

321
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,740
special forces.
And now it's been three years as a 

322
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,870
national guardsman in special forces.
And how old are you now?

323
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,430
Thirty four.

324
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,390
So wow.
So you were really young,

325
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,420
so you're,
you're essentially like college age?

326
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Yeah,
as soon as I was in Grad school when I 

327
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,520
enlisted.
And how old were you then?

328
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,240
I was 22.
Wow.

329
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,240
So you,
you saw what was going on and you just 

330
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,700
decided that this was calling you.

331
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,310
It was a balance.
It was like the perfect storm for me,

332
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,500
for me to go in.
I was,

333
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,110
I was kind of,
this was before it.

334
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:00,280
We'll call,
we'll call it pro.

335
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:04,750
I was a pro MMA fighter and I had five 
fights as foreign one,

336
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,760
you know,
I just won this ECC,

337
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,680
50 big eight men tournament,
you know,

338
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:09,970
Jason Miller,
Dennis Kang,

339
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:10,840
myself,
we're all in it.

340
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,480
And I was the one that won it.
So like I had good promise.

341
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,920
Um,
I was a Douche bag.

342
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,950
I was a little idiot in San Luis Obispo.
We know with the entire,

343
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,550
the Mecca of fighting at the time.
I'm like worrying about what genes I was

344
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,290
going to wear to the next party,
you know,

345
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,000
like,
oh,

346
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,620
I want to with my next winnings from 
this fight,

347
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,750
I'm going to go buy these something 
stupid.

348
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,580
Did you have genes that are already 
ripped?

349
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,570
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

350
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,120
Can I pay way too much for really crappy
genes?

351
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,050
That looks cool.
Anyways,

352
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,080
so make it a lot of poor decisions.
And,

353
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:49,081
you know,
nine slash 11 happened and it was just 

354
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,230
one of those instances that's a godsend.
Divine intervention may be where you get

355
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:55,231
this extra central perspective of how 
much of an idiot you are.

356
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,770
And that's what I had.
I was like,

357
00:16:56,771 --> 00:17:01,771
God,
I am really one of the worst people on 

358
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:01,771
the planet.
Um,

359
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:01,771
you know,
not being a productive,

360
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,980
contributing member to society in any 
way,

361
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,010
just being a succubus of life.
And so I walked down after nine slash 11

362
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,890
to the recruiter's office and the pro,
I wish I could just knock on the door,

363
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:16,891
but that wasn't the issue.
The issue was that there was like a 

364
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:17,230
thousand other dudes in line ahead of me
that I wanted to do the same thing.

365
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,610
And just to give you a testament about 
how amazing the backbone of our country 

366
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:22,610
still is.

367
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,780
What was that feeling like when you 
showed up and you see a thousand other

368
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,350
that are wrapping around the supermarket
have the same mentality?

369
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,060
How humbling,
you know,

370
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,050
we're like,
again,

371
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,200
I'm still still a little fucked hard,
you know?

372
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,020
Um,
I was like,

373
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,050
thinking us,
I'm going to go enlist,

374
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:39,770
you know,
when I get down there,

375
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,510
I was like,
man,

376
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:42,950
I should've been here like five hours 
ago,

377
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,650
you know,
and uh,

378
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,880
instance after instance.
Yeah,

379
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,700
it cool.
It was amazing.

380
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:54,420
It was humbling is what it was to see 
all these dudes ahead of you that um,

381
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,010
their instant reaction,
you know,

382
00:17:56,011 --> 00:18:00,450
it wasn't a little retrospective 
perspective of like what you're doing in

383
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,320
your life.
It was like,

384
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,860
fuck this.
Those dudes just flew planes into our 

385
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:06,860
buildings.
I'm going,

386
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:06,860
you know,
that's,

387
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,980
that's what they were where I was a 
little bit late.

388
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,500
So I think just the response is 
humbling.

389
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,080
Yeah,
it's very tricky because the people that

390
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,760
flew the planes are already dead,
right?

391
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,720
So,
but the,

392
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,760
the idea that there is a faction of the 
world that's planning things along these

393
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:25,940
lines and it's willing to go to such 
extreme lengths when you,

394
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:30,941
when you see shit like that happen in 
the world and you see it from a 

395
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:36,201
perspective of an outsider versus seeing
it from a perspective of someone who's 

396
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,640
actually there and in the military,
what,

397
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,900
what is the difference?
What is the feeling like?

398
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,200
Like it's once you became active duty,
once you're there,

399
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,660
what is the difference in your 
perspective?

400
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,000
Uh,
you know,

401
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,020
nine slash 11.
I think everybody remembers exactly 

402
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,020
where they were.
You know,

403
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,280
I'm no different.
I remember the exact place that I was 

404
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,450
and exactly what I was doing.
Um,

405
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,000
you know,
and I remember my response being anger,

406
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,900
you know,
like I wanted to lash out and revenge.

407
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,470
I don't have that,
that's not in me anymore.

408
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,540
Like I don't,
I never respond that way anymore.

409
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:14,541
When I see things happen.
I almost had like this cold calculated 

410
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:14,541
response,
you know,

411
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,690
like,
um,

412
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,750
you know,
I hear about something happening and I 

413
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,930
don't want to go over with a baseball 
bat and smashed a bunch of dudes heads 

414
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:23,930
in like I did,
you know,

415
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,880
12 years ago now.
It's like when bin Laden was killed,

416
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,100
you know,
I spent some prime years of my life and 

417
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,170
mountains of Afghanistan,
Pakistan looking for that,

418
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,910
that idiot.
And um,

419
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,980
and then navy seals go in and get them,
you know,

420
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:39,270
and I was like,
Dang,

421
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,790
I missed it.
You know,

422
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,120
I was kind of sad.
I wasn't mad.

423
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,440
I wasn't angry.
I didn't want to be there.

424
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:44,850
I don't want to shoot it myself.
But I was like,

425
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,310
Oh man,
you didn't want to shoot them yourself.

426
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,100
I'm not,
I would love to have shot him myself,

427
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,060
but I wasn't mad that I didn't get to,
which was my response,

428
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,080
you know,
11,

429
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:58,920
12 years ago just calculated like,
ah,

430
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,330
man,
that whole event was one of the biggest,

431
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,090
like what do you think really happened?

432
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Conspiracies online when they didn't 
show the body and they threw it in the 

433
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,141
ocean.
And the whole idea that he was going to 

434
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:15,330
be a martyr like that was so perplexing 
to me.

435
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,790
The whole thing was so completely 
perplexing to me.

436
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,430
Like why wouldn't you just show his body
like,

437
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:21,960
can we,
can we take a look?

438
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,140
The whole world wants to see the bad guy
when you,

439
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,810
when you just historically through the 
course of this war,

440
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,970
when we've done it on numerous 
instances,

441
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,680
whether it's Saddam hanging or Zarqawi 
and it's blown up body.

442
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,470
Like some.
I was involved with someone I wasn't.

443
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,750
It's been,
it's been very clear the response by the

444
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,450
fanatic side when they see the body,
you know,

445
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,950
maybe that person becomes a martyr,

446
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,010
you know,
and then then he's like idolized for 

447
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,220
years or maybe it just incites and 
immediate riot.

448
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,170
So yeah,
it sucks.

449
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,580
We want to have that justice feeling of 
like the conclusion that,

450
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,180
you know,
like the finale of like,

451
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,130
ah,
there's been lot and he's dead.

452
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,170
Look at that point.
The beard of his.

453
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,860
That's definitely him.
Alright,

454
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,050
we can sleep at night.
You know,

455
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,120
the Boogeyman bin Ladin it's not under 
the bed.

456
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,690
But had they done that,
the repercussions would have been so 

457
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,600
much more severe with riots and 
possibly,

458
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,280
you know,
a longstanding martyrdom.

459
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,290
So I don't know.
Yeah,

460
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,850
I know what you're saying.
Shades of gray,

461
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,170
like you said,
it sucks.

462
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,180
Yeah,
I'm selfish.

463
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,070
Yeah.
I want to see the dead body.

464
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,660
And plus I don't totally believe 
everything they say.

465
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,830
So you know,
when you,

466
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,350
when you talked to high ranking,
military guys would say,

467
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:36,610
that guy's been dead forever.

468
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,610
He's been dead a long time ago.
That was another part of the conspiracy 

469
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,810
guys that were in the know is saying,
I think that guy was dead already.

470
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,770
There's no way that he's still alive 
because we've probably killed him like 

471
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,330
10 times now.
So whether this was the final version of

472
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:54,580
him or the 10th,
it's irrelevant.

473
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,520
All versions have been loud and her 
dead.

474
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,550
Yeah.
He's not Jason.

475
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm going to pop up out of the ocean the
11th time.

476
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,040
Swim to shore.
A to bitch.

477
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,990
Yeah.
Let's start from scratch.

478
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,470
The idea is a terrifying to us,
like fanatical religious fundamentalists

479
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,080
that are willing to die is terrifying 
for a good reason.

480
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,190
It's one of the worst aspects of human 
beings is that we can talk people and to

481
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:23,191
believe in some completely ridiculous 
shit and talk them into believing it so 

482
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:25,030
much so that they're willing to kill 
themselves and we all.

483
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,650
The other problem with human beings is 
that once a guy gets that far,

484
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,170
once it got once a human man,
woman,

485
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,610
whatever it was that far gone,
how do you bring it back?

486
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:39,611
I don't.
I have a friend who has adopted a child 

487
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,020
and I'm.
The kid was a,

488
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,080
I think she was probably three when they
adopted her and she's six now and the 

489
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,280
poor kid's a mess,
you know?

490
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:53,281
And they really worried.
They don't know what she experienced a 

491
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,741
lot of abuse before they ever got to her
and now she's six years old and they're 

492
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,950
just trying to wrangle her and educator 
and give her love and give her.

493
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,640
But they were like,
God damn,

494
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:02,920
if we just got there sooner,
that's the idea.

495
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,190
You're talking about three years old,
you know,

496
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:09,930
get some guy who's fucking 30 and he's 
all.

497
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,740
I walk by all day,
you know,

498
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,720
bowing and ready to be a martyr,
and it's fucking.

499
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,130
It's impossible to change the course of 
that sort of ideology.

500
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,860
Yeah.
I have no idea how,

501
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,590
if you're smart,
ecstasy,

502
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,740
mushrooms,
isolation,

503
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,120
reprogramming some of the solution was 
way easier.

504
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,890
I'm definitely more repercussions.
Yeah.

505
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:39,720
Well,
you know what?

506
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,590
We're all going to live.
We're all going to die.

507
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,680
And you gotta pull weeds out of a 
garden.

508
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,430
Sometimes.
That's just the reality

509
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,430
of the situation.
The idea of equating a human being like 

510
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,460
a weed.
It's pretty gross,

511
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,760
but it's just a bad analogy.
We're not all flowers.

512
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Yeah.
I don't think you're a flower a.

513
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,690
no,
I don't think I'm a flower.

514
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,030
I'm a vegetable.
Some sort of.

515
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,310
I'm already choke.
I have.

516
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:07,040
Layers are great.
I love artichokes.

517
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,810
I'm like a pineapple.
I'm rough on the outside,

518
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:12,920
but inside I'm delicious,
but the core is really hard as well.

519
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,960
So.
Yeah.

520
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,700
Well,
and it's you deep inside.

521
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:19,160
I'm very fibrous.
Once he gets good metaphor.

522
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,870
I like it.
Um,

523
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,980
so you were over there and uh,
you continued your mixed martial arts 

524
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,040
training while you were over there as 
well.

525
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,270
Yeah.
Special Forces as a whole.

526
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,370
Like there's the expectation that all of
us are just good fighters.

527
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:39,930
Like we're just born bad asses that 
obviously this is not the case,

528
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,070
right?
Nobody is.

529
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,670
So we train,
you know,

530
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,840
we shoot all day long and morning and 
night.

531
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:49,880
We fight know,
usually pet is some form of Jujitsu,

532
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,870
boxing,
wrestling,

533
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,470
kickboxing,
hand to hand combat,

534
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:56,670
small arms and then evening is more 
recreational.

535
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,050
You know,
after you get back from the rain show,

536
00:24:58,051 --> 00:24:59,040
you get up,
you work out,

537
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,380
then you go to the range and shoot for,
you know,

538
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,370
three,
four hours,

539
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:03,360
go back,
clean the guns,

540
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:04,920
and then your evening is usually on the 
mat.

541
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,310
That's Monday through Thursday.
Friday is you're trying to fix whatever 

542
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,310
you broke during the week.

543
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,990
That's the week.
So do you guys,

544
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,870
when,
when they set up training for you,

545
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:19,260
whether it's physical martial arts 
training or fitness training,

546
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,850
as is their instructors who are,
who set a program for you?

547
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:24,840
Like how does,
how does it work?

548
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,000
So sometimes you bring in experts,
you know,

549
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,900
hoists Gracie came in,
trained us,

550
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,130
I can't,
countless times,

551
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,650
you know,
Greg Jackson comes out still,

552
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,830
um,
you know,

553
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,910
guys like,
uh,

554
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,550
I'm Greg Thompson,
you know,

555
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,000
he's a hoist black belt.
He's there permanently.

556
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:48,001
So there there's permanent fixtures at 
the special forces installations that 

557
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:51,640
train guys on a daily basis and they 
have relationships to bring in experts.

558
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,650
Um,
obviously you know,

559
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,770
what you do in a house when to blow a 
door in,

560
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,530
when you're going inside on kill.
Capture mission is different than you're

561
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:04,531
going to do in the cage.
So it has to be guys that can adapt 

562
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:05,260
whatever they're teaching or know what 
their limitations are.

563
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,970
You know,
Greg Jackson doesn't go in there and,

564
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,520
and try to teach knife fighting,
you know,

565
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,140
he knows what his left and right limits 
are,

566
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:11,740
but he comes,
you know,

567
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:13,300
he's one of the best.
So he comes in and gives,

568
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,190
gives the best instruction that he can 
to try to provide tools for,

569
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,520
for guys to be better at what they do.
You train a lot down there in 

570
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Albuquerque?
I do,

571
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,900
yeah.
He's a fascinating guy.

572
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,490
He is,
he is a cool cat.

573
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,120
He's a one of a very unique dude,
like really humble,

574
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:33,121
like really humble.
Like there's a lot of people that 

575
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:33,170
pretend to be humble,
but if you took away Adam,

576
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,610
you pick away at them and you find some 
bullshit.

577
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,580
It's just putting on a.
Now he's humble to a fault to a fault.

578
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:39,360
Yeah.
How so?

579
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,790
Um,
he and Winkeljohn I say humble to a 

580
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,431
fault where they have a,
they have all these things to give.

581
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,520
They're the best that there has ever 
been on coaching staff.

582
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,450
The train more champions.
They have the best stable of fighters on

583
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:02,451
the planet arguably.
And they're still training guys,

584
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,060
you know,
and it's not been designed and this is 

585
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,981
just out of like a almost necessity at 
this scary staff now.

586
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:11,670
It's not even scared.
I don't know.

587
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,330
I'm out of a Bar,
barn warehouse,

588
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,250
industrial,
commercial,

589
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,510
ghetto building,
you know,

590
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,520
like where I can walk out the door and 
score some meth as fast as I can come 

591
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,160
inside and get around with John Jones,
you know,

592
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:27,440
those are my options.
Front door parking lot.

593
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,150
Get some meth.
Come in.

594
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,290
It's that bad.
A neighborhood.

595
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,550
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

596
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,460
Yeah.
You ever see is the outside?

597
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,250
Yeah.
No,

598
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,030
no.
Jackson winkeljohn driving down central.

599
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:43,031
It's like you can count anywhere from 
four to eight transvestites any given 

600
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,540
morning and then variety of.
Yeah,

601
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,300
there's a,
there's a famous one named grace.

602
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:52,301
She's this beautiful black girl that 
wears this huge wig and she's like four 

603
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:54,500
or five inches taller than I am and 
probably 50 pounds bigger than I am.

604
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,340
Whoa.
Yeah.

605
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,170
And,
but it's,

606
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:59,180
you know,
he bring her in.

607
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,210
I know she's amazing.
Scary guy can bring her in and every 

608
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:05,630
corner is like,
oh,

609
00:28:05,631 --> 00:28:07,730
there's that drug dealer,
there's this drug dealer.

610
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,900
And then you're like,
wait,

611
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,820
is that the guy from breaking bad?
No.

612
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,010
Maybe it is.
Is He really selling meth?

613
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,850
And then the irony is there.
No,

614
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,910
that is not the guy from breaking bad,
but he's really selling meth and he's 

615
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:19,910
dressed like the guy from breaking bad.
Wow.

616
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,900
Yeah.
That is what it's like.

617
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,840
They're albuquerque is a weird spot.
It is cookie.

618
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,870
Why do they stay?
It's just because the gyms there and 

619
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,870
yeah.
Good.

620
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,621
Stable of tough guys there.
I mean I would love it if Mike 

621
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:32,621
Winkeljohn,
Greg Jackson,

622
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:33,650
you know,
let's say we're in Austin,

623
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Texas or la or San Louis Obispo,
but they're in Albuquerque,

624
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,470
New Mexico,
so that's where I go.

625
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,180
If they're in Idaho,
that's where I would go,

626
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:49,181
but that's where they are.
So you're trained in Austin during your 

627
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:49,181
time in between fights?
Yes.

628
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:49,181
How do you,
uh,

629
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:50,510
how do you like plan out?

630
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,950
Like,
like when,

631
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,650
like how many weeks do you give yourself
when you go to albuquerque?

632
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,950
I get six weeks.
Six good weeks and Albuquerque,

633
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,480
um,
so,

634
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,710
you know,
hopefully you'll get 10 week heads up,

635
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,060
heads up to your fight.
So then I have four weeks to start doing

636
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:09,980
pre fight camp,
develop like strength,

637
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,580
speed,
explosion type physical stuff,

638
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:18,581
working on specific techniques and then 
moved to albuquerque for the six weeks 

639
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:21,020
for the kind of final fight.
Can you train it?

640
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:23,810
A great spot in Austin too.
I was down there.

641
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,870
I'm really recently and I met the owner 
of that facility with what's that got 

642
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,870
stolen?
Parks and polio.

643
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,980
Brandao yeah.
Great facility.

644
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,090
Amazing.
Yeah.

645
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,510
Really Nice guys too.
Yep.

646
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,860
And um,
so you do just all your most inbetween 

647
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,400
fight preparation.
They're good group of fighters out there

648
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:41,070
as well.
Yeah.

649
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:46,290
Side Austin elite.
Justin Lake was my strength and 

650
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:46,290
conditioning coach.

651
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:46,600
He's like my brother on a whole bunch of
different levels.

652
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,410
He married my sister or my,
um,

653
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,440
my wife's sister,
um,

654
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,050
where you used to go to college 
together.

655
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,080
We used to hang out with the same girls 
together and then we enlisted together.

656
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:00,960
He went to special forces.
We went to some group together,

657
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,430
went to Afghanistan together and then he
married my sister in law.

658
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,480
He might be stocking,
you know,

659
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,580
I hope not because he's like 200 pounds.
The snatches 250 pounds dead lift,

660
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,100
500 pounds.
It would be a bad thing if he was 

661
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,100
stalking me.
Does.

662
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,170
Is he finding his.
He do,

663
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,070
man.
No,

664
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,510
just trains.
Just trains.

665
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,650
Yeah.
There's a lot of those dudes that are 

666
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,080
scary that just trying to please,
please don't ever get mad at me,

667
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,060
tear my limbs off and beat me.
How did you get hooked up with a Jackson

668
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,900
Winkeljohn?
When I,

669
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,740
when I lost the strikeforce title to 
Jacques Rey,

670
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,180
um,
it was,

671
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,700
it was a really close fight,
very close fight.

672
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,090
I thought you won.
I thought I did too,

673
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,630
but it was close and there was just 
small adjustments I needed to make and 

674
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,980
adjustments that w that I wasn't making 
on my own.

675
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,570
I needed somebody that was smarter than 
me to tell me what those were and how 

676
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,330
to,
and how to prepare for them.

677
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,670
Um,
you know,

678
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,730
so since then,
um,

679
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,560
what seven and one since I went there,

680
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,410
you Jackson is an interesting guy in 
that he didn't have any professional mma

681
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:06,800
fights,
but he's a virtuoso.

682
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,870
I mean he really is like,
I've had long conversations with him 

683
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,630
about strategy and weird shit about 
music,

684
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,650
about how,
you know,

685
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,730
he listens to symphonies and compares 
the rhythm of symphonies to the,

686
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,660
the,
the changing rhythm of a fight.

687
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,030
He looks at everything as strategy,
whether it's like he's playing lemmings,

688
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,110
like the old school lemmings,
you know,

689
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,870
or is that,
I don't even know what that is.

690
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Oh,
it's a video game where you like move 

691
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,030
lemmings to certain portions of the map 
to try to achieve some stupid 

692
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,340
engineering goal.
Um,

693
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,400
it's very like archaic,
like 16 bit game from like almost 

694
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,650
commodore 64 type things.
Right?

695
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,830
Like he still plays stat.
Not often,

696
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,660
but he's like,
you know,

697
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,150
everything has strategy,
whether it's chess or backgammon,

698
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,180
you know,
or if he's like playing monopoly with a 

699
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,180
family,
you know,

700
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,670
it's like everything's about strategy.
Nope.

701
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,760
We had a conversation with my friend 
Ari,

702
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,390
my friend Ari Shaffir has a podcast 
called the skeptic tank and our,

703
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,970
he's a really smart dude and him and 
Greg Jackson.

704
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:10,900
Greg was his guest and Greg was like 
picking his brain about the comparisons,

705
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:16,030
like trying to figure out how one crafts
a piece of comedy and like tries to 

706
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,820
attack an audience with it.
Like how you,

707
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,650
how you get an idea past the boundaries 
of someone's consciousness.

708
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,050
Could that be adaptive?
Yeah.

709
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,600
When you're talking to this audience,
you already have the template of what 

710
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,150
you're trying to get to them,
but then your response,

711
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,720
their responsiveness,
can you,

712
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,790
can it change?
Like I envisioned that is exactly 

713
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:36,790
something that Greg would do.

714
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:36,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

715
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,900
It's fascinating to listen to,
to his,

716
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,980
his mind because

717
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,490
I don't know anybody like him.
It's a very unique sort of a mindset.

718
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,120
And then Winkeljohn who's a great 
striking coach was a great kick boxer 

719
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,120
himself.
You know,

720
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
he's an interesting guy too.

721
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,320
Yeah.
He's like the Yin to the Yang with Greg,

722
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:53,830
you know,
he's,

723
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,180
he's a linear thinker,
you know,

724
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:59,750
he's um,
he knows what you like,

725
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:03,040
what Greg wants you to paint the best 
version of yourself.

726
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:08,250
I'm winkle.
John doesn't have that kind of 

727
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,180
responsive approach to you.
He knows what you need to do to be 

728
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,180
better,
you know,

729
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,050
and he says,
this is what you should do to be better.

730
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:16,780
And this is what we're going to drill it
relentlessly until your,

731
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,830
you know,
Greg's like,

732
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,920
all right,
like I want to see you develop this.

733
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:24,430
Let me give you some tools so you can 
implement this in your fighting style.

734
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,790
And it's going to be adaptive to every 
single different athletes that he has 

735
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:29,790
where winkle.
John's like,

736
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:29,790
no,
this is what you need to do.

737
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,640
And this is how we're going to do it.
You're like,

738
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,290
yes sir,
please don't hurt me.

739
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:37,430
You know what I do?
I look at what do I look at for folks 

740
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,480
who don't know,
he lost an eye in training.

741
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,830
Uh,
someone,

742
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,970
uh,
they threw a kick and the toenail missed

743
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,060
the pad and caught his eyeball,
which is the first I've ever heard of 

744
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,100
that happening.
However,

745
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,980
I've heard of guys getting scratched 
badly and training from sparring,

746
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:56,981
but never from holding pads.
He wears safety glasses every time he 

747
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,140
holds.
Now we asked him,

748
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,130
can you see anything out of that other?
No,

749
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,600
definitely not.
No.

750
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,230
That the,
the.

751
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,150
I like poured out of his face.
He was like,

752
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,040
that's.
That was my,

753
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,400
I fuck.
Safety tracks your toenails bitches.

754
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Seriously?
Do I get on the mat fingernails and 

755
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:15,520
toenails and hygiene.
Like,

756
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,460
no,
I'm not rolling with you.

757
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,040
Go clean herself and trim that stuff.
Yeah.

758
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:23,990
I got one of the nastiest infections 
once from a guy peeling my hooks off and

759
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,820
he had just giant fingernails.

760
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,190
Like I brought it out to the class.
I'm like,

761
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,540
come here folks,
look at this.

762
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,590
You can have,
this is you're going to fuck everybody.

763
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,060
It's not going to make you better 
fighter.

764
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,300
We can't have this toenail clippers in 
my Jujitsu bag,

765
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,450
belt headgear,
mouthpiece,

766
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,900
toenail clippers,
and file them bitches to cut them.

767
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,450
And then there's rough edges.
File those bitches down.

768
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:52,930
Yeah.
When you see guys like about to go into 

769
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,881
the cage,
and herb dean would look at their nails 

770
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:54,881
and then they're like,
they bite.

771
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:54,881
I'm like,
no,

772
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:57,560
this is not the time for that.
You don't bite them down.

773
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:59,210
Now you should have done that already.

774
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,900
Then you come home and your wife's like,
why do you have scratches all over you?

775
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:03,200
You're like,

776
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I fight for a living.
That's hilarious.

777
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,610
Why are they on your back?
Because someone who's fucking scratching

778
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:18,380
my back.
I didn't want them to the moon.

779
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,390
Scratches o Tim.
Oh,

780
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,710
more.
More?

781
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,840
Yeah.
Not Good.

782
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,510
Um,
is there a solution for fucking it pokes

783
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,360
gloves?
What?

784
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,370
What should be done?
Heaven forbid we ever say that anything 

785
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:36,920
was done better and pride.
Their gloves are,

786
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,940
they're better,
right?

787
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,210
They're better.
They're curved.

788
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,840
Got like how many guys right now do you 
see with broken hands?

789
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,400
A lot.
It's like tons of them.

790
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,510
So we have this padding on the two 
thirds of our hands.

791
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:53,511
Right?
Well that's not where we break our 

792
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:53,511
hands.
We break her hands in the metacarpals in

793
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:54,080
the back of the wrist or just above the 
wrist of the bottom.

794
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,410
Your hand pride gloves had padding there
which provided support.

795
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,840
So it's a lot harder to break your 
hands.

796
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:06,090
There are also,
the pattern was curved so it was 

797
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,090
actually actually had to straighten 
your.

798
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,400
I'm a grappler obviously,
you know,

799
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:12,401
like I like to grapple.
So as a grappler I could complain that 

800
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:15,180
like I want to have the total use of my 
extremities.

801
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,890
Right?
No gloves would be better for most 

802
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:20,890
grappler.
Yeah,

803
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,220
absolutely.
You could slide things in better you.

804
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,970
I said I don't want to get poked in the 
eye.

805
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,210
So the pride gloves,
that's how we make them better.

806
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Yeah.
Why we own pride the UFC owns and just 

807
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,380
take the word slide off of it and then 
put those three letters on there.

808
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,040
Bam.
Yeah.

809
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,380
They brought some new glove and they're 
like,

810
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:38,120
here's the new glove,
and I put it on.

811
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:38,600
It was like,
why?

812
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:41,720
What the fuck is the difference?
It's just slightly curved,

813
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,150
like these bitches should be like really
curved,

814
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,180
like whereas if you want to do that,
it said an effort and when you relax it 

815
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,710
goes right back to that.
The effort is for 15 to 25 minutes.

816
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,910
Like I'm sure my hand is strong enough 
to go like that when I need it to for 15

817
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:56,750
to 25 minutes.

818
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:00,110
Well I mean as long as you can do it 
when certain situations like,

819
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,910
you know,
you try and apply a choke or something,

820
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:06,911
but it's very disheartening to me.
All the people that are having detached 

821
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:10,320
retinas and Alan Belcher's was fucked up
my.

822
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,600
I mean bisping bisping Xyz off looked at
him in the eye when we were like,

823
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,080
well he's an oil in the oil and is high.
Right?

824
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

825
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,100
I don't know what he can see out of it 
or what it looks like.

826
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:24,440
I mean,
I guess it's diminished in some respect.

827
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,240
Has to be.
Yeah.

828
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:28,610
It's so fucking weird and he's had a 
couple of surgeries,

829
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:30,440
right?
Bisping's had more than one ice surgery.

830
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,910
It's fucking crazy,
man.

831
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,640
I don't want them there.
I need them.

832
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,210
Is it possible to do something where the
fingers aren't exposed,

833
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,810
like chop them off?
No,

834
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,280
no,
no.

835
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,610
I'm talking about like covering like 
what I was thinking of is like a,

836
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,270
like a lamb skin sort of uncovering 
something is not thick,

837
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:51,080
but like maybe like a band around the 
tips where you,

838
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,660
you don't really do this ever anyway.

839
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Know do you?
When do you do that body lock takedown 

840
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:58,960
of stuff?
You grabbed like this?

841
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,450
No,
no,

842
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,360
no,
but you do this.

843
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,250
You still have this or this.
I don't know.

844
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,730
I mean,
do you mostly do this?

845
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,750
Let's design it.
Okay,

846
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,790
well I'm saying what I'm for folks who 
are listening,

847
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,970
there's a thing called the gable grip 
and with the way a gable grip works is 

848
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:16,960
picture your hand.
If you're going to karate chop someone 

849
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,941
in your fingers.
Your thumb was pressed tightly against 

850
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:21,711
society or hand.
Then have your hands like in across 

851
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:25,780
position where one,
one sideways and one is a sitting 

852
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,990
straight up and then crushed down with 
your hands,

853
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,610
with your,
with your fingertips.

854
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,890
That would be what a gable grip is like 
and that is the majority of wrestling of

855
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,040
grabbing.
When you you sent around the

856
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,040
waist,
that's most of the way you grabbed the 

857
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
other way would be an escrip,
which is you would make like an like 69,

858
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,220
69.
That's it.

859
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,940
Ian and Yang.
If you're more uncouth or couth and you,

860
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,120
you grabbed like that,
but you never very rarely do you do 

861
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,771
this.
Very rarely do you let your fingers 

862
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:55,771
intersect with each other.
So it just doesn't.

863
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:59,230
They don't have to be free like that.
And when they're free,

864
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,640
that's when fingers go and eyeballs.
You know,

865
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,650
I thought maybe like maybe there could 
be some sort of a flexible rounded 

866
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,930
covering which would eliminate.
Seems like they've had to have tried it,

867
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,460
you know?
I don't think they have.

868
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,030
Let's give it a whirl.
It's,

869
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,850
it's amazing to me how things just stay 
stagnant when they're retarded.

870
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Like when they don't,
they don't make any sense like these 

871
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,180
gloves.
So 12 to six elbow.

872
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,900
I love those.
Why can't we do those?

873
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,850
This should be at ease to the ground.
Yeah.

874
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:32,020
Well you telling me you can kick someone
in the head with your Shin,

875
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,810
but you can't drop an elbow down your 
head.

876
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,240
Someone has never been kicked in the 
head with a shin.

877
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Obviously.
That's the only reason why you would 

878
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,340
make that really think John Mccain for 
this one,

879
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,340
wasn't it?
That like that.

880
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,950
That era was that era according to John 
Mccarthy who was there when it was all 

881
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,750
going on.
John McCarthy,

882
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,360
famous referee,
the gold standard.

883
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,770
That guy,
great guy.

884
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,890
Big John told me that they were having 
this meeting with the athletic 

885
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,100
commission and they had seen like karate
brick breaking demonstrations on espn at

886
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:05,101
like 2:00
in the morning and the board's shatter 

887
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:08,791
and everything.
Well they said you can't do that move 

888
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:09,250
because that move could kill someone.
Yeah.

889
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,310
If you can break bricks,
you can obviously break somebody's neck.

890
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,660
Exactly.
And just blow.

891
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,780
This is the real reason why the 12 to 
six elbow is illegal,

892
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,860
but arguably this elbow is stronger.
Definitely.

893
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,690
It's got more,
more torque to it.

894
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,130
It's a more natural movement of the 
body.

895
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,650
This is an awkward movement in 
comparison.

896
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,020
Yeah,
but I mean the Cobra Kai,

897
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,200
Daniel's son watched those guys breaking
boards.

898
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Yeah.
It's tough to argue with that kind of 

899
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,631
logic.
That is the logic that literally is 

900
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:42,631
complete pure ignorance.
If you.

901
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:46,360
If you asked like mixed martial arts,
a competitor's trainers,

902
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,490
fighters,
people in the know and as them,

903
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:53,491
which would be illegal,
the 12 slash six elbow is not going to 

904
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:53,491
be on that list.
No where near.

905
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:54,550
It's a fine.
It's a.

906
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:59,590
it's a good technique.
It's excellent as our knees on the 

907
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,490
ground.
I think knees on the ground and it could

908
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,480
be,
you know,

909
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:03,880
if,
if someone wanted to have some sort of a

910
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,910
compromise,
maybe it would be knees on the ground 

911
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:08,910
when you're not pressed up against the 
cage.

912
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,370
That could be a possibility.
You know,

913
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,490
the idea being that the niece of the 
head on the ground would be problematic 

914
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,831
against the cage because the guy 
couldn't move and that was one of the 

915
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:21,280
good things about pride was the ropes.
If soccer kicks and all those things,

916
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:24,250
you can kind of scoot your head under 
the ropes to get away from things you're

917
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:29,251
not,
you're not contained by your 

918
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,141
environment.
And to the point where you would suffer 

919
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:32,650
a damaging blow that you could have 
avoided by your own power.

920
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,900
I mean,
outside of like

921
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,550
the north south 69 position for knees to
the head on the ground.

922
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,940
That's the only position I could think,
you know,

923
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,990
like obviously the limitation is you 
still can't strike to the top of the 

924
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,591
head or the back of the head with a knee
and that under that premise then it 

925
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:48,170
doesn't really matter.
Um,

926
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,330
we need somebody from.
Because you can't hurt them any worse 

927
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,650
than you could in any other way with any
other strike from any other position.

928
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,250
So yeah,
and also I don't like this thing that 

929
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,190
guys are doing with a drop one hand down
to avoid.

930
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,800
But they had and they picked it up,
drop it down like,

931
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:04,420
oh,
let's game.

932
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,170
Play this down,
down,

933
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,850
down.
Don't need me.

934
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,830
Yeah,
I'm up.

935
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,620
Well,
it's,

936
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,720
it's very,
very weird.

937
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,780
It's just a,
it's a weird gray area that I think 

938
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:16,780
needs to be sat down.

939
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,970
And then of course there's the scoring 
system which is adopted from boxing this

940
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,230
10 point scoring system,
which is just terrible.

941
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:29,010
And the implementation of it is even 
more terrible because very few 10,

942
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,410
eight rounds get scored.
Yeah.

943
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,120
I mean I've rarely.
There's 10,

944
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:34,730
nine rounds that are squeakers,
right?

945
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:36,090
Like maybe one of your rounds with 
Jacques,

946
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,980
right?
Might've been at 10,

947
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,990
nine round and then there's 10,
nine rounds where a guy just gets 

948
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,670
fucking molly [inaudible] dropped to 
three times 10,

949
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,090
nine round.
Like how is that possible?

950
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,600
It's a terrible system and I don't know 
if you ever saw doc Hamilton's scoring 

951
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,950
system.
He had a half point scoring system,

952
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:56,780
which is much more better.
Way Better.

953
00:42:56,781 --> 00:43:01,250
I would want doc Hamilton's and to know 
what the scores are every road.

954
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,200
I agree 100 percent.
I agree.

955
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,210
Every other fucking game,
whether it's football,

956
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:06,560
basketball,
everything else.

957
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,300
I think it should be that way in boxing 
too.

958
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:11,990
So it would discourage shitty judges 
from continuing their.

959
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:16,991
Their shittiness Yup.
And shitty fighters from continuing 

960
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:16,991
their shittiness.
Yes.

961
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:21,580
You know,
the only real worry would be that guy 

962
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:21,920
would be so far ahead that he would run 
in the last round.

963
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:24,830
He's up for rounds.
John Jones move into fifth round against

964
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:26,930
glover was like,
alright,

965
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,020
I have this,
but a guy like John wouldn't do that 

966
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,020
anyway.
Yeah.

967
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,490
The great fighters would still fight the
same and that not only that,

968
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:39,491
the other guy is going to get more 
desperate so it'll make it even more 

969
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,100
exciting because he's going to have to.
And if he doesn't like,

970
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,570
well,
will you not trying to win.

971
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,280
Like you know,
you're not going to win a decision,

972
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:48,281
so either you just fucking throw caution
to the wind and throw yourself in the 

973
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:49,130
line of fire or why you fighting.

974
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,390
Move on.
Yeah.

975
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:53,840
Move on.
John Jones is a fucking phenomenon,

976
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:56,180
man.
That dude is good.

977
00:43:56,181 --> 00:44:00,570
As he has looked in the past,
the fight against glover was just,

978
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,400
just sensation was masterful.
It was like,

979
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,850
it was something to behold.
I was like,

980
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,670
he's amazing to the gym.
He's,

981
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,040
I mean,
he's so talented in every respect,

982
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:15,041
you know,
like even I've been doing Jujitsu for 

983
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:15,041
forever and he's good.
He's really,

984
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:19,841
really good.
And then like stand up as a whole 

985
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:19,841
different world.
His wrestling is just out of this world,

986
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:24,281
like,
and then he goes on game day on fight 

987
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:25,370
day and he's better.
He improvises today.

988
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,330
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

989
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:31,331
When,
when I asked him about the elbows in 

990
00:44:31,331 --> 00:44:32,130
tight,
like fighting glover against the cage

991
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,190
like that,
I knew I just had a fucking feeling that

992
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,660
he was improvising,
that I was like,

993
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:38,280
is this something you planned as like,
no,

994
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,830
I just felt it.
He was winding up and I just felt like I

995
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,580
could get away with that.

996
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:47,670
Uh,
we're in fight camp are the exact same 

997
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,670
time I fought one week before him and 
uh,

998
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,500
he did drill those,
you know,

999
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,470
like we're watching out for glover's big
overhand.

1000
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:52,060
Right.
You know,

1001
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,130
obviously we're looking for the two big,
the two,

1002
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:57,350
three punch combos that he doesn't,
entrances,

1003
00:44:57,351 --> 00:44:58,520
you know,
watching of course for her,

1004
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,350
for glover's wrestling,
he's a beast on top.

1005
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Um,
and then you watched the fight and 

1006
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,530
you're like,
he didn't do that stuff in fight camp.

1007
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,710
He just fight night,
started improvising and destroying the 

1008
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,330
still number two dude on the planet.
So decisive leader.

1009
00:45:14,331 --> 00:45:16,150
It's disturbing.
He also added in

1010
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,730
new thing to his game that I think 
you're gonna.

1011
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,270
See a lot of people do.
That's,

1012
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:21,770
that attacking the shoulder with that 
loose underhook.

1013
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,270
When a guy has that relax under hook and
you yank that arm up,

1014
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,500
me,
he fucked glover shoulder up in the 

1015
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:30,500
first one

1016
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:30,500
round.
Never really recovered.

1017
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,020
Oh,
it changed the whole feeling of what 

1018
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,020
glover could do offensively from that 
point forward.

1019
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,250
Yeah.
He,

1020
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,260
he was mangled and now you know,
his Labor was towards the surgery and 

1021
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,520
surgery.
Yeah.

1022
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:45,060
Yeah.
John's done a lot of things that a lot 

1023
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,970
of people implement now.
The front leg side kick to the thigh and

1024
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,210
it was very few people doing that before
him.

1025
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:53,310
Everybody does it.
He's got to watch the finger pokes 

1026
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:53,310
though,
man.

1027
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,880
John has always doing that thing where 
it's extending his hands and you guys 

1028
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,200
trying to move forward.
They wind up running into his fingers 

1029
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,200
all the time.

1030
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,990
Yeah,
I really do believe I hate finger pokes 

1031
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,340
knee to the groin when guys get tired,
cage grabbing like don't like it at all.

1032
00:46:09,341 --> 00:46:11,050
So He's a teammate.
Um,

1033
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,530
I really do believe that he doesn't 
intend to hit them in the eyes.

1034
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,900
He likes controlling range and he has an
open hand out,

1035
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,920
you know,
to try to set that range and to,

1036
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,390
and responsively counter attack and just
like you said,

1037
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,470
guys just run into it,
you know,

1038
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:31,471
he's not trying to poke him,
but it's his fault because his hands 

1039
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:31,510
open and his fingers are freaking 
pointing up there.

1040
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:36,630
Yeah.
I don't think he's doing an 

1041
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,630
intentionally either,
but it is an issue.

1042
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,630
Has to change.

1043
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,100
It happened with Gustafson and half,
one glover,

1044
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,140
you know,
it's um,

1045
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:43,510
it's a very,
it's a very tricky situation because on 

1046
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,631
one hand it's a good tactic.
It's a good tactic to try to palm the 

1047
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:46,880
forehead and you know,
I mean,

1048
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:48,820
it's a big one in Moitai,
but tie,

1049
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,990
of course you're dealing with a fully 
enclosed glove.

1050
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:56,950
I don't know what the fuck they can do,
what they really need to do something 

1051
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,950
and it needs to be a priority.
Gloves,

1052
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,530
Prague,
gloves.

1053
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,000
There it is,
man,

1054
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:04,140
when you watch pride.
And I've been watching a lot of pride 

1055
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,140
lately because I,
um,

1056
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,140
at home,
uh,

1057
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,290
I,
uh,

1058
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,430
yeah,
it's fucking awesome.

1059
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,370
Greatest Shit ever.
You know,

1060
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:10,130
it's really interesting to watch the 
evolution of the sport too.

1061
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:15,131
When you watch pride,
you watched like guys and you compare 

1062
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:15,131
them to the best guys of today and like,
wow,

1063
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:17,000
this is like a,
there's been a big fucking jumped,

1064
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:20,350
big fucking jump.
I love Don Frye and his mustache.

1065
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,880
Rest in peace,
mustache.

1066
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,030
But you look,
that's crazy.

1067
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:30,031
But like Don fry in pride compared to 
the light heavyweights,

1068
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:34,540
now I'm just the disparity of,
of skill and technical level.

1069
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,840
Even athleticism and don was a beast.
Um,

1070
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,160
it's night and day.

1071
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Well,
I was watching vandelay the best of 

1072
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,610
vandelay in pride.
There was an episode in the best of 

1073
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,170
pride where it was all vandalized fights
and you know,

1074
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,880
vandelays one of my favorite fighters to
watch.

1075
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:51,390
It's a wild man,
but you know,

1076
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,430
you compare his skill level to like a 
guy like Jon Jones who they're fighting 

1077
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,101
at the same weight class.
Like that wouldn't even be a hard fight 

1078
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:00,101
for like a round.
Yeah.

1079
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:04,910
It would not be a,
it would be you can't touch me and I'm 

1080
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,871
going to keep hitting you and you're 
going to not know what to do and then 

1081
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:07,970
either you're going to get choked,
unconscious or,

1082
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,680
or beat the fuck up.
Yeah.

1083
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,160
It's amazing how much of a jump.
There's bins from 93 to 2014 as far as 

1084
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:20,351
the evolution of martial arts.
And I say it like it's a line that I 

1085
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,430
keep saying,
but it's true in those two decades,

1086
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,060
martial arts have evolved more than they
have in the last 2000 years.

1087
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,380
It's incredible.
Absolutely.

1088
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,090
To longest time,
man.

1089
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,120
You know,
I grew up doing martial arts in the 

1090
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,120
eighties and nobody knew what the fuck 
worked.

1091
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,020
It was all just guessing.
You know,

1092
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:37,760
everybody knew that,
you know,

1093
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
if you were a really good wrestler,
you could take guys down and if you are 

1094
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,520
really good box so you could probably 
punch better,

1095
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,240
but what would work better?
Karate or judo,

1096
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:49,400
what will work better?
Jiu Jitsu it nobody knew.

1097
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,610
Nobody fucking knew.
It was a guessing game.

1098
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,620
Naming new moves.
Every single card.

1099
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:53,910
You're like,
oh,

1100
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:54,690
what are you gonna?
Call this one.

1101
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:58,440
Like how can we progress so quickly 
where every Saturday night we're like,

1102
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,700
oh,
here's a new submission.

1103
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,590
You know?
It's just unbelievable.

1104
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,170
Yeah.
The Peruvian Necktie,

1105
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,010
Tony D'souza,
which you very rarely see.

1106
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,780
I mean CB dollar is probably the only I 
think.

1107
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,870
I don't even know if the Sousas ever 
pulled it off inside the octagon,

1108
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:15,871
but cb Dahl always pulled it off,
is a few guys that use that Peruvian 

1109
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,410
neck time and then there's a.
there's,

1110
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,010
there's a few jokes that you,
you know,

1111
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:22,420
you see them once and then you never see
them again.

1112
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:27,610
It's,
it's a fascinating thing where you're 

1113
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:27,610
watching all this stuff evolve.
Right?

1114
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,000
Right.
In front of your eyes.

1115
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,480
How do you manage your training when it 
comes to like working on new techniques,

1116
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,750
adding new things to your arsenal and 
instill just the conditioning,

1117
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:41,170
the sparring,
the day to day drilling that you have to

1118
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:42,890
do.
Like how do you manage stuffing,

1119
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,780
all that stuff in

1120
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,360
time management.
Like a good athlete,

1121
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:49,820
you know,
I do things like ratios,

1122
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:54,821
percentages of k I want to develop or 
give a certain percentage of time to 

1123
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,980
getting better.
So I'm going to,

1124
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,280
let's say I have 10 classes a week.
I'm just real easy round number in that 

1125
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,840
in those 10 classes,
you know like I want two or three of 

1126
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,120
them to be exclusively focused on 
drilling new techniques,

1127
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:16,530
you know,
that I want two or three of them to be 

1128
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,620
maintenance of things that I do well and
want to continue to do well.

1129
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,460
And there's just,
just grappling like in,

1130
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,020
in a,
in a,

1131
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:24,470
in a one week,
10 class setting and then you know,

1132
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,810
two or three of them are,
are hard grappling,

1133
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,010
sparring type sessions,
you know.

1134
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,030
Then the other ones like maybe a float 
or of I'm teaching or I'm working with 

1135
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,740
just a handful of black belts trying to 
create new stuff,

1136
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,160
you know,
so like it's equally proportionate to 

1137
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,160
stain.
Good.

1138
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,610
Challenging myself physically and 
developing new technique and learning.

1139
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,090
You know.

1140
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,510
What about recovery?
Like what about um,

1141
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:54,010
what,
what do you do stuff for the birds?

1142
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:59,040
What do you do for fun?
Do you have like a routine as far as 

1143
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,060
like deep tissue massage,
Cryo therapy?

1144
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,720
What do you do?
Yes.

1145
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,520
To both of those.
So Austin,

1146
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:08,521
cryotherapy.
I'm there because I'm one of those 

1147
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:10,471
things.
You stand in one of those chambers and 

1148
00:51:10,471 --> 00:51:12,021
it's 50 below zero.
Negative 300 is that happens your Dick.

1149
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:15,040
When you do that,
that seems to me it'd be gloved fingers.

1150
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:15,270
Right?

1151
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,400
And I take those gloved fingers and I 
cover what is going to be my very small 

1152
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,550
penis in like seconds,
you know,

1153
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,840
and I make sure I like double handed.
So both my hands are like,

1154
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:30,370
yeah.
Does anybody go raw dog and just let 

1155
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:30,370
their Dick Freeze?
That would be a.

1156
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,370
because if you found out that guy did 
it,

1157
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:33,300
you'd probably have to do it too.
Wouldn't you know,

1158
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,690
I would assume that you would be one of 
those guys.

1159
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:36,620
I'd be like,
all right,

1160
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,130
I am that.
I'm like,

1161
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,030
I'm so stupid.
I'm going to do.

1162
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,410
Really?
Are you messing with me?

1163
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,500
I'm going to do it.
Yeah,

1164
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,400
just do it.
A monk position.

1165
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,830
Three minutes,
right?

1166
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:56,010
Um,
and then you get out huge infusion of 

1167
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,010
blood.
You feel better.

1168
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,780
What's the pro?
Eddie Bravo did this,

1169
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,400
uh,
in preparation for his heuler match,

1170
00:51:58,401 --> 00:51:59,760
which is the first time I'd heard about 
it.

1171
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,600
Like explain it to me and for the lay 
people at home,

1172
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,440
it's your neck is above your head of 
exposed.

1173
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,940
Yeah.
So the closes on you suntanning

1174
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,950
bed.
Exactly.

1175
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:11,090
But you're,
you're standing up,

1176
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,650
right?
They punched,

1177
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,860
punched liquid nitrogen gas in there.
So up I about your chin down to like 

1178
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,550
negative 300 degrees.
So you're breathing,

1179
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:21,860
the gas is coming up to your Chin and 
um,

1180
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,920
you know,
the largest organ in your body is your 

1181
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:26,920
skin.
So it's very responsive.

1182
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,030
It can absorb quickly and people take 
drugs that way.

1183
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,810
Uh,
you know,

1184
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:33,170
you can also,
it's very responsive,

1185
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,560
so it gets exposed to negative 300 
degrees.

1186
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:41,740
The first thing it does is take blood 
from the extremities and rushes it to 

1187
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,640
the vital life sustaining organs of your
body,

1188
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:44,420
your brain,
your heart,

1189
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:49,421
and your lungs.
So all the blood goes from your 

1190
00:52:49,421 --> 00:52:50,750
extremities to your core and then you 
get in.

1191
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,210
You're there for like two,
three minutes and super crazy because if

1192
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:58,211
you have an injury like a hurt knee or a
hurt hand where you have extra fluid 

1193
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,400
there,
it gets super cold there because you 

1194
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,550
have more fluid there and more fluid is 
conductive and it gets colder faster.

1195
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,800
So you can feel these injuries on your 
body.

1196
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:10,280
Get crazy cold and then you hop out.
Three minutes is up,

1197
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:15,281
you get out of the get out of the 
chamber and then your body responds to 

1198
00:53:15,281 --> 00:53:19,811
being an 80 degrees and all the Rut,
all the blood rushes back out to the 

1199
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:23,801
extremities.
So you get this huge infusion of good 

1200
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,040
healthy blood back out to these injuries
and out to your extremities.

1201
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,130
It's a rush.
Feels like you just drank five cups of 

1202
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:31,130
coffee and you're like Hampton,
uh,

1203
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,780
it's just this weird tingley fantastic,
um,

1204
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:36,150
sensation.
So that's what happens.

1205
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:40,680
And how does it help you recover by 
doing the infusion circulation like the,

1206
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,360
in the trying to treat an injury,
you know,

1207
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:46,200
you have,
you have rest,

1208
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:46,770
ice,
compression,

1209
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:47,880
elevation,
you know,

1210
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:52,881
when,
when you're trying to work on recovery 

1211
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:55,280
without injury,
you want circulation so you want good 

1212
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,551
healthy blood going to muscles that 
you've just fatigued to increase 

1213
00:53:58,551 --> 00:53:58,890
recovery and response time.

1214
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,430
So if you just like simple terms,
if I went and did like a big squat and 

1215
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,360
deadlift workout for the day,
right?

1216
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:08,760
My legs and back and are going to be 
sore,

1217
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,120
you know those extremities,
law,

1218
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,540
it's vascular region.
So go hop in the cryo chamber.

1219
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,050
All the blood that's sitting there in 
that area,

1220
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,880
in my legs,
my back and my butt.

1221
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:24,060
I'm all rushed to my brain and lungs and
heart.

1222
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,540
Then I get out and all sorts of great 
new,

1223
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:29,940
fantastic blood goes back to my legs,
back and.

1224
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:33,990
But so I get a great,
huge infusion of good healthy blood back

1225
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:38,991
out to my extremities to increase 
recovery time because I'm just 

1226
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:41,811
increasing circulation.
Increasing circulation is increasing 

1227
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:41,811
recovery.

1228
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:42,970
Wow.
That's fascinating shit man.

1229
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:48,030
It's,
it's fascinating when you see all these 

1230
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,431
new innovations when it comes to 
strength and conditioning and recovery 

1231
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:51,000
and fitness.
And that's a,

1232
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,180
that's a unique one,
man.

1233
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:53,590
That's,
that's interesting stuff.

1234
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,950
It's cold though.
Yeah.

1235
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:00,060
How many days a week do you do that for?
And they have a place like that in 

1236
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,250
Albuquerque.

1237
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,500
No,
they don't.

1238
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,600
They have a trailer that sometimes 
they'll,

1239
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,670
they'll bring out to me and in fight 
camps.

1240
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:06,830
That

1241
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,640
is,
that has that in it.

1242
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:09,630
Yeah.
Oh,

1243
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:11,190
that's nice.
That's super nice.

1244
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,780
Wow.
So Albuquerque doesn't have that open.

1245
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,930
Greg Jackson get on the ball,
but come on.

1246
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,250
Should have that task.

1247
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,860
Yeah,
deep tissues.

1248
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,420
Great.
Um,

1249
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,420
you know,
I,

1250
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,930
I believe like the tenants,
the foundations of Bni,

1251
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,440
healthy recovering athlete,
you know,

1252
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:29,300
like good sleep,
good food,

1253
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,010
good sex,
you know,

1254
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:33,380
like you have to have those.
And if you're doing those things,

1255
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:38,381
then your body's gonna adapt to whatever
the workload of volume that you're 

1256
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:43,751
putting out.
So I have a crazy volume like guys that 

1257
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:43,751
come and train with me.
They're like,

1258
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:44,420
this is normal,
this is normal,

1259
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,440
this is what I do normally buy.
Just have a very healthy foundation of a

1260
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:49,600
lifestyle,
you know,

1261
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:51,170
like we're,
I don't really drink,

1262
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,870
I don't ever smoke,
you know,

1263
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,280
like I train every single day to three 
times a day.

1264
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:57,860
Like this is my body's adaptive to that.
And then everything else,

1265
00:55:57,861 --> 00:56:00,340
the supporting structure of eating well,
you know,

1266
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,420
having an awesome supplements.
Um,

1267
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:07,510
you know,
having everything just to make my body 

1268
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,450
respond properly to training volume is,
is there.

1269
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,750
So how do you work your diet out?
What do you,

1270
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,751
uh,
do you do have a nutritionist that you 

1271
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:15,751
work with,
you do it on your own,

1272
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:16,280
of all of the above,
you know,

1273
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:17,420
like,
um,

1274
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,750
I have nutritionists that I bounce stuff
off of and like people that are way 

1275
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,780
smarter than me that,
um,

1276
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:28,150
and then I'm surrounded with so many 
other elite athletes talking to them and

1277
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,500
their coaches,
you know,

1278
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,610
the guys on it,
you know,

1279
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:35,611
they have a whole,
they have a stable of guys there that 

1280
00:56:35,611 --> 00:56:37,090
are always looking for the next best 
thing or even not the next best thing.

1281
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:42,091
Things there just have been there around
for thousands of years that nobody uses 

1282
00:56:42,091 --> 00:56:42,091
like they should.
So it's,

1283
00:56:42,091 --> 00:56:44,260
it's a constant discussion of like how 
to improve.

1284
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:47,230
I know what my calories that I'm burning
a day because I log everything.

1285
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,130
Um,
you know,

1286
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:53,131
I fought two weeks ago,
so I was on crazy strict diet for like 

1287
00:56:53,131 --> 00:56:54,400
three,
four months to get down to one 85.

1288
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,140
Now I'm back in Austin,
Texas.

1289
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:58,380
Maybe I'll have a little bit of brisket.
It's getting in there.

1290
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,580
You has some tacos.
So what,

1291
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,120
which I think is actually needed.
You know,

1292
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,340
you should,
you,

1293
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:07,990
you can't be perfect all the time.
Your body needs those cheats.

1294
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah,
I agree.

1295
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:14,001
I think cheat days are important.
I think people that are just completely 

1296
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:16,701
clean and strict,
you're robbing yourself also of 

1297
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:16,701
enjoyment.
Yeah.

1298
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:20,690
Life's too short and yeah,
there's some delicious food that you 

1299
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:21,570
shouldn't eat all the time,
but you should eat sometimes.

1300
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,040
Definitely.
Right?

1301
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,110
Yeah.
Um,

1302
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,240
so do you,
when you say that you logged the amount 

1303
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:29,520
of calories that you burn,
how do you calculate that?

1304
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:35,080
So heart rate monitor right during the 
workout knows my resting metabolic rate 

1305
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:40,100
is key.
You have to know what that is and once 

1306
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,100
you know what that is kind of in between
workouts,

1307
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,200
you know,
cumulatively in a day what you've burnt 

1308
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,890
and then you just add during the 
workouts.

1309
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:51,020
You know,
if I work out two or three times that 

1310
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,020
day,
you know,

1311
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,020
if I'm doing a 90 minute strength and 
conditioning session,

1312
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,911
you know I'm going to burn anywhere 
between 12 to 1600 calories in that 

1313
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:56,210
session.
You know,

1314
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:57,890
from warm,
warm up to cool down.

1315
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,870
And then like last night I had a two 
hour Jujitsu Shush session,

1316
00:58:02,871 --> 00:58:03,350
you know,
like,

1317
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:05,490
and it smashed afterwards,
you know,

1318
00:58:05,491 --> 00:58:07,520
like I know what my,
kind of,

1319
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:11,510
what my heart rate was at during the 
entire time and two hours,

1320
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,970
you know,
that's going to be another 1500 calories

1321
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:16,250
that I'm putting on top of what I 
brought in that day.

1322
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:17,930
So I guess snapshot that I bought,
you know,

1323
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,520
5,500
to 6,000

1324
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:20,030
calories.

1325
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,540
That's insane.
Yeah.

1326
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,430
That's way more than most people eat the
day.

1327
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,680
Yeah.
It's fun to eat that though.

1328
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,050
How do you stuff that in though?
I'm in the way.

1329
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,850
What do you.
The Texas brisket.

1330
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:38,450
So easy.
Do you have any other nutritional 

1331
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,510
requirements?
Like do you eat gluten?

1332
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:42,600
Do you,
do you take sugar into your diet at all?

1333
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,840
I try.
I try not to.

1334
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,210
I'm definitely fight camp.
I don't have either of those,

1335
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,350
you know,
but like right now,

1336
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:48,180
um,
you know,

1337
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,180
I had an apple fritter Bagel on Monday.
Like I hadn't had one of those and

1338
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,160
I didn't even know how long and it was 
amazing.

1339
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,030
Is like a small orgasm in my mouth.
I don't even know what that is.

1340
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:00,670
And the Apple Fritter Bagel?
No,

1341
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,060
not Bagel.
Just an apple fritter.

1342
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,460
Oh,
her donut.

1343
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,420
Oh,
okay.

1344
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:08,320
So it's like just donut with apple,
gluten and sugar and apples.

1345
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:13,330
Sugar and that sort of a.
What is that syrupy stuff in with the 

1346
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:17,150
apples and cinnamon has exactly what?
That sounds good.

1347
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,670
It was good it yet.
Do Krispy Kreme it?

1348
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,370
Do you ever Krispy Kreme it?
No.

1349
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,770
You don't go to Krispy Kreme?
No.

1350
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,800
Damn dude know there's a spot that I go 
to a I,

1351
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,440
I'm again,
Regena keen.

1352
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:32,441
Do you know what that is?
And something that they go to Germany 

1353
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:32,441
for that.
Uh,

1354
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:33,680
Dr Peter Weller invented.
It's a blood spinning.

1355
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,080
Oh yeah.
You guys are doing it too.

1356
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,940
Yeah,
I've been getting it done.

1357
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:38,870
I had it done on my neck.

1358
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,230
I had a bulging disc in my neck that was
impinging on nerves.

1359
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:44,840
I was getting some numbness in my hand 
from Jujitsu.

1360
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,860
Went away and totally the magic.
The thing just shrunk down to nothing.

1361
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:54,250
But the place where I get it,
it's right down the street from Krispy 

1362
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:54,250
Kreme.
I drive,

1363
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,210
I'm like,
do I want to fuck up what I just fixed,

1364
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,350
just do it inflammation.
And um,

1365
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,480
apparently inflammation.
And uh,

1366
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,810
I found out about it from a physical 
therapist that gluten and inflammation,

1367
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:04,380
the,
they're like,

1368
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,720
people say,
Oh,

1369
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:07,520
you know,
you're not really gluten sensitive.

1370
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,330
Most people aren't mean you can eat 
gluten,

1371
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:14,331
he be fine.
But the reality is it does cause some 

1372
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:14,331
inflammation more.
Eat the morning you get.

1373
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:19,060
Yeah.
That's a fascinating thing that it's a 

1374
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,070
normal part of everybody's diet.
You wouldn't think that it would have 

1375
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,890
that sort of an effect on your joints or
your back or.

1376
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,270
But it really does.
Yeah.

1377
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,800
Well,
especially if they train,

1378
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:28,220
like we do like that,
then now we're just compounding problems

1379
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:32,480
where we have the enablers to cause 
inflammation and then we're diet.

1380
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,880
Giving something that helps cause it,
you know,

1381
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,100
now things are just compounded and it's 
exponential.

1382
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,240
And then we actually like,
ah,

1383
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,580
what about dairy?
Not much at all.

1384
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:43,600
Some cheeses I just can't live without 
your cheeses.

1385
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,290
Your cheese guy mean.
Yes,

1386
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,060
I'm a food guy.
If it's good,

1387
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:47,720
I want it.
Yeah,

1388
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:48,350
you cook,
right?

1389
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:49,550
Oh God,
I love to cook.

1390
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,270
What kind of,
what do,

1391
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,620
what do you cook?
Um,

1392
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:56,950
I love everything,
but I love cooking like real.

1393
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,140
When I say real,
um,

1394
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:04,270
it's my food that I shot.
It's that I cleaned that.

1395
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:09,340
I froze that I packaged,
that I brought in from my greenhouse in 

1396
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:09,680
my backyard,
you know,

1397
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,210
like my food.

1398
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:11,900
Right,
right,

1399
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,000
right.
So I,

1400
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:18,190
I'm with you a thousand percent.
I love being connected to what I put in 

1401
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:18,190
my body.
Yeah.

1402
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:22,691
There's very few people who have 
experienced that haven't said that it's 

1403
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:25,880
something special when you cook an 
animal that you actually hunted,

1404
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,500
shot,
butchered,

1405
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,860
cut up,
put in your freezer or eating in camp,

1406
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:34,070
which is even better when you're eating 
it like a couple of hours after it died.

1407
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,530
This is an amazing connection that,
you know,

1408
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,040
people will poopoo that,
like it's not important.

1409
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:40,910
Like,
you know,

1410
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:45,911
Oh,
you're just using that as an excuse to 

1411
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:45,911
go out and shoot animals.
Like,

1412
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:45,911
no,
and I really wish those folks.

1413
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:50,080
I would really like to take someone who 
is his immediate or who's anting hunting

1414
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,580
and just you need to just experience 
this.

1415
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,910
Just experienced 100 percent agree.
I wish every person that ate meat,

1416
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:01,270
um,
and ironically a ton of anti hunters 

1417
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,930
like eat meat obviously.
Um,

1418
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,820
there's no connection to food these 
days.

1419
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:07,730
People just want to go to the grocery 
store and pick their stuff off the shelf

1420
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,130
and have no idea how it got there,
what was put in there.

1421
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,970
But then they judge me because I hunt.
But I know exactly where this animal 

1422
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,210
came from,
you know,

1423
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:18,980
and like I felt sorry for it when I shot
it,

1424
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,160
they thought it was beautiful

1425
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,920
and I still do and I'm enjoying every 
single bite of it,

1426
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:28,250
but they.
But they're going to sit there and be 

1427
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:28,250
like,
aw man,

1428
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:28,250
that guy hunts,
you know,

1429
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:28,900
like I'm a,
I'm an absolute fanatic conservationist,

1430
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,690
but I want.
Yeah.

1431
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,840
And I love my food and I love good food.
So they're all connected and I think 

1432
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,300
people should wake up.

1433
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,170
It's also what we were taught kind of 
talking about earlier is that there's a.

1434
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,530
there's a broad spectrum of things that 
are going on in this world.

1435
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,840
There is no black and white when it 
comes to hunting.

1436
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,470
You can actually love animals and still 
shoot them and kill the level in that,

1437
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,480
but it's a crazy thing like people have.
They find that like impossibly 

1438
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,301
contradictory,
but it's not and it's also the other 

1439
01:02:59,301 --> 01:03:01,740
thing that people don't want to admit is
that if you do not shoot these animals,

1440
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:06,900
they are going to continue to fuck.
They're going to continue to procreate 

1441
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,981
and then how are you going to control 
the population because you have two 

1442
01:03:09,981 --> 01:03:13,221
options.
Either you can hunt them or you can 

1443
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:13,221
bring in wolves.
So what do you want to do?

1444
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:14,670
You want wolves wandering around through
your fucking neighborhood,

1445
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,650
killing everything that they can get 
ahold of,

1446
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:19,200
including dogs,
including livestock.

1447
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,660
Do you want wild panthers?
What do you want?

1448
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:26,661
What do you.
How are you going to control the 

1449
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:27,240
populations of these animals that don't 
have natural predators?

1450
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,070
The first,
my experience,

1451
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:34,071
I was like a prepubescent kid when 
Catalina island off the coast of 

1452
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
California,
I'm somebody accidentally introduced a 

1453
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,520
hog to Catalina and it made it in boned 
with maybe one or two other wild hogs 

1454
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:52,791
that were there that created this feral 
big ass hog that made a whole bunch of 

1455
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:57,231
shit,
tons of more hogs and then started 

1456
01:03:57,231 --> 01:03:59,510
destroying the entire island.
So they brought in hunters to x,

1457
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,820
like get rid of these hogs that we're 
destroying the,

1458
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,540
the,
the entire ecosystem of the island.

1459
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:10,860
Um,
and that happens on a much more.

1460
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,010
That's the micro example on a tiny 
little island with a tiny little animal.

1461
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,860
But if you look at the big picture of,
you know,

1462
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,180
like deer in the south or hogs from 
Florida to Texas,

1463
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,460
you know,
or the python that was introduced to the

1464
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:28,461
everglades,
they have to be hunted to maintain the 

1465
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:32,361
balance of harmony in the ecosystem.
And the ecosystem will crash if it's not

1466
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,130
done.
Uh,

1467
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,570
so you either,
like you said,

1468
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:41,571
give a Predator and the Predator has 
serious problems that come along with 

1469
01:04:41,571 --> 01:04:45,141
it.
Or You have the hunter that does it 

1470
01:04:45,141 --> 01:04:45,870
properly and uh,
and then you have the benefits that come

1471
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:47,940
along with it,
which is a proper ecosystem

1472
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,380
and you get delicious wild Ham.
Look at that.

1473
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,370
Yeah.
I smoked that bitch myself.

1474
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,380
Okay.
That my backyard,

1475
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:59,250
I shot it and I smoked it and it was the
best tasting ham ever.

1476
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:03,150
Wild pig has a completely different 
texture than anything.

1477
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,920
It's,
it's like a,

1478
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,040
we,
I marinated it or brined it rather for 

1479
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,340
seven days before I smoked it.
But even so it's like,

1480
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,490
it's a more dense meet.
It's more muscle,

1481
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:16,290
it's darker,
it tastes better.

1482
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,040
It's better for you and

1483
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,220
you fucking have to kill them because 
there's 50,000

1484
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:26,221
hogs.
The place where I go to is to hone 

1485
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:26,221
ranch.
We only an hour and a half outside of La

1486
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:31,230
and they have elk.
They have a pond up there that they put 

1487
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:31,540
a trail camera on just to see what's 
eating there.

1488
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,870
16 different mountain minds.
Oh,

1489
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:37,990
nothing.
Just 16 different fucking wild murderous

1490
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:40,390
cats.
And it's because there's so many pigs,

1491
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:45,391
there's so much.
There's so much game up there you could 

1492
01:05:45,391 --> 01:05:48,391
in in from Texas to Florida,
you could bring in every hunter in the 

1493
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:52,240
nation and have them kill 10 pigs a 
piece and it wouldn't even dent.

1494
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:57,780
What's the population of wild hogs in 
the southeast?

1495
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,190
Have you ever seen a pork lips now?
No.

1496
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,960
It sounds like the best movie ever.
It's a show.

1497
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,310
There's this.
There's a dude.

1498
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,850
His name is Brian,
I think is his name,

1499
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:10,410
his name?

1500
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:16,130
He's the guy from Texas and he's got a 
show called pig man and a pig man is.

1501
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,160
He's a hunter in Texas and he hunts wild
pigs and then he owns a barbecue place 

1502
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:27,451
and then serves up wild pig bbq.
Now he's got a show on one of those like

1503
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
history or something like that.
It's called boss Hog and it shows sort 

1504
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,270
of details with doing.
I'm familiar with it.

1505
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Him and Ted nugent got helicopters with 
fucking machine guns and they're flying 

1506
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:44,560
around with ars,
shooting pigs out of the sky.

1507
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:49,830
I mean,
it is the craziest fucking thing I've 

1508
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:49,830
ever seen on TV.
That's legal now.

1509
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,150
Yeah,
we pass through it.

1510
01:06:51,151 --> 01:06:52,400
Yeah.
You have to and,

1511
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,220
but for folks that don't,
that's cruel,

1512
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:58,610
that's horrible.
There are millions of pigs,

1513
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,580
they don't care.
And they know not only that,

1514
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:03,400
they don't stop fucking,
they breed all year round.

1515
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,700
It's not like deer that have a Rut and 
then they'll have a fond.

1516
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:11,680
Now these are animals that are shitting 
out four or five pigs every four or five

1517
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:13,420
months and they just don't,
don't,

1518
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:14,170
don't,
don't,

1519
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:15,670
don't.
And this is a,

1520
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:19,180
this is the video of them shooting these
things from the sky.

1521
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:22,780
There's actually companies,
this is the wrong one.

1522
01:07:22,781 --> 01:07:27,490
You see what you're showing is there's a
pig hunting video that was a pig hunting

1523
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:30,220
promo for the sportsmans channel,
but this is,

1524
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:30,820
uh,
they,

1525
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:35,821
they had a whole episode and in the 
episode that killed 450 pigs in a 

1526
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:37,660
fucking 22 minute episodes with 
commercials.

1527
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:41,590
But that's like a drop in the ocean to 
what's there.

1528
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,140
Yeah.
Literally it is like taking a shot glass

1529
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:45,940
and tossing the end to the ocean.
I mean,

1530
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:50,941
it's the most ridiculous thing you've 
ever seen in your life and they're just 

1531
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:55,830
catching these pigs running head shots 
where they're tomblin while they're 

1532
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,950
running and there's something barbaric 
and fucked up about it,

1533
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,310
but they're taking that food and they're
feeding hungry people.

1534
01:08:00,311 --> 01:08:02,920
They have hunters for the hungry,
they give the wild pork,

1535
01:08:02,921 --> 01:08:07,921
which is excellent meat.
They give it to a hungry families and 

1536
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:07,921
it's really,
really,

1537
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:09,760
really delicious food and it's important
to.

1538
01:08:09,761 --> 01:08:12,190
But then there's that thing where people
are like,

1539
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,150
well,
that's fucked up,

1540
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:14,500
man.
That's not really hunting.

1541
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:15,380
They're shooting.
It's all,

1542
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,340
they're not really hunting.

1543
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,690
They're eradicating these problematic 
delicious animals.

1544
01:08:20,691 --> 01:08:21,860
That's the best way to look at it.

1545
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:27,090
They have to be eradicated.
And while it might not be the most 

1546
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:27,090
humane approach to it,
um,

1547
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:28,420
it's an,
it's a necessary one that has to happen.

1548
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,590
And so,
I dunno,

1549
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,560
like it's a necessary evil a little bit.

1550
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:32,670
Well,
you know,

1551
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:34,380
what's going on in the Hamptons,
the Hamptons,

1552
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:37,920
the luxury area outside of long island 
where all these,

1553
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,080
what's going on with rich folks,
they have so many deer up there that 

1554
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,900
they're bringing in snipers.
The snipers in the middle of the night 

1555
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,561
and the town is proposed to give these 
deer birth control to somehow or another

1556
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:54,620
give them food,
put food out that has birth control in 

1557
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:54,620
it,
which by the way,

1558
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,921
the male deer are going to eat too,
so you can make bitches out of the male 

1559
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:57,990
deer.
The mail you're going to run around.

1560
01:08:57,991 --> 01:09:02,660
I think I'm fucking pregnant.
Why am I not true?

1561
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,310
Yeah,
so you get to have these male deer.

1562
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:07,170
They're eating birth control,
female deer,

1563
01:09:07,171 --> 01:09:12,171
and it's going to cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars and it's a direct 

1564
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:15,591
result of the failure to eradicate.
These animals are controller population 

1565
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:15,591
through hunting.

1566
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:18,990
There's a place in Pennsylvania where 
they have 24,

1567
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:22,860
a 24 hour day,
seven day a week hunting,

1568
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,130
365 days a year.
You can hunt with bows and arrows.

1569
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,890
You can hunt all year around because 
there are so many deer.

1570
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:34,100
They're like just fucking bring in 
hunters and the hunters come in and 

1571
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,470
there's these huge estates that have 
these 10 acre properties where there's a

1572
01:09:37,471 --> 01:09:41,250
fucking tree stands and there's million 
dollar houses with fucking putting green

1573
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:46,251
courses and dudes and trees.
Dan's launching arrows at deer because 

1574
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:46,620
they're fucking everywhere.
They're like tree score,

1575
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,380
like ground squirrels.
You ever driving a like a ranch that has

1576
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:54,381
ground squirrels and as the car is 
running you see like others run across 

1577
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:55,230
the road.
It's incredible.

1578
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,980
Like to hone ranch which has 50,000
hogs.

1579
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,800
It has rocky mountain elk,
gigantic elk.

1580
01:10:01,801 --> 01:10:04,230
They have thousands of deer.
They have bears,

1581
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,810
they have mountains,
they have everything.

1582
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:10,050
The number one animal mass,
pound for pound is ground squirrels,

1583
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,670
and there's 2,700,000
acre ranch.

1584
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,410
Number one is ground squirrels,

1585
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,910
I believe it was my dad in.
Here's a narcotics officer for 30 years 

1586
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:25,961
door kicking superstar.
He spends his retired time now shooting 

1587
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:30,060
ground squirrels like the most amazing 
setup.

1588
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:32,080
Ground squirrels,
ground squirrels,

1589
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:35,060
ground squirrels,
no it on the ranch.

1590
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:40,061
Like the.
The cows will step in their whole break 

1591
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:42,350
their legs or they destroy irrigation 
for the vineyards,

1592
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:47,351
like they're nasty.
They're disease carrying and they also 

1593
01:10:47,351 --> 01:10:48,620
breed like crazy.
You can't stop them.

1594
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:53,621
They're cannibals too.
Like you shoot one to like drag it into 

1595
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:53,621
the hole and eat it.

1596
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:57,180
Very different from tree squirrels.
Tree squirrels are actually good.

1597
01:10:57,181 --> 01:10:58,890
I've eaten tree squirrel.
They're delicious.

1598
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,140
They're pretty.
They're tastes good man.

1599
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,880
Steve Rinella.
The guy who was the host,

1600
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:07,881
immediate or shadow squirrel when we 
were in Wisconsin and cooked it and it 

1601
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:11,031
was real.
It's a very unique taste to it doesn't 

1602
01:11:11,031 --> 01:11:11,031
taste like anything else.
But um,

1603
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,740
ground squirrels,
man.

1604
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,070
I eat one.
Yeah,

1605
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:16,140
we currently can't.
Apparently.

1606
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:17,430
They're just fucking disgusting.
Yeah.

1607
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:18,450
It's like,
I mean,

1608
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:20,520
I guess you could eat it if you were 
starving to death,

1609
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:22,800
but the other problem is if you shoot 
them,

1610
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:26,100
you have to kill them because if you 
shoot them and you wound them,

1611
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,110
they run into their hole and then the 
other ones eat it.

1612
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:31,080
Yeah.
Fucking creepy little nasty.

1613
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:36,750
A lot.
A lot of creepy little animals out 

1614
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:36,750
there.
But this,

1615
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,090
I mean the idea that there's one branch 
with $2 million,

1616
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:40,830
700,000
acres there,

1617
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,770
largest largest animal mass is ground 
squirrels.

1618
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,840
Well,
they say that the largest mass of,

1619
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,900
of life on earth moving life is aunts 
and that there's more pounds of ants a 

1620
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,020
than there are humans,
pounds of humans.

1621
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,210
It's incredible.
Yeah.

1622
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,970
And they're like 10,000
times stronger than we are ratio.

1623
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,090
Yeah.
They never get mad at us.

1624
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,760
Or are they better not start growing.

1625
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:11,050
You know,
if you go back throughout the history 

1626
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:13,221
and you find some of the animals that 
were just really enormous just to a few 

1627
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:17,000
hundred million years ago and if somehow
or another shrunk down to a manageable 

1628
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,000
size.
Yeah.

1629
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,450
Like if bees,
if bees of the size of horses,

1630
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,840
we'd have real problems.
I love honey.

1631
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,820
Yeah.
Honey is delicious.

1632
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,350
You know,
vegans don't eat honey.

1633
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,180
That's a horrible.
That's hilarious.

1634
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:32,210
That's hilarious.
Just show if you ever want to know how 

1635
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,030
retarded it being a Vegan is,
you won't eat honey.

1636
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,670
Uh,
either retarded.

1637
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:37,140
The moment that they start with I'm a 
Vegan,

1638
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,750
you know.
Well they can't help say it.

1639
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:43,230
It's like they're holding hands.
They run marathons.

1640
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:48,410
Yeah.
Just like another thing that comes out 

1641
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:48,410
right away is like,
I'm a marathoner,

1642
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,080
or I'm a Vegan,
or I eat Paleo,

1643
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:52,560
or I'm a crossfit.
That's like nobody can help but tell you

1644
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,540
those necessary elements of themselves.

1645
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:56,850
Yeah.
What is that?

1646
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:01,910
I don't know what it is.
It's they want to tell you they're 

1647
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,651
awesome,
but to me that almost discounts 

1648
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:04,700
discounts you as being such.
Yeah.

1649
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:07,530
If you're a Vegan,
you cannot tell people for a long period

1650
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:09,150
of time.
That's super impressive.

1651
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,720
I'll like you more.
Wow.

1652
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:15,150
You're a Vegan and you just.
It took you two weeks to tell me,

1653
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,900
I'm impressed.
Can I buy you lunch of Vegan lunch?

1654
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,450
I get it.
For people that don't want to be cruel,

1655
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:24,390
I totally get the whole sentiment I get.
I get all of it.

1656
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:29,391
I get the idea of like wanting to eat 
fresh vegetables and it's healthy for 

1657
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:29,391
you.
I get it,

1658
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:32,190
but the finite nature of life itself,
it's just.

1659
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:37,220
It seems to me it's so silly that you 
think that somehow under the EU not 

1660
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:41,211
killing animals is somehow going to 
balance things out or you not being a 

1661
01:13:41,211 --> 01:13:41,640
part of killing animals is going to bow.

1662
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,040
They're killing each other.
Do you know that?

1663
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:47,400
Like there's a war going on.
All the animals are involved in it,

1664
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:49,620
including humans.
We're just so far ahead.

1665
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:52,220
We forgot it's a war and we have POW 
camps,

1666
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:55,250
so we set up in cities,
we call them zoos and that's it.

1667
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,540
That is that they didn't ask to be 
there.

1668
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:02,870
We capture those motherfuckers and we 
put them and they're in these weird 

1669
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,320
things where we don't let them interact 
with the other animals in the zoo.

1670
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:09,340
We,
we blocked them off in their own little 

1671
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,100
apartments and you know,
so we could stare at him all we popcorn.

1672
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,330
I'm not sure I agree with that.
I don't.

1673
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,600
I think that if you should have zoos,
you should lump all those bitches 

1674
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,150
together and if you run out of monkeys,
go get more.

1675
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,400
The monkeys,
the monkeys that survive are going to be

1676
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:25,930
the ones that know how to get away from 
the cat.

1677
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,760
He's a bad ass.
That monkey.

1678
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:28,720
I want us to pet.
Yeah,

1679
01:14:28,721 --> 01:14:30,310
that's a monkey.
Knows that to zig and zag.

1680
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:32,870
He knows that a Juke,
you know when the cat's coming,

1681
01:14:32,871 --> 01:14:34,870
he knows that to gets to the type.
The tall branches,

1682
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:40,350
the monkey that stays in the ground and 
picks his ass while the Jaguars slowly 

1683
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,531
creeping up on him.
That's the monkey that's supposed to 

1684
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:45,751
die.
The only weird part about the shoe 

1685
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:48,750
worlds and the zoos have this of,
of our life is that they do.

1686
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,650
I love when people are like,
oh,

1687
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:52,310
did you see the movie black fish?
You know,

1688
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,610
like,
it's so horrible.

1689
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,670
I'm going to boycott seaworld.
You're like,

1690
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:02,010
have you ever given a cent to marine 
biology or the preservation of marine 

1691
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:02,740
wildlife?
No,

1692
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:07,890
but you're going to boycott seaworld.
How much money have they given in the 

1693
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,390
research and preservation of marine 
wildlife?

1694
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:11,950
Oh yeah.
A thousand times more than you.

1695
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,060
It's the same with the zoos.
You know,

1696
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:14,530
like,
I don't like zoos.

1697
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:16,300
I think it's horrible that the animals 
were there,

1698
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:21,510
but they do more in research and 
understanding wildlife and the 

1699
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:24,730
preservation of wildlife.
Then almost everyone that goes there and

1700
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:26,500
then or doesn't go there and complained 
about it,

1701
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,630
so it's just like this.
Again,

1702
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:32,440
shades of gray.
My problem with seaworld is very simple.

1703
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,960
Those animals are smart.
They're very smart.

1704
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:39,961
In fact,
the cerebral cortex of a dolphin's 40 

1705
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:39,961
percent larger than that of a human 
being so beautiful.

1706
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:43,930
We don't even understand how smart they 
are because they can't alter their 

1707
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:44,380
environment,
so we don't think of them as being smart

1708
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,960
because they can.
They don't have funds.

1709
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:50,980
They don't pick things up because they 
can move in three d all around the 

1710
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,331
ocean.
They can fucking dive and swim and move 

1711
01:15:54,331 --> 01:15:54,331
around and they have these pods.

1712
01:15:54,331 --> 01:15:55,270
They stay together,
they have families,

1713
01:15:55,271 --> 01:15:56,860
they have dialects,
they have languages.

1714
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,200
There are so intelligent that we,
we,

1715
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:04,201
we're just now starting to understand 
that they have variations in the way 

1716
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:06,610
they speak depending upon what 
geographic location they're at.

1717
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,290
They're really fucking smart human type 
smart and just because they're different

1718
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:13,930
from us and they don't build houses 
doesn't mean they're not smart.

1719
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,740
So to me it's like slavery.
It's like just because you know,

1720
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,040
we have donated so much money into 
slavery research,

1721
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,670
but you're still fucking slave owners.
Yukon's,

1722
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,870
you know,
the reason why there needs to be slavery

1723
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:30,871
research.
I just think that anything smart 

1724
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:32,680
shouldn't be in captivity,
but like giraffes,

1725
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,410
they're so stupid.
You go to the zoo and they seem happy as

1726
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:38,360
fuck there is happy there and they let 
babies feed them.

1727
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,610
I have a three year old,
then she holds up lettuce.

1728
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,700
The draft comes and take it.
That fucking drafts.

1729
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:47,701
Not upset at all.
They're so confident that giraffes are 

1730
01:16:47,701 --> 01:16:47,701
chill,
that they let babies freedom,

1731
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:48,750
you know,
are there.

1732
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,260
They are so chill.
They're just happy.

1733
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:54,130
There's no lions for you to be a giraffe
all day.

1734
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:59,220
You have a giant target.
Your neck is just a huge target or 

1735
01:16:59,220 --> 01:16:59,290
beacon.
Somebody wants to bite.

1736
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:04,740
There's not one spot.
It's not like a wart hog that is just a 

1737
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:05,230
little short fucking stubby neck.
It's tough to get to you.

1738
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:10,010
There's a giant neck trees everywhere 
rounded you could and kill

1739
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,180
you.
I mean,

1740
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:13,010
they're so happy.
They're in the zoo.

1741
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:13,990
They're so happy.
No,

1742
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,280
they don't know how happy they are.
They're like,

1743
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:21,980
wait,
nothing's eating meat and this three 

1744
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:21,980
year olds giving me food.
Okay,

1745
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,780
I think this is good.
But then there's,

1746
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:28,100
there's weirdness when it comes to 
captivated captive animals,

1747
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:28,560
like,
um,

1748
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,890
these hunting camps that they have in 
Africa,

1749
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,940
it gets again the gray area,
the weirdness of the world because,

1750
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,940
you know,
Louis thorough the documentary guy.

1751
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,250
Yeah.
Fascinating guy had him on the podcast.

1752
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:41,640
Really,
really interesting category to watch.

1753
01:17:41,641 --> 01:17:46,641
That one is a good one.
One of the best documentaries that he 

1754
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:48,020
did was when he went to Africa and went 
to these hunting camps,

1755
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:53,410
they have these high fence hunting camps
where they take these animals and they 

1756
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,650
put them in these huge enclosures and 
they let people hunt them.

1757
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:59,690
The irony is these animals are,
there's higher populations.

1758
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:01,190
They're healthier.
There's more of them.

1759
01:18:01,191 --> 01:18:04,100
Animals that were on the verge of 
extinction are now.

1760
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,930
There's many,
many,

1761
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,300
many of them,
but they're hunted.

1762
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:11,000
Yeah,
so it's like people have this weird sort

1763
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,380
of like,
well yeah,

1764
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:14,810
the animals are healthier,
that populations are healthier,

1765
01:18:14,811 --> 01:18:17,870
but the reason being is because people 
can pay to go kill them.

1766
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:22,871
Like whoa,
but it's just another example of the 

1767
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:25,970
world not being so clear cut.
There's a lot of weirdness out there.

1768
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:31,930
Ironically,
the like some of the rhinos that are 

1769
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,200
left in this world are at those camps.
They're not being hunted.

1770
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,100
There've been protected during these 
high fence game fence areas where people

1771
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:42,101
are coming.
They'll come look at the rhino and be 

1772
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:42,101
like,
Oh wow,

1773
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:42,101
what a beautiful.
Righto,

1774
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:42,101
righto.
All right,

1775
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:44,690
let's go shoot a buck and a kudu.
How much does it cost?

1776
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,220
You know,
like something they couldn't do 20 years

1777
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,360
ago because there weren't enough of 
them,

1778
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:48,410
but no,
like,

1779
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,820
oh limitless and Paula,
what?

1780
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,690
That's a blessed book.
Oh,

1781
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,310
I'll take one of those.
That's not a problem.

1782
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:54,170
You know,
like that's what it's like there.

1783
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:59,200
But there they saved species by making 
them available to be paid for.

1784
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,080
Yeah,
it was very strange.

1785
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:06,080
And Louis Theroux is documentary really 
kept his position.

1786
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:11,290
Well,
his position is he's trying to get to 

1787
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:14,521
it.
He's trying to get to his position 

1788
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:14,521
during the whole documentary.
He's like,

1789
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:14,990
okay,
I see,

1790
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:20,290
but the real position is really clearly 
established by the guy who runs the 

1791
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:22,430
hunting camp because he gets angry at 
Louis.

1792
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,930
One point in the show,
like,

1793
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:25,550
you know,
three quarters of the way in.

1794
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,290
He goes,
you don't understand.

1795
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:29,300
He goes,
Africa is fucked.

1796
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,680
He goes,
it's fucked.

1797
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,400
Unless something is with money,
it's gonna fucking die.

1798
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,730
They fucking kill everything.
It's fucked.

1799
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,500
There's nothing here that have these 
fucking animals.

1800
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:42,560
I here is because they're worth money.
That's it.

1801
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,940
That's it.
Do you understand?

1802
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,660
And you know Louise,
like I guess I understand it's true.

1803
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,700
It is true,
it is true,

1804
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:55,260
and in a sense that sort of mirrors 
what's going on when it comes to 

1805
01:19:55,281 --> 01:20:00,281
wildlife in America.
More money has been spent by hunters to 

1806
01:20:00,281 --> 01:20:03,230
conserve wetlands,
to preserve wildlife habitat,

1807
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:07,240
for elk,
to preserve areas where deer live and,

1808
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:07,890
and,
and to

1809
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:13,250
establish clear protocols as far as how 
many animals can,

1810
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,150
can be sustained in any given location 
and keep the populations healthy.

1811
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:21,330
All that money comes from hunters,
which is just amazing.

1812
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:23,220
It's just,
it's another one of those things.

1813
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:27,810
It's like when you look at it in a clear
objective terms,

1814
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:33,020
you see that this is a very complex 
issue and it's not as simple as these 

1815
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,720
animals are beautiful.
We should not kill them.

1816
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,880
Like they're beautiful.
Yeah.

1817
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,770
You have to kill them though,
but you have to kill him.

1818
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,060
Whoa,
right.

1819
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:41,670
Sucks.
It's not really the delicious.

1820
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,360
That's the crazy thing is.
No,

1821
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,660
no,
it doesn't really suck.

1822
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:46,840
They are delicious.
Like,

1823
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,530
fuck man,
there's so much going on there.

1824
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,560
And again,
that's just the way the world is the 

1825
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,191
world,
which is like this ironic contrast to 

1826
01:20:58,191 --> 01:20:58,191
the first 10 years of my life where 
like,

1827
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,260
I didn't think what I was shooting was 
beautiful because they're evil fuckers,

1828
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,370
you know,
like now as a sportsman,

1829
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:06,450
a hunter,
like I love these animals.

1830
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,960
Which animals do you think we're evil?
Uh,

1831
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,790
terrorists.
But when we are,

1832
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,630
you said for the first 10 years of your 
life,

1833
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:15,990
you're shooting terrorist.
Ten years of my career as a shooter.

1834
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:21,230
Oh,
I thought you were saying as your life 

1835
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,330
when you're nine years old at 23,
you know,

1836
01:21:23,571 --> 01:21:28,571
it's like no remorse.
Slept very well at night because these 

1837
01:21:28,571 --> 01:21:29,670
were evil people and now I'm like,
Oh man,

1838
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:31,050
I don't want to shoot that.
That's pretty.

1839
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,020
Now that thing's beautiful.
That all.

1840
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:33,720
Shoot,
you know,

1841
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:36,870
because that is really yummy and there's
too many of them know.

1842
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:42,170
Yeah.
I have a buddy who served and came back 

1843
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:43,950
and he loves fishing and he had a real 
hard time getting back into hunting.

1844
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,590
He said,
you know,

1845
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,300
you just,
you see so much death at a certain point

1846
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:53,301
in time,
you don't want to be a part of 

1847
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:53,301
empathize.
Yeah.

1848
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:53,301
Yeah.
He,

1849
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:56,530
he got back.
He lives in New Mexico and he got back 

1850
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:56,530
into elk hunting.
New Mexican was great for elk.

1851
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,860
He got back into an after awhile,
but it took them awhile,

1852
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,560
took them awhile to just sort of settle 
in.

1853
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,690
He just like,
I saw too much death.

1854
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:10,820
Totally empathetic to that.
Is there ever going to be a time when 

1855
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:13,030
there's no war?
Is that even possible with human beings?

1856
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:18,410
Not In my lifetime.
That's a disturbing idea for people 

1857
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,700
because if people have this idea,
I mean this is,

1858
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:24,630
this is a shitty analogy,
but it's one that I use if 20 people can

1859
01:22:24,631 --> 01:22:25,750
get along,
if like,

1860
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,920
okay,
there's five of us in this room were 

1861
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,750
four of us in this room.
If there's four people in this room and 

1862
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:33,360
we can get along,
can 40 people get along?

1863
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:34,920
Yes.
40 people can get along.

1864
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:39,921
You could have a community of 40 people 
with no problems and just live from 

1865
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:39,990
birth to death and everybody,
you know,

1866
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:42,630
nobody kills anybody that weird outlier 
at 40,

1867
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:47,631
but you know,
as a community that they'll absorb him 

1868
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:47,970
for what he is or whatever,
but then you get to 4,000.

1869
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,000
No,
no,

1870
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,410
someone's going to die.
Yeah,

1871
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,750
Jim's Douche.
We've got to take out Jim,

1872
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,980
you know,
and everybody's gonna meet by the 

1873
01:22:59,980 --> 01:22:59,980
Campfire and go,
look,

1874
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,000
this motherfucker is just ruining our 
life.

1875
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,860
He doesn't hunt.
He eats all her food.

1876
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,130
He fucks are women were not there.
He beats our kids.

1877
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,040
We've got to kill this

1878
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,370
guy and there's one out of a certain 
number.

1879
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:14,371
There's going to be this one that comes 
up and then when you deal with $7 

1880
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:15,400
million,
it's like,

1881
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,750
Whoa,
how does,

1882
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,430
how does,
how does that ever become manageable?

1883
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:25,150
I mean to human beings have to evolve 
past what we are right now.

1884
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:28,630
Do we have to hope some new stage?
Yeah,

1885
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:31,400
I hope so too.
Well,

1886
01:23:31,401 --> 01:23:35,300
you would know better than anybody what 
the horrors of war are.

1887
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:40,450
So would you think that someone who has 
experienced that would have a better 

1888
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:45,251
perspective about what's necessary and 
what's not necessary when it comes to 

1889
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,610
sort of just managing piece?
Try to.

1890
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,220
Yes and no.
You know,

1891
01:23:52,221 --> 01:23:57,221
there's no like,
nirvana moment where you had like this 

1892
01:23:57,221 --> 01:23:57,221
clear sight of,
you know,

1893
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:00,950
what an understanding of what's 
necessary and what's not,

1894
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:02,900
how people should be or how people 
shouldn't be.

1895
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,780
Like if anything,
you know,

1896
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:11,260
as six years as a door kicker assaulter 
and then four years as a halo sniper 

1897
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:15,221
guy.
I've seen death like from a foot away 

1898
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:16,690
and from a mile away,
you know,

1899
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,100
so like there's no range of death I 
haven't seen.

1900
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,380
So if anything,
like I value life more.

1901
01:24:21,381 --> 01:24:22,640
I think,
um,

1902
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:27,730
I hate war more like I know,
like I think it's horrible and 

1903
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,301
disgusting,
but without a doubt I think it's 

1904
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:31,610
absolutely necessary and,

1905
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:33,190
and

1906
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:38,770
needed into such a level that I can't 
even imagine what this world would be 

1907
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:43,121
like had we not been involved to the 
degree that we've been involved in for 

1908
01:24:44,181 --> 01:24:49,181
the past 12 years trying to eradicate 
this fanatic group of psychopaths.

1909
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:53,360
So I don't want to think about what the 
world would be like,

1910
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:53,690
but,
you know,

1911
01:24:53,691 --> 01:24:58,691
I don't want my,
my nieces and my nephews or my kids to 

1912
01:24:58,691 --> 01:24:59,060
ever have to do what I did or see what I
saw.

1913
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:00,620
So I dunno,
like,

1914
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:06,070
um,
I hope we never have to invade a 

1915
01:25:06,071 --> 01:25:06,580
country.
You know,

1916
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:08,230
I remember we were talking about Syria.
You're like,

1917
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:09,220
are we going to go over there?
I was like,

1918
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,060
God,
no.

1919
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:10,930
You know,
there's no,

1920
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,850
there's no need.
There's no resources.

1921
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:15,400
There's no necessary element for us to 
be involved in.

1922
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,150
But the preservation of human life isn't
that needed.

1923
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:20,370
You know,
Brian,

1924
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,660
I don't.
Well,

1925
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,020
that's one of the reasons why

1926
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:28,820
false flags and false flag operations 
are so disgusting when you find out that

1927
01:25:28,821 --> 01:25:33,360
someone's lying about the motivation for
profit and that

1928
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:38,600
nothing worse than somebody that lies 
for the benefit of themselves.

1929
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:43,790
Like Joe,
I think you're a good looking man and I 

1930
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:44,660
think that dress looks great on you and 
it makes you look thin.

1931
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:49,600
That's no k lice lie sometimes to to 
tell you no,

1932
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,220
wait,
it's your 28th birthday,

1933
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,660
you know,
that's great to hear.

1934
01:25:53,661 --> 01:25:55,100
You know,
I'm 40 or whatever.

1935
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,270
You know,
like those,

1936
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,450
those are not self serving lizard cute 
laws,

1937
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:03,940
but when you're lying so that you can 
put money in your pocket at the expense 

1938
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,820
of human,
I hope you burn in hell forever.

1939
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,230
It's a dark law.
No,

1940
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,000
it's a very,
very dark lie.

1941
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,630
It's,
it's a.

1942
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,110
it's a confusing lie too because it's 
like,

1943
01:26:12,111 --> 01:26:12,830
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1944
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:17,831
This has actually happened.
When you find out about the Gulf of 

1945
01:26:17,831 --> 01:26:20,710
Tonkin or operation northwoods,
that there have been these moments in 

1946
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:23,510
time where people have tried to figure 
out a way to lie in order to drag people

1947
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,000
into war,
a war that otherwise the public wouldn't

1948
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:27,830
support.
It's a.

1949
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,620
it's dark,
it's dark.

1950
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,640
It's.
It's a very weird aspect of society that

1951
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,980
it not only that exists,
but that's ignored.

1952
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,360
It's ignored and almost brushed under 
the table when you start talking about 

1953
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,490
war and about policy.
This is something that people don't want

1954
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:48,491
to acknowledge,
that we have been duped by the military 

1955
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:50,120
industrial complex in the past and that 
it is actually many standard,

1956
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:55,450
standard operational procedure that they
will come up with different ways in 

1957
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:58,520
order to get people to support Warren.
One of them is the lie.

1958
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:03,200
You know when,
when guys come back,

1959
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,190
the big one is ptsd.
That's,

1960
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:12,191
that's the the the hardest aspect.
It seems to to integrate back into a 

1961
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:15,950
normal society with normal life and 
normal jobs and normal.

1962
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,100
Just the things that we all just deal 
with on a regular basis.

1963
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:22,700
For some folks it becomes almost 
unbearable.

1964
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
What is the difference between people 
that integrate smoothly and people that 

1965
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:30,350
have an incredibly difficult time,

1966
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:31,680
you know,
from,

1967
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:35,760
from that incredibly difficult time to 
smoothly are all scales,

1968
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:40,790
you know,
and the biggest or the factors are the 

1969
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:42,030
degrees of coping mechanisms that,
that an individual has.

1970
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,640
I have a very strong family,
you know,

1971
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:46,980
like an amazing wife.
Fantastic father and mother.

1972
01:27:46,981 --> 01:27:49,380
They're still married.
Amazing brother and sister.

1973
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,210
Great.
Like so family unit.

1974
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:54,570
Very supportive.
I'm very fit and very healthy.

1975
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:59,670
I'm well educated as well trained.
These are all different mechanisms to 

1976
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:00,930
deal with stress.
Everybody deals with stress differently,

1977
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:04,440
but the foundation of how you deal with 
stress,

1978
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:09,680
you have to have these fundamental 
elements to be able to do the more of 

1979
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,110
them that you have,
the more stress you can deal with.

1980
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:15,570
So a guy like me that was ranger sniper,
green baret like killed.

1981
01:28:15,571 --> 01:28:19,710
Lots of dudes can come back and sleep 
well at night,

1982
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:20,190
you know?
Yeah.

1983
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:21,630
I had to adjust.
There are things that,

1984
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,870
you know,
like I had moments where a guy smoking a

1985
01:28:24,871 --> 01:28:27,120
clove that may be just aided Indian 
restaurant.

1986
01:28:27,121 --> 01:28:30,000
So I'm having some sensory to like how 
he smells,

1987
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:34,650
listening to music from that culture 
that I just spent six,

1988
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,600
six months with,
you know,

1989
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,700
like I'm like,
I want to shoot this person,

1990
01:28:38,701 --> 01:28:41,070
like that instant reaction.
But then I'm like,

1991
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,150
okay,
know everything's okay.

1992
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:43,560
I'm wow.
What is that like?

1993
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:48,650
It's weird.
I was walking into a best buy and that 

1994
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:48,930
was an example.
This guy driving a yellow bmw,

1995
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:53,931
you're smoking a clove and I got this 
width of like curry and so everything 

1996
01:28:53,931 --> 01:28:54,750
was there.
Like the music,

1997
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:57,210
the look what he was wearing,
you know?

1998
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:58,060
Um,
yeah,

1999
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,630
like I was just like,
fuck,

2000
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,370
it looks like a terrorist,
a snap judgment.

2001
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:05,070
Like I just got back a couple of days,
letter later and I was like,

2002
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,220
should I shoot this person?
No,

2003
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,810
I'm in Fayetteville,
North Carolina.

2004
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:11,760
Walk into a best buy to buy the new 
avengers movie.

2005
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,560
Now there was iron man.
I remember what it was.

2006
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,990
But you were an educated

2007
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:20,070
guy and you're intelligent in respect of
introspective guy for a guy who's not.

2008
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,970
That's the problem with those coping 
mechanisms.

2009
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:28,971
Like how much does that person have?
You have a national guardsman that 

2010
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:30,690
enlisted out of high school,
him comes from a broken home.

2011
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,310
He's poor,
you know,

2012
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,720
then he goes,
he,

2013
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:34,230
he,
he,

2014
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:39,350
he enlisted to be a truck driver and 
then his truck gets blown up and they 

2015
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,200
get in a firefight and then he sees 
death.

2016
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:43,410
He saw the guy that has navigator,
just lost an arm.

2017
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:45,570
Did that guy is scarred for life.
You know,

2018
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,600
he has no kept coping mechanisms deal.
And then he comes home and he's broken 

2019
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:50,600
and he's damaged,
you know,

2020
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:50,690
like,
how,

2021
01:29:50,691 --> 01:29:54,270
how does that person reintegrate into 
society without all the necessary coping

2022
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:55,740
mechanisms?
Man,

2023
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,640
it's hard.
Um,

2024
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:58,610
when you hear it

2025
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:02,720
about stories where guys snap and uh,
there,

2026
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:07,790
there've been several over the course of
these two wars and one of the big ones 

2027
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:12,431
was uh,
a decorated guy want killing a bunch of 

2028
01:30:12,431 --> 01:30:15,371
civilians and it made,
made a lot of the rounds on these talk 

2029
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:20,411
shows or people trying to discuss like 
ptsd and traumatic events and that this 

2030
01:30:20,411 --> 01:30:25,391
guy was,
he was having real problems and 

2031
01:30:25,391 --> 01:30:27,821
reporting,
having real problems before all this 

2032
01:30:27,821 --> 01:30:30,401
happened.
And they kept sending him back over 

2033
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:30,401
there.
Do you,

2034
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:32,840
do you relate to that and you try to try
to figure it out for yourself?

2035
01:30:33,111 --> 01:30:34,820
Like when you see these stories in the 
news,

2036
01:30:34,821 --> 01:30:35,690
like how did they hit you?

2037
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:42,290
Um,
I wish I could be empathetic to like 

2038
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:42,290
I've had ptsd nightmares where I wake up
in a sweat,

2039
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:43,310
you know,
and like I put my,

2040
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:44,800
my hand through the wall,
you know,

2041
01:30:44,801 --> 01:30:46,690
my wife's like,
are you okay?

2042
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,720
You know,
like that was years ago when I first 

2043
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:51,720
came back after,
you know,

2044
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,910
some bad rough trips.
Um,

2045
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:57,760
so maybe I have some empathy to that,
but I'm,

2046
01:30:57,970 --> 01:31:02,710
the special forces unit by design is 
very tight and you know,

2047
01:31:02,711 --> 01:31:07,711
like if you're having issues I can go to
my team sergeant or I can go to my 

2048
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:07,711
senior and bounce things off off of 
them.

2049
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:13,230
I get really resentful over people 
making snap judgments about these guys 

2050
01:31:13,391 --> 01:31:14,800
that are coming back and having issues,
you know,

2051
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:16,000
like,
Oh,

2052
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:18,400
you're a veteran.
Is it safe for my kids to be around,

2053
01:31:18,401 --> 01:31:20,590
you know,
like hell yeah.

2054
01:31:20,591 --> 01:31:22,480
They're like the greatest human beings 
on the planet.

2055
01:31:22,481 --> 01:31:27,481
You don't like one in a million,
have not one was a very small percentage

2056
01:31:27,641 --> 01:31:32,641
have serious issues,
but we have to have our eyes wide open 

2057
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:35,770
about how to deal with posttraumatic 
stress and um,

2058
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:39,160
there's not one easy solution and it's a
lot of hard work to get there.

2059
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:44,510
It's not one easy solution.
There's not one standard set of 

2060
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:47,821
experiences that each veteran 
experiences over there and brings back 

2061
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:47,821
with them.
It's all,

2062
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:51,931
it varies.
And that's such an important thing that 

2063
01:31:51,931 --> 01:31:52,450
you said about the coping mechanisms 
that you have in place.

2064
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:54,800
What,
what's done to,

2065
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:56,790
to help veterans when,
when,

2066
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,250
when they come back as far as like help 
them strengthen their coping

2067
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,380
mechanisms,
help them deal with situations.

2068
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:06,220
What kind of support did they offer you?
So now,

2069
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:07,720
you know,
we've been at war for a long time.

2070
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:10,170
We have a lot of things in place where,
you know,

2071
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:13,150
frg the family readiness group is there 
for your family.

2072
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:18,151
So when you're coming back that your 
family has an understanding of what 

2073
01:32:18,151 --> 01:32:19,860
you've experienced or how to deal with 
you,

2074
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:20,470
you know,
like,

2075
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:21,430
um,
you know,

2076
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:22,300
not,
hey,

2077
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:27,301
Saturday,
you're going to be coaching kids 

2078
01:32:27,301 --> 01:32:27,301
softball Saturday night,
you know,

2079
01:32:27,301 --> 01:32:27,301
we have this,
we're going to mom and dad's for,

2080
01:32:27,301 --> 01:32:31,740
you know,
they're not like overwhelming you with 

2081
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:31,740
like American life,
which is normal to everybody else,

2082
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:36,421
unless you've been in a plywood building
for 12 months and now you're back 

2083
01:32:36,421 --> 01:32:38,750
surrounded without like thousands of 
people that you have no idea.

2084
01:32:38,751 --> 01:32:40,520
It's weird.
Um,

2085
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:47,700
so the military has done a way better 
job of trying to reintegrate soldiers 

2086
01:32:48,371 --> 01:32:53,371
back into normal life.
But then you have a lot of great 

2087
01:32:53,371 --> 01:32:56,970
organizations that are,
that are veteran started.

2088
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,520
And these guys really get it.
You know,

2089
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:01,770
like,
I'm Brian.

2090
01:33:01,771 --> 01:33:03,990
Stan is great example.
Hire heroes.

2091
01:33:03,991 --> 01:33:08,991
You know,
he's involved with getting these guys 

2092
01:33:08,991 --> 01:33:08,991
back to work.
Um,

2093
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:14,420
veterans outdoors,
like a make wish foundation for wounded 

2094
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,331
guys.
So like if you have a serious physical 

2095
01:33:17,331 --> 01:33:18,690
ailment from battle,
whether it's internal or physical,

2096
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:22,560
um,
they'll give you these crazy things just

2097
01:33:22,561 --> 01:33:23,010
to be like,
hey,

2098
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:25,230
things are okay.
You're still surrounded by friends,

2099
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:30,590
let's get you reconnected to a community
that you're involved with and do 

2100
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:31,530
something fun at the same time.
So there's a lot of different ways.

2101
01:33:31,531 --> 01:33:34,740
Like the worst thing though is when they
start throwing pills at these guys,

2102
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,580
um,
you know,

2103
01:33:35,581 --> 01:33:37,290
the pharmaceutical approach.
Whereas like,

2104
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:42,291
alright,
let's put you on an antidepressant and 

2105
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:45,070
hope for the best.
There's a lot of that freaking retarded 

2106
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:45,090
when,
when you're over there,

2107
01:33:45,091 --> 01:33:48,420
do they try to offer it to when you're 
actually in country?

2108
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,790
Uh,
not,

2109
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,480
not like antidepressants,
you know,

2110
01:33:54,481 --> 01:33:59,481
there,
there's pharmaceutical things like to 

2111
01:33:59,481 --> 01:33:59,710
keep you awake longer,
to make you alert long.

2112
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,970
I've had just like,
you're in special forces.

2113
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:03,270
I,
Hey,

2114
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:04,170
here's,
you know this.

2115
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:04,950
Well,
I mean even,

2116
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:10,070
even some great stuff,
we're like over the counter things like 

2117
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,140
I wish I had alpha brain when I was 
there,

2118
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:10,810
like,
not,

2119
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:13,260
not plugging intentionally,
but like,

2120
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:15,450
that stuff's fantastic.
You're focused,

2121
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,100
you feel good,
you're ready to go.

2122
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:22,380
You know,
that would have been a thousand times 

2123
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:22,380
better than,
you know,

2124
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:22,380
like,
Hey,

2125
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:22,560
here's,
here's something that God just sent down

2126
01:34:22,561 --> 01:34:23,560
for us to use.
You know,

2127
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:25,350
it's,
it'll keep you awake for three days.

2128
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:27,980
Awesome.
What did they give you?

2129
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,370
What?
I don't have no idea.

2130
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:31,060
You didn't even know what they were?
Not really,

2131
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,220
but I know I was awake for three days.
You know,

2132
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:37,530
I have friends who went over there and 
said they just gave him steroids.

2133
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,510
They gave him oral steroids.
Why do you want,

2134
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,450
I've never done steroids.

2135
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:44,750
Like I swear by law is holy and true.
Um,

2136
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:46,710
the where they offered an available.
Yeah.

2137
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:49,680
You know,
but we have a special forces guy.

2138
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:52,470
He's 38 years old.
This is his sixth,

2139
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,660
seventh combat tour.
We're doing two,

2140
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:59,661
three,
four hits and night a hits like 

2141
01:34:59,661 --> 01:34:59,661
missions.
You know,

2142
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:01,070
we're doing mission followup,
mission followup mission.

2143
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:06,071
We're doing a helicopter landing.
We're doing a gap where we're on a 

2144
01:35:06,071 --> 01:35:07,370
ground assault force.
And um,

2145
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,170
this guy is broken.
He's hurt.

2146
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:12,080
His physically can't keep up joint.
He needs it,

2147
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,400
you know.
And do I want to like,

2148
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:18,401
do I want the 38 year old dude next to 
me that's on steroids or do I want the 

2149
01:35:18,401 --> 01:35:20,090
one that can barely walk because 
everything hurts so bad?

2150
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:21,340
Uh,
oh,

2151
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:22,790
with a 38 year old on steroids.

2152
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:28,110
Yeah.
And that sort of brings up what we were 

2153
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:30,140
talking about before where it's the,
the discussion of tea,

2154
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:33,940
our tea when it comes to a mixed martial
arts training,

2155
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:37,400
a testosterone replacement therapy for 
sewer.

2156
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:40,770
Yeah.
For folks who don't know this,

2157
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:45,860
this debate,
they're not mixed martial arts fans and 

2158
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,120
now there's probably a lot of people 
listening to this that aren't,

2159
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:48,850
um,
for a long time,

2160
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,440
over a year,
two years,

2161
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:55,560
whatever it was,
you were allowed to get prescribed 

2162
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:58,501
testosterone.
And Brendan Schaub said it best when 

2163
01:35:58,501 --> 01:35:59,890
we're discussing it on the podcast,
he said that there's,

2164
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:04,390
there's youth and with youth you have 
elevated hormone levels,

2165
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:07,180
but you have a lack of experience.
You have a lack of knowledge.

2166
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:11,350
And then as you get older you get wiser,
you get smarter,

2167
01:36:11,351 --> 01:36:16,351
you have more knowledge,
but the body just does not respond the 

2168
01:36:16,351 --> 01:36:16,351
way it used to.

2169
01:36:16,351 --> 01:36:17,620
And Eve Edwards was talking to him and 
he was saying,

2170
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:18,720
you know,
man,

2171
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,530
you know,
he's like 37 now.

2172
01:36:20,531 --> 01:36:22,300
And he's like,
I know so much now,

2173
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:24,640
but my body just doesn't listen,
just doesn't,

2174
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,880
doesn't do what it did when I was 20 and
I didn't know as much and that this is 

2175
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,240
the name of Eve.
That's great guy.

2176
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:36,241
But there's that nature balance that is 
sort of stopped and it's placed with 

2177
01:36:38,111 --> 01:36:43,111
injections of testosterone and then 
you're introducing this weird element 

2178
01:36:43,111 --> 01:36:47,620
into one of the most dangerous sports 
competitions the world has ever known.

2179
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,480
Mixed martial arts.
One of the most.

2180
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:52,840
There's more on the line as far as your 
emotions.

2181
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:55,420
Your physical body is at risk.
There's always.

2182
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:58,720
And you're sort of.
You're changing nature.

2183
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,840
You're making it so that these old wise 
people now are Jews to the gills and 

2184
01:37:04,181 --> 01:37:08,890
they can train 17 hours a fucking day 
and it gets real weird.

2185
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:14,070
It gets real weird.
One that's for awhile was accepted by 

2186
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,200
athletic commissions.

2187
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,590
Yeah.
The youth is wasted on the young,

2188
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:21,670
you know,
like that expression is like you have 

2189
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:21,670
now,
you know,

2190
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:26,300
I'm 34.
I've been doing martial arts for 

2191
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,551
forever.
I want the body of a 22 year old with 

2192
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:28,551
what I know now.
Right now,

2193
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,780
but I can chemically do that,
you know,

2194
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:35,840
with through testosterone,
which is what guys have been able to do 

2195
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,600
for the past couple of years and it's 
dangerous,

2196
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:37,840
you know,
like in,

2197
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:38,310
in,
uh,

2198
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:40,770
if it was golf,
I wouldn't care,

2199
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,800
you know,
if it's baseball and like Sam was Sammy 

2200
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:45,800
Sosa,
mark mcgwire era.

2201
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,960
I don't really care,
but we're in a sport where we're hitting

2202
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:51,480
each other in the face and choking each 
other unconscious.

2203
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:56,830
Um,
we do not need the advantage of taking 

2204
01:37:56,830 --> 01:38:01,071
the years of experience of doing martial
arts for 20 some odd years and then 

2205
01:38:01,071 --> 01:38:03,430
giving us bodies of 20 year olds,
um,

2206
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,250
the physicality,
the recovery,

2207
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,910
the responsiveness.
It's,

2208
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:10,470
it's horrible.
You guys have been doing it.

2209
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:12,040
And now we're at this,
this,

2210
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,160
this juncture where we're now saying,
okay,

2211
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:19,161
it's not okay.
Like you can't have an athletic 

2212
01:38:19,161 --> 01:38:21,591
commission allow you to do it.
So does that mean the guys are going to 

2213
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:25,311
do it on the side and do orally?
So they don't because they know where 

2214
01:38:25,311 --> 01:38:25,590
they're going to get tested or now 
they're not being monitored.

2215
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:28,230
So there's going to do it whenever and 
however they want.

2216
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:30,570
Like what does that mean?
It's.

2217
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,410
It's scary.

2218
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,180
It is.
It's weird because there were a few guys

2219
01:38:34,181 --> 01:38:39,181
that were on it for several years and 
they were being very successful while 

2220
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:40,720
they were on it and then all of a sudden
it gets pulled away.

2221
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:45,930
So what do they do?
Do they try to bring their body up to 

2222
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:45,930
natural levels?
See,

2223
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,350
but that takes time.
It takes a long time.

2224
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,660
Yeah,
for like a,

2225
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,760
I don't know,
let's say a hypothetical 37 year old 

2226
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,531
that's been on testosterone for four or 
five years and then he can't have it 

2227
01:38:56,531 --> 01:38:59,951
anymore.
It's going to take that guy a long time 

2228
01:38:59,951 --> 01:39:03,850
if ever,
to be able to naturally produce 

2229
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:03,850
testosterone

2230
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:03,850
and he'll never have the levels that he 
had when he was.

2231
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:08,340
No,
because the levels he's had when he was 

2232
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,271
on it for 25 year olds levels and the.
The other thing is the things that you 

2233
01:39:10,271 --> 01:39:14,771
can take to bring your levels back up or
also banned things like clomid and all 

2234
01:39:14,771 --> 01:39:19,151
these different.
Their estrogen or estrogen suppressing 

2235
01:39:19,311 --> 01:39:22,430
devices.
These all these different chemicals that

2236
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:25,670
people do post steroids cycle are also 
illegal,

2237
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:30,260
so it becomes like that was what I'm 
Dennis seaver got popped for.

2238
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:35,440
He got popped for one of these posts,
steroids cycle things and now he's on 

2239
01:39:36,591 --> 01:39:38,270
the shelf for nine months because of 
this.

2240
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:39,190
People are like,
wait,

2241
01:39:39,191 --> 01:39:40,130
wait,
why was that guy?

2242
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,130
He failed a drug test because he's 
blocking estrogen.

2243
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,710
Yeah,
you have to or otherwise you're going to

2244
01:39:45,711 --> 01:39:49,310
grow breasts after you've been using 
anabolic steroids and testosterone.

2245
01:39:49,311 --> 01:39:54,311
It's like you have to,
when you will see there's there's 

2246
01:39:54,311 --> 01:39:54,680
testosterone replacement.

2247
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:57,200
Like if you went to a doctor and you 
said,

2248
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,390
Hey doc,
I'm 60 years old.

2249
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:03,170
I would like to get on some testosterone
and have a better quality of life.

2250
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:08,220
The doctor will give you a slow dose of 
testosterone slowly ramp you up.

2251
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:09,860
He's not gonna,
Bam,

2252
01:40:09,861 --> 01:40:11,840
Jack you and turn you into a 20 year 
old,

2253
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:17,110
but with a lot of fighters are doing is 
they're taking way more than you would 

2254
01:40:17,110 --> 01:40:18,560
have when you were 20 and what happens 
is your body goes,

2255
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:21,350
what the fuck is going on?
And it grows tits.

2256
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:26,590
Literally,
your body starts producing massive 

2257
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:28,751
amounts of estrogen to counteract a 
massive amounts of testosterone in your 

2258
01:40:28,751 --> 01:40:33,101
body,
gets so confused as to these levels of 

2259
01:40:33,101 --> 01:40:35,741
hormones that are completely 
supernatural in your body and under 

2260
01:40:35,741 --> 01:40:36,920
those conditions,
under those conditions,

2261
01:40:36,921 --> 01:40:41,921
you develop bitch tits and a lot of guys
have had them and you'll see this weird 

2262
01:40:41,921 --> 01:40:46,390
like thing that you see these jelly like
growing around their nipples.

2263
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:51,641
And I've seen guys,
whether they bounce up and down in the 

2264
01:40:51,641 --> 01:40:52,070
cage and they're there,
they have tents.

2265
01:40:52,071 --> 01:40:52,320
It's

2266
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,000
remarkable to me where people don't 
understand like we're a pugilistic 

2267
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,901
sport,
like guys are trying to take every 

2268
01:41:02,901 --> 01:41:02,901
advantage,
every shortcut that they possibly can,

2269
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,570
you know,
like you and I can look into dude and we

2270
01:41:04,571 --> 01:41:07,620
like just from the texture of his skin.
Um,

2271
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,660
can know,
like if he's on a cycle,

2272
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,880
if he's off a cycle,
if he was on a cycle,

2273
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:14,320
you know,
like the texture of their skin.

2274
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:19,321
You mean like Zits on the asked me for 
acne scarring or what's possible that 

2275
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,570
they have that naturally possible.
Some guys,

2276
01:41:22,571 --> 01:41:23,920
you know,
it is a sign,

2277
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:24,980
it is a sign,
you know,

2278
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,580
and then they have bitched hits another 
sign,

2279
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,510
another clue,
you know,

2280
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:33,511
or like a guy looked one way five years 
ago when he was 32 and now he's 37 and 

2281
01:41:34,211 --> 01:41:35,650
he looks 10,
10,000

2282
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:37,570
times better than he ever has in his 
whole entire life.

2283
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,920
You're talking about Vito Belfort?
No,

2284
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:43,921
I'm just kidding.
I'm just giving you an example of 

2285
01:41:43,921 --> 01:41:43,921
perhaps another clue.
Yes,

2286
01:41:43,921 --> 01:41:48,660
I am.
Just so we're not being unclear about 

2287
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:51,040
that.
Talk about what we were talking about 

2288
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:51,400
before the show or is that the offer?
No,

2289
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:52,090
no.
Okay.

2290
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:53,880
So you know,
he,

2291
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:58,950
he was the,
he's a scapegoat I think a little bit 

2292
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:59,170
for trt because there's a bigger problem
for the,

2293
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:03,400
you know,
for the entire sport where a,

2294
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,780
he in my opinion just personified a 
problem and then you know,

2295
01:42:07,781 --> 01:42:12,781
everybody like pinned everything on him.
But it was a big problem throughout the 

2296
01:42:12,781 --> 01:42:14,290
whole entire sports which is performance
enhancing drugs.

2297
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:19,590
And is it right for a 37 year old dude 
like theater bell for it to be on 

2298
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:23,830
testosterone for five years,
look amazing and fantastic while he's on

2299
01:42:23,831 --> 01:42:28,090
it and nothing like he did five years 
ago where he was struggling,

2300
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,740
you know,
like winning a fight,

2301
01:42:29,741 --> 01:42:34,741
losing a fight when now,
now he's like knocking guys out with 

2302
01:42:34,741 --> 01:42:34,900
crazy fight of the night,
fight of the year,

2303
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:37,270
like knockout of the night,
knock out of the year type stuff.

2304
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:38,350
Um,
you know,

2305
01:42:38,351 --> 01:42:43,351
you can't have that turnaround.
And then like stopped testosterone and 

2306
01:42:43,351 --> 01:42:43,690
two months later he's ready to go.
No,

2307
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:44,830
that's chemical,
you know,

2308
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,690
like,
that doesn't work that way.

2309
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:51,950
How does a guy get off of it in that 
short of a time and then have the 

2310
01:42:52,211 --> 01:42:57,211
ability to compete again?
It would seem like it would take like a 

2311
01:42:57,211 --> 01:42:57,211
year to just,
if ever.

2312
01:42:57,211 --> 01:42:58,240
Yeah.
Chemically.

2313
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:00,990
There's no way around it.
No,

2314
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:01,420
there's,
I,

2315
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,670
I,
I'm,

2316
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,120
I'm not a doctor,
you know.

2317
01:43:04,121 --> 01:43:06,640
But having been a professional athlete 
for 13 years,

2318
01:43:06,641 --> 01:43:11,641
I've never seen somebody that was so 
responsive to testosterone like,

2319
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:18,180
like he was.
And then come clean and try to be an 

2320
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:22,681
athlete like he like they wore when they
are using performance enhancing drugs 

2321
01:43:22,681 --> 01:43:26,250
afterwards and just like miraculously 
been as good as they were when they are 

2322
01:43:26,621 --> 01:43:27,940
on.
It never has never happened.

2323
01:43:27,941 --> 01:43:30,610
I can't,
I can't think of like a single sport,

2324
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:34,390
a single sportsmen in history where they
got popped.

2325
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,380
They are watched closely and then 
performed as well after that point.

2326
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:40,630
You know,
ever.

2327
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:43,540
Yeah.
I completely agree with you that it's so

2328
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:45,850
different than baseball and all these 
other things.

2329
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:51,000
What I don't like about the baseball,
a steroid controversy is that a young 

2330
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:51,980
kid

2331
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,790
who's coming up who wants to play 
baseball almost has to do it in order to

2332
01:43:55,791 --> 01:44:00,791
compete.
So when there's a guy like Mark Mcguire 

2333
01:44:00,791 --> 01:44:00,830
who's juice to the gills crushing the 
ball out of the stadium,

2334
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:04,100
a young guy coming up that wants to be 
like Mark Mcguire,

2335
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:10,350
most likely,
unless you have incredible genetics and 

2336
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:12,250
genetic specimen,
just a weird freak of nature.

2337
01:44:12,251 --> 01:44:13,570
Some,
you know,

2338
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,600
some,
some guy was just the extreme mesomorph 

2339
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:18,600
you'll probably knock it ever be able to
do that.

2340
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,100
And uh,
yeah,

2341
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:23,380
that,
that to me sucks that a young guy has to

2342
01:44:23,381 --> 01:44:28,381
risk his endocrine system and put it in.
But there's such a big difference 

2343
01:44:28,381 --> 01:44:30,020
between that and a combat sport.
Yeah.

2344
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,010
Yeah.
I don't know what the solution is.

2345
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:38,300
Testing,
testing right around testing random 

2346
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:38,800
testing in fight camp post-fight,
you know,

2347
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,030
like right now,
um,

2348
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,190
you know,
fought two weeks ago.

2349
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:44,650
I'm getting back into training two,
three times a day.

2350
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,560
Like this is when you,
this is when a guy test them,

2351
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:48,810
test them,
you know,

2352
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:50,310
like,
just show up high.

2353
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:53,380
Yeah.
Joe Silva is about to throw an offer,

2354
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:54,130
you know,
my way,

2355
01:44:54,131 --> 01:44:57,750
let's say in to fight and 10 weeks,
he knows he's gonna throw it off from my

2356
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,340
way before he throws the off from my 
way,

2357
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:05,640
a guy from the athletic commission to 
the respective state that I'm going to 

2358
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:05,640
be fighting in shows up and says,
Hey,

2359
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,570
pee in the cup.
Um,

2360
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:10,920
that's how you're going to get a fair,
equal system,

2361
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,110
you know,
not where you sit.

2362
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,530
Tell a guy in Brazil,
hey,

2363
01:45:14,531 --> 01:45:15,970
you need to come up here and take a drug
test.

2364
01:45:15,971 --> 01:45:17,730
And he's like,
Oh yeah man,

2365
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,960
I'll be there.
And like four days.

2366
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,520
No,
no dude,

2367
01:45:21,521 --> 01:45:26,521
like athletic commission guy shows up 
the randomly and.

2368
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:28,870
Right they're feeding of the cup

2369
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:33,990
and when you catch someone it can't.
I think it should be more than nine 

2370
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:37,771
months and you know,
I think in this day and age you should 

2371
01:45:37,771 --> 01:45:37,771
let everybody know,
hey look,

2372
01:45:37,771 --> 01:45:42,330
we're going to cut you.
You're not going to fight for this 

2373
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:42,730
organization anymore.
And let them know and then just say,

2374
01:45:42,731 --> 01:45:44,080
this is the rule.
This is,

2375
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:47,200
this is where we're at right now.
So everyone's been served.

2376
01:45:47,201 --> 01:45:52,201
Notice everyone knows what the 
repercussions are of this illegal 

2377
01:45:52,201 --> 01:45:55,321
activity that puts people in jeopardy.
My real concern is medical science is 

2378
01:45:55,841 --> 01:45:59,550
not going to stop medical science and 
the.

2379
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,300
The innovative.
Yeah,

2380
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,420
the,
the way guys are going to sleep,

2381
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:07,350
not just cheap but just the things that 
they're going to come up with to,

2382
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:12,410
to change the human body.
There's restorative capabilities of new 

2383
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:16,651
advancements and new techniques.
Like you could say that like getting in 

2384
01:46:16,691 --> 01:46:18,070
that cryo chamber.

2385
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:21,490
If you can do that cryo chamber and 
another guy can't do that cryo chamber,

2386
01:46:21,491 --> 01:46:24,160
do you have an advantage?
Is it an unfair advantage?

2387
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:25,930
You know,
where do you draw the line?

2388
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,780
Because should you be able to take 
creatine will create a teen's legal?

2389
01:46:28,781 --> 01:46:31,630
Doesn't that increase muscle power?
And it does,

2390
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:33,400
it increases your ability to work 
harder.

2391
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,980
It's like,
where is the line?

2392
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:41,010
Can you take tribulus can you take on 
it's t plus we're having great results 

2393
01:46:42,251 --> 01:46:46,420
with that t plus stuff where guys are 
showing he's 50 percent increases in,

2394
01:46:46,421 --> 01:46:46,950
in,
in,

2395
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:51,980
in rates of lifting,
and they're there the rate of progress 

2396
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,420
over people that are not taking it and 
double blind placebos.

2397
01:46:53,421 --> 01:46:54,600
Like what?
When,

2398
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:59,601
when do you,
when does it become legal and when it's 

2399
01:46:59,601 --> 01:47:01,971
become cheating,
when is it like a nice supplement and 

2400
01:47:01,971 --> 01:47:03,540
when is it a performance enhancing drug?

2401
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:09,110
I think one of the big things is what 
does it do to your body in the long run?

2402
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:13,430
You know,
when you're using it as a supplement,

2403
01:47:13,431 --> 01:47:18,431
we'll just call them all supplements 
that will just even remove performance 

2404
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:18,431
enhancing drugs from,
from,

2405
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:18,920
uh,
the discussion,

2406
01:47:18,921 --> 01:47:23,921
just a supplement that does in the short
term great benefits in the long term,

2407
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:25,940
big damage.
You know,

2408
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:29,720
when you have wwe stars that are dying 
at 41 from heart attacks,

2409
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:31,160
you know,
and Lo and behold,

2410
01:47:31,161 --> 01:47:32,750
they've been doing steroids for 12 
years.

2411
01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:33,440
You know,
it's,

2412
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:34,580
it's tragic.
It's sad,

2413
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,180
but not

2414
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:37,750
pricing isn't a lot of those guys that 
the pain pills,

2415
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:41,890
those guys are folks who don't respect 
pro wrestlers either.

2416
01:47:41,891 --> 01:47:43,390
I know a lot of people think that,
oh,

2417
01:47:43,391 --> 01:47:44,650
it's all fake.
Silly.

2418
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:50,100
Those guys work hard at is image their 
bodies all the time.

2419
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:54,580
If you watch those guys flying through 
the air and jumping on each other,

2420
01:47:54,581 --> 01:47:57,640
that's not a free ride.
They're getting hurt all the time.

2421
01:47:57,910 --> 01:48:02,320
And a huge problem in that world is guys
that get hooked on pain pills,

2422
01:48:02,321 --> 01:48:04,540
man.
Well the damage

2423
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:06,930
body,
but then they have a show next Saturday.

2424
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,720
They have to like,
you know,

2425
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:10,680
Mcmahon's like,
no,

2426
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:13,680
you got to perform bro.
That's like you're your own contract.

2427
01:48:13,681 --> 01:48:14,780
You're going to get paid.
Like,

2428
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,750
I can't move my hands right now.
Like I can't use my fingers.

2429
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:20,100
All right,
well take this,

2430
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:25,410
you know,
now everything doesn't hurt and you'll 

2431
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:25,410
be able to perform

2432
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:25,750
because that's what's important.
Yeah.

2433
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:30,830
Becomes like a thing where there's,
there's things that you can take that 

2434
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:32,370
elevate your body's natural production 
of testosterone and they,

2435
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:37,371
they can enhance your body's production,
but what they don't do is introduced 

2436
01:48:37,371 --> 01:48:39,430
synthetic versions of it that shut down 
your endocrine system.

2437
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:44,640
What they don't do is give you these 
hyper human levels that are causing you 

2438
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,150
to grow tits.
You know,

2439
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:51,340
there's,
there's got to be like a comfortable 

2440
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:54,511
medium between eating healthy,
having benefits like the cryo chamber 

2441
01:48:54,521 --> 01:48:57,070
and all these different things that do 
enhance recovery.

2442
01:48:57,490 --> 01:49:00,400
But don't put you in your body in 
danger.

2443
01:49:00,401 --> 01:49:03,880
Don't burn you out in the short term,
you know,

2444
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:06,040
to give you the rest of your life.
You're,

2445
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:06,970
you're fucked.
You know,

2446
01:49:06,971 --> 01:49:09,850
from 35 on,
your body's just devastated.

2447
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,420
It's,
it's not going to be black and white.

2448
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:13,490
You know,
it's not going to be a line drawn in the

2449
01:49:13,491 --> 01:49:14,120
sand,
you know,

2450
01:49:14,121 --> 01:49:15,950
that line needs to be able to be moved,
you know,

2451
01:49:15,951 --> 01:49:20,951
it needs to have commissions and medical
professionals that can adjust and adapt 

2452
01:49:20,951 --> 01:49:21,810
to what's happening,
you know,

2453
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:23,390
with the growth of science,
you know,

2454
01:49:23,391 --> 01:49:26,060
like there's a reason why we're breaking
records every Olympics.

2455
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:27,390
We're getting better,
you know,

2456
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,900
like with the human body,
how to make it perform better.

2457
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,440
I'm having people that are smarter than 
me,

2458
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:38,470
like figure out where those lines are 
and move them so that you don't have to 

2459
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,990
get that line,
has to be there,

2460
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:39,900
you know,
um,

2461
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,170
it can be a mobile line that they,
they move,

2462
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,070
you know,
from year to year.

2463
01:49:43,071 --> 01:49:46,280
But that line has to be there.
And when guys step across it,

2464
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,070
um,
you know,

2465
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,570
there has to be recut repercussions.

2466
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:53,870
My concern is what's really going to 
happen in the future,

2467
01:49:53,871 --> 01:49:57,440
which happens with almost anything that 
involves human innovation.

2468
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:02,620
Like if you look back at the cell phones
of the 19 nineties where they had these 

2469
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:06,071
fucking giant bricks and they'd hold 
them up to the head and have videos and 

2470
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:08,150
now you can go anywhere in the world in 
a third world country,

2471
01:50:08,151 --> 01:50:11,240
in a impoverished neighborhood,
and people have these really small,

2472
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:16,630
incredibly complex cell phones that are 
just these magical devices that allow 

2473
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:19,490
you to interface with the entire 
knowledge base of the world and they're.

2474
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:23,510
They're everywhere.
I wonder what's going to happen when you

2475
01:50:23,511 --> 01:50:26,180
have the kind of technology that they're
working on right now,

2476
01:50:26,181 --> 01:50:31,181
genetic engineering at a,
at a cellular level where they're able 

2477
01:50:31,181 --> 01:50:31,310
to change people.
I mean,

2478
01:50:31,311 --> 01:50:36,311
I'm sure you're aware of the mild stat 
inhibitors like these things that they 

2479
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:36,311
use with.

2480
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:37,940
Well,
they've demonstrated in whippets.

2481
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,180
These dogs were just because of 
breeding.

2482
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:46,420
Just a just a mistake and breeding.
They've produced these super hyper 

2483
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,610
muscular dogs that have double the 
muscle in cows as well.

2484
01:50:49,611 --> 01:50:51,590
Have you ever seen those images?
It's incredible,

2485
01:50:51,591 --> 01:50:52,610
right?
Well,

2486
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:57,670
people are being born just born with it.
A kid in Germany was born just a genetic

2487
01:50:57,681 --> 01:50:59,930
mistake or,
or a benefit to him.

2488
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,790
Well,
they're gonna be able to figure that out

2489
01:51:01,791 --> 01:51:05,530
with a pill or the shot and you're 
fucking mailman is going to have it.

2490
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,250
Your mailman is gonna.
Look like the hulk.

2491
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:10,490
And when that happens,
when it's everywhere,

2492
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:12,170
what is,
what do we do with athletes?

2493
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:16,360
Have the Germans were trying it with 
your genetics.

2494
01:51:16,361 --> 01:51:21,361
You know,
like we've done it periodically 

2495
01:51:21,361 --> 01:51:21,361
throughout history.
The spartans did it,

2496
01:51:21,361 --> 01:51:21,400
you know,
they did it at spartans do.

2497
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,940
They'd throw babies that didn't meet 
their requirements off the cliff.

2498
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:31,640
Yeah.
This huge genetics at a very primal 

2499
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:33,490
level of it happens in nature all the 
time where a mom will be like,

2500
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:36,490
this cup is not gonna be able to walk.
I'm leaving it,

2501
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:38,330
you know?
So like,

2502
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:40,150
that's your genetics.
That's survival of the fittest.

2503
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:43,990
Now we as super too smart for our own 
good.

2504
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:48,991
Sometimes humans can take huge genetics 
and fix it with chemistry.

2505
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:51,660
That's scary.
You know,

2506
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:54,720
where we can just magically pop out like
superhuman.

2507
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:56,380
I don't.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

2508
01:51:57,050 --> 01:52:00,440
I don't know anyone's ready for the 
implications of what that means morally.

2509
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:05,500
If we don't get hit by an asteroid or 
invaded by aliens or blow each other up 

2510
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,060
with nukes,
it's common there.

2511
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:11,240
They're not going to stop.
There's egg heads that are in 

2512
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:14,081
laboratories right now that are 
constantly working on new shit and 

2513
01:52:14,081 --> 01:52:15,500
that's what they do and that's what 
humans do.

2514
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,020
We push the boundaries of innovation.
We always have.

2515
01:52:18,021 --> 01:52:23,021
It's part of what makes us human.
It's why we're on a podcast right now 

2516
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:24,290
talking to a microphone that neither you
nor I could have ever figured out on her

2517
01:52:24,291 --> 01:52:29,291
own.
It's just a part of the program and 

2518
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:29,291
they're going to figure out something,
man.

2519
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:32,921
They're going to inject you with Nano 
bots or some sort of a new chemical that

2520
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:35,600
allows your body to work like Spiderman.
I mean,

2521
01:52:35,601 --> 01:52:37,340
you're going to fucking climb walls.
You're gonna.

2522
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:42,690
You're going to have incredible balance.
They're going to figure out a way to 

2523
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:44,150
stop traumatic brain injury by 
reengineering the human mind.

2524
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:48,170
This is going to be a of crazy shit.
It might not be in our lifetimes,

2525
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:53,320
but are killed.
Our Children's children for sure are 

2526
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:55,991
going to experience human beings that no
one has ever experienced in the entire 

2527
01:52:55,991 --> 01:52:57,470
history of the,
of the world itself.

2528
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:00,830
It's coming,
it's coming by human innovation.

2529
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:02,750
It's gonna,
leapfrog,

2530
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:03,500
evolution.

2531
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:08,520
I'm not sure I want to.
I'm going to kind of sad that I'm going 

2532
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,250
to miss it.
Maybe I want to reap the benefits of it,

2533
01:53:09,251 --> 01:53:11,890
but then at the flip,
I don't want to have to deal with,

2534
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:13,380
uh,
the,

2535
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,120
you know,
the implications of that.

2536
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:19,600
I'm sad that I'm going to miss it too.
Or we might not miss it.

2537
01:53:19,601 --> 01:53:23,140
We might just catch the wave,
but I'm also,

2538
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:27,190
I'm glad that I saw the world before.
A lot of shit was.

2539
01:53:27,191 --> 01:53:30,400
They're like,
my kids are gonna grow up in a world.

2540
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:35,410
I have a 17 year old and she doesn't 
have any idea what life was like before 

2541
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:35,800
the Internet.
She has no idea.

2542
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:37,660
The Internet is always been there.
She has a question.

2543
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:38,950
Oh,
there's the answer.

2544
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:44,460
I grew up.
I was retarded when I was her age and I 

2545
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:44,460
put it in her head every day I go,
let me tell you,

2546
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:47,230
if you met me,
if I was 17 and you were 17,

2547
01:53:47,231 --> 01:53:48,160
you would think,
oh my God,

2548
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:50,920
this is the dumbest fucking guy that's 
ever walked the face of the earth,

2549
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:53,620
and he thinks he's so smart.
I was an idiot.

2550
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,920
I knew how to throw kicks and I knew 
which Stephen King books I liked.

2551
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:04,050
That's it.
I knew what the right combination of 

2552
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:04,570
words to say to get a girl to fuck me 
sometimes.

2553
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:05,890
That's it.
That's all I knew.

2554
01:54:05,891 --> 01:54:10,891
I was a moron.
Like what a 17 year old knows today as 

2555
01:54:10,891 --> 01:54:14,461
opposed to what they knew when I was.
Now the future is going to be even 

2556
01:54:14,461 --> 01:54:16,990
crazier than that,
but at least I got a perspective.

2557
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:22,020
I got to see what it was like to grow up
where you didn't know if you called 

2558
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:24,550
someone and they weren't home.
They just weren't fucking home.

2559
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:29,940
You know?
I remember when answering machines were 

2560
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:30,310
invented where people were like,
Holy Shit

2561
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,610
again,
the Internet and you'd hear this,

2562
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,050
and it was slow.
As fuck,

2563
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:40,630
and if you wanted to see a picture of 
something or be like click,

2564
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:41,260
click,
click,

2565
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:41,920
click,
click,

2566
01:54:41,921 --> 01:54:42,880
click,
click,

2567
01:54:42,881 --> 01:54:43,500
click,
click,

2568
01:54:43,570 --> 01:54:45,310
white and green.
Yeah.

2569
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:47,500
Variations of those three.
Oh yeah,

2570
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:48,320
yeah.

2571
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:53,360
I remember when Internet searches first 
came about to when you first find.

2572
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:55,390
I got a great story.
There was a,

2573
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:57,560
we don't even need to say the name of 
the organization,

2574
01:54:57,561 --> 01:55:02,561
but a buddy of mine used to be co owner 
of a small mixed martial arts 

2575
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:07,811
organization and this was in the late 
nineties and they were just starting to 

2576
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:13,780
promote fighters through the Internet 
and they were just starting to do bios 

2577
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:18,970
where they would research a guy through 
the internet where they researched this 

2578
01:55:18,970 --> 01:55:20,450
guy and they find out that a guy with 
the exact same name,

2579
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:23,480
one something called the hungry as but 
contest.

2580
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:26,300
Oh No.
So they're,

2581
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,790
they're gladiator there.
Heavyweight,

2582
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:30,330
there,
Adonis,

2583
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:35,440
six foot four,
shredded man with his penthouse pet 

2584
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:35,610
girlfriend,
you know,

2585
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:37,160
that he would parade around at all these
events.

2586
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:39,980
Also had done gay porn.
And so,

2587
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:42,230
uh,
they pulled down the picture,

2588
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:43,860
these downloads and pictures,

2589
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,870
and my friend described as like,
Isi,

2590
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:46,290
click,
click,

2591
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:47,100
click,
click,

2592
01:55:47,101 --> 01:55:47,550
click,
click,

2593
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:50,040
you know,
have those pictures would slowly show up

2594
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:51,930
on a 56 k modem.
It would like,

2595
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:54,810
you would get the top of it and it would
slowly start to pan down.

2596
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,030
And as it pans now what that looks like,
his hair,

2597
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:59,610
click the click that looks like it could
be his forehead.

2598
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:01,290
Click well that's his eyes.
Click,

2599
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:01,730
click,
click.

2600
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:04,380
That's dig in his mouth.
Oh my God.

2601
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:06,500
And this is a ticket his ass.
Oh my God.

2602
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,180
There was two guys using him like 
Chinese finger handcuffs.

2603
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:10,740
And they're like,
whoa.

2604
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:15,960
And so this dude had no idea that,
that was even possible to internet.

2605
01:56:15,961 --> 01:56:18,000
He'd used the same name,
you know,

2606
01:56:18,001 --> 01:56:20,040
he just figured and no one is going to 
look that up.

2607
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:23,190
But homos.
And then they did.

2608
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:24,620
Yeah.
When they said,

2609
01:56:24,621 --> 01:56:29,621
you know,
he needed a lot of money and they gave 

2610
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:29,621
him some money.

2611
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:29,621
So he did it once.
Turn.

2612
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:30,760
I did like 100 films,
you know,

2613
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:32,700
it was a lot.
He's doing really good.

2614
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:36,840
How good could it be?
The joke is I would say,

2615
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:39,930
you know,
what is a lot of money mean to you?

2616
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:45,180
A lot of money to me means I do one gay 
porno and I live like in a video for the

2617
01:56:45,181 --> 01:56:50,181
rest of my life and I'm in my underwear 
with two bottles of cristal on a yacht 

2618
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:52,440
with a thousand models forever.
That's.

2619
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:58,100
We did 100 porns.
He should have all the money on the 

2620
01:56:58,100 --> 01:56:59,790
planet by my calculations.
There's no one Richard ever anywhere.

2621
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:03,480
And it fucking is con fuck everyone has 
ever lived.

2622
01:57:03,481 --> 01:57:04,620
Has got.
Who's got money?

2623
01:57:04,621 --> 01:57:08,130
That guy would have all the money.
Every country would be bankrupt and this

2624
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:09,900
guy's bank account would have all the 
cash.

2625
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:15,650
Yeah,
but the thing is it's just like no one 

2626
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:18,651
knew before that,
that an internet search was a 

2627
01:57:18,651 --> 01:57:21,741
possibility.
And think about how many people that 

2628
01:57:21,741 --> 01:57:23,781
have done things that just had no idea 
what you're going to be able to find 

2629
01:57:23,781 --> 01:57:27,231
that out.
Like how could and now and find it out 

2630
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:27,231
on your phone just.

2631
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:32,000
Yep.
And be able to access the person that 

2632
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,230
said content is about like,
no,

2633
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:38,480
never in our history in May kinds 
existence have we been able to connect 

2634
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,380
so effortlessly to so many different 
people,

2635
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,190
you know,
like,

2636
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:46,420
like a fan that doesn't like me.
You can just get on twitter and like 

2637
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,460
tell me that I'm a baby killer.
Like just because,

2638
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:49,860
you know,
or they can do anything anytime,

2639
01:57:49,861 --> 01:57:51,720
anywhere and they can,
you know,

2640
01:57:51,721 --> 01:57:56,721
like you can find out anything about 
anybody and then probably breached that 

2641
01:57:56,721 --> 01:57:56,721
person,

2642
01:57:56,721 --> 01:58:00,520
especially a fighter or someone who's 
got a social media account or a 

2643
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:00,650
president of a social media account.
You know,

2644
01:58:00,651 --> 01:58:04,300
like there's a few folks that I know 
that just avoid it all together,

2645
01:58:04,301 --> 01:58:05,620
but they don't have to do it.

2646
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:09,190
50 million people here,
like almost all of them,

2647
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,060
like $300

2648
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,030
and Mexicans,
14 account Mexicans.

2649
01:58:12,031 --> 01:58:14,620
It's probably another 50 million a 
lease.

2650
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:15,910
I don't know.
Who knows how many.

2651
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:18,190
I love Mexicans,
don't get me wrong,

2652
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:21,280
but there's a lot of them that aren't 
taking the census.

2653
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:27,320
Um,
how often do you get fucked with on 

2654
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,320
social media?
All the time.

2655
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,320
All the time

2656
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:29,040
I,
I guess I'm like a polarizing figure.

2657
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,470
I don't know how I think I'm a likable 
guy,

2658
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:33,150
but some for some reason

2659
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:36,950
people have a problem with strength.
People have a problem with competence.

2660
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:42,280
People have a problem with,
with folks that have strong opinions or 

2661
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:42,280
controversial opinions,

2662
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,930
and instead of those,
well,

2663
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,950
you know,
you should.

2664
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:50,550
I think anybody who's paying attention 
to the world and sees all the 

2665
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:52,540
contradictory information that we're 
receiving,

2666
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:53,970
sees the chaos,
sees,

2667
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:57,610
just sees how fucked our political 
system is.

2668
01:58:57,611 --> 01:59:00,640
Our financial system.
If you don't have strong opinions,

2669
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:02,710
if you don't have controversial 
opinions,

2670
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:05,140
you're not paying attention to your 
eyes.

2671
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:06,450
You know?
I mean,

2672
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:11,460
I can't tell you how many conversations 
I've had about gun control just about 

2673
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:13,360
guns itself.
I'm like,

2674
01:59:13,361 --> 01:59:15,490
God damn,
guns aren't the problem.

2675
01:59:15,491 --> 01:59:18,130
It's people that use guns that are the 
problem.

2676
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:18,940
You leave,
uh,

2677
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:20,770
you know,
that old adage,

2678
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:25,800
guns don't kill people.
People kill people and people will 

2679
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:25,800
fucking argue that to the end of time.
God dammit.

2680
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,370
It's true.
Every time you go to the gas station,

2681
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,370
you got a store in that gas station that
sells the lighters.

2682
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:35,580
You got fluid that comes out of a pump 
and anyone can just light people on 

2683
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:37,670
fire.
I mean it's it.

2684
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:40,090
Anyone can do it.
It hasn't happened that often,

2685
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,410
but anyone can do it.

2686
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:46,410
Or just take your car and turn two 
degrees to the right and run down the 

2687
01:59:46,410 --> 01:59:46,410
sidewalk.
Yeah.

2688
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:49,210
The,
the option to kill is always there.

2689
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,680
It's always there.
It's a choice,

2690
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:51,790
you know?
And they're like,

2691
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:56,791
but it's a tool.
It's a mechanism that serves no other 

2692
01:59:56,791 --> 01:59:56,791
purpose.
You know,

2693
01:59:56,791 --> 01:59:56,791
a car can get you from point a to point 
b.

2694
01:59:56,791 --> 02:00:00,350
So why do they need a gun with him?
The only thing it does is kill you.

2695
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:03,820
Like I could say the same thing about a 
tractor.

2696
02:00:03,821 --> 02:00:08,821
If I wanted to know,
like if I wanted to make a killer 

2697
02:00:08,821 --> 02:00:08,821
tractor,
the only thing that's designed for us to

2698
02:00:08,821 --> 02:00:10,030
kill because I put spikes on its wheels,
you know,

2699
02:00:10,031 --> 02:00:15,031
and it's not,
doesn't excavate anything besides human 

2700
02:00:15,031 --> 02:00:15,430
souls,
but no,

2701
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:17,280
it's the choice to kill,
you know,

2702
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:19,540
it's like get over it.
Get people killed

2703
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:24,660
it is is a way that they can do it 
easily and that is an issue,

2704
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:25,410
but

2705
02:00:26,410 --> 02:00:31,410
it's also why does a person have the 
ability to do that and how come so 

2706
02:00:32,471 --> 02:00:37,471
little effort and so little emphasis is 
on what causes a person to be able to 

2707
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:42,511
disconnect or to be able to have so much
hate and anger in their heart that they 

2708
02:00:42,511 --> 02:00:45,871
can kill a bunch of school children,
that they can use a gun to shoot up a 

2709
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:46,460
mall like,
wow,

2710
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:51,500
why isn't that the subject of discussion
and why is it always the tool for 

2711
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:56,191
madness?
It's not the madness itself is the tool 

2712
02:00:56,191 --> 02:00:57,490
of madness,
but that same tool can be used by anyone

2713
02:00:57,491 --> 02:01:01,090
else to do a million other things.
It's like it's a bad analogy,

2714
02:01:01,091 --> 02:01:02,620
but it's one that I always use with 
marijuana.

2715
02:01:02,621 --> 02:01:03,130
People go,
Oh,

2716
02:01:03,131 --> 02:01:04,750
you could ruin your life if you smoke 
pot.

2717
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:10,260
You could.
You could also take a hammer and hit 

2718
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:10,930
yourself in the Dick.
You know,

2719
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,910
should.
Should we make hammers illegal?

2720
02:01:12,911 --> 02:01:14,710
Because you can.
Because the hammer is just a tool.

2721
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:19,780
If you take marijuana and just enjoy it 
and you don't hurt anybody,

2722
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:25,020
should that person be penalized because 
someone decided to just wake and bake 

2723
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:26,950
every day and then fucking go into debt 
and wind up.

2724
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:32,310
It's humans are the problem in human 
weakness and a lack of character and all

2725
02:01:34,331 --> 02:01:35,740
sorts of chemical imbalances

2726
02:01:35,910 --> 02:01:40,910
or the culture and the structure around 
the person that led them to make these 

2727
02:01:41,001 --> 02:01:44,300
horrific decisions and actions.
You know,

2728
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:47,060
that they use whatever tool,
don't care what it is,

2729
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:52,330
gun knife,
everything up to that point is what we 

2730
02:01:52,330 --> 02:01:55,361
should.
The emphasis of trying to understand or 

2731
02:01:55,361 --> 02:01:55,760
prevent an acknowledged and research 
should be done,

2732
02:01:55,761 --> 02:01:57,440
not take away,
you know,

2733
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:01,070
whatever it was.
That was the end conclusion.

2734
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:06,100
It's all the things up to that point 
that's that are important that nobody 

2735
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:06,100
pays attention to,
nobody cares about.

2736
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:09,540
That's what was ridiculous about it.
Any sort of control,

2737
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,730
gun control,
knife control,

2738
02:02:11,731 --> 02:02:14,850
bow and Arrow control debate.
It's not that.

2739
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,880
It's what constitutes what went,
what makes a human being capable of 

2740
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:24,621
horrific things,
and I think you're uniquely qualified 

2741
02:02:24,621 --> 02:02:24,621
for a bunch of reasons.
One,

2742
02:02:24,621 --> 02:02:28,731
because you have a family,
you know what it's like to raise a 

2743
02:02:28,731 --> 02:02:31,131
person and to.
You've seen the consequences of human 

2744
02:02:31,131 --> 02:02:35,781
beings when they're in this environment 
that is totally fucked from from the 

2745
02:02:37,021 --> 02:02:40,530
jump and you see these religious 
fanatics and you see fundamentalism,

2746
02:02:40,531 --> 02:02:45,531
you see chaos and a land that's just 
just overrun with it.

2747
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:47,460
You see it's.
It's humans.

2748
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,440
It's the development of humans

2749
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:53,520
and an error.
They use the development erroneously,

2750
02:02:53,521 --> 02:02:55,710
like the development of human,
the wrong way.

2751
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:59,400
There's the right way and there's not.
There's the right way.

2752
02:02:59,401 --> 02:03:02,090
There's about a billion right ways.
Yeah,

2753
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:03,810
there's a couple of wrong ways,
you know,

2754
02:03:03,811 --> 02:03:07,140
in a couple of wrong ways,
end up with bad products

2755
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:12,420
and it's again,
it's sort of contradictory thing that 

2756
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:14,740
through through combat and through,
especially through martial arts,

2757
02:03:14,741 --> 02:03:19,741
I think that the deepest bond of 
commitment that I've ever experienced 

2758
02:03:19,741 --> 02:03:23,890
was outside of my family is the friends 
that have trained with and people that 

2759
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:26,320
have competed with that,
that have just.

2760
02:03:26,650 --> 02:03:28,990
You see them.
You know who the fuck they are.

2761
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:33,160
When you see a guy breaking training,
when you see a guy with 30 seconds to go

2762
02:03:33,161 --> 02:03:36,310
in the ground,
put his hands down on his knees and just

2763
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:41,580
take deep breaths and step away,
and then you see the coach go get back 

2764
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,730
in there and you see them suck it up and
you know,

2765
02:03:42,731 --> 02:03:47,731
there's the guys who would suck it up 
and it's guys who don't and you see the 

2766
02:03:47,731 --> 02:03:47,731
difference,
you see who they are,

2767
02:03:47,731 --> 02:03:48,820
you see their soul,
you see,

2768
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:52,570
and you learn about people that way in a
way that a lot of folks don't ever get a

2769
02:03:52,571 --> 02:03:55,120
chance to learn even about themselves.

2770
02:03:55,440 --> 02:04:00,440
The refiner fire,
the refiner's fire is like this 

2771
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:00,440
beautiful thing.
You know,

2772
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:02,350
it's a refiner's fire.
Refiner's fire.

2773
02:04:02,351 --> 02:04:05,080
Yeah.
So get you take a metal refineries.

2774
02:04:05,081 --> 02:04:05,650
Yeah.
Right.

2775
02:04:05,651 --> 02:04:07,300
Okay.
When you're making a sword,

2776
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:08,170
you know,
the,

2777
02:04:08,370 --> 02:04:13,370
the folding process of heating it up and
pounding out the impurities and 14 and 

2778
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:13,370
again,
and pounding out the impurities.

2779
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:16,030
Impurities.
Like the hotter the fire,

2780
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:19,090
the more bad stuff gets cooked out.
Um,

2781
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,710
that's the same with people.
You know,

2782
02:04:20,711 --> 02:04:24,490
you put them in a room that's hot,
put them in a Ge that's hot.

2783
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:28,570
I'm around a whole bunch of other dudes 
that are like trying to choke each other

2784
02:04:28,571 --> 02:04:33,571
out and kill you.
You get glimpses of the depth and 

2785
02:04:33,571 --> 02:04:36,901
hardness of somebody's character and 
soul and see awesome snapshots and even 

2786
02:04:37,231 --> 02:04:42,231
kids like down at the youngest level,
putting them into competitions of 

2787
02:04:42,231 --> 02:04:42,240
martial arts.
You see the exact same thing.

2788
02:04:42,241 --> 02:04:45,930
You see the development of this 
character and if somebody's soul,

2789
02:04:45,931 --> 02:04:50,040
as they get tougher and deeper,
you know,

2790
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:51,180
as a,
as a human,

2791
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:56,190
and you get in indy snapshots,
you get a clear glimpse of who that 

2792
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:56,370
person is,
what's,

2793
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,690
what's,
what's part of them.

2794
02:04:57,890 --> 02:04:59,260
Like it's cool,
it's cool.

2795
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:01,200
Strong Gracie said it best.
He said,

2796
02:05:01,201 --> 02:05:01,890
uh,
you know,

2797
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:02,990
uh,
I,

2798
02:05:02,991 --> 02:05:06,480
I reserve judgment until I've trained 
with you.

2799
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:10,050
Now he said,
I think you know me.

2800
02:05:10,051 --> 02:05:11,280
You know,
you seem like a nice guy,

2801
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:13,440
but I reserve judgment until I've 
trained with you,

2802
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:16,950
which is such a great way to put it.
And you know,

2803
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:19,130
a lot of people think we're cool.
I don't want a fucking train.

2804
02:05:19,190 --> 02:05:24,190
You don't have to.
It's not that it's just you should in 

2805
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:25,800
your life do something difficult.
It is not martial arts.

2806
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,560
Maybe it's mountain climbing,
maybe it's hiking.

2807
02:05:28,561 --> 02:05:30,580
Maybe I'd run anything.
Doesn't matter.

2808
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:33,450
Do something that's hard to do.
Maybe it's write a book.

2809
02:05:33,451 --> 02:05:38,370
Find out what your fucking barriers are 
because the most reprehensible thing,

2810
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:43,371
the thing that we all pretty much 
universally despised is a spoiled rich 

2811
02:05:43,371 --> 02:05:44,850
kid,
a spoiled kid that never had to work for

2812
02:05:44,851 --> 02:05:45,210
anything.

2813
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:48,360
They were handed at their whole life,
their parents never gave them values,

2814
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:53,540
and what did they do?
They grow up yelling at servants and 

2815
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:54,230
then they become some rich asshole.
That's a sociopath.

2816
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,060
I mean that is the.
That's.

2817
02:05:56,230 --> 02:06:00,570
That's a key character in so many movies
that's in so many books,

2818
02:06:00,571 --> 02:06:05,571
literature,
we all can relate to that person who 

2819
02:06:05,571 --> 02:06:06,540
didn't earn it,
who got that place without hard work and

2820
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:08,460
how gross they are.
I hate that pussy.

2821
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:10,580
Fucking everybody does.
You're supposed to.

2822
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:13,120
It's supposed to.
They're not supposed to be there.

2823
02:06:13,121 --> 02:06:18,121
It's not supposed to happen.
You're not supposed to win the lottery 

2824
02:06:18,121 --> 02:06:18,121
like that.
That fucks you up.

2825
02:06:18,121 --> 02:06:22,410
But the really remarkable ones that are 
the ones that could or have access to 

2826
02:06:22,991 --> 02:06:26,800
all of that and then choose not to,
or on the total flip side,

2827
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:31,830
the guys that have access to none of 
that and challenge themselves and put 

2828
02:06:31,931 --> 02:06:33,940
themselves through hardships that the 
altos,

2829
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:36,310
you know,
that like they have nothing.

2830
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:38,230
And just through hard work 
determination,

2831
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,750
they become something,
you know,

2832
02:06:40,810 --> 02:06:44,830
like those are two complete polar 
opposites of a human that I just like,

2833
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:45,880
I adore.
You know,

2834
02:06:45,881 --> 02:06:48,910
like I said in the military,
you see these guys are like,

2835
02:06:49,490 --> 02:06:53,890
you were like this Ivy League,
Super Rich,

2836
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:56,740
you're enlisted.
Why are you here?

2837
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:58,240
You know,
you could have done anything.

2838
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:00,030
They're like,
I wanted to be here.

2839
02:07:00,031 --> 02:07:01,450
Like I love you.
You're amazing.

2840
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:03,220
You know.
And then then the flip side,

2841
02:07:03,230 --> 02:07:03,580
you know,
the,

2842
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:08,660
the Puerto Rican that his parents swam 
over here or on some pourable boat and 

2843
02:07:09,941 --> 02:07:10,670
um,
you know,

2844
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:15,730
they're one generation removed and they 
have like they put themselves through 

2845
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:17,080
college or maybe they joined the 
military so they could go to college and

2846
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:22,200
their ethics,
this exact same point of their life as 

2847
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:25,161
this rich Yuppie guy that are just there
because they want to see how hard they 

2848
02:07:25,870 --> 02:07:27,490
are,
how far they can push themselves.

2849
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,850
Yeah.
Humans beings are just,

2850
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:34,910
we are just a mass of potential and it's
awesome to see someone rise through 

2851
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:40,840
adversity and reach a potential that 
elevates us all.

2852
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:46,080
Because when you see someone reach their
potential or reach out very high level 

2853
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:46,080
of,
of anything,

2854
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:48,820
it changes the way you look at what's 
possible.

2855
02:07:48,821 --> 02:07:51,580
When you see a guy who gets up at 6:00
in the morning,

2856
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:56,581
the alarm clock goes off and he just 
fucking hits those hills and starts 

2857
02:07:56,581 --> 02:07:56,860
running and he does it every morning 
before work.

2858
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:57,970
You Go,
fuck,

2859
02:07:57,971 --> 02:07:59,680
I'm a bitch.
I'm just a weak bitch.

2860
02:07:59,681 --> 02:08:00,690
I don't do that.
Fuck.

2861
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,190
And then it changes your perspective.
You want to do that too.

2862
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:08,430
You want to absorb a little bit of that 
guy strengthened that feeling that you 

2863
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:11,551
get from being around that guy.
It's empowering or you're one of those 

2864
02:08:11,551 --> 02:08:15,721
guys that diminishes that and tries to 
squash it because you're insecure and 

2865
02:08:15,721 --> 02:08:17,740
you wanna you wanna tweet,
Tim Kennedy,

2866
02:08:17,741 --> 02:08:19,030
you fucking bitch.

2867
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:22,610
You look you in the mood to you mean,
you know there's,

2868
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:27,640
there's folks like that too.
I think that strength is the best 

2869
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:33,930
antidote for a lot of the weaknesses 
that we find in our society that we 

2870
02:08:33,930 --> 02:08:35,170
consider to be strength.
Like bullies.

2871
02:08:35,650 --> 02:08:37,720
People say like,
what's the best solution to bullies?

2872
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:41,050
Teach them how to fight.
Teach them all how to fight everyone.

2873
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:46,200
I think that is a core problem with men.
Men have a giant fear hanging over their

2874
02:08:47,351 --> 02:08:50,470
head all day long and that is being 
dominated by other men.

2875
02:08:50,650 --> 02:08:55,650
You know,
I mean is what led me to martial arts 

2876
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:57,130
100 percent was I was scared of dudes 
kicking my ass.

2877
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:59,980
So I got into martial arts as a very 
young kid because of that.

2878
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:05,280
And I think that the more kids,
if we had programs in school where we 

2879
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:10,081
taught martial arts to kids in class,
you would have so few instances of 

2880
02:09:10,751 --> 02:09:11,110
bullying.

2881
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:16,110
I think the dramatic decrease in 
bullying and the respect that people 

2882
02:09:16,181 --> 02:09:19,840
have for each other would change the 
respect that people have for themselves.

2883
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:23,140
Like a bully cannot respect themselves.
They just can't.

2884
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,450
Unless there's some sort of a complete 
sociopath.

2885
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:26,240
You're not,
you're,

2886
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:31,260
you're not going to be happy with 
yourself if you pick on someone smaller 

2887
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:31,260
than you,
you're doing it because you're insecure.

2888
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:35,820
But if you weren't insecure or you were 
less insecure or you had some sort of 

2889
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:36,910
sense of personal sovereignty because of
training,

2890
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:42,180
you would have less of this,
this inclination to do something shitty 

2891
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:43,390
to someone like that.
Yeah,

2892
02:09:43,450 --> 02:09:45,190
it'd be cool to see.
Fuck him,

2893
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:50,191
man.
I think martial arts programs should be 

2894
02:09:50,191 --> 02:09:51,640
mandatory in school,
just like they have pes mandatory for.

2895
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:54,340
For Boys,
especially martial arts should be.

2896
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:59,780
And you want to.
You want to see what you want to see 

2897
02:09:59,780 --> 02:09:59,780
your kid have discipline,
focus,

2898
02:09:59,780 --> 02:09:59,790
understanding of,
right and wrong.

2899
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:03,420
A little bit of confidence.
Restraint,

2900
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:07,380
martial arts,
that's why you did it.

2901
02:10:07,381 --> 02:10:08,350
So you didn't get beat up.
I,

2902
02:10:08,351 --> 02:10:10,350
I did it because,
um,

2903
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:13,080
our second born,
I was a crazy middle kid,

2904
02:10:13,081 --> 02:10:18,081
you know,
my dad's like at a very early age like 

2905
02:10:18,081 --> 02:10:18,081
you are going to be doing martial arts,
you know,

2906
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:23,880
so like I was like nine.
And I remember saying a bad word on the 

2907
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:23,940
mat and having,
you know,

2908
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:29,060
my,
my sensei come up with an a scream of 

2909
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:29,060
stick and hit me in the back of the head
and like I'm,

2910
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:29,580
I missed up and doing stuff.
And he's like,

2911
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,010
ah.
And then I said a bad word when I messed

2912
02:10:32,011 --> 02:10:32,980
up.
And then bow,

2913
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:35,210
you're like,
I didn't say that bad word again.

2914
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:40,300
And,
but more importantly I was able to 

2915
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:40,490
control myself,
which was the elements,

2916
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:42,260
the necessary element that I needed.

2917
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:46,170
And also this,
the great feeling of accomplishment that

2918
02:10:46,171 --> 02:10:48,570
you get when you learn that you can 
control yourself.

2919
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:50,700
When you feel yourself improving,
your feel,

2920
02:10:50,701 --> 02:10:55,701
your character improving and you have a 
difficult situation and you navigate it 

2921
02:10:55,701 --> 02:10:56,460
successfully.
And he goes,

2922
02:10:56,490 --> 02:11:01,490
oh,
I'm a better person now than I was when 

2923
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:02,970
I was whatever,
when I was young and stupid.

2924
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:06,840
And that's just one of those things 
where everybody wants to be comfortable.

2925
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:10,290
Everybody wants to look towards their 
golden age and everybody wants to retire

2926
02:11:10,291 --> 02:11:12,360
and sit on the couch and put your feet 
up.

2927
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:15,030
That's horseshit.
That's not you.

2928
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:20,070
You only.
You only can experience that and enjoy 

2929
02:11:20,070 --> 02:11:21,120
it if you've earned it.
No one wants to earn it.

2930
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:24,000
The earning is the most important part 
of your life.

2931
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:24,990
Individual risks,

2932
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:27,230
possibility.
Nobody has it.

2933
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:28,760
You've got to earn it.
You've got to work for it.

2934
02:11:28,761 --> 02:11:32,450
You gotta you know so much better when 
you do.

2935
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:33,430
Yes.
Well,

2936
02:11:33,431 --> 02:11:35,200
that's why I think guys like you were 
important,

2937
02:11:35,201 --> 02:11:36,950
man.
I think you set a great example of that.

2938
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:39,520
I think you said a great example with 
your words.

2939
02:11:39,521 --> 02:11:41,590
I think you set a great example with 
your actions.

2940
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,470
It's one of the reasons why I've been 
wanting to talk to you on the podcast.

2941
02:11:44,471 --> 02:11:46,630
You're a very inspirational guy in my 
opinion.

2942
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:51,990
I think you,
the way you talk about things and the 

2943
02:11:51,990 --> 02:11:51,990
way you express yourself,
it's,

2944
02:11:51,990 --> 02:11:54,880
it's admirable and I think it,
it helps people,

2945
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:58,150
it,
it sets a very high standard and I think

2946
02:11:58,151 --> 02:12:03,130
setting a high standard is one of the 
key things that young men and young,

2947
02:12:03,131 --> 02:12:05,770
I'm sure young women as well need in 
life.

2948
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,360
They need to see a high standard.

2949
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:12,560
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes probably way too much or

2950
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:17,570
more often than I'd like to admit,
but I'm always searching and seeking to 

2951
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:19,660
get better know,
like,

2952
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,860
and I think that's something that I 
always tried to project.

2953
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:24,150
Um,
you know,

2954
02:12:24,151 --> 02:12:26,220
and the only way to get theirs is like 
you've just said,

2955
02:12:26,221 --> 02:12:27,270
it's,
it's through hard work.

2956
02:12:27,271 --> 02:12:28,480
It's through determination.
It's,

2957
02:12:28,481 --> 02:12:28,840
you know,
it's,

2958
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:33,180
it's through the amazing innate part of 
the human being,

2959
02:12:33,210 --> 02:12:35,780
which is the ability to do,
you know,

2960
02:12:35,850 --> 02:12:40,850
and to not quit and to have the inner 
strength to try to achieve and surpass 

2961
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:41,880
whatever it was before.

2962
02:12:41,980 --> 02:12:44,560
And there's beauty in imperfection.
You know,

2963
02:12:44,561 --> 02:12:46,900
this idea that you're going to be this 
enlightened,

2964
02:12:46,901 --> 02:12:49,390
quite Chang Kang character electing the 
TV show.

2965
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:50,930
You got to take a leak.
Good head on.

2966
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:53,120
I saw you drinking that gigantic 
smartwater.

2967
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:58,560
There's dudes who have bladders like 
mine who could just power through a 

2968
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,340
three hour podcasts and then this guys 
like Tim Kennedy,

2969
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:01,630
you know,
it's cool.

2970
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:02,830
It's like,
you know,

2971
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:04,180
we all learn.
We just,

2972
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:05,670
we show,
we show that there's,

2973
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:08,320
there's higher levels.
My fucking bladder bro.

2974
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:11,620
It's like a duffle bag that you can 
carry guns in.

2975
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:16,210
It's large and it's durable and it gets 
dirty and filled with liquid,

2976
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,460
but don't worry about it.
I can hang in there.

2977
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:23,910
Um,
what I was saying to Tim that's 

2978
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:25,951
important is I think everybody has this 
idea that there's some guy out there 

2979
02:13:25,951 --> 02:13:27,970
that's like jet Li that's like a perfect
person.

2980
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,470
Some,
some character.

2981
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:32,790
There's the beauty really in the 
imperfection.

2982
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:38,090
The beauty is in knowing that we're all 
just these weird,

2983
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:42,150
flawed creatures that are trying to 
figure out.

2984
02:13:42,151 --> 02:13:45,160
It's not even that we're flawed.
It's just that we're,

2985
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:50,340
we're dealing with an impossible amount 
of variables that we're constantly 

2986
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:54,291
navigating.
And this idea that you should have 

2987
02:13:54,421 --> 02:13:56,850
gotten it right.
It's not what it is.

2988
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:01,880
It's the idea is that you learn from 
what you get wrong and then that thing 

2989
02:14:03,181 --> 02:14:06,010
you don't do the same way next time he 
say,

2990
02:14:06,011 --> 02:14:11,011
you know what?
I made a mistake the last time I was in 

2991
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:11,070
a similar situation.
Now I know that,

2992
02:14:11,071 --> 02:14:15,540
and so now I'm going to power through 
with the knowledge that I've accumulated

2993
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:18,610
in my life from my past mistakes.
That's a,

2994
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:23,790
that's a huge factor about being a 
person of huge factor is that we're all 

2995
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:25,740
learning from each other.

2996
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:30,920
And uh,
I said a lot of cool shit when you're 

2997
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:32,460
gone,
but that is a that.

2998
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:37,520
But learning and learning from each 
other is the whole reason why it's great

2999
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:39,900
to have inspirational people to draw 
from.

3000
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:45,000
And I think that now there's never been 
a time like this where you could just go

3001
02:14:45,001 --> 02:14:49,230
on youtube and you could be inspired for
24 hours a day,

3002
02:14:49,231 --> 02:14:54,231
seven days a week.
You could watch videos of guys pushing 

3003
02:14:54,231 --> 02:14:57,381
through things.
Guys are doing fucking hundred mile 

3004
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:00,520
ultra marathons and just seeing people 
talk about the things that inspire them 

3005
02:15:01,591 --> 02:15:04,170
and what pushes them.
There's never been a time like this.

3006
02:15:04,171 --> 02:15:07,050
We just,
inspiration is available everywhere.

3007
02:15:07,051 --> 02:15:07,380
You look

3008
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:11,360
in a whole bunch of different.
Not Everybody's inspired the same way,

3009
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:16,390
you know,
like I think it's amazing to see a guy 

3010
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:19,400
that has nothing,
do something remarkable to come,

3011
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:21,380
you know,
not the underdog,

3012
02:15:21,381 --> 02:15:26,360
but that has no resources that then 
there's this guy in Austin,

3013
02:15:26,361 --> 02:15:27,360
Texas,
his,

3014
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:31,490
he runs this running group called 
Gilbert Gazelles and um,

3015
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:36,320
the who to,
when the genocide that was occurring,

3016
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:40,370
he has these burns on his body because 
his family was murdered and he was piled

3017
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,620
into this pile of bodies and set on 
fire.

3018
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:47,990
And once the militias,
I'm Ryan left from the Hutu in Tutus,

3019
02:15:48,170 --> 02:15:53,170
he got up and started running.
Then he went to the NCAA and started 

3020
02:15:53,170 --> 02:15:53,450
running there and then he went to the 
Olympics and now he runs.

3021
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:58,510
He's an inspirational dude in Austin 
that just tells people to run.

3022
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,460
And he's one of the most remarkable 
human beings.

3023
02:16:01,461 --> 02:16:06,461
And there's,
there's tons of people out there that 

3024
02:16:06,461 --> 02:16:06,590
are so amazing and remarkable.
And you can,

3025
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:08,300
if you just look,
you can find them.

3026
02:16:08,301 --> 02:16:13,301
And then that I,
I love latching onto people like that 

3027
02:16:13,301 --> 02:16:14,600
and just trying to get into what's in 
there and try to not,

3028
02:16:14,601 --> 02:16:16,730
I don't want to say steal it,
but I want some of that.

3029
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:21,750
Yeah,
well you don't steal it because they 

3030
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:21,750
still have it.
Oh,

3031
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:21,750
they'll always have it,
but yeah.

3032
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:21,890
But you absorb some of it.
Yeah.

3033
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:23,500
It's very important.
We,

3034
02:16:23,501 --> 02:16:25,990
we,
we surround ourselves with inspirational

3035
02:16:25,991 --> 02:16:29,500
people and become inspired.
Surround yourself with negative and your

3036
02:16:29,501 --> 02:16:32,710
life is going to be a wreck.
And that's a lot of people don't realize

3037
02:16:32,711 --> 02:16:36,160
that and they just try to work through 
these negative constant life.

3038
02:16:36,161 --> 02:16:37,960
You've got to cut them off,
man.

3039
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:41,080
You got to cut them off and keep moving 
because they will hold you back.

3040
02:16:41,380 --> 02:16:45,190
There are crabs in that bucket and when 
you try to reach the top of that bucket,

3041
02:16:45,191 --> 02:16:48,550
they will latch ahold of your little 
crab legs and drag you down with them.

3042
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,020
Data was so,
you know,

3043
02:16:50,030 --> 02:16:52,580
retrospectively my dad was so wise.
So when he's like,

3044
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:53,920
no,
you don't want those guys around,

3045
02:16:53,921 --> 02:16:56,930
you know you're going to be who you 
surround yourself with.

3046
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:57,650
You know?
And it's like,

3047
02:16:57,950 --> 02:16:58,730
whatever,
that guy is,

3048
02:16:58,900 --> 02:16:59,740
cool,
Haley,

3049
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:00,550
that guy,
you know,

3050
02:17:00,551 --> 02:17:02,480
and now I'm like,
God,

3051
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:05,650
it's hard.
How did he know so early.

3052
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:07,660
There's always gonna be people that 
will.

3053
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:10,110
But those people are also important 
because you,

3054
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:11,530
you learn,
you know,

3055
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:14,470
you learn from watching them fuck their 
lives up.

3056
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:19,650
I've never done cocaine.
And one of the reasons why I never did 

3057
02:17:19,650 --> 02:17:22,261
cocaine is because I grew up with a 
buddy of mine who's cousin was selling 

3058
02:17:22,261 --> 02:17:25,450
cocaine and I watched this guy fall 
apart.

3059
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:25,920
He,
they,

3060
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:30,960
him and his girlfriend would just do 
blow and they would hide out in their 

3061
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,751
place and they would,
they had this attic apartment and they 

3062
02:17:33,751 --> 02:17:34,660
would just fucking watch tv all day and 
they would shrink.

3063
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:37,600
Like their fucking face was shrinking,
their body was shrinking.

3064
02:17:37,601 --> 02:17:39,820
The all they would do is do coke.
I don't even know if they ate,

3065
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:41,200
you know?
And I watched this guy,

3066
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:46,260
it was like a guy who got bit by a 
vampire and became like this disease 

3067
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:46,260
thing.

3068
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,590
And I went,
Whoa,

3069
02:17:47,710 --> 02:17:49,970
keep the fuck away from coke,
you know?

3070
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:54,040
And I didn't have to do coke and go to 
rehab and pull myself out,

3071
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:54,730
you know,
I,

3072
02:17:54,731 --> 02:17:57,250
you know,
I lived 40 plus years of my life with no

3073
02:17:57,251 --> 02:17:59,380
desire to do coke.
Fuck that.

3074
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:04,690
And so it's not always good.
You need losers.

3075
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,060
You know,
losers are there too for a reason.

3076
02:18:07,061 --> 02:18:09,430
It's the whole world was filled with 
inspirational winters.

3077
02:18:09,431 --> 02:18:12,580
Like how would you figure out where,
where do we begin?

3078
02:18:12,581 --> 02:18:16,390
If everybody's a fucking winner now you 
got to see people who ring that bell,

3079
02:18:16,391 --> 02:18:18,490
right?
You got to see people who tap out quick.

3080
02:18:18,810 --> 02:18:21,760
You got to see a guy who tapped before 
the choke is even sunk in.

3081
02:18:21,761 --> 02:18:22,900
Like,
what are you doing?

3082
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,570
Types two taps to strikes.
Well,

3083
02:18:25,571 --> 02:18:28,570
you know,
sometimes GSP versus Matt Serra,

3084
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:32,860
sometimes it's good to tap to strikes 
because fights over go anywhere.

3085
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:37,980
When the guys on top of you dropping 
bombs and you're starting to see sparks 

3086
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:40,270
and the elevator doors closing,
do you think tap strikes is a bad idea?

3087
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,160
I don't know if I have it in me.
I don't know.

3088
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:46,370
Like right.
I'm not saying it's bad idea.

3089
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:49,160
Maybe I should respect the guy that 
smarter than I am,

3090
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:51,230
you know,
like I'm kind of like an oak.

3091
02:18:51,710 --> 02:18:53,240
I'm big,
I'm strong and I'm dumb,

3092
02:18:53,550 --> 02:18:54,130
you know,
like I'm just,

3093
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,270
I'm going to grow and I'm gonna do what 
I do.

3094
02:18:56,730 --> 02:19:01,730
Um,
maybe I wish I was smart enough to tap 

3095
02:19:01,730 --> 02:19:01,730
two strikes.
I don't think I am.

3096
02:19:01,730 --> 02:19:05,711
I just don't.
I don't think I have it in me to be 

3097
02:19:05,711 --> 02:19:05,711
like,
okay,

3098
02:19:05,711 --> 02:19:06,260
I'm not going to get outta here.
I'm just going to quit.

3099
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:09,650
I don't think there's any problem with 
tablets,

3100
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:11,960
trucks,
but I respect your viewpoint.

3101
02:19:11,961 --> 02:19:16,961
I know what you're saying.
And I think you'd probably have to have 

3102
02:19:16,961 --> 02:19:19,271
that sort of mentality to be an elite 
level competitor in something like mma 

3103
02:19:19,401 --> 02:19:21,170
where that's not even an option in your 
head.

3104
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:23,290
And this guys don't tap,
you know,

3105
02:19:23,310 --> 02:19:25,790
a good fucking war machine.
You just gets choked out.

3106
02:19:25,791 --> 02:19:27,830
There's a lot of guys that just say,
I never tap.

3107
02:19:27,831 --> 02:19:29,780
I will go out.
I'll get my arm broken.

3108
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:31,340
Fuck it.
I'm not tapping.

3109
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:33,260
It's not in there.
Yeah,

3110
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:33,910
it's not.
Look good.

3111
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:35,510
John Jones,
we fought vittorio,

3112
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:38,730
his arms completely,
hyper extended tap ladder,

3113
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:42,170
got let it get completely popped 
backwards and then won the fight.

3114
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:42,530
Anyway,

3115
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:47,640
[inaudible] is to,
before you go to special forces 

3116
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:51,671
selection,
there's this phase four guys out the 

3117
02:19:51,671 --> 02:19:52,160
street called [inaudible] special 
operations preparation course.

3118
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:57,220
The only thing that is isn't a trigger.
They take like 400 dudes and they ended 

3119
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:59,750
up sending 80,
80 of them to selection the other 320 at

3120
02:19:59,751 --> 02:20:02,090
some point.
Either got broke or quit.

3121
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:07,510
Um,
I remember seeing the Gong that you go 

3122
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:09,440
up and hit and it's like,
so longingly looking at that thing being

3123
02:20:09,441 --> 02:20:12,410
like,
that's the smart thing to do.

3124
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:13,310
Like,
you know,

3125
02:20:13,311 --> 02:20:18,311
you have blisters on your feet that 
you've injected stuff into so that you 

3126
02:20:18,311 --> 02:20:21,911
can't say like your skin,
like glues back to what portion it 

3127
02:20:21,911 --> 02:20:22,470
separated itself from,
you know,

3128
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:26,980
like you've lost 20 pounds in the course
of 30 days and um,

3129
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:28,440
and you're looking at that Gong and 
you're like,

3130
02:20:28,730 --> 02:20:31,160
a smart person would go and hit that 
goal,

3131
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:33,290
you know?
And I watched guys go up and do it and I

3132
02:20:33,291 --> 02:20:34,040
was like,
that's,

3133
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:36,980
that's a smart person probably I didn't 
have it in me.

3134
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:41,690
So I'm maybe I'm dumb.
I think that's my take.

3135
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:44,080
I'm either like too dumb,
you know,

3136
02:20:44,081 --> 02:20:47,030
like there's a balance there and I think
we're kind of a green each other from,

3137
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:48,650
with each other,
from different perspectives.

3138
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:49,920
Well I think the,
you're,

3139
02:20:49,930 --> 02:20:52,900
you're being self deprecating.
When you calling yourself dumb,

3140
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:57,960
it's not a dumb thing.
But if you wanted to be smart about the 

3141
02:20:58,481 --> 02:21:01,300
amount of punishment that you endure,
yeah.

3142
02:21:01,570 --> 02:21:06,570
But if you wanted to build the highest 
level of character and durability and 

3143
02:21:08,381 --> 02:21:11,740
mental toughness possible,
then it would be dumb to hit that gun.

3144
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:14,710
I don't know.
Because the benefits of not hitting that

3145
02:21:14,711 --> 02:21:19,711
Gong is what you are today.
I would have got a cup of coffee and a 

3146
02:21:19,711 --> 02:21:19,711
hot breakfast.
You didn't.

3147
02:21:19,711 --> 02:21:22,210
I didn't get a cup coffee today.
And,

3148
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:24,550
and have the knowledge that you didn't 
hit that golf.

3149
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:28,870
It's a good looking gong.
I could go back,

3150
02:21:28,871 --> 02:21:31,930
I might have.
You're a thick guy for 185 pounds.

3151
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,760
Like your,
your built in a very,

3152
02:21:33,761 --> 02:21:37,300
you're very muscular weight class toward
my wife uses.

3153
02:21:37,390 --> 02:21:38,080
What do you,
what,

3154
02:21:38,081 --> 02:21:39,970
what do you walk around that before you 
start your cut

3155
02:21:40,530 --> 02:21:42,810
to like day of cut?

3156
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:43,540
No,
like what?

3157
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:48,580
Like if you,
if you had a fight that was four months 

3158
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:48,580
from now and you don't have to worry 
about your weight,

3159
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:49,820
what are you going to work?
Way To?

3160
02:21:49,821 --> 02:21:51,680
Twenty to 20.
Wow.

3161
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:53,990
And did you fight light heavyweight at 
all?

3162
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:59,230
Yeah,
I think at wcs heavyweight ifl is a 

3163
02:21:59,230 --> 02:22:03,731
light heavyweight.
Middleweight and then I've stayed at 

3164
02:22:03,731 --> 02:22:03,731
middleweight.

3165
02:22:03,731 --> 02:22:04,570
Wow.
So when you,

3166
02:22:04,571 --> 02:22:07,030
if you're walking around in the two 
hundreds,

3167
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:10,750
how do you navigate a weight cut to get 
down to 185 pounds?

3168
02:22:10,751 --> 02:22:15,751
Because that is a big issue in mma is 
that point of diminishing returns where 

3169
02:22:15,751 --> 02:22:18,670
some guys like Anthony Rumble Johnson.
Perfect example.

3170
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:19,450
God,
he's good at two.

3171
02:22:19,451 --> 02:22:20,800
Oh five.
Jesus Christ.

3172
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:24,610
The kid was so fucking big in between 
fights.

3173
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:27,860
I see him walking around.
He was fighting at one 74.

3174
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:30,960
Kevin Burns and I saw him like two 
months later it was 2:30.

3175
02:22:30,961 --> 02:22:32,430
I go,
what the fuck are you?

3176
02:22:33,650 --> 02:22:35,280
He's a house.
He was bigger than,

3177
02:22:35,470 --> 02:22:38,100
or I mean he was just,
he was on inside mma would fade or,

3178
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:40,890
and he was towering over them wider,
thicker.

3179
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:42,630
You're like,
what is going on?

3180
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:45,450
And then finally he gets his shit 
together,

3181
02:22:45,570 --> 02:22:50,570
decides to come back as a light 
heavyweight and dominate sill Davis at 

3182
02:22:50,570 --> 02:22:50,970
two.
Oh five.

3183
02:22:50,971 --> 02:22:51,870
And you're like,
okay,

3184
02:22:51,871 --> 02:22:55,590
this kid was obviously past the point of
diminishing returns.

3185
02:22:55,591 --> 02:23:00,591
He was,
he was diminishing his own ability to 

3186
02:23:00,591 --> 02:23:00,600
perform by cutting so much.
Wait,

3187
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:02,580
what is that number?

3188
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:05,090
It's,
I think it's different for every athlete

3189
02:23:05,091 --> 02:23:05,960
and person,
you know,

3190
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:07,760
and um,
you know,

3191
02:23:07,761 --> 02:23:11,720
when I'm,
when I'm to 15 to 20,

3192
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:15,410
I feel like I'm a juggernaut.
I never have training related injuries,

3193
02:23:15,411 --> 02:23:16,060
you know,
like I,

3194
02:23:16,670 --> 02:23:18,950
I'm running an extra three,
four percent body fat.

3195
02:23:19,370 --> 02:23:22,340
I'm just like all around healthier.
My brain's working right.

3196
02:23:22,341 --> 02:23:24,380
You know,
like my libido is good,

3197
02:23:24,381 --> 02:23:27,170
you know,
I'm sleeping very soundly,

3198
02:23:27,171 --> 02:23:28,170
all eight hours,
you know,

3199
02:23:28,171 --> 02:23:29,420
like things,
everything's great.

3200
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,160
You know,
like when I'm down to like that,

3201
02:23:31,550 --> 02:23:35,920
that one 95,
one 93 precut type weight,

3202
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:38,270
you know,
we're like that five percent body fat.

3203
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:41,780
My brain's not firing on all cylinders,
you know,

3204
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:45,350
like it's libidos rough.
You're training three,

3205
02:23:45,351 --> 02:23:48,070
four times a day.
Like just things suck.

3206
02:23:48,370 --> 02:23:50,150
I'm like,
everything hurts.

3207
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:55,630
You get down to five percent body fat 
when you're like one 95 [inaudible] are 

3208
02:23:55,630 --> 02:23:56,420
you doing,
how are you measuring it?

3209
02:23:56,920 --> 02:24:00,480
A pinch test water stuff.
The water tanks and then um,

3210
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:05,560
the calipers,
that's a lot that's really low and then 

3211
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:07,040
you're going to cut another 10 pounds.
Just water,

3212
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:12,460
10 pounds of water.
I think our final cuts usually like 

3213
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:13,230
eight pounds of.
But you know,

3214
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,840
you're like,
my body doesn't.

3215
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:17,560
I don't think it even recognizes like 
I'll,

3216
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:22,620
I'll cut.
I fought Michael Bisbing us probably 

3217
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:22,640
two.
Oh five when I fought him,

3218
02:24:22,690 --> 02:24:27,690
you know,
I weighed in at one or one 86 the day 

3219
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:27,690
before,
you know,

3220
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:29,550
and then 30 hours later,
you know,

3221
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:33,350
I've been eating and drinking and 
feeling fantastic.

3222
02:24:33,410 --> 02:24:36,230
Do you recruit for that?
How many apps do you use?

3223
02:24:36,410 --> 02:24:41,410
1,500
milliliters to 2000 leaders like the 

3224
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:41,780
greener.
I honestly don't know.

3225
02:24:41,810 --> 02:24:43,250
Fighters that don't.
Right.

3226
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:44,350
And nowadays,
yeah,

3227
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:49,480
pretty much everybody does.
Unless you're like a frankie edgar that 

3228
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:52,060
literally weighs in at what he fights 
that maybe it was like pretty rare 

3229
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:52,060
weights in his pocket.

3230
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:54,140
Yeah.
Frankie fought at 1:55

3231
02:24:54,141 --> 02:24:56,480
and weighed 1:55.
Liotta machita fought a two.

3232
02:24:56,481 --> 02:24:58,750
Oh three for the longest time.
And you know,

3233
02:24:58,790 --> 02:24:59,690
weighed in at two.
Oh,

3234
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:02,060
three for 200,
five pound weight class.

3235
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:04,100
But look how good he is at 1:45.
Better,

3236
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:04,940
much better.
You know.

3237
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:07,520
So the diminishing returns,
like it's different for everybody.

3238
02:25:07,850 --> 02:25:09,290
Um,
you know,

3239
02:25:09,291 --> 02:25:10,620
I'm 5:11,
you know,

3240
02:25:10,621 --> 02:25:15,621
I have a 73 inch reach.
There's no way I can hang with the tool 

3241
02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:18,700
fibers that have 86 and teaches,
you know,

3242
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:20,660
that are six foot four.
Um,

3243
02:25:20,810 --> 02:25:22,340
yeah,
it might be as strong as they are,

3244
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:23,810
but I'm like,
uh,

3245
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:26,080
like as Brian Stan calls me like a 
squat,

3246
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:28,270
a little hobbit,
angry hobbit,

3247
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:31,900
sometimes troll endearingly.
He refers to me as these things,

3248
02:25:31,901 --> 02:25:34,330
but he's right and I just can't reach 
them.

3249
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:39,390
You know,
like John Jones can runs around the 

3250
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:39,390
cage,
you know,

3251
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:41,080
jabs me to death and then when I tried 
to like athletically explode in,

3252
02:25:41,081 --> 02:25:43,390
then he violates me with something 
painful.

3253
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:45,180
Yeah.
Do you ever

3254
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:47,320
think about going one 70?
Is that possible?

3255
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:49,180
Definitely possible.
Yeah.

3256
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:50,370
Yeah.
We've um,

3257
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:54,300
honestly had robbie lawler beat Johnny 
Hendricks.

3258
02:25:55,380 --> 02:25:57,600
I always out I would cut to fight 
Robbie.

3259
02:25:57,850 --> 02:25:59,680
Really?
Because you beat Robbie and strikeforce?

3260
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:00,880
Yeah.
Do you,

3261
02:26:00,881 --> 02:26:03,430
um,
do you when you walk around at two?

3262
02:26:03,431 --> 02:26:04,540
Oh,
five or 2:20

3263
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:09,541
rather.
Is it because you're lifting weights is 

3264
02:26:09,541 --> 02:26:09,541
because you're doing a lot of.

3265
02:26:09,580 --> 02:26:10,810
Yeah,
yes.

3266
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:11,540
Um,
I like,

3267
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:15,190
I treat the annual cycle of like fight 
camp,

3268
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:16,960
post fight camp,
pre fight camp,

3269
02:26:16,961 --> 02:26:19,230
fight camp fight.
And I'm Kinda,

3270
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:21,280
if you look at like a,
like an nfl player,

3271
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:26,310
you know,
they have the pre season where there 

3272
02:26:26,310 --> 02:26:28,060
they're trying to get their body strong 
and healthy so that when they go into 

3273
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:30,350
the season they have everything that 
they need to,

3274
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:32,880
to perform during that season.
Um,

3275
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:38,220
so like my pre fight camp,
like right now where I'm lifting 

3276
02:26:38,220 --> 02:26:41,280
weights,
doing a high volume of work where I'm 

3277
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,021
working on like my,
my sparring stuff now is a lot more 

3278
02:26:44,111 --> 02:26:49,111
drill oriented.
I'm not burning tons of calories 

3279
02:26:49,111 --> 02:26:50,020
grappling or boxing or sparring,
kickboxing.

3280
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:54,400
I'm lifting a lot of weights so my 
body's responsibly like getting healthy,

3281
02:26:54,401 --> 02:26:55,420
big and strong.
Again,

3282
02:26:55,421 --> 02:26:58,180
I'm getting my technique better.
So when I move into that fight camp,

3283
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:01,570
I have this mold of clay that's totally 
healthy,

3284
02:27:01,571 --> 02:27:05,240
that can be shaped into what needs to be
shaped to be executed for,

3285
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:06,610
for a particular fight.

3286
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:12,100
So when you think about like 2:20
and the garlic rumble Johnson who used 

3287
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:14,730
to weigh somewhere around that even 
heavier and get down to one 70 crazy.

3288
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:18,320
If you were going to get down to one 70,
if Robbie lawler beat Johnny Hendricks,

3289
02:27:19,250 --> 02:27:24,250
how would you do that?
Would you cut out the weightlifting and 

3290
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:26,471
start doing like marathon running?
Like what would you do to get yourself 

3291
02:27:26,471 --> 02:27:26,471
leaner?

3292
02:27:26,471 --> 02:27:26,490
Yeah.
Um,

3293
02:27:26,750 --> 02:27:29,410
what would it be leaner or would it be 
like less muscle?

3294
02:27:29,470 --> 02:27:34,470
A little bit of both.
I definitely have to lose a little bit 

3295
02:27:34,470 --> 02:27:34,470
of muscle to be able to.

3296
02:27:34,470 --> 02:27:36,140
And how would you do that?
By not lifting or

3297
02:27:36,350 --> 02:27:38,390
just changing the type of lifting that 
I'm doing,

3298
02:27:38,391 --> 02:27:38,970
you know,
like I'm,

3299
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:41,090
I'm not doing those three rep max is,
have dead lifted,

3300
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:42,470
you know,
four or 500 pounds.

3301
02:27:42,471 --> 02:27:43,770
So what'd you do these days?
Yeah,

3302
02:27:44,150 --> 02:27:45,080
like right now.
Yeah,

3303
02:27:45,081 --> 02:27:46,220
absolutely unloving it,
you know,

3304
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:49,490
it's like I did shrugs yesterday.
Just shrugged.

3305
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:50,960
Well not,
not just drugs,

3306
02:27:50,961 --> 02:27:54,610
but I got to do shrugs as actually my 
strength because I'm like,

3307
02:27:54,710 --> 02:27:57,770
can we do some curls?
You shut your mouth,

3308
02:27:57,771 --> 02:27:58,300
you know,
it's like,

3309
02:27:58,630 --> 02:28:02,120
like straps that you never allowed to 
touch those.

3310
02:28:02,121 --> 02:28:07,121
And I was like looking at those,
but like how can I use some straps that 

3311
02:28:07,121 --> 02:28:07,310
looks good and grab the bar and do some 
more weight,

3312
02:28:07,311 --> 02:28:07,910
you know,
he's like,

3313
02:28:07,980 --> 02:28:12,980
no.
Now the point of departure is calm and 

3314
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:12,980
he's like,
come back to me Tim,

3315
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:14,360
and we're not doing curls.
I'll let you do drugs.

3316
02:28:14,361 --> 02:28:15,390
But that's all you know,
like,

3317
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:20,650
so straps being you don't do straub's 
because you only want to lift with your 

3318
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:20,650
hands.
Can hold up.

3319
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:21,740
What's the point?
Yeah.

3320
02:28:21,741 --> 02:28:22,010
I don't

3321
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,430
ever use straps.
I,

3322
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:26,570
I see people using straps and I,
I get it.

3323
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:29,750
I get what you're doing.
What's use straps functionally though,

3324
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:32,660
she'd be whatever you could carry with 
your hands too.

3325
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:34,610
Especially for a grappler,
right?

3326
02:28:34,630 --> 02:28:35,410
Yeah,
absolutely.

3327
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:40,700
So you would just start doing high reps 
doing high volume a lot more speeds.

3328
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:44,360
Like I think I think I'd have to be 
faster to at one 70,

3329
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:49,480
you know like watching these guys are 
just like all over the place and you see

3330
02:28:49,611 --> 02:28:52,280
like Damien Maia when he dropped down to
one 70 and you know,

3331
02:28:52,310 --> 02:28:54,900
fought rick story and to see like the 
difference in the,

3332
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:59,910
just the,
the amount of physical strength that he 

3333
02:28:59,910 --> 02:29:00,830
had over a guy who was used to fighting 
at one 70.

3334
02:29:00,831 --> 02:29:03,140
It's a big leap.
Do you think there should be more weight

3335
02:29:03,141 --> 02:29:04,430
classes?
Yeah,

3336
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:06,070
I do too.
Yeah,

3337
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:08,150
I think the one 85 to 205.

3338
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:10,460
Jesus fucking Christ.
That's 20 pounds.

3339
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:14,300
There should be three champions in 
between those weight classes or at least

3340
02:29:14,390 --> 02:29:15,070
to.
Yeah,

3341
02:29:15,071 --> 02:29:19,550
I mean if you look at a guy from,
I'll go all the way down from like 1:55,

3342
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:19,970
two,
two.

3343
02:29:19,971 --> 02:29:21,830
Oh five.
You know you have 55,

3344
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:22,790
70,
85.

3345
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:25,520
You have four weight classes from 1:55
to two.

3346
02:29:25,521 --> 02:29:27,740
Oh five.
That's crazy.

3347
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:28,820
Yeah.
Yeah,

3348
02:29:28,821 --> 02:29:31,010
I agree.
I think it's crazy and I think that,

3349
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:36,130
you know,
a lot of people say that boxing is 

3350
02:29:36,130 --> 02:29:37,691
watered down by all the weight classes.
I think it's watered down by all the 

3351
02:29:37,691 --> 02:29:37,691
titles,
but I don't think there's anything wrong

3352
02:29:37,691 --> 02:29:41,600
with having a welterweight class at 1:47
and then a junior middleweight at 1:54

3353
02:29:41,601 --> 02:29:44,120
and then the middle weighted one 66 
pounds,

3354
02:29:44,121 --> 02:29:46,760
but you 1:54
and one slash 60 is fucking significant.

3355
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:51,940
Six pounds and significant 20 pounds is 
crazy and I just think that there's just

3356
02:29:52,191 --> 02:29:57,191
a,
a lot of fighters who are tweeners like 

3357
02:29:57,191 --> 02:29:57,191
Diego Sanchez.

3358
02:29:57,191 --> 02:29:57,920
I think Diego should be fighting at one 
65,

3359
02:29:58,220 --> 02:29:59,840
you know,
I think when he gets to 1:55,

3360
02:29:59,841 --> 02:30:02,740
I think he's to diminished you scrawny 
when he fights at one 70.

3361
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:07,750
He's a little soft,
these little little small for some of 

3362
02:30:07,750 --> 02:30:10,571
those really big giant dudes.
I think I'm kind of between 85 and one 

3363
02:30:10,571 --> 02:30:10,820
70,
like my shape,

3364
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,230
my reach,
my height,

3365
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:15,680
and you're like,
I would love there to be like a 180.

3366
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:20,800
Yeah.
I really should be more of that in the 

3367
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,550
everything.
Those are the things that I would like 

3368
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:25,931
to use to change the,
the downward elbows and knees on the 

3369
02:30:25,931 --> 02:30:26,270
ground and more weight class except a 
lot of problems.

3370
02:30:27,050 --> 02:30:29,210
Dana,
can we go ahead and execute these things

3371
02:30:29,211 --> 02:30:31,910
that Joe and I have concurred on from 
today's podcast?

3372
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:33,860
Yes.
It's not even Dana.

3373
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:39,080
It's the athletic commissions through.
That's what's really crazy is that it's 

3374
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:42,371
sanctioned by athletic commissions and 
you really don't have that much 

3375
02:30:42,371 --> 02:30:44,080
influence over athletic commissions.
Yeah.

3376
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:46,580
Especially,
well now the Keith Kaiser's gone.

3377
02:30:46,581 --> 02:30:50,750
Maybe they have a little bit more,
but I don't know how much they listen.

3378
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:55,930
I,
I wish they would listen about a few 

3379
02:30:55,930 --> 02:30:58,390
things for certainly downward elbows and
certainly at least consider revamping 

3380
02:30:58,390 --> 02:31:01,460
the scoring system and then adding 
weight classes.

3381
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:05,600
Um,
one of the things about weight cutting,

3382
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:10,690
do you find that are an issue like the,
there's obviously an issue with injuries

3383
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:17,030
and there's obviously an issue with 
diminishing health.

3384
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:20,730
Do you worry about the long term 
repercussions

3385
02:31:20,730 --> 02:31:25,730
of like there was an article recently,
Jim Miller was talking about weight 

3386
02:31:25,730 --> 02:31:25,730
cutting.
He's like,

3387
02:31:25,730 --> 02:31:28,260
I know I've taken years off my life 
through weight cutting.

3388
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:29,970
Do you worry about that?

3389
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:35,540
I do.
The things that I am really conscious 

3390
02:31:35,540 --> 02:31:37,980
about my brain,
you know,

3391
02:31:37,981 --> 02:31:41,190
when I'm cutting weight I like,
I love reading,

3392
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:42,410
I love writing,
you know,

3393
02:31:42,430 --> 02:31:44,140
like even,
you know,

3394
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:47,160
creative writing too.
Like I love.

3395
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,620
Do you write a blog?
Do you keep a blog or anything?

3396
02:31:49,650 --> 02:31:50,310
Yeah,
for me.

3397
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:51,520
Just for you?
Yeah.

3398
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:53,520
You're going to publish it some day.
Maybe.

3399
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:55,560
There are a couple of times where I 
wrote a,

3400
02:31:55,561 --> 02:31:57,710
wrote some blogs when I was deployed,
um,

3401
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:01,230
letters from a foreign land and I'm 
like,

3402
02:32:01,290 --> 02:32:03,090
people love,
like I'm an okay writer,

3403
02:32:03,091 --> 02:32:05,200
I'm not the best like anyways,
everybody.

3404
02:32:05,201 --> 02:32:06,280
So worse credit,
um,

3405
02:32:07,650 --> 02:32:10,350
and when I'm cutting like my brain 
doesn't work right?

3406
02:32:10,530 --> 02:32:12,350
Like I feel it.
And um,

3407
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:14,670
and then when you're getting hit in the 
head while you're cutting,

3408
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:20,000
you know,
from guys like John Jones and Carlos 

3409
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:20,000
condit,
you know,

3410
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:20,000
like,
life sucks,

3411
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,530
your brain sucks.
So I'm like,

3412
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:28,280
yeah,
I have my eyes are wide open that 

3413
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:28,280
there's,
you know,

3414
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:32,490
physically going to be some 
repercussions to me fighting,

3415
02:32:32,730 --> 02:32:33,240
you know,
for me,

3416
02:32:33,241 --> 02:32:36,180
jumping out of airplanes for like,
at what point do I say,

3417
02:32:36,990 --> 02:32:41,990
okay,
I'm not going to do this because it 

3418
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:41,990
hurts me in the long term.
You know,

3419
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:41,990
like

3420
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:41,990
you're 34.
Yeah.

3421
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:46,700
Do you have a cutoff?
Do you have like an age where you're 

3422
02:32:46,700 --> 02:32:47,970
like,
this is the age where I don't want to be

3423
02:32:47,971 --> 02:32:49,370
doing this anymore.
Definitely.

3424
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,420
What you would tell you,
you can't tell me.

3425
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:53,520
Okay.
But you have a number in your head where

3426
02:32:53,521 --> 02:32:55,800
you would like a goal to reach.

3427
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:59,320
I love randy couture and Dan Henderson 
and I had to get some of the.

3428
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:02,500
They had send the greatest fights 
towards the end of their careers.

3429
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:05,230
I am not going to be fighting at 40,
you know,

3430
02:33:05,350 --> 02:33:05,830
I'm not gonna be fun

3431
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:07,070
fighting my late thirties,
you know,

3432
02:33:07,071 --> 02:33:07,460
like,
Oh,

3433
02:33:07,461 --> 02:33:12,461
you told me the number then that's the 
only you don't leave in five years ago 

3434
02:33:12,461 --> 02:33:12,510
there.
Yeah.

3435
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:14,150
You got a five year window then.
Wow.

3436
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:16,100
Yeah.
No Way.

3437
02:33:16,450 --> 02:33:17,630
I got too much.
I want to do.

3438
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:19,260
What do you want to do?
Um,

3439
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:21,680
I want to change people's lives.
You know,

3440
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:26,710
I want,
I want to be able to impart individual 

3441
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:26,710
responsibility.
People.

3442
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:27,500
I want to save some animals.
I want to own a hudson more.

3443
02:33:27,820 --> 02:33:31,010
Um,
I want to make some awesome TV shows and

3444
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,580
try to TV shows.
Uh,

3445
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,850
so duck dynasty.
No,

3446
02:33:37,851 --> 02:33:42,851
I do not want to do duck dynasty at all 
and I don't even think I've ever seen a 

3447
02:33:42,851 --> 02:33:45,410
full episode,
but I haven't.

3448
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:47,690
Maybe I've seen like three quarters of 
an episode.

3449
02:33:48,050 --> 02:33:51,860
But you done lost your red neck from our
rear admiral.

3450
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:57,040
Those guys took values that they wanted 
to project and they figured out a 

3451
02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:01,301
conduit to do it.
We might call them idiots and they have 

3452
02:34:01,301 --> 02:34:01,301
horrible accents and they do stupid 
things.

3453
02:34:01,301 --> 02:34:06,101
And um,
but they had a set of morals that they 

3454
02:34:06,101 --> 02:34:09,581
try to convey and they found an avenue 
to reach out millions of people,

3455
02:34:10,070 --> 02:34:13,640
you know,
like I want that platform because I have

3456
02:34:13,641 --> 02:34:15,830
some good things to say,
you know,

3457
02:34:15,831 --> 02:34:18,040
and I,
I think I want to have an

3458
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,100
opportunity to make a difference.
Why don't you do a podcast,

3459
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:23,650
start off with the podcast,
do a podcast now.

3460
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:28,860
Be like one of the first mma guys mean 
Brendan Schaub does one with Brian 

3461
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:29,340
Cowen.
But Brendan's kind of a meathead,

3462
02:34:29,350 --> 02:34:30,720
let's be honest.
He's a great guy.

3463
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:33,460
Love Him.
But you're so like,

3464
02:34:33,461 --> 02:34:34,990
you're intimidating and smart.
Like,

3465
02:34:34,991 --> 02:34:36,790
how could I compete with the Joe 
Roadblock as,

3466
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:39,070
fuck,
I don't blow smoke up my ass.

3467
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:42,250
I know what you're doing.
I'm not that smart.

3468
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:43,040
You are?
Nope.

3469
02:34:43,150 --> 02:34:46,720
Nope.
The argument with Joe because he doesn't

3470
02:34:46,721 --> 02:34:48,910
forget anything and he's deceivingly 
smart.

3471
02:34:49,310 --> 02:34:51,230
I was like,
I'm aware of these things.

3472
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:53,560
I definitely look dumber than I am for 
sure.

3473
02:34:53,561 --> 02:34:56,290
But that's not saying much because they 
look really fucking stupid.

3474
02:34:56,350 --> 02:35:00,140
I used that to my benefit as well.
It's like I'm an infantryman immigrant.

3475
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:02,200
I'm an MMA fighter.
I'm dumb.

3476
02:35:02,740 --> 02:35:03,400
Talk Shit to me.

3477
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:04,300
Go ahead.
For sure.

3478
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:05,440
Yeah,
I've definitely.

3479
02:35:05,441 --> 02:35:10,441
I smoked a lot of weed.
I've got plenty of brain damage going 

3480
02:35:10,441 --> 02:35:10,441
on.
Absolutely,

3481
02:35:10,441 --> 02:35:14,500
but I'm not nearly as dumb as I look.
I look way fucking dumber.

3482
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:20,850
I think you'd be great on a podcast.
I think you and the beautiful thing 

3483
02:35:20,850 --> 02:35:21,880
about a podcast is,
and I fucking swear to God,

3484
02:35:21,881 --> 02:35:23,250
everybody that comes on my podcast,
I.

3485
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:25,930
You should have a podcast.
I'm like trying to give.

3486
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,610
I don't know.
I don't believe.

3487
02:35:28,110 --> 02:35:30,220
It's not that I don't believe in 
competitions.

3488
02:35:30,221 --> 02:35:35,221
I don't.
I have the exact opposite of a famine 

3489
02:35:35,221 --> 02:35:35,221
mentality.
I think there's.

3490
02:35:35,221 --> 02:35:37,360
There's 300 million people out there,
everybody,

3491
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:40,600
everybody could support everybody and 
there's still plenty to go around.

3492
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:46,060
I really believe that,
but obviously my bladder even kindled 

3493
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:46,060
can't handle the podcasts at this 
length,

3494
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:50,881
so we.
We've already discovered a limitation 

3495
02:35:50,881 --> 02:35:50,881
to.
Well,

3496
02:35:50,881 --> 02:35:54,871
in your defense you have a one liter 
smartwater and you've drank a big cup of

3497
02:35:55,121 --> 02:35:55,900
bulletproof coffee.

3498
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:59,200
There's a lot of liquids in there and 
it's also just stamina.

3499
02:35:59,201 --> 02:36:04,201
I just like,
I probably couldn't keep up with your 

3500
02:36:04,201 --> 02:36:06,361
strength and conditioning program and 
you can't keep up with my bladder 

3501
02:36:06,361 --> 02:36:06,361
program.
My bladder is like a fucking,

3502
02:36:06,361 --> 02:36:08,650
like a leather Satchel.
Back in the old days,

3503
02:36:08,690 --> 02:36:12,130
you can make them at a buffalo skins 
strong and durable.

3504
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,500
Lasts a lifetime handed down your 
grandchildren.

3505
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:18,310
You could easily do a podcast dude.
And the beautiful thing about it is that

3506
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:20,490
no one be able to tell you what to do.
You could,

3507
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:23,620
no one would tell you what to say,
what to talk about.

3508
02:36:23,621 --> 02:36:25,340
You wouldn't have to converse with the 
producers,

3509
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:30,380
captivate enough people to.
Because I want that the access to the 

3510
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:30,880
audience,
you know,

3511
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:32,500
to,
to influence lives,

3512
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:33,340
you know,
would,

3513
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:36,040
would my words have enough meaning,
um,

3514
02:36:36,370 --> 02:36:38,730
to draw in enough people?
Of course they would.

3515
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:43,760
I hope so.
They were there doing that right now if 

3516
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:46,441
I,
right now millions of people are gonna 

3517
02:36:46,441 --> 02:36:46,441
listen to this.
I jump out of an airplane,

3518
02:36:46,441 --> 02:36:46,441
you know,
into the water,

3519
02:36:46,441 --> 02:36:51,130
you know,
into the ocean with a whole bunch of 

3520
02:36:51,130 --> 02:36:51,280
sharks and go swim with them.
Like people are going to tune into that.

3521
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:53,070
But what if you get eaten?
I'll start.

3522
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:58,500
This whole thing is fucked now,
but then I get out of the water and I 

3523
02:36:58,500 --> 02:36:58,500
can talk to them.
You know,

3524
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:03,520
there's 16 million people watched him 
parachute out of this plane into shark 

3525
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:04,400
infested waters.
Oh,

3526
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:06,820
you're out of your mind and wrote a 
motorcycle up onto the beach.

3527
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:09,910
Then I have them.
But you have them already,

3528
02:37:09,911 --> 02:37:10,990
man.
You don't have to do that.

3529
02:37:10,991 --> 02:37:12,280
Trust me.
You don't have to do that.

3530
02:37:12,281 --> 02:37:14,770
You've already done enough that you're 
qualified.

3531
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:16,190
You're qualified,

3532
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,180
legit,
bad ass.

3533
02:37:17,181 --> 02:37:20,180
The idea that you're going to parachute 
into sharks and that's going to change.

3534
02:37:20,181 --> 02:37:22,130
Everybody will ask.
The guy's a fucking pussy.

3535
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:24,140
The sharks.
Oh,

3536
02:37:24,141 --> 02:37:29,141
he's got me.
Let's sit down and listen to what tim 

3537
02:37:29,141 --> 02:37:29,141
has to say.
I think that's just broke off there.

3538
02:37:29,141 --> 02:37:30,590
You are so powerful.
Joe Rogan,

3539
02:37:30,591 --> 02:37:33,320
chest broke his microphone just with Ron
was.

3540
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:35,230
I'll just hold onto it till we're done.
Bear.

3541
02:37:35,231 --> 02:37:40,231
His microphone is made from a maid in a 
foreign land where quality is not 

3542
02:37:40,231 --> 02:37:42,140
valued.
You easily.

3543
02:37:42,141 --> 02:37:44,810
Dude could do a podcast easily without a
doubt.

3544
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:49,900
And I think that these,
you do a lot of videos too with ranger 

3545
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:49,900
up,
right?

3546
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:52,310
If you call them,
I call them that.

3547
02:37:52,311 --> 02:37:54,650
What was the one we did?
The Black Swan thing.

3548
02:37:55,150 --> 02:37:56,780
That is interpretive dance.
Can we.

3549
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:58,120
Can we show that?
Yeah,

3550
02:37:58,130 --> 02:38:00,170
that's fine.
Pull it up.

3551
02:38:00,171 --> 02:38:01,010
What's the name of that?

3552
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:04,780
I think it's Tim Kennedy Black Swan.
Pull up Tim Kennedy Black Swan.

3553
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,640
And I'll try to fix this microphone 
while,

3554
02:38:07,641 --> 02:38:08,930
uh,
while that's happening.

3555
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:13,310
But the problem you're gonna have it,
was doing a television show is producers

3556
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:18,430
because they're going to look at you and
they're going to try to put you in a 

3557
02:38:18,430 --> 02:38:19,220
mold and they're going to try to get you
to do a bunch of fake shit.

3558
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:22,070
They do fake shit man.
They fake shit.

3559
02:38:22,071 --> 02:38:24,590
I had a problem with fake shit on my 
Scifi show.

3560
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:27,680
They faked a bunch of shit and I didn't 
find out about it until it was aired.

3561
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:32,830
And I came on the podcast and I 
apologized and I didn't know and it was 

3562
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:34,430
a huge fucking problem.
And that's,

3563
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:37,160
that was on a show called Joe Rogan 
questions.

3564
02:38:37,161 --> 02:38:42,161
Everything like I'm trying to find the 
truth about these things and their 

3565
02:38:42,161 --> 02:38:46,120
instinct is still the fake shit and to 
put fake shit in that you don't know 

3566
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:46,120
about that.

3567
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:48,200
It's fucking horrible,
very malleable.

3568
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:49,010
You're like,
no,

3569
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:51,380
you're not.
That's why podcasts is perfect.

3570
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:56,760
You do.
You have a very unique vision and your 

3571
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:58,160
unique vision is qualified by your 
unique life experiences.

3572
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:02,600
Any Hollywood douche bag is not going to
understand that and they're going to try

3573
02:39:02,601 --> 02:39:05,960
to mold you and what they think could be
more profitable for the network,

3574
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:11,230
but they would also have to sleep at 
night and they'd be scared of what I 

3575
02:39:11,230 --> 02:39:11,230
could do to them once they go to bed,
but they wouldn't.

3576
02:39:11,230 --> 02:39:15,320
They live in gated communities and they 
hire people to keep an eye out for you.

3577
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:16,270
Is this it?
Here?

3578
02:39:16,290 --> 02:39:17,750
Play that and I'll fix this thing.

3579
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:24,580
Hello and welcome to masterpiece theater
is a scene from black swan performed by 

3580
02:39:25,430 --> 02:39:28,640
MMA fighter and special forces operator,
Tim Kennedy.

3581
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:36,550
I had the craziest dream last night 
about a boy who was turned into a swan 

3582
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:41,620
whom falls for the wrong guy and he 
kills himself.

3583
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:19,110
For the folks who are not watching this,
please watch this.

3584
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:23,100
Go to youtube.
What compelled you to do this?

3585
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:26,130
So the,
the movie Black Swan,

3586
02:40:26,131 --> 02:40:27,540
obviously.
Well,

3587
02:40:27,570 --> 02:40:28,290
Natalie Portman.

3588
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:30,400
Beautiful.
She is beautiful.

3589
02:40:31,850 --> 02:40:36,850
And uh,
my mom used to make us take dancing 

3590
02:40:36,850 --> 02:40:36,850
lessons.
So there,

3591
02:40:36,850 --> 02:40:38,170
as you can see,
there's some skill here.

3592
02:40:38,171 --> 02:40:40,540
This is,
you just can't do this stuff.

3593
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:42,490
Whatever.
That is scary.

3594
02:40:43,910 --> 02:40:47,050
I'm your mom made you take dance and 
your dad made you take martial arts.

3595
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:51,670
Interesting cooking classes with my mom 
cooking class.

3596
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:54,050
Have Hunting with my dad.
Um,

3597
02:40:54,070 --> 02:40:56,470
that makes a balanced person that's like
I'm Yamamoto.

3598
02:40:56,471 --> 02:40:58,630
Musashi's book of five rings,
you know,

3599
02:40:58,631 --> 02:41:02,470
he believed that every button should,
every warrior should also be well versed

3600
02:41:02,471 --> 02:41:06,020
in poetry and calligraphy and art.
Yeah.

3601
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:08,320
It wasn't by choice,
just like,

3602
02:41:08,321 --> 02:41:13,321
yeah,
let's go to ballroom dancing and learn 

3603
02:41:13,321 --> 02:41:13,321
how to swing ballroom dance.
Oh yeah.

3604
02:41:13,321 --> 02:41:16,060
She got them all out of probably moved 
out.

3605
02:41:17,170 --> 02:41:22,170
I was like 11.
I didn't have a chance to find someone 

3606
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:24,490
to take the motivation was I'm having 
fun.

3607
02:41:24,610 --> 02:41:26,190
You know,
like you,

3608
02:41:26,350 --> 02:41:27,350
you can't,
um,

3609
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:31,120
if you don't enjoy and have fun in life 
and be able to laugh at yourself and put

3610
02:41:31,121 --> 02:41:33,990
on like a Tutu and dance around,
you know,

3611
02:41:33,991 --> 02:41:38,230
like,
like a Beautiful Fairy Butterfly Swan,

3612
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:43,680
both the black and white version and be 
able to understand what the transition 

3613
02:41:44,441 --> 02:41:46,450
the metamorphosis from the black to 
White Swan.

3614
02:41:46,451 --> 02:41:48,160
It's scary,
scary process.

3615
02:41:48,290 --> 02:41:50,530
It is.
Once you understand that about yourself,

3616
02:41:51,610 --> 02:41:56,440
there's really nothing more frightening,
um,

3617
02:41:56,470 --> 02:41:57,700
that you could do in the rest of your 
life.

3618
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:02,760
If I was that guy from.
What is that show inside the actors 

3619
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:05,161
studio?
Is that analogous to your transition as 

3620
02:42:05,501 --> 02:42:08,500
a fighter?
I really,

3621
02:42:08,530 --> 02:42:13,530
really try to personify that.
You the Black Swan or the white swan 

3622
02:42:14,111 --> 02:42:16,870
when you fight.
It's in me,

3623
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:19,510
it's,
it's the journey to the Black Swan.

3624
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:20,560
I'm neither,
you know,

3625
02:42:20,570 --> 02:42:23,560
it's like the scary down the rabbit 
hole.

3626
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:28,650
Like I took the blue pill and now I'm 
becoming the Black Swan and there's 

3627
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:33,001
violent,
scary things on the way there and that 

3628
02:42:33,001 --> 02:42:35,780
that's,
that's where I try to fight that is on 

3629
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:35,780
the journey to the black school.

3630
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,330
Is that why you come out to the rooster 
now?

3631
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:39,220
I come out to the rooster because it's 
bad ass song.

3632
02:42:39,250 --> 02:42:42,820
It is a bad ass song.
And roosters like the fight they do like

3633
02:42:42,821 --> 02:42:44,950
to fight,
but the songs about Vietnam,

3634
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:50,460
it's about Vietnam vets.
The hundred and first they used to call 

3635
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:53,440
the tail gunner or the machine gunners.
The rooster on the team.

3636
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:54,850
Is that allison chains?
Yeah.

3637
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:57,970
So like POW,
mia,

3638
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,590
Vietnam vets,
all of them.

3639
02:42:59,591 --> 02:43:03,220
That song,
the song was written by the bleaching or

3640
02:43:03,250 --> 02:43:08,250
about his father who are disenchanted.
They grew apart and he kind of resented 

3641
02:43:08,250 --> 02:43:12,961
him for being in the war and then he 
kind of had revelation that it was like 

3642
02:43:12,961 --> 02:43:14,090
he had to.
He didn't have a choice.

3643
02:43:14,091 --> 02:43:17,590
He drafted.
So he wrote that song to,

3644
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:22,680
to connect,
reconnect with his father who was a 

3645
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:22,680
Vietnam vet.
So that,

3646
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:27,160
that song has a lot of meaning to me and
my community,

3647
02:43:27,210 --> 02:43:28,180
you know,
veterans.

3648
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:30,430
So everybody walk out of that Song,
man.

3649
02:43:30,431 --> 02:43:33,000
There's like,
there's not like,

3650
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:38,070
I feel like there's nothing you could.
You could hit me with a freight train 

3651
02:43:38,070 --> 02:43:38,070
and I wouldn't care.

3652
02:43:38,070 --> 02:43:39,960
Grab portions of my body and try to keep
fighting.

3653
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:41,910
It's a great fucking song for you,
man.

3654
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:46,110
There's certain songs that just sort of,
you hear that song and you know,

3655
02:43:46,111 --> 02:43:51,111
that guy's fighting like there's a 
country board can survive when Matt 

3656
02:43:51,111 --> 02:43:51,720
Hughes fights,
you know,

3657
02:43:51,721 --> 02:43:53,990
there's just no getting around it.
Stranglehold.

3658
02:43:54,090 --> 02:43:57,660
When Benevidez fights,
Joseph Benevidez fights comes out to Ted

3659
02:43:57,661 --> 02:44:00,630
nugent's trying to hold,
which is a great fucking song for him.

3660
02:44:01,050 --> 02:44:02,100
You know,
it's just,

3661
02:44:02,101 --> 02:44:06,000
there's certain songs that just persona 
fly a fighter that's a,

3662
02:44:06,010 --> 02:44:07,230
that's a good one for you,
man.

3663
02:44:07,870 --> 02:44:09,490
I'll have it forever.
That's my song.

3664
02:44:09,810 --> 02:44:12,070
Do they give you any pressure about 
songs?

3665
02:44:12,071 --> 02:44:17,071
Did they like,
you have to approve it because I know 

3666
02:44:17,071 --> 02:44:17,230
I'm Uriah Faber try,
you know,

3667
02:44:17,270 --> 02:44:20,590
he always comes out to California love.
But uh,

3668
02:44:20,610 --> 02:44:24,070
he wanted to do going back to Cali and 
uh,

3669
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:25,170
they wouldn't let them do it.

3670
02:44:25,610 --> 02:44:28,950
I don't think it's like the UFC.
I'm a,

3671
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:34,120
I'm not sure to them that they have to 
get rights to use that music in the 

3672
02:44:35,181 --> 02:44:39,800
production.
And I have no idea how legally that that

3673
02:44:39,801 --> 02:44:44,801
occurs.
So sometimes they have a list of what 

3674
02:44:44,801 --> 02:44:44,801
you're allowed to do,
you know,

3675
02:44:44,801 --> 02:44:45,890
there are some fight promotions were 
like,

3676
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:47,830
all right,
submit your,

3677
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:52,900
your song that you want to walk out to 
two weeks before and we'll see if we 

3678
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:56,261
can,
if it's approved or if we can get 

3679
02:44:56,261 --> 02:44:56,261
approval.
Um,

3680
02:44:56,261 --> 02:44:57,610
you know,
it's,

3681
02:44:57,670 --> 02:44:58,450
it's,
I dunno,

3682
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:03,480
I have no idea how it works,
but thank God I can walk out to rooster 

3683
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:03,480
because I'd be really sad if I couldn't.

3684
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:03,480
Yeah,
it's perfect for you.

3685
02:45:03,710 --> 02:45:08,710
Do.
I'm glad that you have an exit strategy 

3686
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:09,760
because there are a lot of fighters that
don't.

3687
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:15,000
And the saddest thing to me is a guy who
looks at fighting as everything like 

3688
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:19,690
that is all they're capable of.
That is all they're ever going to be.

3689
02:45:19,870 --> 02:45:24,870
They don't know what to do next and they
get out of it and they have this thing 

3690
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:24,870
where they,
they,

3691
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:25,990
they're,
they're diminished.

3692
02:45:25,991 --> 02:45:30,100
Like you could see their aura is 
diminished if you believe in Aras,

3693
02:45:30,101 --> 02:45:35,101
but whoever they are like seems less 
when you were around them then who they 

3694
02:45:35,101 --> 02:45:36,940
were when they were competing.

3695
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:37,890
Yeah,
it's true.

3696
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:43,150
There's nothing more tragic than seeing 
the guy that blood and sweat for your 

3697
02:45:43,461 --> 02:45:45,680
entertainment and at the end of his 
career,

3698
02:45:45,950 --> 02:45:47,150
you know,
he wasn't smart,

3699
02:45:47,151 --> 02:45:49,460
he didn't do things,
you know,

3700
02:45:49,620 --> 02:45:52,130
how he should have.
And then at the end of his career he has

3701
02:45:52,131 --> 02:45:52,850
nothing,
you know,

3702
02:45:52,851 --> 02:45:56,450
he's fought 20 fights,
he's broken physically and mentally,

3703
02:45:56,890 --> 02:45:59,060
you know,
there there's nothing left in him and he

3704
02:45:59,061 --> 02:46:01,040
has no resources to continue his life.
You know,

3705
02:46:01,041 --> 02:46:02,450
like I have,
I've ranger up,

3706
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:07,480
you know,
that accompany that I'm intimately part 

3707
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:07,480
of,
you know,

3708
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:08,870
I've great relationships with partners 
that are going to go outside of the.

3709
02:46:09,230 --> 02:46:12,800
When I'm done fighting that are going to
be part of whatever TV's series that I'm

3710
02:46:12,801 --> 02:46:16,190
in,
but it breaks my heart.

3711
02:46:16,191 --> 02:46:17,390
Seeing these guys that,
you know,

3712
02:46:17,391 --> 02:46:19,730
at the end of the careers they have 
nothing and you're just like,

3713
02:46:20,390 --> 02:46:21,480
yeah,
yeah.

3714
02:46:21,481 --> 02:46:23,170
It breaks my heart too.
And it,

3715
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:28,310
I've,
I've seen it so many times that it just 

3716
02:46:28,310 --> 02:46:28,310
drives me fucking nuts,
man.

3717
02:46:28,310 --> 02:46:28,310
It,
it,

3718
02:46:28,310 --> 02:46:29,430
it just,
it drives me nuts.

3719
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:34,520
I almost want to like grab them in the 
middle when they're peaking and go,

3720
02:46:35,371 --> 02:46:37,290
listen man,
this is beautiful,

3721
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:40,680
but it ain't gonna last.
You've got to have something else.

3722
02:46:40,681 --> 02:46:45,030
You got to have something that you have 
as much passion for as you do this.

3723
02:46:45,510 --> 02:46:50,510
Maybe that's one area where you have an 
advantage in that you've been in so many

3724
02:46:51,511 --> 02:46:55,110
life or death struggles,
firefights being deployed overseas,

3725
02:46:55,111 --> 02:46:58,980
seeing life and death and your 
perspective as far broader than a person

3726
02:46:58,981 --> 02:47:03,981
who's just been an athlete,
just been an athlete that is sought 

3727
02:47:03,981 --> 02:47:05,190
glory and believes that that is the end 
all.

3728
02:47:05,191 --> 02:47:05,610
Be All.

3729
02:47:06,930 --> 02:47:08,140
Maybe,
you know,

3730
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:10,170
I,
I definitely have this perspective that,

3731
02:47:10,590 --> 02:47:11,640
you know,
we have,

3732
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,310
we have a shelf life as an athlete and 
it's short.

3733
02:47:14,340 --> 02:47:17,670
It's this window of opportunity that if 
you don't capitalize on it,

3734
02:47:17,671 --> 02:47:18,260
you know,
it's common,

3735
02:47:18,270 --> 02:47:20,140
it's gone.
And um,

3736
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,050
most people don't understand that,
you know,

3737
02:47:22,051 --> 02:47:23,070
we have this,
this,

3738
02:47:23,250 --> 02:47:28,250
this window to,
to earn our earning potential is small 

3739
02:47:28,250 --> 02:47:28,250
for an athlete.
You know,

3740
02:47:28,250 --> 02:47:28,620
like,
I never had that.

3741
02:47:29,070 --> 02:47:31,140
This is something that I wanted to do.
I wanted to be champion.

3742
02:47:31,141 --> 02:47:34,530
I want to be champion and that's what 
I'm trying to achieve in this window,

3743
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:39,630
not financial gain or like,
like if I don't achieve it in that 

3744
02:47:39,630 --> 02:47:44,061
window,
I can move on to the next thing to then 

3745
02:47:44,061 --> 02:47:44,490
achieve the next thing that I'm trying 
to do.

3746
02:47:44,970 --> 02:47:47,190
But uh,
these guys that go in there,

3747
02:47:47,191 --> 02:47:47,790
they,
they,

3748
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:51,450
the Mike Tyson is a perfect example of 
where,

3749
02:47:51,451 --> 02:47:53,310
you know,
he literally pissed it all away and then

3750
02:47:53,311 --> 02:47:54,050
at the end of,
you know,

3751
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:56,100
what happened to $230 million dollars 
that you had,

3752
02:47:56,580 --> 02:47:57,420
you're bankrupt.

3753
02:47:59,150 --> 02:48:04,150
Crazy.
Did he to stash away 10 can live off 10 

3754
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:04,550
for a long fucking time,
man.

3755
02:48:04,830 --> 02:48:07,280
Just dig tense.
Blow to 20.

3756
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:10,790
Yeah.
It's crazy when you see those stories,

3757
02:48:10,791 --> 02:48:15,791
but it's almost like the Hubris that 
allows you to be a combat athlete in a 

3758
02:48:15,791 --> 02:48:19,811
lot of ways.
This idea that I'm different or like 

3759
02:48:19,811 --> 02:48:22,121
your idea,
you're going to fucking parachute into 

3760
02:48:22,121 --> 02:48:22,121
sharks.
You're going to be fine.

3761
02:48:22,121 --> 02:48:22,121
I'll be fine.
You know,

3762
02:48:22,121 --> 02:48:27,050
I'm not like that poor fuck.
That was a triathlon training off the 

3763
02:48:27,050 --> 02:48:27,050
course of,
uh,

3764
02:48:27,050 --> 02:48:29,600
off the coast of San Diego and got 
bitten in half in front of his friends.

3765
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:32,270
That happens.
Pro happens.

3766
02:48:32,271 --> 02:48:34,220
Anybody gets in there.
It's a bad world.

3767
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:38,810
Oceans a bad place.
I don't like it at all.

3768
02:48:39,070 --> 02:48:40,580
Sharks are beautiful.
Yeah,

3769
02:48:40,581 --> 02:48:43,490
they're beautiful when you have a 
delayed over a grill.

3770
02:48:44,150 --> 02:48:46,580
Delicious as well.
Um,

3771
02:48:47,210 --> 02:48:49,250
one 70.
This is the last question.

3772
02:48:49,370 --> 02:48:52,610
Do you think that your best chance for 
our title would be at one 70?

3773
02:48:54,010 --> 02:48:55,750
No,
I think I'm close either.

3774
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:58,300
Next fight.
You know,

3775
02:48:58,301 --> 02:49:00,390
who Joe Silva gives me is,
you know,

3776
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:03,830
fits the VB Vitor Belfort,
jock raise,

3777
02:49:03,831 --> 02:49:05,620
you know that,
that puts me right there.

3778
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:06,730
You know,
I'm number six.

3779
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:08,520
I be number two.
Three guy.

3780
02:49:08,910 --> 02:49:09,890
That's the title fight.
You know,

3781
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:11,200
foreign owned The you ob for?
No,

3782
02:49:11,201 --> 02:49:12,840
in the UFC.
Just beating in a title.

3783
02:49:12,860 --> 02:49:14,650
Eliminated my last two fights.
Have been five rounder,

3784
02:49:14,670 --> 02:49:15,780
main events,
you know,

3785
02:49:15,810 --> 02:49:20,250
how can you not say so am I,
I'm potentially one fight away.

3786
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:21,690
Um,
you know,

3787
02:49:21,691 --> 02:49:26,691
Mark Munoz and move saucier fighting.
Could I potentially be fighting the 

3788
02:49:26,691 --> 02:49:26,850
winner of that fight?
You know,

3789
02:49:26,851 --> 02:49:28,440
that's,
that's definitely in the room too.

3790
02:49:28,441 --> 02:49:30,870
And if that's the case then maybe I am 
too fights away.

3791
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:33,840
If I cut down to one 70,
I don't think that.

3792
02:49:34,170 --> 02:49:36,070
Let me fight for the title,
you know,

3793
02:49:36,071 --> 02:49:38,640
like I'd still be one fight away,
maybe two.

3794
02:49:39,090 --> 02:49:41,280
So no,
I don't think I'd be any closer.

3795
02:49:41,970 --> 02:49:42,820
Would,
uh,

3796
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:47,280
physically the physicality of like me 
being a bigger one 70 than a lot of guys

3797
02:49:47,281 --> 02:49:48,900
stronger than one 70.
Yes,

3798
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:51,180
there'd be benefits there.
But again,

3799
02:49:51,181 --> 02:49:56,181
diminishing returns.
Like what am I giving up for that in 

3800
02:49:56,181 --> 02:49:56,181
exchange for.

3801
02:49:56,181 --> 02:50:00,050
Do you look at the window that you have?
I mean we've established that you think 

3802
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:03,231
you have a five year window.
I know you don't want to give up the 

3803
02:50:03,231 --> 02:50:03,231
number,
but you did.

3804
02:50:03,231 --> 02:50:04,320
Do you do you look at that and say,
well,

3805
02:50:04,321 --> 02:50:07,350
if I do get to a title shot at one,
a five,

3806
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:11,340
how much time would I have left to work 
myself up to a title shot at one 70?

3807
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:15,420
Or would I regroup and try again at one 
85 if I wasn't successful?

3808
02:50:15,421 --> 02:50:20,421
The first attempt,
like do you have those thoughts in your 

3809
02:50:20,421 --> 02:50:20,421
head or do you just think about next 
fight?

3810
02:50:20,421 --> 02:50:24,900
No def.
I definitely have those thoughts in my 

3811
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:25,330
head.
I love having the five meter target.

3812
02:50:25,360 --> 02:50:30,360
That's the super close thing that I'm 
looking at that I'm saying this is the 

3813
02:50:30,360 --> 02:50:32,791
goal that I'm trying to achieve.
I'm trying to get a perfect group in 

3814
02:50:32,791 --> 02:50:32,791
right here,
you know,

3815
02:50:32,791 --> 02:50:32,791
that's that potential next opponent,
you know,

3816
02:50:32,791 --> 02:50:33,370
that's that guy that drank two,
three,

3817
02:50:33,371 --> 02:50:35,920
four so I can get a title eliminator 
type fight.

3818
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:38,770
But then I see the,
the long road.

3819
02:50:38,771 --> 02:50:39,340
We're like,
okay,

3820
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:40,660
I fight,
not fight.

3821
02:50:40,750 --> 02:50:45,750
I,
when I'm fighting for the title and I 

3822
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:45,820
lose the title,
can I kind of Chalcedon in it and talked

3823
02:50:45,821 --> 02:50:47,480
my way into another title fight in a 
different way.

3824
02:50:47,481 --> 02:50:48,280
Class,
you know?

3825
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:48,780
Um,

3826
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:51,870
Chael Sonnen is an interesting way to 
describe it because that's what a lot of

3827
02:50:51,871 --> 02:50:53,040
people are doing now.
Yeah.

3828
02:50:53,041 --> 02:50:54,360
Duty when you,
when you,

3829
02:50:54,361 --> 02:50:56,430
when you,
when your name has become a verb.

3830
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:58,860
Like,
dude,

3831
02:50:58,861 --> 02:51:02,490
he just totally got chills sewn in.
Sells a master wordsmith.

3832
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:07,520
He really is.
You did a great fucking job chels 

3833
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:07,680
sending it with this Michael bisping 
fight though.

3834
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:10,140
Both of you did.
I mean it,

3835
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:15,160
it got interesting and I was very happy 
that you guys sort of sorted it out 

3836
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:16,800
inside the octagon and you both gave 
each other a lot of respect.

3837
02:51:16,801 --> 02:51:21,801
But God damn,
there was a lot going back and forth 

3838
02:51:21,801 --> 02:51:21,801
between you two.
Yeah.

3839
02:51:21,801 --> 02:51:22,620
We're like,
we're never going to be friends.

3840
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:24,660
No.
But when you like when you hit,

3841
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:27,110
I hit him so hard.
So like I,

3842
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:27,450
I,

3843
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:32,180
it had the same performance that in,
in strikes landed in percentage that Jon

3844
02:51:32,180 --> 02:51:34,670
Jones to texture it did as I did to car

3845
02:51:34,840 --> 02:51:36,810
being like,
that's I hit that guy that many times.

3846
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:38,640
You have blasted him with some hard 
shots.

3847
02:51:38,641 --> 02:51:39,840
He took them,
he took them,

3848
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:41,730
you know,
like I know how hard I hit.

3849
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:46,790
I put guys down to the gym with way less
and I'm wearing four ounce gloves and 

3850
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:47,880
Michael Bisping was like,
Hey,

3851
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:50,670
I'm here for 25 minutes.
You're not going to put me away as like,

3852
02:51:50,671 --> 02:51:52,740
how can you not respect a guy for that?
Now he's,

3853
02:51:52,741 --> 02:51:54,150
uh,
he's definitely a tough dude.

3854
02:51:54,151 --> 02:51:55,410
He's very,
very determined.

3855
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:57,820
He's a,
he's also a,

3856
02:51:57,930 --> 02:52:00,480
you've got to give it up for them,
for mental toughness.

3857
02:52:00,481 --> 02:52:05,481
Just not even considering retiring.
The fact he's fucked his eye up to eye 

3858
02:52:06,911 --> 02:52:08,110
surgeries.
Not even,

3859
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:13,260
it was just,
it's just a thing I'm going to pull 

3860
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:15,331
aside,
get back into the gym who will come and 

3861
02:52:15,331 --> 02:52:15,331
striking,
you know,

3862
02:52:15,331 --> 02:52:15,910
he's,
he's tough as they come.

3863
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:17,070
He's a born fighter.
I mean,

3864
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:18,490
really,
that's what he's supposed to be doing.

3865
02:52:18,570 --> 02:52:21,860
Is he the personification of our 
nightmare of two,

3866
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:22,600
three fights,
let's say,

3867
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:24,970
loses two more fights.
That is the end of his career.

3868
02:52:25,230 --> 02:52:26,650
Um,
you know,

3869
02:52:26,660 --> 02:52:27,170
he,
his,

3870
02:52:27,320 --> 02:52:28,200
he's,
he,

3871
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:30,880
his eyes going to be permanently damaged
to the rest of his life,

3872
02:52:30,910 --> 02:52:35,910
you know,
like how much brain damage does he had 

3873
02:52:35,910 --> 02:52:37,511
and how many fights and how many 
sparring preparations for or fight has 

3874
02:52:37,511 --> 02:52:40,491
he had.
Now he's done and he's out of the 

3875
02:52:40,491 --> 02:52:40,491
limelight and he's broken,
you know,

3876
02:52:40,491 --> 02:52:43,330
does he have,
was he smart enough to prepare for that?

3877
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:45,330
I think he was,
but you know,

3878
02:52:45,370 --> 02:52:47,470
he,
he is that example of,

3879
02:52:47,500 --> 02:52:49,510
you know,
key left everything in the cage and time

3880
02:52:49,511 --> 02:52:52,540
and time again at 24 minutes.
So the fifth round,

3881
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:54,520
that dude was still trying to get up for
me.

3882
02:52:54,550 --> 02:52:55,870
You know,
like when the,

3883
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:58,720
when the,
when the 32nd call was from our corners,

3884
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:03,940
he's like started coming right at me 
after I just dominated him for 24 and a 

3885
02:53:03,940 --> 02:53:03,940
half minutes.
Yeah.

3886
02:53:03,940 --> 02:53:05,740
He wasn't given.
I'm still trying to win that fight.

3887
02:53:05,810 --> 02:53:07,510
What a great.
He's a tough dude.

3888
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:09,550
No doubt about it.
He's got some serious problems.

3889
02:53:09,551 --> 02:53:14,140
He's got a real injury to his neck.
Affecting is a strength of his arm.

3890
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:15,040
You know,
he's a,

3891
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:16,960
he's a,
he's as tough as they come.

3892
02:53:16,990 --> 02:53:19,090
You know,
he's definitely as tough as they come,

3893
02:53:19,270 --> 02:53:24,270
but I know what you're saying as far as 
guys that accumulate injuries and then 

3894
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:25,870
they get to a certain point in time like
what is left.

3895
02:53:25,871 --> 02:53:30,871
You know,
there's a lot of guys that have done 

3896
02:53:30,871 --> 02:53:30,871
less far,
far less,

3897
02:53:30,871 --> 02:53:35,720
you know,
less successful than him that their 

3898
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:35,720
bodies have given out along the way.

3899
02:53:36,100 --> 02:53:41,100
It's a fucking hurt game,
so the game and the hurt game is along 

3900
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:45,571
the way.
Just the amount of accumulation of 

3901
02:53:45,571 --> 02:53:45,820
damage that you get in training.
Forget about.

3902
02:53:45,910 --> 02:53:48,790
That's what most casual fans just have 
no idea.

3903
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:51,040
You see little cuts,
a little bit of blood,

3904
02:53:51,041 --> 02:53:52,990
a little bit of sweat and the fight,
that's nothing,

3905
02:53:53,170 --> 02:53:58,170
you know,
like leading up to my 25 minute fight 

3906
02:53:58,170 --> 02:54:00,870
with Michael Bisping like my sparring 
partners were like Bubbleq Danielle and 

3907
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:04,141
Carlos condit when they're are peaking 
for their fights and then they moved on 

3908
02:54:04,141 --> 02:54:05,440
and then I had John Jones,
myself,

3909
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:10,800
like this room full of dudes that are 
the best in the world and if we're 

3910
02:54:10,901 --> 02:54:15,850
sparring two times a week for seven,
six,

3911
02:54:15,851 --> 02:54:16,930
seven,
eight weeks,

3912
02:54:17,050 --> 02:54:18,580
you know,
like leading up to that fight,

3913
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,000
you know,
and like we're hitting each other just 

3914
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:24,000
as hard there as we are in the cage,
you know,

3915
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:28,420
because you have to put,
push yourself as far as you can in 

3916
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:30,370
training so that the best element of who
you are,

3917
02:54:30,400 --> 02:54:33,150
what you are occurs in the cage,
what do you,

3918
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:34,450
how do you feel about that?

3919
02:54:34,450 --> 02:54:39,450
Like as far as like sparring hard,
do you think that you have to spar as 

3920
02:54:39,450 --> 02:54:42,130
hard as you fight or do you think that 
there's a way?

3921
02:54:42,131 --> 02:54:45,850
Like Robbie lawler famously said that he
doesn't really spar much as sitting.

3922
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:47,200
Yeah.
He said he knows how to fight.

3923
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:52,260
He said it's just about getting in shape
and working on his technique and I'm a 

3924
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:53,320
little ice bar way less than I used to.
You know,

3925
02:54:53,321 --> 02:54:55,100
like I,
I'm,

3926
02:54:56,340 --> 02:55:00,580
and on very rare occasions do I really 
go all out.

3927
02:55:00,730 --> 02:55:04,130
But I think there are there times in a 
fight

3928
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:09,130
camp where both your coaches need to see
you and you need to see yourself when 

3929
02:55:10,521 --> 02:55:12,410
you're,
when you're trying to do it all.

3930
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:13,160
You know,
when,

3931
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:14,570
when,
when you're broken,

3932
02:55:14,571 --> 02:55:15,800
when you're hurt,
when you're tired,

3933
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:21,220
you know,
and sometimes the only way to get there 

3934
02:55:21,220 --> 02:55:23,030
is to push yourself to the limit and 
they only put way to get there is man by

3935
02:55:23,031 --> 02:55:23,720
going after it.

3936
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:28,270
And so you have to feel what it's like 
to be inside that,

3937
02:55:28,390 --> 02:55:29,030
that,
that,

3938
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:31,930
that position to be inside that,
that,

3939
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:37,080
that position where you're just duking 
it out at 100 percent.

3940
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:41,560
There's no holding back.
You know what it's like to be exhausted.

3941
02:55:41,561 --> 02:55:43,720
You know what it's like to be strong,
you know what it's like to be hurt,

3942
02:55:43,721 --> 02:55:46,730
you know what it's like to bounce back 
from being dominated in a,

3943
02:55:46,731 --> 02:55:51,731
in a training session.
Like there's no substitution for that 

3944
02:55:51,731 --> 02:55:51,731
actual fight.

3945
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:52,790
No,
no.

3946
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:56,150
In grappling.
Like do I ever am I in a position for,

3947
02:55:56,151 --> 02:56:01,151
you know,
a guy for me to work on an escape of an 

3948
02:56:01,151 --> 02:56:01,151
bar,
you know,

3949
02:56:01,151 --> 02:56:02,540
there's a thousand ways I could have 
prevented ever getting there.

3950
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:05,330
But I still have to see what it's like 
to get out of it.

3951
02:56:05,870 --> 02:56:09,590
And the only way I'll ever see what it's
like to get out of it is a film actually

3952
02:56:09,591 --> 02:56:12,050
put in it.
So it's the same in fighting like,

3953
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:13,760
um,
when I,

3954
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:16,630
when I thought I had really hurt my hand
in,

3955
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:17,610
in,
uh,

3956
02:56:17,720 --> 02:56:22,190
in the first round and I sit down and I 
come out the second round,

3957
02:56:22,191 --> 02:56:23,370
I just tanked,
you know,

3958
02:56:23,371 --> 02:56:26,240
like pain,
adrenaline dumps against,

3959
02:56:26,380 --> 02:56:27,430
against Mike,
you know,

3960
02:56:27,450 --> 02:56:29,500
I come back to the court at the end of 
second round and they're like,

3961
02:56:29,700 --> 02:56:34,700
all right,
so you're gonna lose this fight if you 

3962
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:34,700
do that.
I was at the pits,

3963
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:34,970
you know,
like my hands hurt.

3964
02:56:35,300 --> 02:56:37,250
I wasn't sure if I could throw my right 
hand again.

3965
