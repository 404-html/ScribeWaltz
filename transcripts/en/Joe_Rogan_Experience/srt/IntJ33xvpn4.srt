1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
[inaudible] live.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,060
We're back.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,893
I bet.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:08,731
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,564
We came back.

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:10,790
Well,

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,710
Mons and Marquez Lmo Brian.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,461
Brian would connect.

9
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:14,791
Correct?

10
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,790
You were gonna we were trying
to watch the fade or fight.

11
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,820
We've got to get a new
apple TV up in this bitch.

12
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:21,810
We got this old shit.

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,673
We gotta get the new one.

14
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,150
The new one has a better remote.

15
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,571
Oh yeah,

16
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,404
I got the new one.

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,500
I tried to download the road,

18
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,540
use the remote APP,

19
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,261
but he gets,

20
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,850
it only works on one apple TV.

21
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:30,370
Can't use it.

22
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,590
The one you have somewhere else.

23
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,970
It's not effective.

24
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:33,804
What does marijuana,

25
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,450
it's just bad for what does this,

26
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,313
uh,

27
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,320
we're going to watch the,

28
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,154
uh,

29
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,090
fade or Fabio Maldonado
fight in its entirety.

30
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,781
Entirety,

31
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,320
Huh?

32
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,150
Yeah.

33
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,983
Is this fine?

34
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,570
I believe it's 13 good.

35
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:48,711
Hey,

36
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:49,544
y'all give me,

37
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,850
if you get panicky,

38
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,773
fast forward.

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,993
I've seen him.

40
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,143
I know.

41
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,721
Had He,

42
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,554
did you see it?

43
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,000
I saw highlights of it.

44
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,900
And you're in for a treat,

45
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,120
but it might be more shocking if a guy
like Kim took that much time off and came

46
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,250
back and was as good as he's ever been.

47
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,551
You know,

48
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,310
it's almost like we expect from the
greatest heavyweight of all time.

49
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,390
What do you think is going on,

50
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,390
do you think is the same
thing that happened that
came the same thing to happen

51
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,740
to anybody at a certain time?

52
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,340
Your body point gets older.

53
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,440
Older man,

54
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,480
like father time does not
give a fuck if you're rushing.

55
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,360
When he did throw down when he was stolen,

56
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,310
no shots powers.

57
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,330
The last thing to go Eddie,

58
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,870
he throws him like,

59
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,920
I don't know anybody throws those shelf.

60
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,390
Fuck the way she's
coming down and a spider.

61
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,560
Can you see that?

62
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,010
The power power.

63
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,741
It's the last thing you you'll,

64
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:39,390
that's why heavyweights last so long,

65
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,730
but he could not got do it out there.

66
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,080
That's,

67
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,020
that's strange.

68
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,711
Who the fuck that?

69
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,250
Let's get a big old spider appeared
to get this white girl in corner.

70
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,130
That was my idea or idea.

71
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,190
That's still a Russian lady.

72
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,060
Gaga right there.

73
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,361
Well,

74
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,760
what I wanted was a little
cultural appropriation.

75
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,800
Poisonous spiders.

76
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,220
Eddie.

77
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,053
That's a,

78
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,340
you're lucky a Pepsi
was seen in that bitch.

79
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,363
That's right.

80
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,740
It's just a black widow.

81
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,910
What's his message man?

82
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,260
Black widows eat their mates.

83
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,970
It's just the like my pussy.

84
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,804
So good.

85
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,210
Who the fuck that off threaten you with?

86
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:09,600
Uh,

87
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,910
the fear of me killing
you after I fuck you.

88
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,500
That's how hot I am when my song,

89
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,210
I mean,

90
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,350
wait,

91
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,183
who's this?

92
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,950
I don't know.

93
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,720
Say it fade or though
the same fate or God,

94
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,430
Russia's been some dark shit.

95
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,473
Isn't that um,

96
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,420
the uh,

97
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,860
kickboxing gentlemen who knocked out
Badr Hari is that it is Peter Grams.

98
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:26,694
That Peter Graham

99
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,300
never liked his kickboxing.

100
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,133
I'm sorry.

101
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
Just check is still singing.

102
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,390
This is so strange.

103
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,890
I'd like to know if she can sing if fast
forward this a Peter Graham with it.

104
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,550
I think it is who?

105
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,770
Powerful violins.

106
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,350
Violins are very strong instrument.

107
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,221
Chose it.

108
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,680
You have class sophisticated.

109
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,160
Yeah.

110
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,210
How about the track team?

111
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,180
Not Up in here.

112
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,341
Track team.

113
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,860
When you mean the Russian track
teams banned from the Olympics.

114
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,251
Oh,

115
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:53,580
well,

116
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,230
little cheat cheat.

117
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,970
Well,

118
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,803
getting a little testy.

119
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,980
They said they're going to
check other sports Russia too.

120
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:00,850
They're going to be fucked.

121
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,220
Something like Olympic Dude
is tweeting at me saying that,

122
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,000
uh,

123
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
that I say that uh,

124
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,870
steroids and I'm EPO aren't dangerous and
unlock contrary to what I say steroids

125
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,390
and danger.

126
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,940
And he told her Olympic guy to suck Dick.

127
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,130
Oh well can give gimme danger.

128
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,140
All that stuff's dangerous.

129
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,020
Use too much of it.

130
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:17,771
If you read the line,

131
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,390
all that shit I can for sure.

132
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,160
It could be doing
anything and be dangerous.

133
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,321
You know,

134
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:22,360
it's fucking dangerous man.

135
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,813
Cheeseburgers,

136
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,373
Ibuprofen,

137
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,620
really sending your blood
like apparently that stuff,

138
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:29,831
no,

139
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,330
it's not even a thinning your blood,

140
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,060
it causes all sorts of
issues with your body.

141
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:39,061
This a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory
medication that a lot of people take all

142
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,480
the time.

143
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,980
Well Cameron Hanes was on that shit.

144
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,870
The dude was running the
hundred miles right now.

145
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,230
Yeah,

146
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:44,530
he,

147
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,040
he,

148
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,821
he was on that shit.

149
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,500
And then Rhonda Patrick
came on the podcast.

150
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,420
It was talking about how dangerous
it is and all this stuff.

151
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,230
It does.

152
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,550
And he had been like,

153
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:51,791
he's like,

154
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,001
dude,

155
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,600
I need it.

156
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,860
I'm sore all the time.

157
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,963
Check this out.

158
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,450
He gets off of it and
because he's off of it,

159
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,020
apparently in talking to
people that understand it,

160
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:01,171
it,

161
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:04,120
it affects your gut bacteria
when you take too much of it.

162
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,954
If you abuse it,

163
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,640
he was taking 800
milligrams in the morning,

164
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,630
800 milligrams at night.

165
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,463
It's just too much.

166
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,760
So it was raising,

167
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,910
his blood pressure was doing all
this shit to him and it was creating

168
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,130
inflammation is gut
because he was abusing it.

169
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,840
It was fucking with his joints.

170
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,970
So he gets off of it
because of that podcast.

171
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,200
All the pain that he's taking the fucking
medication for in the first place goes

172
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,890
away because the pain had been partially,

173
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,960
at least because of the fact she's,

174
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,850
he's creating inflammation
by taking this shit.

175
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,690
So is,

176
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,300
I mean this guy was running so often,

177
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,300
it didn't make any sense.

178
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,710
I don't understand blood pressure.

179
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,350
I don't understand what like why
do you get high blood pressure?

180
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,011
Why do you not?

181
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:39,844
I don't understand it,

182
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,310
but I do know that he
gets off this Ibuprofen.

183
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,670
He's doing the same thing in every
other way and all of a sudden his blood

184
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,504
pressure drops.

185
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,080
Jesus.

186
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,680
That's crazy.

187
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,513
That's nuts.

188
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,850
So this guy who is,

189
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:52,030
uh,

190
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,610
doing the commentary for this thing
apparently was the funniest fuck that man

191
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,650
says he's the best.

192
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,660
I was listening to one
thing that he was saying.

193
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,800
It was hilarious,

194
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,634
man.

195
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,320
I to,

196
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,810
if they would let us listen and
UFC you probably polar shit.

197
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,560
Really?

198
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,310
Yeah.

199
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,210
It's five past.

200
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,110
We got to get permission.

201
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,223
They don't trust.

202
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,130
He could talk your boy data permission.

203
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,030
Too much.

204
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,550
Dang Jar to be association.

205
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,050
I didn't give you permission.

206
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,320
Oh,

207
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,153
maybe.

208
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,211
Maybe something like this,

209
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:19,421
right?

210
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:19,720
Yeah.

211
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,060
Fatal.

212
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,661
It's five pounds.

213
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:21,760
I should have asked it in advance.

214
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,653
I don't want to bother him.

215
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,860
She's got a lot of planning to do.

216
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,340
How is it that the UFC
200 is still together?

217
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,710
How is it that something
catastrophic hasn't happened?

218
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:30,311
I've cards too.

219
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:31,000
God damn good.

220
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
You just jinxed it.

221
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,061
No,

222
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:32,241
no,

223
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:32,421
no,

224
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:32,561
no,

225
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:32,741
no.

226
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,520
Not really.

227
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,390
If that card goes through
though exactly as planned,

228
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,100
it will be left to fall out.

229
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:39,934
It's still the best,

230
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,960
the best card of all time.

231
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,070
Even if four fallout,

232
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:42,904
we're still good,

233
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,470
but what I'm thinking is villain.

234
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,460
How weird would it be if nothing
fell out like that's how crazy.

235
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:49,480
This fucking sport is.

236
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,871
Nuts.

237
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:54,871
This sport is so wild and so volatile
that you got to accept the fact we all do.

238
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,950
Like when rumble just pulled out,

239
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,303
Glover,

240
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,990
we all accept the fact that man,

241
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:01,190
there's like a certain,

242
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,470
there's a certain amount of fights
that just are not going to happen.

243
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,820
Nothing he could do about it.

244
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,231
Literally nothing.

245
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,921
You do nothing.

246
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,820
He was part of the sport,

247
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,683
part of the sport.

248
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,000
It's just too crazy.

249
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,701
It's too crazy.

250
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,600
It's too dangerous.

251
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,181
Training suit.

252
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:16,880
Tav trainings too bad on the
joints in the neck and God,

253
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,860
what did rumble pull out from that?

254
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,791
This or does this?

255
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,624
Jamie,

256
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,883
this is

257
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,140
your first fight of the nights.

258
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,910
Jim Miller verse Tuck.

259
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,260
Noreaga go me.

260
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,030
This is fun.

261
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,670
You Diego Sanchez and Joe Lowe's on Pam.

262
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Second fight of the night moves saucy
and that's on fight pass pre cards.

263
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,650
Have you seen Enrique
Mart and fight or Marin?

264
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,041
Excuse me.

265
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,610
I have not.

266
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,560
Enrique Marin and the guy
was fighting sage Northcutt.

267
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,113
I don't know him.

268
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,180
Enjoy that sage enough north gut though.

269
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,760
What do you mean by that?

270
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,060
Meaning and sage north earthen
rip your face off with his abs.

271
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,000
You're on UFC 200 for a
reason because your names.

272
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,080
Oh,

273
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
you never know son.

274
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,080
You never know.

275
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,500
Sage northcutts there for a reason.

276
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,220
Wow.

277
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,770
Interesting a great card though.

278
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:07,780
Dan.

279
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,580
You didn't think that way about pass
fight pass card they've ever had.

280
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,550
God Damn Amazing Pass card ever.

281
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,040
Right then.

282
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,170
You will never do better than that.

283
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,030
How about cats?

284
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,630
Ghana and Julianna Pena.

285
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,420
Holy Shit.

286
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,820
That's going to be a wild fight,

287
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:23,141
man.

288
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:23,961
That main cards.

289
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:26,180
Fucking nine Velasquez.

290
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,350
Travis Browne,

291
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:28,260
Josie Aldo,

292
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,210
Frankie Edgar,

293
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,044
Misha Tate,

294
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,250
Amanda Nunez,

295
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,120
Brock Lesnar,

296
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:32,954
Mark Hunt,

297
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,980
Daniel Carme,

298
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,210
a Jon Jones.

299
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,860
People are going to have a heart attack.

300
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,694
Dana White.

301
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,620
Nah,

302
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,880
that's a hard tack card.

303
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,560
By the time you get to the main event,

304
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,394
you're dead.

305
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,691
You know it's crazy.

306
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:45,170
Joe,

307
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,003
what?

308
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm going to say it without Brock Lesnar.

309
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:48,861
Mark Hunt.

310
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:52,220
That card's not that big of
a bang or paper view wise.

311
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,190
It doesn't beat a con card or Rhonda Card.

312
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
Maybe that's why they come in.

313
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,140
Yeah.

314
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,700
That's why they sent that bat signal.

315
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,380
Brock Lesnar came over from WWE.

316
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:00,531
Well,

317
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:00,861
you know what?

318
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,060
There's a reason why they pay that money.

319
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,391
You don't.

320
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,110
They did too.

321
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,820
They played a very,

322
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,850
very smart move strategically
because he's the biggest paper.

323
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,710
If you starve all time,

324
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,510
numero uno,

325
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,340
numero uno,

326
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,640
that flat top good for him.

327
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:21,641
So when Conor McGregor comes along and
Conor McGregor in the UFC have some sort

328
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,140
of a disagreement about things,

329
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,860
would it be that is their fucking
four aces that they lay down?

330
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,320
Oh,

331
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,450
did they pay for it?

332
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:30,771
Yeah,

333
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,910
there's definitely some pain,

334
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,170
Yo.

335
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,690
Yeah.

336
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,230
Yeah.

337
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,063
How much?

338
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,330
How much?

339
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,020
I don't know.

340
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,621
Probably a lot.

341
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:36,920
Right?

342
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,840
Let's I what?

343
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,980
From what I hear is the most
the fighters ever been paid.

344
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,090
How much do you think that is?

345
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,820
Color makes more than 5 million.

346
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:44,950
Ron Carter made a million.

347
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,700
Apparently Kai was the first MMA
athlete to ever enter into Forbes 30,

348
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,510
30.

349
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:50,781
Yeah,

350
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,910
whatever the top third is,

351
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,380
hot paid athletes top or whatever
the hell he was and all of those.

352
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,214
Number one.

353
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
Yeah.

354
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,851
And then there was,

355
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:57,120
um,

356
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,953
the other guy,

357
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:58,921
what's the,

358
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,061
uh,

359
00:08:59,061 --> 00:08:59,300
the,

360
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,470
the soccer player Rinaldo's number one.

361
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,651
Yeah,

362
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:02,484
but there's the other guy,

363
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,091
Massey.

364
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:03,271
Yeah,

365
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:07,310
he's up there Brazilian soccer player
from like 10 years ago and all those guys

366
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,860
finish that Brazilian

367
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,110
a portrait.

368
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,800
You remember that guy
from like 10 years ago?

369
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,120
The Brazilian guy superstar.

370
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,290
Not that too.

371
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,420
There's some bad ass
soccer players these days.

372
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,261
They make a lot of money,

373
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:19,680
man.

374
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,221
It's crazy.

375
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:20,580
You know,

376
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,220
we don't think about it because in
the United States it sounded big sport

377
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:24,120
because sport in the world,

378
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,720
it's giant.

379
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,690
Ronaldo and Messi.

380
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,191
You're number one.

381
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:26,880
And number two,

382
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,290
Ian Edwards has been getting me into it.

383
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,693
I've been trying.

384
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,890
It's,

385
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,460
it's,

386
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,190
it's,

387
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,023
it's fun.

388
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,511
I mean,

389
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,344
it's tough.

390
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,920
Strong.

391
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,753
I stutter.

392
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,663
Struggle's real.

393
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,793
So here we,

394
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,020
or just walked into the cage there.

395
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,990
That's the top paid athletes in the world.

396
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,260
Fucking good for you.

397
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:51,261
Tiger Woods at fucking number 12
and you're making 46 million a year.

398
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,040
Wow.

399
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,420
Could you haven't done shit.

400
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,190
He's on competing right now.

401
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,151
Damn.

402
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:58,050
Cam Newton,

403
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,030
Lebron James' son,

404
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:02,020
77 fuck,

405
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,470
fuck you Joe.

406
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,473
Flacco.

407
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,230
Joe Flacco.

408
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,310
Fuck you.

409
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,540
Holy Shit.

410
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,380
Jesus Christ.

411
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,214
Keep going down.

412
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,560
God Damn.

413
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:14,560
They're like fuck you.

414
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,270
But he like,

415
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,551
man,

416
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,100
he makes more than Joe Flacco.

417
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,000
This isn't these numbers or
banana damn come Gary name.

418
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:21,880
Yeah.

419
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,030
Conor McGregor is like 34 or something.

420
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,380
Go down there and see what it is.

421
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,680
It's,

422
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,820
he's at 22 million to more than nine
years for for some reason there is no 34

423
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:30,151
whoa.

424
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,470
It's a fucking lucky number.

425
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,623
They kicked them out.

426
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,610
Maybe there was a tie
somewhere on the list.

427
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:36,444
Probably.

428
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,170
We're both guys are going to say a
number at the top 50 he's up there.

429
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,900
There's no UFC fighter and the
contras down in the 22 so it's,

430
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:50,901
I guess it's a hundred is it a Forbes
100 is it four is 100,000 and a UFC

431
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,590
fighters on there it is right there.

432
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,451
There he is.

433
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,350
22 million.

434
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,220
That's interesting.

435
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,390
A lot of guys in this 20 to
20 he's number one and he's,

436
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,310
what is that 85 in the world?

437
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,130
All those sports.

438
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,150
The call these people like Jimmy
Johnson likes $22 million a year.

439
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,080
Wow.

440
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,570
Good for them.

441
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,950
Canelo he makes more than
Canelo and Canelo is now low.

442
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:11,660
Such a base.

443
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,350
See the biggest guy in boxing right now.

444
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,393
Yeah.

445
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,451
Yeah.

446
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,111
That's interesting.

447
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:16,944
Right?

448
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,620
Well they see the biggest
guy in boxing a straw.

449
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,340
No,

450
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,650
he's dumb.

451
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,910
Cause the biggest dragon has
[inaudible] name another star.

452
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:24,870
Really inbox right now.

453
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,920
Now that Mayweather's gun.

454
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,600
Well Amir Khan before that fight,

455
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,181
but that,

456
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:29,880
that was a big victory for Canelo.

457
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Canelo still the bigger
draw the right numbers wise.

458
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,580
Miguel Kodo is still a big,

459
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,600
Miguel Cotto was another example of a
guy was like super tatted up and he's a

460
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,280
world championship caliber fighter.

461
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,191
Like that's a,

462
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:44,130
that's a real rare back in the day.

463
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,091
That's a real new,

464
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,170
super tatted up,

465
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,380
real,

466
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,650
real tatted up and became more and
more tatted up as his career went on.

467
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,023
That's true.

468
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,260
Do you ever see what
I'm homeboy looks like?

469
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,650
Um,

470
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,640
the white dude from,

471
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:54,980
uh,

472
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,813
Youngstown,

473
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,283
uh,

474
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,671
oh,

475
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,010
you're talking about Kelly Pavlik,

476
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,660
Kelly Kelly attitude.

477
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,800
He's just bodies covered a super tight,

478
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:03,760
just went nutty with it.

479
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,391
You know,

480
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,980
who is the suit he's a young kid.

481
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,180
Does is silly.

482
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,014
It's skateboarding.

483
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,370
He looks cut.

484
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,510
Do you see what Bobby Green did?

485
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,620
Tattooed his head?

486
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,970
It's not like a dragon on his head.

487
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,810
Well,

488
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,200
okay.

489
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,840
There it goes.

490
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,560
Like guys can do it exactly the same.

491
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,171
He was right.

492
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,440
He looks exactly the same.

493
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,010
They both got dad bought.

494
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,233
Um,

495
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,950
they both got set of tits on him.

496
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,440
It's interesting because they're
in the neighborhood there.

497
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:27,791
No,

498
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,230
that's the neighborhood Joe.

499
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:32,470
No matter if I came over dude's house
and he looked like that and he had Bobby

500
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,590
Green.

501
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,991
There's this,

502
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:35,680
any on his pants off and he
has knuckles clenched up.

503
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,350
I'd be very nervous to for the shoulders.

504
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,210
It looks like those what a,

505
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,391
yeah,

506
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:43,900
there's Bobby Greens head look at
Eddie fedoras never had an ass.

507
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,880
Barbara Green tattooed his whole,

508
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,290
what do we know what it is?

509
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,153
I don't know.

510
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,053
I don't know.

511
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,440
Professor Athlete or bus.

512
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:50,801
My man.

513
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:51,910
You ain't working at remax.

514
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,010
We're looking like that.

515
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,840
It's good looking guy.

516
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,800
He does shut the fuck.

517
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,510
Don't hate,

518
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,230
I'm not hating.

519
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,470
I'm taking it on their out of it.

520
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,710
Is it is the Dragon?

521
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,760
What is that German dude?

522
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,140
I celebrate that Shit.

523
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,740
No idea.

524
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,573
I'm trying to figure it out.

525
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,350
It looks like some sort of dragon.

526
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,011
Yeah,

527
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:06,790
something like that.

528
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,623
It looks dope.

529
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,580
Wish I could do that.

530
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,660
Could not.

531
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,773
Well,

532
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,310
well what's his face?

533
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:15,610
Uh,

534
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,170
Jason Ellis has the craziest
ones because it's so intense.

535
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,520
It's so intense.

536
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,400
Jason.

537
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,640
I never seen Jason Ellis.

538
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,100
She said I was tattooed a
wolf on the top of his head.

539
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,360
Let me see the Werewolf.

540
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,720
Oh,

541
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,550
his whole head is like a wolf.

542
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:31,384
Look at liquid hook

543
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,240
and he's white as fuck.

544
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,810
There's a bunch of pictures of that Jamie,

545
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,780
where he could see a straight on shot.

546
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,250
We could see the actual wolf.

547
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,990
That's a wolf dude.

548
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,890
Look at that.

549
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,370
Look at that.

550
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,203
That's his head.

551
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,813
So intense.

552
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,010
It's so crazy.

553
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,903
Looks good though.

554
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,630
I love it.

555
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,070
Only certain people can pull that off.

556
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,550
He's,

557
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,210
he did it.

558
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,043
He pulled it off.

559
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,883
It's the same guy to me.

560
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,210
Look at all these people like excited
about watching his fate or fight.

561
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,410
That might be the new shit.

562
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,960
Shaved your head and tattoo
it or build like his guys.

563
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Make it look like Karen
me tattoo that fade to fe.

564
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,983
Tattooed.

565
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,480
Imagine you have to have
a good design though.

566
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,080
You can't have like hello
kitty hair designed.

567
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:16,990
It doesn't go out of style.

568
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,160
You can't tattoo a mullet.

569
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,280
What if you have a whole menu
of what's going on in there?

570
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,010
What does that,

571
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,431
is that,

572
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,070
is that a bad ea or a boozer?

573
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,000
Carlos Buhler.

574
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,890
Boozer is that real?

575
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,190
He tattooed his whole head like spray.

576
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:30,611
No,

577
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,350
he went ahead and spray paint that shit.

578
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,113
Oh Wow.

579
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,133
I don't weird.

580
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,850
He looks fucking terrible.

581
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,160
I hope that that catches
on and that'd be cool.

582
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,220
I've seen some really bizarre head pieces
that have been done like people have a

583
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,710
over the last few years that's been
more and more common and do like these

584
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,980
really crazy art pieces on your head.

585
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,360
Is it easier for black hair?

586
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,421
Bobby Green.

587
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:55,254
Excuse me sir.

588
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,173
Don't fuck.

589
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,663
Look at this.

590
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,580
We're watching fader and Maldonado and
fader was just swinging for the fences.

591
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:01,791
Man,

592
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,480
look at this holy and and I was
covering up in Malden dollars,

593
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,314
moving,

594
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,430
standing right in front of them and fade
or just blew a giant wad and Maldonado

595
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,110
duct and covered and blocked.

596
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:20,111
A lot of that will fade or
definitely unloaded on him so much.

597
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,580
Knock out

598
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,300
39 impersonator looked like
this fade or just swing and man,

599
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,720
this is crazy.

600
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,090
Maldonado's blocking.

601
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,890
A lot of that stuff comes down the street.

602
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:37,401
This drug,

603
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:38,181
this all time.

604
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,220
Look at their bodies.

605
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,460
It's still there is he has to make sure
you eat ice cream and I checked your

606
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:43,701
blood.

607
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,534
There's no ice cream.

608
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,980
Real life.

609
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,270
Everyone's eat the hot dogs all day.

610
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,830
All Denado is bleed.

611
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,370
No left.

612
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,091
Oh,

613
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:56,960
there it is.

614
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,250
He's,

615
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,353
he's out.

616
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,343
Oh my goodness.

617
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,770
Oh my goodness.

618
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,890
Oh my goodness.

619
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:04,550
He is.

620
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,390
They're stopping this.

621
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,423
The

622
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,920
sparks flying there,

623
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:10,730
man.

624
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,810
That's amazing.

625
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,330
He's a baptist stuff.

626
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,630
Oh my God.

627
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,161
Dude.

628
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:16,994
I'm like

629
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,540
legs and both time,

630
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,350
but God damn it.

631
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:21,830
You have,

632
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,480
the brain can only take so much.

633
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,490
The head can only take so much.

634
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,353
I do it.

635
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,291
What are you doing,

636
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:27,680
man?

637
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,520
What do you mean into the clothes?

638
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,090
What are you going to do with the UFC
if his life outside of this is probably

639
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,530
not as fun if you're best friends,

640
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:34,640
fucking Putin.

641
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,610
Putin likes to see victory Puente,

642
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,720
his best buddy.

643
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,160
Deep and Russian girls is a good time.

644
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,570
I don't know.

645
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,120
I shot vodka mock Russia,

646
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,090
Russia.

647
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,050
This is a beat down,

648
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:48,261
man.

649
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,310
It's an ugly Pete down.

650
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,520
He's getting boxed in to get fucked up.

651
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,563
Oh.

652
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,180
Oh my God.

653
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,620
No,

654
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,453
no man.

655
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,970
I mean he's moving.

656
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,051
He's moving,

657
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,220
so look at it.

658
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh my God.

659
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,910
There's 100 oh my God.

660
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,620
100% stop us in the UFC.

661
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,760
Oh my God.

662
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,780
Oh my God.

663
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,703
Shit.

664
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,120
I can't.

665
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,100
Oh my God.

666
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,060
How about the that?

667
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,330
I bet the forums were going
nuts when this is happening.

668
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,433
Oh.

669
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,730
Oh my God.

670
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,530
All denials.

671
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,071
Beating the shit.

672
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,600
This is worse than I thought it was.

673
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,900
Wave or oh my God,

674
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:23,660
this is horrific.

675
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,493
Oh,

676
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,383
oh.

677
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,870
How is he surviving?

678
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,850
Oh my God.

679
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,790
What are fatal or get?

680
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,800
She gets came.

681
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,630
Oh Jesus Christ.

682
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:33,620
Excuse me.

683
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,353
Come on.

684
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,580
Oh Oh

685
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,970
thing is federal comes UFC.

686
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,530
They tossed him fucking,

687
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,730
oh my God.

688
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,100
So I'm a normal dude.

689
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,960
You get no monster.

690
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,820
Oh my God.

691
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,530
What are the craziest
fights I've ever seen?

692
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,120
Oh my God.

693
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,373
Oh,

694
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,191
how bad.

695
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:03,640
He's still fucking still
getting bobbin that head moving.

696
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,550
He must be so determined
not to lose like this again.

697
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:06,710
Look,

698
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,770
the dropped again.

699
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,970
The emperor is a fucking monster.

700
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,261
Boy.

701
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:13,480
He has taken some horrible shots.

702
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,440
The Russian Zombie.

703
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,860
You're fucking batshit crazy.

704
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,120
You think that Russian judge
or ref is stopping anything?

705
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:20,140
He didn't want to die.

706
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,691
If you're a journalist,

707
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,140
you write bad shit about fader or you die.

708
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,881
This is so,

709
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:25,330
uh,

710
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,330
it's so weird to watch him like this
now and think about when he was in his

711
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:31,150
prime.

712
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,980
Oh my God.

713
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Well you to bump this up.

714
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,220
You know what their day
just fucking gave that ref.

715
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:37,120
Oh my God.

716
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,200
A new car.

717
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,063
You know what I mean?

718
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,630
The mob.

719
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,630
It's funny in this show.

720
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,490
Oh Jesus Christ.

721
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,383
Leave this.

722
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,370
Okay.

723
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,600
Oh my God.

724
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,711
Maldonado,

725
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,350
that nasty apricots modem box to me.

726
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,140
Fuck Aa can only hurt Glover.

727
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:53,950
Yeah.

728
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,790
And they got dealt with.

729
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,830
Oh my God.

730
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,780
Jesus Christ.

731
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,770
He's uppercuts.

732
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,660
What did they do at rough?

733
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:05,940
Said let's put this up.

734
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,150
Let's give him a break.

735
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,680
What did he do there?

736
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,080
Got Him another car.

737
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,183
Oh my God.

738
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,390
Oh,

739
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,223
upper cut.

740
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,221
Another one.

741
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:15,880
Another one.

742
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,181
Fatal.

743
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,760
Tried to crazy knee fader swings back.

744
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,560
Look at them and saw Austin.

745
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,930
We're strictly cause he
going to go three rounds.

746
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,790
This is incredible and amazing.

747
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,820
The power fade or possesses
and has flied in us.

748
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,800
Have you ever seen such
a powerful flat ass?

749
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,030
That's a very good point.

750
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,480
Right?

751
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,550
So I'm just going on as a tiny ass.

752
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,320
Most guys that much power.

753
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,190
I have fucking cheek
son because look at how,

754
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,140
why to shoulders are,

755
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,590
yeah,

756
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,860
I know no ass.

757
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,140
That's where all your power comes from.

758
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,130
Well you know the thing is you
don't need that much power.

759
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,800
You just need to land with power.

760
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,490
Right?

761
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,290
Like the difference between the guy
who's got like stupid one punch knockout

762
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,250
path Johnson.

763
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,143
Yeah.

764
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,330
And it got close to be as though
cheeks but Faye doors knocked like um,

765
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,860
what's his face?

766
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,993
The grim reaper.

767
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,193
Fuck's his name.

768
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,890
Grim reaper do.

769
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,860
Um,

770
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,170
in,

771
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,003
uh,

772
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,960
give me a hint in strike force

773
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,250
talking about Brett Rogers Rodgers,

774
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,390
right,

775
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,911
exactly.

776
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,100
He didn't call himself the grim reaper.

777
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,993
I don't think so.

778
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,570
Did he,

779
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,610
did he breadth the grim reaper Rogers.

780
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:21,881
That's,

781
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,590
that's a nice ring to make that up.

782
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:23,771
No,

783
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:24,660
that has a nice ring.

784
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,040
Somebody call him that he did it
and I hope it comes back and fights.

785
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:27,360
Is that,

786
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,193
has that name?

787
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:28,800
No,

788
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,633
I made it up.

789
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,663
What's that?

790
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,740
The grim.

791
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,573
Okay.

792
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,420
I'm sorry Doug Graham.

793
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:35,011
But he thought,

794
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:35,450
oh my God,

795
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,720
look at this phase.

796
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,100
Brandon,

797
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,560
I think,

798
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,090
I think it's just the shorts for Bikini's
on you would see a little bubble.

799
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,900
But remember Brett Rodgers knocked out
Andrea Lawsky and the first round and he

800
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:50,620
was really good and I think he fought
fade or after that if I'm correct.

801
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,100
That's right.

802
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,180
He thought he'd beat Andre.

803
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,940
And then it was a big high profile fight,

804
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:58,900
but it was a tough fight for Fado before
he bombed on him with a right hand.

805
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,660
And there was an interesting fight because
one of his trainers just like fate or

806
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,040
one with his old tricks,

807
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,790
but really like you need
to be training and there,

808
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,080
remember Brett Rogers Fret over him.

809
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,753
He fought Uber.

810
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,890
Uber even fucking thrown to the mat.

811
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,830
Ubering was terrifying back then and said,

812
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:14,951
hey,

813
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,581
Brett Rogers,

814
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:18,300
sweet knock out of our
Lawsky here's feed or Uber,

815
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,330
Rheem.

816
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,163
Enjoy this.

817
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,430
You're going to go away now.

818
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,770
You know what?

819
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,150
I don't enjoy an MMA.

820
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:23,500
That overhead shot.

821
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,641
Oh,

822
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:25,600
the right hands.

823
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,983
Oh,

824
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,080
Maldon Nanos got a nice short right hand.

825
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,170
Who can that Jab fitters
thinking right now?

826
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,280
God Damn it.

827
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,953
Wow.

828
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,780
Maldonado way looked at like double jab
fate to the face and a jab to the body.

829
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,250
Nice and loose.

830
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,990
He's a good boxer,

831
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:45,350
man.

832
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,561
Yeah,

833
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:46,280
really good box.

834
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,880
Ooh,

835
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,691
barely clipped.

836
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:48,770
Fade on the out.

837
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,380
Faders faces a mass too,

838
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:51,651
man.

839
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:52,580
He's such a warrior.

840
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:56,080
Can rush it out and be okay
that he tries to find neon him.

841
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,133
God Damn,

842
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,420
he's a savage man.

843
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,700
Shows you how far the sport's come though.

844
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,750
When I watch this stuff,

845
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,591
my God damn.

846
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:04,280
It's nuts.

847
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,670
Like watching Wonderboy is nuts,

848
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,160
man.

849
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,251
Oh,

850
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:08,090
it's a different thing,

851
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,310
but it's also a different
weight class as well.

852
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:13,380
There's never been anybody in this weight
class that can move like wonder boy

853
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,620
damn magic and his ass.

854
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,251
Oh my God.

855
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,440
Fit or the come back strong.

856
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,870
They're both exhausted.

857
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,570
You have a fader was the Atlanta
in some good shots there.

858
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:23,961
Ooh,

859
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:24,794
nice length fillers.

860
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,633
Fucking them up.

861
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:25,881
Well,

862
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:30,550
here's a diversity of fair doors attack
versus Maldon Donald's boxing fader

863
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,960
control.

864
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,330
So it's just been a box too though.

865
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,253
Yeah.

866
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:33,840
Oh Hey.

867
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,020
Did you just use not that bad.

868
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,190
He's,

869
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,610
he's good at getting back up mirror.

870
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:37,870
Mild.

871
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,071
No.

872
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,770
You of the body all the time in the UFC.

873
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,000
Is he a brown belt Eddie?

874
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,560
I don't know what it is.

875
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,580
Why don't I feel like he's a brown belt?

876
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,430
Fabio Maldonado Jujitsu.

877
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,540
Find out what it is.

878
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:50,840
He,

879
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,351
Oh shit.

880
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:54,710
Now I can't see fit or
I can do everything man.

881
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,611
You know.

882
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:57,370
And this is the NASA space.

883
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:59,060
He against heavy bag though.

884
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,900
He's exhausted.

885
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,650
He is.

886
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,120
But I mean fader was really good at,

887
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,470
look at his adjustment.

888
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,810
He's decided to fight on the outside,

889
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,780
start kicking now.

890
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,170
And then these found the
weakness in Maldonado,

891
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:09,004
his range,

892
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,090
he's fighting way farther apart now.

893
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:14,060
Look at him cause he got ate up by some
of those punches and so you got such a

894
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:14,600
good job.

895
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,433
Oh beautiful.

896
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,760
So was coming in with these punches,

897
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,200
but he's on the outside with those kicks.

898
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:21,410
See I think this distance he
changed the whole distance game.

899
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,270
I think anyone in the top
10 would eat his fight.

900
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,561
Maybe now.

901
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,480
But God damn it,

902
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,030
I'm watching.

903
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,680
This shit almost makes me upset.

904
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,581
That's what I'm saying.

905
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,750
I lied or man,

906
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,111
no,

907
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,820
I'm not saying that pride in the UFC
didn't come to some sort of an agreement

908
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,931
early,

909
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,471
early,

910
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:43,471
early on and we could've seen fade or
like cro cop fade or add his best fight

911
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:47,900
against the best heavyweights
and he mean very well.

912
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,560
May have been the best
for quite a few years.

913
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,270
Most likely was most likely,

914
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,283
most likely.

915
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,191
I mean,

916
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:55,641
it's all,

917
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:58,670
it's all speculative and totally
actually fights a guy like Cain.

918
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,751
But God damn,

919
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,500
he was good.

920
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,300
Maldonado was a brown belt boom.

921
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,740
Beautiful fucking combination for memory.

922
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,073
Harmful.

923
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,790
Ooh,

924
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,610
look that right.

925
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,640
Jesus Christ.

926
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:11,280
He looks good.

927
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,220
I'm talking about those really guys

928
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,500
blue,

929
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,510
but the k doors,

930
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:16,990
he's,

931
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,890
he's landing some colorful show shit.

932
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,191
You,

933
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:19,360
you,

934
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,210
you sympathize with him because he beat
bay doors ass and he got tired from it.

935
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,033
Nothing.

936
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,900
They don't got the ass kicking.

937
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,590
Yeah.

938
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,230
You know what I mean?

939
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,420
No.

940
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,380
He's one on the other
side of the punishment.

941
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,030
I got feed or um,

942
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,790
I mean he's hitting on some really good
shots towards the end of this round.

943
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,840
I think it's his round.

944
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,680
100% of them are small punch this round.

945
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,840
No.

946
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,060
Yes,

947
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,970
he did in the beginning.

948
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,200
Very beginning.

949
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:43,160
He hit him with good shots,

950
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:47,300
but Fado has definitely taken over
this round or set 100% of first round.

951
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:48,190
He lost 10,

952
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,800
eight.

953
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,270
I don't give a fuck you from Russia.

954
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,090
Egypt.

955
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,120
That's 10 me.

956
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,881
It might be 10,

957
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:53,570
seven man.

958
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,970
It might be 10 cigs if
we're in fucking Colorado.

959
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,390
Yeah.

960
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,080
That's weird.

961
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,501
It's weird.

962
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,560
Decide what that is because
that was the Brits attentive.

963
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,240
That was a vicious beat down in
this round is a perfect example.

964
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:04,730
This is not the beat down
that that first round was,

965
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,950
it's he's who could this
Maldonaldo clipped him.

966
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,900
Draw modern.

967
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,490
I don't fucking clipped him again.

968
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,480
I look at Fader,

969
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,931
his face,

970
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:12,171
man.

971
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:13,220
It's a horror mask.

972
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:13,770
Oh.

973
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,603
Oh.

974
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,490
Oh my God.

975
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,953
God Damn.

976
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,180
The faders brothers in prison.

977
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:21,014
Right.

978
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,623
Um,

979
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,140
I think that's what I read last time.

980
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:24,730
I too.

981
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,660
It's like Marlo Zimmer main new sites.

982
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:28,590
How to think about it and
then interviewed them there.

983
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,600
Kill them bitches or something.

984
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,820
He killed anybody in the snow.

985
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,960
I think you're making sure that,

986
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,450
I don't know what the fuck happened.

987
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,130
Even little snow,

988
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:38,240
but he's a savage.

989
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,030
He's a super selfish blue.

990
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,864
That ACL.

991
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,070
This is one of the
commentary was at its best.

992
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,050
I don't know what is going on.

993
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,853
What

994
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,551
he fell down,

995
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:52,910
bitch.

996
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,850
She's showcase trying to create
drama when there is nothing ice.

997
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:56,570
He's fat.

998
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,180
Fucking five minutes and 50 seconds.

999
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,300
How about you shut that off.

1000
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,113
Oh my God.

1001
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,583
Yeah

1002
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,543
man.

1003
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,430
Well fight.

1004
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,450
So fader won that round,

1005
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:09,470
but that's a ten nine rounds.

1006
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,280
The last round was ten eight hundred
percent I agree 100% even though he got

1007
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:13,730
knocked down.

1008
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,563
He still one?

1009
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,320
Yeah.

1010
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,591
Yeah.

1011
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:16,330
I think you want,

1012
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,620
I mean he,

1013
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,490
he got clipped any went down,

1014
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,180
but he went right back up
and I think mother Russia,

1015
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,320
he landed some pretty significant shots.

1016
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,370
It was a close round,

1017
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,960
but I think I gave it to fade or,

1018
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,260
but I'm not a judge and I really don't
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1019
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,240
Did anything terrible at scoring things.

1020
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,220
Okay.

1021
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,450
I don't think Tufts sports score,

1022
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,730
I don't think in some cases
there should be a winner.

1023
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,640
You know,

1024
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,820
like the boss of your fight both say,

1025
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,450
yeah,

1026
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:41,860
I feel good.

1027
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,070
That's like that.

1028
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,220
Like to say one guy,

1029
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:45,780
one on one guy lost my God.

1030
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:45,991
Damn,

1031
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:46,950
that's so close.

1032
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,061
It's so close.

1033
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:49,290
He gets into this gray or,

1034
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:49,471
I mean,

1035
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,600
you could say that you
thought that Bossi one.

1036
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,650
And I could say that I
thought I'd call and why,

1037
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:54,061
but if you,

1038
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:54,600
if you,

1039
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,340
if you look at it all together,

1040
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,761
it's like,

1041
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:57,594
man,

1042
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,820
it's just a,

1043
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,810
it's a guess.

1044
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,651
You know what I'm saying?

1045
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:02,040
Yeah.

1046
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,510
It's a great guy.

1047
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,290
Damn fight.

1048
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,370
It's so good to see.

1049
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,130
You need to watch it again when I'm sober.

1050
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,671
Yeah.

1051
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:09,720
I need to watch the whole fight.

1052
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,411
I usually do that.

1053
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:10,951
I record them.

1054
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:13,050
I watch them Sunday mornings
when we do the companions.

1055
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,080
So this is a third brown.

1056
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,710
So I have ten first round for Fabio Hook.

1057
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,331
Your favorite?

1058
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:21,810
Favorite.

1059
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,141
Wow.

1060
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:22,960
Fay door's busted.

1061
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,793
Hot Man.

1062
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
The greatest of all time.

1063
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,070
Right?

1064
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,150
What do I still does it?

1065
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,670
The only other guy that it's on the
argument about the greatest of all time.

1066
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:32,504
Times cane.

1067
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,060
Oh,

1068
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,893
how dare you.

1069
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,763
What about for doom?

1070
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,813
Well,

1071
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,201
Pete Kane.

1072
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:37,470
Yeah,

1073
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,100
that's true.

1074
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,933
That's true.

1075
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,073
What about Steepbank?

1076
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,651
Yeah.

1077
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,041
You know what?

1078
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,860
Steep Steep Bay has
the potential for sure.

1079
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,910
He's like at the door,

1080
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,630
you know Steepbank and hit together.

1081
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,500
So do before you can see
as the greatest phone.

1082
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:48,691
No,

1083
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:48,871
no,

1084
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:49,051
no,

1085
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:49,231
no,

1086
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:49,681
no doubt.

1087
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:50,580
But he's,

1088
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,050
he's in an advanced place,

1089
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,913
right?

1090
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,410
Knocked out for doom and a beautiful one.

1091
00:27:55,411 --> 00:28:00,411
Punch knockout in Brizzy wobbled
him left with a beautiful left hook.

1092
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,590
God damn his boxing is crisp.

1093
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,961
I'd say Malo.

1094
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,110
Strikings better this fight.

1095
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,611
It looks good man.

1096
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:09,090
It does.

1097
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,930
It looks more Chris.

1098
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,151
Well,

1099
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,690
he also knows this is
super dangerous opponent.

1100
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,063
Oh my God.

1101
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,190
Oh Nice.

1102
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,270
Your body by freight door.

1103
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,750
Still quick as fuck.

1104
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,643
Oh Man.

1105
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,281
Combo.

1106
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:25,340
Beautiful Combo by fate
or really isn't dropped.

1107
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,480
Oh God.

1108
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,550
Mom and clipped him again with the left.

1109
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,050
Hook them up.

1110
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,150
That left hook on the outside.

1111
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,691
Oh,

1112
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:33,590
the jab.

1113
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,550
God damn all done.

1114
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,860
Otherwise are good fucking striker.

1115
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,700
You know,

1116
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,960
it's,

1117
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,150
it's one of those things
where you gotta wonder like,

1118
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,800
is this what fate or wants to do?

1119
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,910
Is this like an exciting fight for
Ramsey and join this or is this a,

1120
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,190
is it a financial decision?

1121
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,110
You feel like it's diminishing his legacy?

1122
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,950
No,

1123
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,783
not to me.

1124
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,440
To me it's just this is who he is.

1125
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:00,550
This is not what he's done.

1126
00:29:00,551 --> 00:29:01,384
Just a fighter.

1127
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,010
What he's done is just fucking,

1128
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,630
you can't take that away from them.

1129
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,763
Yeah.

1130
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,800
I mean if you go always be
PAMF pound one or two for me.

1131
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,580
Heavyweight.

1132
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:09,911
Oh yeah.

1133
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:10,660
I think one,

1134
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,493
I think one,

1135
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,170
yeah.

1136
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,150
For me as a case.

1137
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,320
He does have a case,

1138
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,640
but the thing is,

1139
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:16,181
I don't know,

1140
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:19,390
a fader was the same guy by
the time he got divert doom.

1141
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,460
I mean it's total speculation.

1142
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,353
I also think,

1143
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:22,991
you know,

1144
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,160
guys taught long and errors,

1145
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:24,440
man.

1146
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,851
I agree.

1147
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:26,590
Because you look at what Kane did,

1148
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:27,290
amber doom,

1149
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,700
they're also facing I think
more well rounded guys.

1150
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,150
Yeah.

1151
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,170
Good shot to the bottom.

1152
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,580
Evolution of the sport.

1153
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,473
100%.

1154
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,410
But you know,

1155
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:36,790
when you're looking at all time greats,

1156
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,130
don't you think that Muhammad Ali
is the greatest boxer of all time?

1157
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:40,410
Do for bevy ways,

1158
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:40,621
ins,

1159
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:41,140
right?

1160
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,160
But if you yeah,

1161
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:43,180
like for socially.

1162
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:43,570
Yes.

1163
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:43,901
Yeah.

1164
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:45,850
And what he stood for over pop culture,

1165
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,111
all that.

1166
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:48,160
What do you think that
he would have survived?

1167
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:48,821
Mike Tyson,

1168
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:49,451
the Mike Tyson.

1169
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:50,530
The beat Marvis Frasier.

1170
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:50,681
Yeah,

1171
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,430
I do.

1172
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,090
Maybe,

1173
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,100
but did you ever watch Henry
Cooper knock them down?

1174
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,560
Yeah,

1175
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,040
they're like the same age
when Henry Cooper knocked,

1176
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,610
uh,

1177
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,421
Tyson down,

1178
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:58,930
or excuse me,

1179
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,790
Muhammad Ali down and um,

1180
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,493
uh,

1181
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,371
we're talking,

1182
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,890
we're talking Muhammad Ali
before the draft bullshit.

1183
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,700
Yeah.

1184
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,121
Oh yeah.

1185
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:07,701
This is death.

1186
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:08,980
This was when he was Cassius clay.

1187
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,630
When he sketched clay,

1188
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,120
he beats Mike Tyson
afterwards where it's tough.

1189
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,653
Yeah.

1190
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,090
It's hard to say man.

1191
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,640
Yeah.

1192
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,341
That's a thing,

1193
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:18,670
right?

1194
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,230
It's like when do you catch the guy?

1195
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,640
Like when you look at this fade or you
can't judge this fade or in the third

1196
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,850
round of this fight with Fabio
Maldonado who's been beaten up,

1197
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:28,900
his eyes are almost won.

1198
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,210
This is not quite the same guy as
the guy who we saw just armbar.

1199
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:37,810
Kevin Randleman have to get super relaxed.

1200
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,020
The guy that we saw come back against
Fujita Fujita caught him on the big punch,

1201
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,741
came back.

1202
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,220
There was no Garrett grounding pal.

1203
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:45,881
Yeah man.

1204
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:46,710
It was no camera.

1205
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,600
That's what the time,

1206
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,780
cause remember Verdomme fought in pride
and he would have eight fucking ver

1207
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:56,970
dooms lunch back then but for doom
now with list his fucking head off.

1208
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,510
I think there are different guidance
to say for doom now is on the,

1209
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,970
he's still at the very highest level.

1210
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,420
I mean we've got to see how he rebalanced
for Steve Bay knock out cause it was a

1211
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,290
brutal knockout.

1212
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,730
But before that fight,

1213
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,790
if you look at his knock out and Mark
Hunt and if you look at a submission

1214
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,840
victory over a cane,

1215
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,820
you're looking at like the best version.

1216
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,850
You think about junior dos Santos in his
prime against fade or fight junior dos

1217
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,440
Santos is prime in his prime.

1218
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:24,880
His father came stuff.

1219
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,990
But I'll tell you what dude,

1220
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:28,810
he looked really fucking
good and his last one great.

1221
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,190
He did look really good.

1222
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,850
You look great.

1223
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,391
Shocking,

1224
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:31,810
right?

1225
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,410
Amazing.

1226
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,200
Really good.

1227
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,033
Amazing.

1228
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,290
I mean a lot of people thought that
Ben Rothwell had the answer to his uh,

1229
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,070
boxing style with his,

1230
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:42,281
you know,

1231
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:43,600
Ben is just awkwardness.

1232
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,010
Real awkward and dangerous.

1233
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:48,880
Like super dangerous was knockout
power dealt with and also like really

1234
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,480
confident.

1235
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,840
You know,

1236
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,550
Ben is just a real savage
and super experienced guys.

1237
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,640
Been around for a long time.

1238
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:55,210
Huge,

1239
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,721
huge,

1240
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:56,261
enormous,

1241
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,950
like one of the biggest like physically
Busiek biggest guys in the heavyweight

1242
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,251
division.

1243
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,140
Like just how busy we are,

1244
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,991
how big he was.

1245
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,100
And even at Wayne's I was like,

1246
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:03,911
he's not that big.

1247
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,010
They want to get knocked
down like Jesus Christ.

1248
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,470
What the fuck am I doing it heavyweight.

1249
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,730
He's so big.

1250
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,260
Enormous.

1251
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,200
And Harry,

1252
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,620
he's so big that he did.

1253
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,270
He like,

1254
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,730
there's no doubt he could not make
two oh five you look at me go wide.

1255
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,740
These are real heavyweight fights.

1256
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,180
I like to be lost a row or like,

1257
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:22,301
Hey,

1258
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:23,200
what do you think your two of five?

1259
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,063
No Man,

1260
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,510
what do you think of 300 yeah,

1261
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:26,980
he's the argument for the weight class.

1262
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,461
Yes,

1263
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,650
it's got his hands down.

1264
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,560
Boom,

1265
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,240
boom.

1266
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,991
He's exhausted.

1267
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,824
I think man.

1268
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,770
But he a lot of times he fought like that.

1269
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,810
He never moved like that,

1270
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,640
but he's just a,

1271
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,040
you know,

1272
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,620
I mean you got to consider the beating
that he took in that first round,

1273
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,860
but if you remember like
the cro cop that used to,

1274
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,611
there it is.

1275
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:47,444
That's the end.

1276
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,110
That's it.

1277
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah.

1278
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,880
I first round ten nine six
[inaudible] 10 I mean first round,

1279
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,930
ten eight second around
ten nine this friend,

1280
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,561
I don't fuck,

1281
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:58,130
he won this round two seems like a draw.

1282
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,580
I would,

1283
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,660
I would assume that it's draw.

1284
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,610
If I was a,

1285
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,480
if I didn't know the score,

1286
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,460
he jumped up on the ring
like he for sure had it.

1287
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:04,971
Well,

1288
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:05,960
you know he fought well.

1289
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,780
I know in that first round
he did second 30 days.

1290
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,420
Hill faded would be undecided
in a couple of shots in there.

1291
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,140
We'll fade or definitely came back in
that second and his reign draw his range

1292
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:18,590
was better.

1293
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:18,831
Yeah,

1294
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,260
I would say that that's a
reasonable to call that a draw.

1295
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,210
If I was watching this
and I was objective,

1296
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,290
there's never good Madoff
in the house either.

1297
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,160
Draw them all Dinaro
line either at the draw.

1298
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm all denial.

1299
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,250
Yeah,

1300
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,590
I don't see,

1301
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,423
yeah,

1302
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,371
I agree.

1303
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:32,180
And the damage,

1304
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,180
well there's no way that fate or the
second or the third by any more than ten

1305
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,780
nine if you had the
standard scoring system,

1306
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:39,410
we're getting dropped.

1307
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,170
Last hook he grabbed,

1308
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,470
he cracked him,

1309
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,070
he cracked.

1310
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,060
Even in these rounds,

1311
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:44,960
he's still hurt,

1312
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,990
fade or more than feed or hurt him or
hit him or fate or it hit him with some

1313
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:50,521
good shots.

1314
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:51,380
Those second and third rounds,

1315
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:52,101
but he wobbled,

1316
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:55,580
fade are in the second round
riding on the shoulder a lot too.

1317
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,851
He's,

1318
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,360
yeah.

1319
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,111
Well there was a nice ride,

1320
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:57,520
man.

1321
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,800
Look,

1322
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,730
it's a good fight,

1323
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,121
you know,

1324
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,970
and Maldonado rose to the
occasion and for photo,

1325
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:02,990
this is a very,

1326
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,320
very,

1327
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,190
very difficult fight to gypsy.

1328
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,330
When fader would make paintings
and they would sell them on Ebay.

1329
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:08,780
Yeah.

1330
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,613
Beautiful.

1331
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,030
Through a terrible,

1332
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,860
people would buy a beautiful paintings.

1333
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,240
I even looked at bidding and on one,

1334
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,370
did you go to college?

1335
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:16,611
I was like,

1336
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:16,671
yeah,

1337
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,690
I want to fade or painting.

1338
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,420
It was like a smiley face man.

1339
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,254
He's um,

1340
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,750
he's all time legend right there.

1341
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,170
If your fate or I can just do shit.

1342
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,010
I almost bought it.

1343
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,600
It was take my fucking paypal.

1344
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,560
He's 39 now.

1345
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:31,310
So how old he is.

1346
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:31,521
Yeah.

1347
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:35,930
39 30 he needs to stop all time.

1348
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,764
Legend man.

1349
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,391
All Time Ledge.

1350
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,800
And how old is Dan Henderson?

1351
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:44,420
Dan Henderson is 45 and the goddamn
American treasure just knocked out.

1352
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:46,910
Hector lie the way to
find it for a world title,

1353
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,331
by the way.

1354
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:47,811
Knocked out.

1355
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:49,430
Fade or don't forget that.

1356
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
That's fucking Strikeforce.

1357
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:51,970
Feta.

1358
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,731
Does that hook?

1359
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,520
He misses any comes back with the elbow.

1360
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,040
Oh yeah.

1361
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,820
That was some shit.

1362
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,230
You can't even put it in a movie.

1363
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:58,240
You can't put that movie.

1364
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,420
He would go shut up.

1365
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,480
And why is he moved so stiff movie.

1366
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,333
He would be like,

1367
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,420
I don't believe that this
guy get hit that hard.

1368
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:06,290
Look how he moves.

1369
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,670
These are [inaudible] paintings.

1370
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:08,504
Look at this and it.

1371
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,610
He's Shitty game up now that he retired.

1372
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:11,530
He's a little more detailed.

1373
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,373
I didn't look up there.

1374
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:12,891
Nah,

1375
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:13,401
I don't want that.

1376
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:15,080
Fucking beautiful.

1377
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,510
That's a beautiful tweety bird.

1378
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,763
Cute little girl.

1379
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,580
No,

1380
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,190
he got away.

1381
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,781
He works with,

1382
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:21,531
I didn't want these.

1383
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,370
These are two good.

1384
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,660
Let me tell you something man.

1385
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,051
We,

1386
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,960
we all know he's drawn this shit.

1387
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:27,441
That sad.

1388
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:27,770
No,

1389
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,970
cause it looks like his face.

1390
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,631
That's crazy.

1391
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:30,201
Listen man,

1392
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:34,730
we all miss something in our world by
Brock Lesnar and fade or never fighting.

1393
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:35,180
I agree.

1394
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,800
We all miss something 100%.

1395
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,400
We miss a little piece of life.

1396
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,090
Two Lane that could have been too late.

1397
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,590
That could have been really interesting.

1398
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,430
It's still happen.

1399
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,320
It could definitely still happen.

1400
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,540
Immediate fate or just won this fight.

1401
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,610
And if Brock wins his fight,

1402
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,810
which is certainly a bigF ,

1403
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,520
and if the UFC decides to
sign fade or after this fight,

1404
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,660
because to the fans,

1405
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:58,620
like this is a really tough fight,

1406
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:58,921
buddy.

1407
00:35:58,921 --> 00:35:59,640
One,

1408
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,900
it's still not a loss.

1409
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:01,291
You know,

1410
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,970
after you wait a few months,

1411
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,380
I'm just saying if I was a salesman,

1412
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,660
which check kind of,

1413
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,400
that's your thing as what I would say.

1414
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,390
I would say,

1415
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,070
let's fucking do this.

1416
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,870
We've always wanted to see this.

1417
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,943
Let's do this.

1418
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,833
By the way,

1419
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,920
give him a fucking Usada
exemption that playing games,

1420
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,260
any games,

1421
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,460
give him some turbulence.

1422
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,440
You let them take whatever he wants.

1423
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:26,970
He's fighting Brock Lesnar.

1424
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,983
Oof.

1425
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,730
Let them take whatever he wants.

1426
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,950
Let him get some of that fabric in the
report as the north miss a big reporter,

1427
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:35,790
James Bro.

1428
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:36,900
It's like,

1429
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,370
why don't you get smaller?

1430
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,270
Hmm.

1431
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,740
I'd like to see him a fate or go out.

1432
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,760
He'd go out and after that,

1433
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:41,911
yeah,

1434
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,200
he's his dad.

1435
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,560
Giant ass gorilla.

1436
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,521
Who's that guy?

1437
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:48,340
Look at his hands.

1438
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,173
Jesus.

1439
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,433
There are enormous,

1440
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,060
you don't want that.

1441
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,030
That could be Andrew Karalyn remember
that gets definitely not though.

1442
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,310
Drug corral looks like way harder.

1443
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,940
He's like,

1444
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,290
he's terrifying looking.

1445
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,124
Cool Mike.

1446
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,190
I don't about that.

1447
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:03,024
Pepsi money.

1448
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:04,590
No,

1449
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,710
I don't know what the fuck is that.

1450
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,710
See my ultimate ad space.

1451
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,910
He was on the mic fucking like a fader.

1452
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,570
Well the UFC has like a unit.

1453
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,430
We have like a little UFC logo.

1454
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,200
That's the show and like a network guy.

1455
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,034
But when you have,

1456
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,160
what if the UFC had a monster low?

1457
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,610
Uh,

1458
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,180
Mike,

1459
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,013
can you imagine?

1460
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,601
But when I do,

1461
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,090
he said he was for Fox.

1462
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,380
If it's fs one,

1463
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,540
it says it on the,

1464
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,350
it says Fox on the little thing.

1465
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,910
But like a sponsor,

1466
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:34,150
like what do you think that is?

1467
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,100
Is that a station?

1468
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,270
What is that on his mind?

1469
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,140
I think that's Russian.

1470
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:37,974
Pepsi.

1471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,833
Look at that.

1472
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,350
It's got to be wow.

1473
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:43,780
Or,

1474
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,430
or they,

1475
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,900
they just like the same colors.

1476
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,853
Brendan Shop.

1477
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,090
If you were afraid or his friend,

1478
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,020
would you tell him right now?

1479
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,570
I would give him a way harsher talk.

1480
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,404
Then he gave me,

1481
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,720
I would fucking the hey man,

1482
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,240
cause I'm sure he has
the options in Russia.

1483
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,440
He's a living legend.

1484
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,240
He's like Brad Pitt and Russia.

1485
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:00,930
You know what I'm saying?

1486
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,780
Did you know that there's like
someone was saying something crazy,

1487
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,960
someone sent something to me on Twitter
about him fighting value of next.

1488
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,390
That's seven foot tall Russian boxer.

1489
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:10,320
Is that bullshit?

1490
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,610
I mean if you take some down.

1491
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:12,240
Sure.

1492
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,581
Jamie,

1493
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,820
see she's crazy.

1494
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:15,241
Bullshit.

1495
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,260
Fucking circus.

1496
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,913
I Dunno.

1497
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,690
Well fighting giant giant dudes.

1498
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,740
They don't know shit in Vegas.

1499
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,290
He remembered he did that twice.

1500
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,700
He fought Zulu,

1501
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,980
who was a huge guy but really charming.

1502
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,000
But then he fought Hong Whan Choi
who was at like a seven foot one guy.

1503
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,870
He was enormous,

1504
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:34,250
right?

1505
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,083
Yeah.

1506
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,370
This dude at the Mirage

1507
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,330
talk me.

1508
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,530
I don't think you would sell tickets.

1509
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,710
Three food at night for Friday.

1510
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:45,221
Saturday,

1511
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:45,820
Sunday.

1512
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,370
We do a live flight
companion from that bullshit.

1513
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,730
I want to be this shit be alive,

1514
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,360
get paid.

1515
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,360
If we ever get hired by a casino to do
a fight companion in like a large space

1516
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,880
and Tiwi enough for now.

1517
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,481
Oh my God,

1518
00:38:58,481 --> 00:38:59,680
we're going to get shrunk.

1519
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,650
Someone's going to kill us for a crazy.

1520
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,520
What was I asking you?

1521
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,620
This research I caught value of,

1522
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,670
I don't know whether or not fade or is
rumored to be fighting value of next

1523
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,450
because someone was
saying that on Twitter.

1524
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,000
Can you believe he's
going to fight value of,

1525
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,431
and I was like,

1526
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:19,264
why?

1527
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,230
I think it was Twitter.

1528
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,630
Read it somewhere where I read it.

1529
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,860
He just needs to stop.

1530
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,880
Well maybe it doesn't need to stop or
does he need to do whatever the fuck he

1531
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:30,820
wants to do and this is loves
doing the fuck he wants to do.

1532
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,760
This is probably like more fun for him.

1533
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,571
That did not look,

1534
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:35,860
they're not telling you,

1535
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,160
but came back strong as
fuck in that second round.

1536
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,350
This is the first real,

1537
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,660
it was the first real
challenge that he's had.

1538
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,460
The first guy just could
not grapple with them.

1539
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,100
Right.

1540
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,931
Take that guy down.

1541
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:49,090
Dominates and when the ground
ground and pounds on this fight,

1542
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:49,924
he gets tested.

1543
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,330
So what he's got to do now for shampoos,

1544
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,700
take some fucking time off.

1545
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,050
Take a long time.

1546
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:56,460
Off.

1547
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,790
I think we've taken enough time off.

1548
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,920
You've got to heal up
and get your ass back.

1549
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:00,790
You don't get that much time.

1550
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,271
But that's not what,

1551
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:04,630
I'm 39 I agree with you 100% but I think
he's got to take some time off from

1552
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:05,410
that beating.

1553
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,370
He took a beating dude.

1554
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,630
You can't just jump right back in.

1555
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,381
You'll be,

1556
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:09,760
you'll still be suffering.

1557
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,613
Remember,

1558
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,650
remember what Steve Bay did?

1559
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,160
Maldona yeah I do.

1560
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,970
I do.

1561
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,803
I do.

1562
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,920
Steve Bay is a monster.

1563
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,060
You starched and congratulated him in
the ring after this oh value of did and

1564
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:22,780
that's about,

1565
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,760
that's it about a fight.

1566
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,190
But there was some weird thing where they
cut the value of any made a face cause

1567
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,720
a fader was making some sort of a
speech and they cut the value of,

1568
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,150
I'm just speaking out of like a,

1569
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,993
you know,

1570
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,100
bullshit rubric.

1571
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,860
Well also like if I had to be skeptical,

1572
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,530
I would say probably what they do.

1573
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,393
Which Putin there,

1574
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,030
that's what it says.

1575
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,260
It says my knees.

1576
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,180
A notable people came to congratulate
him including Nicholi value.

1577
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,120
Evan notably Vladimir Putin.

1578
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,071
Putin and him are,

1579
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:51,220
or boys.

1580
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,200
Are you scared if Hillary Clinton wins?

1581
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,130
Oh Shit.

1582
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,120
And I'm more scared if Donald
Trump wins more scared.

1583
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,013
Yeah.

1584
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,800
I think he's

1585
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,460
either way.

1586
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,120
You know what?

1587
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,810
This is what I think Hillary Clinton a
million percent and is going to win 100%

1588
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:05,050
of them.

1589
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,190
Donald Trump is not going to,

1590
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,480
they're not going to let him be president.

1591
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:08,740
That was just a big distraction.

1592
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,200
They put them in there to
make sure Hillary wins.

1593
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,423
For sure.

1594
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,770
Trump going to be president.

1595
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,280
Well that he's going to be the president.

1596
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:21,040
It's all you think is a sound sensor.

1597
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,303
Tower seven.

1598
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,860
What do you think you'd think,

1599
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:24,220
uh,

1600
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,220
you think that the election was rigged
with Bernie Sanders in California and

1601
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:29,591
Hillary,

1602
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:30,424
you think it was rigged?

1603
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,680
You look into it at all.

1604
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:33,514
He didn't into it.

1605
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,070
I did not

1606
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,150
think it was rigged.

1607
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,260
Um,

1608
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,190
there's definitely some sort of a
problem with there was votes at weren't

1609
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:40,700
counted,

1610
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:40,921
right?

1611
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:41,440
Yeah.

1612
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,781
Pretty much.

1613
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,240
That's right.

1614
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,440
History and really being in the
Bernie Carlson pull more land to,

1615
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,040
hold on.

1616
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,480
Eddie,

1617
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,680
what?

1618
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,360
So yeah.

1619
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,880
A friend of mine who I follow on Facebook.

1620
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,743
Uh,

1621
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,670
he was really big in the Bernie campaign,

1622
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,440
uh,

1623
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,740
falling a lot of it,

1624
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,120
uh,

1625
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,670
posting things all throughout
the last couple of months.

1626
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,460
He was even making posters that
were going viral online for it,

1627
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,320
helping voters for
registrations and whatnot.

1628
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,960
His vote wasn't counted and it said,

1629
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:09,590
because he didn't sign this thing and
he is adamant that he hundred percent

1630
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,740
followed everything to the t double
checked all this stuff they're telling you

1631
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:12,841
is,

1632
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:13,880
but it won't be counted a hundred.

1633
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,520
And so what is,

1634
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:16,300
um,

1635
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,090
so what's the conspiracy
conspiracy theory?

1636
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:19,924
Is that uh,

1637
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,893
um,

1638
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,490
that Hillary's campaign is
actively suppressing votes?

1639
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,030
Is it that or is it that there's a bunch
of people that are zealous and they,

1640
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:30,940
uh,

1641
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,650
they identify with the Hillary Party
and they work some in some way,

1642
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:39,290
shape or form and counting side.

1643
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,020
It doesn't count.

1644
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,621
That's what that means.

1645
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:42,251
Everyone don't have to be,

1646
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:42,381
oh,

1647
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:43,960
I voted if you didn't vote,

1648
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,130
don't fucking complain.

1649
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,850
Guess what?

1650
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,770
Your phone didn't count.

1651
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,140
Right?

1652
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,321
No,

1653
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:48,160
I totally get that.

1654
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:48,880
But I'm saying like,

1655
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,620
what do you think is the mechanism?

1656
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:52,240
Like what's actually happening here?

1657
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:57,420
Is it because they think
that Hillary's parlor,

1658
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,660
so Hillary,

1659
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,520
it's like there's some sort of concerted
effort to make her win even though they

1660
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:03,301
know she wasn't wearing.

1661
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:06,160
She's part of the team and she's what
she's can apply no matter what you're

1662
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:06,640
selling,

1663
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,090
no matter what.

1664
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,750
Here's the question.

1665
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,583
Here's a real question.

1666
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,630
Who's doing that and how is that,

1667
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:14,500
how is it the people that are working
in the campaign offices and in the

1668
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:16,000
election was the government?

1669
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,421
Well,

1670
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:17,920
the people that are working
in election offices,

1671
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,480
the people that count elections,

1672
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:19,661
right?

1673
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:20,530
They count results.

1674
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,360
They must have some
kind of political bias,

1675
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,960
right?

1676
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,520
They must meet people do.

1677
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,660
Everyone does.

1678
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,700
Some people are just naturally democratic.

1679
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,320
Some people are naturally conservative.

1680
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,183
They'd have to.

1681
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,570
How do they account for that?

1682
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,220
When it comes to something like this,

1683
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,150
like when you have,

1684
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,950
what is the excuse,

1685
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:39,784
like what's the,

1686
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,401
what is the,

1687
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,660
the the reason they're saying
why these votes weren't counted.

1688
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,280
Provisional ballots is something I've
heard come up a lot and they're going to

1689
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,170
be counted over an
extended period of time.

1690
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:51,060
But they've already made calls for things.

1691
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:51,480
So that,

1692
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,313
I don't know how that felt,

1693
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:52,931
but the dude,

1694
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:53,291
you know,

1695
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,270
said that his stuff wasn't signed right.

1696
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:56,140
They said he wasn't signed.

1697
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,590
Did you take a photo of it?

1698
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,710
Screenshot.

1699
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,400
I sought,

1700
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,950
I think that you said he's got
even eye witnesses that saw him.

1701
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,453
He has a,

1702
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,980
he has a screen shot of him.

1703
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,470
Not a screenshot that it was
a screenshot of like his,

1704
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:12,290
the response to the voter registration
things set that says vote wasn't it?

1705
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,150
Oh,

1706
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:13,983
whistleblowers.

1707
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,040
Whistleblower came out and made a video.

1708
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,570
She made a video and explained everything,

1709
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,890
how they trained or what to do.

1710
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:23,210
And what they did is they supposedly,

1711
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:24,044
this is what she said,

1712
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,390
that they told her that anybody,

1713
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,690
cause you could vote for a candidate
but not be part of a party.

1714
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,351
You could just say,

1715
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,190
I'm not Democrat.

1716
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm not a Republican.

1717
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,450
I'm a whatever her name.

1718
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,470
There's a name for it.

1719
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,060
No,

1720
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,570
uh,

1721
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,351
political,

1722
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:38,460
whatever representation.

1723
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,360
I don't know what the fuck it is,

1724
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,080
but you're,

1725
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,950
you're that third,

1726
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,060
that third class.

1727
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,550
So if most of those people
were voting for Bernie,

1728
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,110
so they weren't either,

1729
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:47,490
they weren't Democrat or Republican,

1730
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:50,430
so they were on that third pile and
that third pound on and those votes got

1731
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:51,050
counted.

1732
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:51,450
Whoa.

1733
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:51,990
That's what,

1734
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,780
that's what the conspiracy
theory is and that's huge shit.

1735
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,471
Huge,

1736
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:56,010
huge.

1737
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:56,843
I mean,

1738
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,330
yeah,

1739
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:57,960
that's an,

1740
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,920
your vote doesn't count.

1741
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,170
Well that's also what
happened during the Al Gore,

1742
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,200
George W elections where they said that
if you actually counted the real numbers

1743
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,370
of people that voted like all
that dangling Chad Bullshit,

1744
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,640
if you actually count the actual
results after they sorted it all out,

1745
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,833
Al Gore won.

1746
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:16,950
He won the election.

1747
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,920
I mean this is like
pretty well established,

1748
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,820
but it's one of those things where you
know how referee stops a fight for the

1749
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:24,654
wrong reason.

1750
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:25,950
Once they stopped the fight,

1751
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,760
the fight stopped.

1752
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:26,960
Yeah.

1753
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,520
It's nothing.

1754
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,320
It's kind of the same
thing with [inaudible].

1755
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,850
They're so terrified of this idea of
losing the power that they get from

1756
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:37,140
controlling the leader of the world,

1757
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:38,220
which is exactly what it is.

1758
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:39,990
When you just decided
someone's a president,

1759
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,430
if you got to a point where you're like,

1760
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:42,211
this is so stupid,

1761
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,260
why are we still having presence?

1762
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:47,250
And everybody agreed there'd be no one
person that would have that position of

1763
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:47,700
power.

1764
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,080
They're so terrified of that,

1765
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,303
that even in it,

1766
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,990
it like some sort of a crazy dispute
where Al Gore like may or may have not.

1767
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:55,980
Obviously I didn't count them,

1768
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:58,740
but if you count them all up and you
listen to a lot of the people that did,

1769
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,750
they said that Al Gore won that election.

1770
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:03,420
He should have won that election easy and
like we're not even going to entertain

1771
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:04,190
it.

1772
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,330
Just not even going to entertain.

1773
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,690
And Adler backs away.

1774
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
And then the same thing
happened with Carrie didn't,

1775
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,020
same thing happened with Carrie.

1776
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,620
There was like some dispute as to whether
or not carry one or didn't mean Al

1777
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:13,861
Gore was a,

1778
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:14,910
for sure thing,

1779
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:15,661
k was close.

1780
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,430
But Carrie was an issue too.

1781
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:17,821
There was a,

1782
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:19,740
there was some sort of a
dispute with Carrie too.

1783
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,180
I think with all those guys,

1784
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:24,930
it's like the game is so fucking wacky.

1785
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:30,350
It's so the game of controlling the
Geo political power of the world and

1786
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:35,640
controlling the greatest nation the world
has ever known and the best people we

1787
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,220
can get.

1788
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,340
The people that were
we're voting on right now,

1789
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,091
it's ridiculous.

1790
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:43,260
All the smartest people aren't going to
run to watch a documentary on Youtube

1791
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:45,540
called behind the Iran Contra affair.

1792
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,100
You'll get to see,

1793
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,480
this is all public shit.

1794
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:53,100
The Iran Contra affair that shows you
how ever help help people get honey deck.

1795
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,240
It shows you everything.

1796
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:56,640
Watch that chronicles,

1797
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,790
the Clinton chronicles and
behind the Iran Contra affair.

1798
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,200
It's fucking nuts.

1799
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,820
Don't get a star on top seven.

1800
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,230
Well we don't have to go to that though.

1801
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:07,740
I rent contract fares is undeniable.

1802
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,783
It's one of those,

1803
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,430
the Iran Contra affair is one of those
conspiracy theories that's so legit and

1804
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:19,020
so verified and so proven that it opens
a door to a lot of other stuff cause you

1805
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:19,141
go,

1806
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:19,980
well wait a minute.

1807
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,530
How the fuck did they think
they could pull off this?

1808
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,160
How do they,

1809
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,160
how did they sell drugs in the La
Ghettos to fund these crazy military

1810
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,230
operations?

1811
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,063
Nothing centuries,

1812
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,220
dude.

1813
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,430
What they did,

1814
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:39,100
it was they sold drugs in
the ghetto like they sold,

1815
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,330
look,

1816
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,163
here's the thing,

1817
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,080
if you know,

1818
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,990
it was like two dozen people
running all that shit.

1819
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:44,860
They're not that many.

1820
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,521
Not that many.

1821
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:45,711
You know?

1822
00:47:45,711 --> 00:47:47,500
And that's one of the
things that the CIA guys,

1823
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:47,801
when you,

1824
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:50,110
when you get to know them and you start
communicating with them and realize,

1825
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:50,800
okay,

1826
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,090
there's some cowboys that realize that
they're kind of operating on their own

1827
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:57,400
and they realized they could make a
lot of money and they went for it.

1828
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,720
And I think that's what happened.

1829
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,750
Military connection in a
lot of tape makes it happen.

1830
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,180
I think that happened in a lot of cases.

1831
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,170
And there's a lot of dudes who sold
drugs and did all kinds of other shit

1832
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:10,440
because there's a lot of other
people doing it and they,

1833
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:10,901
they like,

1834
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:11,560
fuck these people.

1835
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:11,791
Why didn't,

1836
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,000
should these people make this money?

1837
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,260
And we could take this money.

1838
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,400
And we can go do some other shit.

1839
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:16,510
And they got caught with it.

1840
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,980
They got caught funding the war with
the contractors and the Sandinistas in

1841
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:21,671
Nicaragua.

1842
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:23,500
That was during the Oliver North trials.

1843
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,900
All that crazy shit dude.

1844
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,734
It was bananas.

1845
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,430
They got comp buffed it.

1846
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,400
There's like here,

1847
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,680
here it is right here was
the 2004 election stolen
Republican's prevented more

1848
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:33,514
than,

1849
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,301
what does that say?

1850
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:39,190
350,000 votes in Ohio
article written by Robert F.

1851
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,080
Kennedy Jr in rolling stone.

1852
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,123
Whoa.

1853
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,413
Kenny Jr.

1854
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:43,721
Yeah,

1855
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,590
so you see there's always these
debates and disputes about elections,

1856
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,660
but I think at a certain point in time,

1857
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,950
like as a people,

1858
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:52,390
we have to come to this conclusion,

1859
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:56,260
this idea of giving all the power
to one group like this is just,

1860
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,550
it's intoxicating.

1861
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,020
It's dangerous,

1862
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,040
it's not good for them.

1863
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,970
It's not good for us.

1864
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,050
It's not good for anybody.

1865
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:02,860
We Shit,

1866
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,860
we shouldn't have these groups that have
so much power over what you do or what

1867
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:08,681
you don't.

1868
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:13,681
And especially like what the fuck
happens with the future of the world?

1869
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,370
Like who are these people?

1870
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:16,030
Like why?

1871
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,690
Why do they?

1872
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,420
Because we decide cause
everybody raises their hand.

1873
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:20,470
They point to a guy,

1874
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,550
that guy gets to choose.

1875
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:22,720
This is madness.

1876
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,130
We get to stop doing it.

1877
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,973
Old School,

1878
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,110
it's old school for sure.

1879
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,030
Ran Contra scandal was when Ronald Reagan
was president and George Senior was

1880
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:31,751
vice president.

1881
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:33,460
George scene was vice president.

1882
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,220
He was the former director of the CIA.

1883
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:36,641
He's right there.

1884
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,450
Vice President,

1885
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,940
actor fucking president during,

1886
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,803
that's when they were,

1887
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,340
George Bush was running all kinds
of game through the CIA and uh,

1888
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,850
they got caught selling
arms to Iran through Israel.

1889
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,420
We were supposedly,

1890
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:52,751
that was,

1891
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:53,830
those were our enemies.

1892
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,053
But,

1893
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,050
and then they said it was because
they needed a free the hostages.

1894
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,020
So that's why they were
selling arms to them.

1895
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,760
But sounds like a reasonable deal.

1896
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,150
Yeah,

1897
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,660
that's,

1898
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,180
yeah,

1899
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,790
that's some old shit.

1900
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,363
Nothing light him up.

1901
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,880
Now the sweet guns check these
out were just making money.

1902
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:16,300
The guys that were handling the deals
that were just skimming all the money and

1903
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:17,134
that they got busted.

1904
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,240
So the guys that got indicted,

1905
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:20,530
there was like four dudes.

1906
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,230
As soon as George W.

1907
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:23,920
Bush or Jordan,

1908
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,020
not w George singer became president,

1909
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,380
he pardoned all those guys.

1910
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,070
You let them all

1911
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,903
out of jail.

1912
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,730
It was gangster sleeps fog,

1913
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,140
they're gangsters and,

1914
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,350
and it's public knowledge and no one can
do anything about it and you just can't

1915
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:40,280
do shit about it.

1916
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:41,114
So crazy.

1917
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,160
Like you can't do anything
about any of that shit.

1918
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,870
That shit was all public knowledge.

1919
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:45,350
They were,

1920
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:50,350
they had the hearings in front of Congress
on public television for two or three

1921
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,214
weeks.

1922
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,590
It was huge.

1923
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,210
I remember it got busted and guess what?

1924
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,290
Nothing.

1925
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:57,771
Guess what?

1926
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,480
George senior became president.

1927
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:00,170
How about that?

1928
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,641
How about that?

1929
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:00,870
But I,

1930
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:01,703
gangster movie,

1931
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,200
He became president and then he got
his retard son to become president.

1932
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,034
He wasn't,

1933
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,240
just wasn't.

1934
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,073
So how about,

1935
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,700
how about this?

1936
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,593
How about this?

1937
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,640
How about this?

1938
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,270
When he was vice president,

1939
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,320
when all that should happen,

1940
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,000
so when those dudes got busted,

1941
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,100
he pardoned him once he became president
and the guy responsible for all,

1942
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:22,330
for,

1943
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,330
for allowing all the drugs to
come in illegally through the CIA.

1944
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,630
When Bill Clinton was
Bill Clinton in Arkansas.

1945
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:30,464
He was the governor.

1946
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,340
Guess what?

1947
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,480
After George singers,

1948
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:33,920
President Bill Clinton,

1949
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:34,400
that takes us,

1950
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,180
he was next.

1951
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,013
He said,

1952
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,620
what's up?

1953
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:36,951
He said,

1954
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:37,071
hey,

1955
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,180
let us run this shit.

1956
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:40,280
Three a goddamn state
and we'll hook you up.

1957
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:41,630
We'll let you be
president for a few years.

1958
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,171
What about that?

1959
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:43,004
It's hard to,

1960
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,800
it's hard to argue with facts.

1961
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:46,161
I mean,

1962
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,530
Arkansas Gang,

1963
00:51:47,531 --> 00:51:49,300
so Barry seal's connection.

1964
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,150
Watch the crib.

1965
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,470
The Clinton chronicles,

1966
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:52,390
watch that show and said,

1967
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:52,610
dude,

1968
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,760
that Clinton Quantico's.

1969
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,761
You'll see how it,

1970
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:55,251
when he was,

1971
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,580
when Bill Clinton was
governor of Arkansas,

1972
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,510
he was gangster.

1973
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,130
He was the most gangster.

1974
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,593
Oh,

1975
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,883
he's got

1976
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,330
that soprano guy in the White House.

1977
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,860
That's nothing.

1978
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,260
That's a no Bill Clinton.

1979
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,550
Bill Clinton was,

1980
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,590
that's all he cared about was pussy.

1981
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,830
That's all I cared about.

1982
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,250
And there's whistleblower
after whistleblower.

1983
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,480
That's what he was known for.

1984
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:21,703
He got down

1985
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,891
clean,

1986
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:24,320
the grind.

1987
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,080
The sacs calling that is doing sec.

1988
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,983
He was a beast.

1989
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:27,950
He was.

1990
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:28,490
He was like,

1991
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:28,911
what's his name?

1992
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:29,721
Jimmy Soprano.

1993
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:30,554
What's that guy's name?

1994
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:30,980
Tony.

1995
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,350
Tony's.

1996
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,183
How many guys?

1997
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,220
I've done coke in the White House.

1998
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,970
They had the best shit.

1999
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,260
They brought it in the delta.

2000
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,270
They brought it in.

2001
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:45,260
How many people you think what
[inaudible] joint at the White House.

2002
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,000
You're crazy.

2003
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,540
Don't think Obama smoking joints at night?

2004
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:47,931
No.

2005
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:48,360
You don't want,

2006
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,690
I don't know so much weed for sure.

2007
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,450
Colin can a paranoia.

2008
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,000
Do you think that he would get
if he was smoking weed at night,

2009
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,080
he would sleep at night.

2010
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,800
What's that?

2011
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,380
David Cross admits to snoring.

Starting cocaine at the White House.

2013
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,640
He won't be back.

2014
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:05,841
You know what?

2015
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:06,860
That didn't even give a shit.

2016
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:07,500
What the fuck?

2017
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,333
They didn't give a shit.

2018
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,460
Common care is a comic.

2019

I'm sure he was telling the truth.

00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,281
Everybody has.

2023
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:19,780

There's some Storton going on.

2028
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,830
That's amazing.

2029
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:30,640
They would fucking bring coke into the
White House that had such a [inaudible]

2030
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,090

00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,033
It's on youtube.

2038
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,080

2039
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,040
it's at the library.

2040
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,400
My Shit on Youtube.

2042
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,153

Hulu.

2044
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:57,654
Amazon.

2045
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,220
What were we just talking about?

2046
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,820
He says Youtube and then
did you watch it on Youtube?

2047
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:09,330
It's like,

2048
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,680
where else are you gonna fucking watch it.

2049
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:11,514
Hulu.

2050
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,540
Hulu is a fine platform.

2051
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,890
Snoop Dogg says he smoked marijuana
in the White House without Obama.

2052
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,970
Without Obama.

2053
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,081
Yeah,

2054
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:25,860
probably.

2055
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,693
That's a good move.

2056
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,391
It's on here too,

2057
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:27,691
man.

2058
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:28,524
I don't believe it.

2059
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,550
If it was on Vimeo,

2060
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:30,384
I would believe that.

2061
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,430
We're cnn.com what?

2062
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,264

Willie Nelson.

2065
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,473
Willie Nelson.

2066
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:40,501
There's a bunch.

2067
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:41,910
You wish Brian Cowen didn't leave.

2068
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,110
Then you and him could get into it.

2069
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,990
My loves Clinton.

2070
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,860
I'm done with the tower south.

2071
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:54,641
Fast.

2072
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:55,410
You're over.

2073
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,243
You're over with

2074
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:03,380
is how people can watch that shit
and and still not believe it.

2075
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,080
That's more fascinating.

2076
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,120
What's behind that shit that,

2077
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,370
that's what I want to know.

2078
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,550
That's what I want to know.

2079
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:11,821
It's like,

2080
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:12,654
fuck.

2081
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,730
How the fuck does that happen?

2082
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:15,930
How do you get hypnotized?

2083
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,550
You could see that shit coming down,

2084
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,300
but yet you still think it came down.

2085
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,740
The fire is more Pepsi
people reached out to me,

2086
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:23,520
bro.

2087
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,130
How do you make for your
buddies beliefs like that?

2088
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,510
It's no different like,

2089
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:28,470
hey man,

2090
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,363
I'm not offended,

2091
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,100
but which is the conversation?

2092
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:32,934
Just debating.

2093
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,410
I don't believe in dragons.

2094
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:36,480
You guys don't make fun of
me going up to hypnotism,

2095
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:36,840
man.

2096
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,141
I want to.

2097
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:38,610
I want to know everything about that shit.

2098
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,320
I want to know about Mkl
tron on mind control stuff.

2099
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,550
That's what I'm into.

2100
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,790
That shit.

2101
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:44,471
That shit work.

2102
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:45,740
Dope headlights on that car.

2103
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,540
Look at that shit is Formula One car.

2104
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,250
That's the hazards mass.

2105
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:51,084
That portion.

2106
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,670
That thing is nine seven nine whatever.

2107
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,710
Rsa 19 is that what it is?

2108
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,633
The new one?

2109
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,313
Look at that thing.

2110
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,670
Those tires can't be cheap.

2111
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:00,691
You know what?

2112
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:05,400
There's a weird thing that happens when
they switched to these insane shapes.

2113
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,440
His tires can be,

2114
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,250
he's just tired because I have 100 bucks.

2115
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,280
Oh fuck.

2116
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,530
Serves their sponsor.

2117
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:16,881
Oh No,

2118
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:17,040
no.

2119
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,130
They don't pay for them.

2120
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,500
But if you had to pay for 500 more
than a grant to go through it and like

2121
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:24,120
fucking a half more than a grant attire

2122
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,570
for those because they have to be,

2123
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,700
they have to be rated to
go over 200 miles an hour,

2124
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:28,510
not burn.

2125
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,920
Those things are insane.

2126
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,731
They're all slicks,

2127
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:30,971
you know,

2128
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,410
they don't have any tread on them.

2129
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,360
That's the thing about those tires.

2130
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,720
They're like this really soft
sticky component and so they,

2131
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,620
they kinda like drive with them and heat
them up and move around with them and

2132
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:43,690
then once they heat them up real good,

2133
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,940
they become super adhesive.

2134
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:46,301
Yeah.

2135
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:47,290
Real sticky.

2136
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,270
And you could just take you down.

2137
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:49,761
No,

2138
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:49,931
no.

2139
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:52,330
Stick to the crib to
the road like a Gecko.

2140
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,370
It's way better because
you don't get as retired.

2141
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,900
See that Jamie?

2142
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:56,920
That's Nascar dog.

2143
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,390
I'm talking about f one son.

2144
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:59,330
It's got to be very,

2145
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,070
let's say three different
kinds of four 50 leech.

2146
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,413
Interestingly,

2147
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,300
racing teams don't buy their tires.

2148
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:08,260
They leased those,

2149
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:09,940
they leased them from good year.

2150
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,880
The official tire supplier
of Nascar on race day.

2151
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,910
Each team is allowed to lease 16 sets
of four tires for this guy matter.

2152
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:23,560
How crazy that 16 sets they,

2153
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,570
it takes them 16 sets a fucking,

2154
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,490
that's a lot of fun.

2155
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,770
Well that's because those
things are super gummy man.

2156
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,480
So like the really good racers,

2157
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,790
they know when their tires
are like ready to go,

2158
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,740
they start feeling the slippage.

2159
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:36,580
They start,

2160
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,550
they're so sensitive and it's
like really like their ass,

2161
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,640
like their ass and their
feet and their feet,

2162
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,630
their hand connected to the wheel.

2163
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:43,961
They go,

2164
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,870
Oh this bitch is slip and just a little
bit more than it did the last lap.

2165
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,940
How's that back Eddie?

2166
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,193
Oh,

2167
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,730
I'm gonna go home and fucking,

2168
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:52,600
yeah.

2169
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,950
Midtown is this,

2170
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:54,220
uh,

2171
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,810
would you want to try one of these chairs?

2172
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:56,561
Is this,

2173
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:57,690
what do you think this would be better?

2174
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,770
Is that one allow you to like
lean back a little bit more?

2175
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,813
What's better?

2176
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,400
It's okay for seven hours.

2177
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,910
I'm after you.

2178
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,761
Compromise soon.

2179
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:07,930
Brothers is ridiculous.

2180
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:08,800
Why are we still doing this?

2181
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,610
We've been going since seven 30.

2182
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:13,683
How much time do we do?

2183
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:18,040
This is going to be a five hour pod.

2184
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,020
Which is so ridiculous.

2185
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:21,760
Let's break it up into two pieces.

2186
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,810
I have part one.

2187
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,970
God were so ridiculous.

2188
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:28,180
We should shut the fuck a
couple of guys having fun man.

2189
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:28,510
See,

2190
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,980
look at this guys sliding backwards.

2191
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,010
Tell me that looks like a good time
and this guy is slamming into one.

2192
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,493
He's Asian.

2193
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,800
You don't know that.

2194
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:40,750
You just being rude but are no
Asian Nascar drivers though.

2195
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,733
That's a good point.

2196
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,221
Yeah,

2197
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:45,080
we thought about that shit in
2003 he's guaranteed a ruck.

2198
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,210
Know what I mean?

2199
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,170
That brings in the people.

2200
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:48,340
That's what they want to see bro.

2201
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:49,720
He's 61 years old.

2202
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,563
No,

2203
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,570
no wonder he's fun.

2204
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,400
He's you think Shit
Nass Nascar should like,

2205
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:55,743
they should go for that.

2206
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,673
What's that?

2207
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,990
There's just one there is about you.

2208
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,193
Eddie Bravo.

2209
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,610
You don't even reach Eddie.

2210
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,523
Probably cry.

2211
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,591
I'm sorry.

2212
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:08,051
Asians.

2213
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:08,531
I'm sorry.

2214
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:08,861
Out there.

2215
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:11,740
And we were just joking around because
I'll sketch that we did on the man show

2216
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:12,640
that got rejected.

2217
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,110
It's a long day.

2218
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:17,500
A lot of podcasts and all right folks.

2219
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,580
So I guess that's it.

2220
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,840
We'll wrap this up.

2221
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,430
I hope you guys enjoyed
the fuck out of it.

2222
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:21,881
We did.

2223
00:59:21,881 --> 00:59:22,860
I enjoyed the fuck out of it.

2224
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:23,530
A Bravo.

2225
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,090
You're gangster for getting here.

2226
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,720
Uh,

2227
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,870
