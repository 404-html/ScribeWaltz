I'm talking to you. Listen, we're
back. I know it's been a while folks.

2
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:16,620

been down to one a week over the last uh,

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,340
couple of weeks, but almost out of
the woods with this new TV show.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,310
So shit will get normal any
second now this week today, uh,

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,910
we have Marianna vans hour and a
Darren foster and then tomorrow,

6
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:33,990
Joey Diaz and I think we're going to
get mark Marin in this week as well.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,820
So lots, lots of podcasts. You're
going to get annoyed with me again.

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,700

me and then you'd be like, dude,

9
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,830

html and formulate your own website,

which is ridiculously easy. You can
choose from over 20 excellent designs.

put in to develop something that you

51
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,640
for those of you saw the UFC last
night where we're going to try to start

52
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,290
sponsoring UFC fighters.
Um, but uh, that's uh,

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,710
that's gonna take a little bit of time.

54
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,790
We've got to work out some
of the details for that. Uh,

55
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,410
but I know a lot of you want
me to talk about the UFC.

56
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:33,310
We will talk about that tomorrow.
Joey Diaz is going to be here and uh,

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,900
he came to Vegas with me Friday night,

58
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,780
so he was there for the show
that we had at the joint.

59
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,370
Thanks everybody who came out to that.

60
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,400
And we will talk about
everything tomorrow.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,430
That's probably same time tomorrow on
it.com is a human optimization website.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,330
We sell at [inaudible] Dot com is

00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,160

function. Also have a Melatonin

74
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,490
I'll just like the healthiest shit that

75
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,460
and if you go to [inaudible] dot

76
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:53,350
you will save 10% off any and all
supplements. All right. Freaks.

77
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,740
We got to get rolling here. I know these
commercials are too long sometimes,

78
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,530
so I'm trying to correct that.
Cue The music,

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,370
the Joe Rogan experience,

80
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,010
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,860
So, uh, with me today are, uh,

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,360
Darren foster and Marianna
von Zeller. And, um,

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,320
I first found out about
Marianna from the show, uh,

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,570
on vanguard, the Oxycontin
Express, which, uh,

85
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,440
I remember watching it in my house and
thinking this is the craziest thing I

86
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,430
have ever heard in my life.

87
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,210
I couldn't believe that all the things
you were telling me about the whole

88
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:48,860
system of pain management centers and
how it's set up in Florida, it was true.

89
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,410
And the statistics on how many
people are addicted to Oxycontin,

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,440
how many prescriptions are being given
out for Oxycontin in Florida is just

91
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,450
absolutely bananas.
And I watched an I and I said,

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,480
this is so far beyond out of control
that it's amazing that I'm just hearing

93
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:16,010
about it now from a documentary
on current TV, which is like,

94
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,340
you know,
not the most widely viewed channel.

95
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,760
I mean I felt like this
should be on every channel,

96
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:27,590
on the front page of every newspaper.
There's a hijack and going on down there.

97
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,620
They've hijacked the legal system somehow
or another and absolutely willfully

98
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,160
put these things into position in
order to extract money and do it at the

99
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:40,370
expense of all these people
being addicted. I mean,

100
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,630
how did you find out about this and
how did you go about doing that piece?

101
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,150
It's interesting you say that. I
mean, it was exactly the same for us.

102
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,970
The same surprise that we got when
we started looking into the story,

103
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:55,260
we found a little news clipping on one
newspaper about some deaths in Florida

104
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,670
because of prescription drugs.

105
00:06:56,671 --> 00:07:00,450
And some of them were more pain clinics
around and Mcdonald's. And we thought,

106
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:02,460
wow, this is really interesting.
We should investigate this.

107
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,210
And we started looking into it and
then we found out that there were seven

108
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:09,990
people every day dying from prescription
pill abuse that all over the u s are

109
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:13,710
more people dying from a prescription
pill, overdoses and heroin,

110
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:18,711
cocaine and ecstasy combined that just
last year it's surpassed car accidents to

111
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:22,860
become the number one cause of
accidental deaths in the United States.

112
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,910
So this was the story that we could just
going to turn our heads away from mine.

113
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,950
God, when, when I watched it,

114
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,760
I went to work and I told all
these people about it. I was like,

115
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:37,510
you gotta see this. This is crazy.
And they, they didn't believe me,

116
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,250
like when I was saying I go,
do you know,

117
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:43,060
in Florida you can go to a doctor and
get a prescription and then they don't

118
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:43,781
have a database.

119
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,600
You can go to another doctor across the
street and get a new prescription and

120
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:51,250
just ping pong your way back and forth,
down the highway and they're everywhere.

121
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,950
You know,

122
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,540
the most insane thing was that we spoke
to the local journalist who had sort of

123
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,060
covered this story a little
bit and they told us, look,

124
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,260
you'll go by pain clinics here and you'll
see lines of people and out of state

125
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:05,350
cars parked outside and
literally lines of people,

126
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,100
I mean very long lines around the corner
of people waiting to get into these

127
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,920
pain clinics to get these prescription
drugs. And we thought, okay,

128
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,390
this is the kind of thing
that you hear about.

129
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,970
We'll never be able to film worth
witness ourselves. And then,

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,910
and then it was easy. I mean we,
as soon as we left the airport,

131
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:22,420
went straight to this one street that
we knew had a lot of pain clinics and

132
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,510
there it was, the parking lot's
full of out of state plates.

133
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,430
I mean people driving all
the way from Kentucky,

134
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:32,380
Ohio as far off as Massachusetts down
to Florida to buy their pills and they

135
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,240
pack their car with Pete cars with people,

136
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,460
and then they bring them
back and sell them for five,

137
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:39,760
10 times the price that they buy
them in Florida. So it's a racket.

138
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,840
It's so hard to believe when, when,
when I watched your show, it was,

139
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,650
it was so hard to wrap my head around
the fact that there was one area that was

140
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:53,651
so completely out of control because
where I grew up on the east coast or here

141
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:54,441
in California,

142
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:58,860
I've never seen anything like that and
I never had any inkling that this was

143
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:03,600
something that had to be dealt with
somewhere. So watching that was a, wow,

144
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,830
you really freak me out.

145
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,770
It was when we tried to film
one of the lines when you,

146
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:12,400
there was this one pain clinic that had
that, a lot of people like going to,

147
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:15,880
because it was super easy to get drugs
basically you just go in and out and get

148
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:16,714
whatever you wanted.

149
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,230
And we started filming outside and we
set our tripod and we were across the

150
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:24,830
street on the other side of this. Um, sort
of, it wasn't a freeway was sort of a,

151
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,360
a big street. And uh, as soon
as we started filming these,

152
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,750
these guys come out and they start
chasing us and they asked us what we were

153
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:35,890
doing and we said, you know, we were just
filming out here. Big Guys, big guys,

154
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:38,860
I mean big, big guys. Um, and um,

155
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,310
they started chasing us and we ran out
of gas cause every time he's tried to

156
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:45,370
stop and get gas in our car,
we were running low.

157
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,680
They would get out of the car and it was
just me, Darren and our other producers,

158
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:53,530
Teresa and I was freaked out the night
before I'd been watching the sopranos and

159
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,340
I really felt like I was apart of the
soprano's. I felt, Oh my God, we've been,

160
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,550
we traveled all around the
world and warzones and we're
going to be killed right

161
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,530
here in Florida,
in Fort Lauderdale,

162
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,840
Florida because we were
filming a pain clinic. It was,

163
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,110
but those guys, those guys were
actually later indicted. They were, um,

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,730
busted by the DA and
they were late indicted,

165
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,100
but in the indictment that found that
the head made like $40 million in two

166
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:16,050
years off these pain clinics and they're,

167
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,020
they're in jail for like 17 years now
because I think one of them was even, um,

168
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,510
convicted of like hiring someone to,
to, uh, kill to take out somebody else.

169
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Yeah. Gun for hire. I mean,
these were dangerous people.

170
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,270
These were not people that you

171
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,190
yes or no. Not good people always
getting in behind the, these Iraqi.

172
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,200
So when you ran out of
gas, what happened? Yeah.

173
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
Until we ran out of gas
and I had just entered,

174
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,080
we just interviewed some line
forcement there and we had,

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,990
he was calling nine one one I was
calling the contact that we had for law

176
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,180
enforcement there and
saying please help us.

177
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,730
We don't know what to do and
it means I'm the nine one one.

178
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,020
I mean that we were about five

179
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,710
minutes later we were on a nine to five.

180
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,490
And so like highway patrol just saw that
we were pulled over anyway and they,

181
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,413
they came and then,

182
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,900
but we stopped and then the other guy
stopped behind us and they didn't come out

183
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,630
of the car cause I think they realized
that we were calling nine one one but

184
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,090
they just, they just stayed there
and it was just to intimidate us.

185
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,930
So they stay there and then they'd made
the story up to the police that uh,

186
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,150
we had been stalking,
stalking them,

187
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,130
that they had an ex girlfriend
that was talking them.

188
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:13,890
So they thought that we were stock,
they ex girlfriend or something.

189
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,220
But it's pretty warm too, bro.
She's filming cause she wants,

190
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,080
I mean you do have stalker
tendencies coming from my husband.

191
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,290
Wow. So, um, the non database thing,

192
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,360
that has to be a criminal thing.

193
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,660
I mean there's no way that
I could in this day and age,

194
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,550
there's no way that could be by accident.
Right?

195
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,930
Yeah. You know, they, they did pass a, um,

196
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,160
a drug control plan.

197
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,720
There they are now that is in place.
What does that mean?

198
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,820
It means that now doctors,
they have a database and plan but in,

199
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,440
in place basically that they are
supposed to check to see if a customer is

200
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:57,670
coming or a client is coming to get
more drugs so that you can't go what's

201
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,260
called doctor shopping from pain clinic,

202
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,890
pain clinic or pharmacy to
pharmacy to get all these meds. Um,

203
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,450
however it's not mandatory,

204
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,770
but I mean it's far better right now in
Florida than it was back when we went.

205
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,800
And what's happening with them?
Mandatory.

206
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,740
Yeah. I mean it all has to do
like these privacy laws, you know,

207
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:18,240
like they don't want your medical records
to be accessible to the government

208
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,880
basically. Right. And so, you
know, people that are very,

209
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,940
I guess worried about our
privacy, um, which, you know,

210
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,950
maybe we think about differently now
with the whole NSA scandal. Little.

211
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,200
I mean like, you know, people
are definitely, um, that's,

212
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,140
that's the resistance to,

213
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,940
to do in the prescription monitoring
programs and a lot of places.

214
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:37,200
But most states have them these days.

215
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,910
Florida was one of the biggest states
that didn't have one for a long time. Um,

216
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,470
but now with the,
obviously you know,

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,080
so many people dying of this and there's
the sort of bad reputation in the state

218
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,430
was getting, um, they
decided to do something

219
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,450
press down a little bit,
but it's still happening.

220
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:52,880
And two years after we did
that Oxycontin Express,

221
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:57,230
we actually were filming a story about
heroin abuse in Massachusetts and how,

222
00:12:57,231 --> 00:13:00,520
because of the oxycontin
epidemic, a lot of kids, um,

223
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,160
then went on to do heroin for whatever
reason because oxy was getting more

224
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,830
expensive or it was harder
to get their hands on oxy.

225
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:09,990
So then they started shooting up heroin
because the effects are sort of the same

226
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,620
on, on the, on the body. Except, you know,

227
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:17,270
it's a street drugs in many ways
it's extremely dangerous as well. Um,

228
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,420
and so we actually went to a guy's house
who was selling heroin and he said,

229
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,720
dude, I'm selling hearing, but what I
really like to sell his spills and we,

230
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,471
we go down,

231
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:30,350
me and my friends all go down to Florida
and get a bunch of these and we make

232
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,184
much more money.

233
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,570
Our profit margin is much higher by
selling pills and it is selling heroin.

234
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,660
So we much prefer to that. Wow. Yeah,

235
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,080
that's hilarious. It's
pretty 2013. It's uh,

236
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,250
it's really shocking to me that that
hasn't been addressed and that you're not

237
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:51,530
seeing people talk about
that in the mainstream media.

238
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,920
Like the president never get fields
questions on the prescription pill problem

239
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:59,990
this country. And why is this
happening and have you investigated?

240
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:03,380
What factors are involved here or
they're dirty doctors. Are there,

241
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,410
are they in cahoots with the
pharmacy companies? Like, what,

242
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,730
how is it possible that there's,

243
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,390
they did a thing on Montana
recently in the Montana,

244
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:14,060
the billings daily gazette or something
that one of the billings daily

245
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,990
newspapers where they said
that out of 1 million people,

246
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:22,991
it Montana 240,000 new
prescriptions had been written.

247
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,183
Well,

248
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,770
I mean it's one of the things
that definitely drew us to that,

249
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,650
to see that story and to, to follow up
stories that we've done subsequently is,

250
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,550
is the fact that,
you know,

251
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:38,610
like we spend billions of dollars
every year fighting a war on drugs,

252
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,250
just trying to prevent drugs
coming into this country.

253
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:44,970
But meanwhile it's the drugs that
are being made in this country, um,

254
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,950
that are causing the biggest,
you know,

255
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,680
problems in terms of lives
lost and stuff like that. Yeah.

256
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,680
The war on drugs is playing cowboys
and Indians and pretending you're doing

257
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:55,790
genocide.
I mean,

258
00:14:55,791 --> 00:15:00,680
is the worst job ever of controlling
drugs that anybody's ever done ever.

259
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,780
When you stop and think about how much
resources to results, it's so damn stupid.

260
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,670
It's like all you're doing
is arrest in pot dealers.

261
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:11,150
Why don't you just call it the war on
people probably won't shoot you and you

262
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,390
can make arrests. You
make them count. You know,

263
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,260
how many people were they arresting
that are involved in these pill clinics?

264
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,410
How many people they're investing that
are in involved in the pharmaceutical

265
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:25,760
companies. So obviously bribing
local lawmakers to make these laws.

266
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:26,990
I mean that's,

267
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,840
that is one of the creepiest state
laws I've ever heard in my life.

268
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,450
But it's not surprising that
it's coming from Florida.

269
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,930
Like if you wanted to have a crazy place
where you would think that that would

270
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:40,400
go, you go. Yeah. Yeah. I always say
the Florida is like the South Mexico,

271
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,950
you know, like we always look at
Mexico like, oh those God Mexico,

272
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,020
he think about all the crime that goes
on there and all the craziness and the

273
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:52,340
shenanigans we always look at like
Florida is like the south is that part of

274
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,950
this country and the Florida
is like that to the south.

275
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,080
Like they'll like Jesus Christ Florida.
Yeah.

276
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,110
Whenever it was stuck for a story where
he's like, what's going on in Florida?

277
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,760
If it wasn't for Florida, Nancy Grace, it
have nothing to talk about. It's a crazy,

278
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,650
crazy place right.
Now,

279
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,100
when you guys aired this and you,
you put this with,

280
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,180
was there any resistance? Did people
give you a hard time about this?

281
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,060
No, actually it's been an
incredible in the past,

282
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,910
I mean this air to three years
ago already and I still get, um,

283
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,890
weekly I get emails or Facebook messages
or people reaching out because they've

284
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,800
been somewhat, they've watched this and
somehow they've been affected by drugs,

285
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,590
by prescription drugs. You
know, their son has died,

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,180
their husband is addicted and they
reach out. Um, because this, this,

287
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:39,200
this documentary has made an impact on
them and they, um, and they want to,

288
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,750
to let us know, which is fantastic.
You know, as a, as a journalist,

289
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,450
that's the best kind of gift you can get.

290
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah. That's beautiful. Now you guys
did an amazing job. Like I said,

291
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,720
you completely enlightened
me on the subject.

292
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:54,700
I had literally no idea before I saw
your show that this was even an issue.

293
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,030
I had thought about, you know, people
need pills, like they get hurt.

294
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,990
And then I remember reading the
rush limbo thing and I'd be like,

295
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,510
that crazy bastard. Like,
what the fuck is he doing?

296
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,990
He's taking like 99 a day or
something nutty. Like that wasn't a,

297
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,970
do you know that number?

298
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,970
I don't know the number, but
I know some people, you know,

299
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,780
that we've interviewed have, you
know, gotten quite tolerant to the,

300
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,480
to the pills and they could take a
huge number, like a surprisingly,

301
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,140
a huge number.

302
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,210
He was going with his housekeeper.

303
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,570
He was having his housekeeper go
around and collect them for him.

304
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,770
And then apparently that's how he
got popped. The whole thing was just,

305
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,200
I was like, well, this
just this crazy fat guy.

306
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:35,200
Of course he's got a skeleton or two
in his closet. That guy's an asshole,

307
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,430
you know, like he's so judgmental and
evil and the way he goes after, you know,

308
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,310
all these, uh, the, the liberals and
the Democrats, I was like, of course,

309
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,290
that guy's fucking crazy.
Of course he's on pills.

310
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,460
Then when you hear that he did
so much that he lost his hearing?

311
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,390
Like somebody had to describe
it to me in medical terms.

312
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,540
He did so much oxycontin
that he blew out his hearing.

313
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,040
Wow. I mean, I don't know if you remember,
but the tod, the main guy in our, in our,

314
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,030
in our documentary, the oxy
got an express. He was this
kid, he was 28 at the time,

315
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:07,920
but he started doing oxies 10 years
before he lost his brother to Oxycontin.

316
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,390
He lost his wife to bills
and you could see, I mean,

317
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,320
and recently he died last year
as well, um, from drug overdose.

318
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,160
And you know, you could tell just
by talking to him, to him that he,

319
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:23,880
his mind was just not there and his, his
mom was constantly telling us like she,

320
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,530
he couldn't remember things.
He,

321
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,270
he was totally fried and it
was all because of pills,

322
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,530
the amount of pills he was doing
and he was taking an insane amount.

323
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:34,170
I remember him telling us,
what was it like,

324
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,290
you remember the teen 80
milligrams or that would just,

325
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,230
I don't remember lead you consulted a
doctor afterwards and told him how much

326
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,990
this guy was taking and he couldn't
believe it. He said that, you know,

327
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,870
obviously if any of us decided
to take that amount today,

328
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,900
we would die in a second because
we just don't have that tolerance.

329
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,920
Yeah. I have, uh, one of my, well I had
one of my best friends died from it, um,

330
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,800
that and actual heroin and uh, you know,
a bunch of other things and he was doing,

331
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,973
but it was just,

332
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:05,230
I've seen people caught in the grips of
physical addiction and it's a terrifying,

333
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:10,030
terrifying thing. I've never
experienced it myself. Um,
I, the only thing that I've,

334
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,450
that I've ever taken that's really
addictive as coffee and, um,

335
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,730
I guess alcohol to certain people, but
although it's never been to me, um,

336
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,270
but I've always been terrified of
the actual addictive properties.

337
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:23,740
It's something becoming
a part of your system,

338
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:27,900
not an impulsive addiction like gambling,
which I'm scared of that stuff too. Um,

339
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,450
cause I'm a very impulsive
person, but the, the,

340
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,120
the terrifying notion of
seeing it get into your bones,

341
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,280
which is what these pills do and it's,
it's so just evil.

342
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,670
Like it's almost like
vampires in a pill form.

343
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,940
It just slowly sucks your life away
and absolutely forces you to take it.

344
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,560
You know,
I'm from Europe,

345
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,980
from Portugal and in Europe it's only
prescribed to critically ill cancer

346
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,360
patients.
So it's,

347
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,900
it was so surprising to me to see
how easily they're prescribed here.

348
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,690
Yeah. That's because well it's because
of money. I mean it has to be. I got um,

349
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,650
my nose fixed.

350
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,240
I had a deviated septum and my doctor
gave me a prescription afterwards over of

351
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,150
two different types of
painkillers and I told them I go,

352
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:13,550
it doesn't even hurt because it,
it really didn't hurt.

353
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,510
Like everybody had told me, it was
like incredibly painful and all my God,

354
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:19,940
you're barely going to be able to deal.
Then I got out of there, I was like,

355
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:22,240
this is it. I was like, I
feel like I have a stuff nose.

356
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,090
Like it doesn't hurt at all.

357
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,820
And it was because my nose has been
packed with these things, but he was like,

358
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,800
you need pain pills. And
I'm like, listen man,

359
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,830
I just got done telling you that I'm
not even in pain. What did he give you?

360
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,460
He gave me vicodins and
I think it was percocets.

361
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,970
I didn't take it though, but I
just threw the prescriptions. Why?

362
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,300
I'm scared of that shit. Um,
I have a buddy who had a, um,

363
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,130
a problem with drugs and then he had
back surgery and then after he had back

364
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:49,540
surgery, they put them on pills, you know,
to give him one. And they're like, look,

365
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,740
you need prescription medication.

366
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:53,800
They didn't even take into consideration
the fact that he used to be a junkie

367
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,360
and so immediately as problem again, you
know, it was all shady and weird now.

368
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,140
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the unfortunate,

369
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,240
it's the way it starts with so many
people is it that they're an injury.

370
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,570
And that's why you see like
in a lot of places where the,

371
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,790
where the problem is is that it's
around places that have like a lot of

372
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,600
workplace injuries like evaled Aisha
where people worked at the mines and stuff

373
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:15,260
like that or get like closer to that.
Sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

374
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,290
So I mean that's a lot of times
where we see these clusters of,

375
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,780
of people who have, uh,
uh, become addicted.

376
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah. And it's, so, unfortunately, it's
like that is where, you know, you're,

377
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,710
you're finding these lower income people,

378
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,250
middle class people who worked
factory jobs and have to move things,

379
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,990
manual labor type jobs.
And it just seems like they have no hope.

380
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,580
Like once they get caught up in that,

381
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,930
it's so hard to get out from under the
grip of that monster and they don't have,

382
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,380
they can't afford to take a month off
and go to Malibu to some clinic where

383
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:46,050
they're going to feed them green
tea and rub their feet. You know,

384
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,150
like people are, they get, they're doomed.

385
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:53,151
Like you can get stock and the amount of
willpower required to pull yourself out

386
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:56,130
of that mud is insane.

387
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,031
It is.
I mean,

388
00:21:57,031 --> 00:22:02,031
we spoke to so many people who
were getting better and they,

389
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,950
we really, I mean they really, they
had this conviction that they were,

390
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,900
this was it.
They were talking to us as,

391
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,600
as x drug addicts and they were
never going to take pills again.

392
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:13,620
And I would say that 99% of
those went back to drugs.

393
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,630
Did you know this is a statistic that
somebody put on my message board? Um,

394
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,730
a dude named evil homer. Thanks
Eva Homer, that last year,

395
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:25,731
five pharmaceutical companies were agreed
to pay 5.5 billion to resolve the US

396
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,000
Department of Justice
allegations of fraudulent,
fraudulent marketing practices,

397
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:33,180
including the promotion of medications
for uses that there were not approved by

398
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:37,140
the food and Drug
Administration. Insane. I mean,

399
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:39,480
if you go back and look at the
numbers that they've been paying,

400
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:43,410
like Pfizer in 2009 was fine.
2.3 billion.

401
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:48,030
And this is so many of them.
There's Glaxo Smith Kline,

402
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,100
3 billion and it's not, the pharmaceutical
drugs haven't done great things.

403
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,360
There's amazing applications
for pharmaceutical drugs
that have changed people's

404
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:01,730
lives for the better. Yeah. It's
just so unfortunate that it's a, uh,

405
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,210
it's the bottom line over morality,
over humanity.

406
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,710
The bottom line being ones and zero's
collect as many as you can above humanity

407
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,750
and it's,
it's not necessary.

408
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,230
It's like there's plenty of
valid applications for drugs,

409
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:21,000
but if you want to control the entire
world and you want to be like the king of

410
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,820
the planet and have all the,
all the gold,

411
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,410
like the best way to do it is to be like
fuck people. Just treat them as little,

412
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:28,681
you know,

413
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:33,150
vampires sucklings and take as much blood
as he can while keeping them alive for

414
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:37,080
as long as he can until they eventually
run out of money or blood and then move

415
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:37,914
on to the next one.

416
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,530
We spoke to a doctor,

417
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,240
he was a rehab doctor and he told
us something really interesting.

418
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:46,490
I think it wasn't the end of the nineties
that the medical got together and they

419
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,710
decided that the best thing to do,

420
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:53,711
to treat pain was to really go at it
aggressively and have the lowest possible

421
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,750
tolerance to pain. So if, uh,

422
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,590
if there was any chance that the patient
would feel any sort of feign just

423
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,400
treated aggressively by giving them a lot
of drugs and he says there was a total

424
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:09,170
shift, uh, in the end of the,
uh, the nine, the 90s, wasn't
it Darren? End of the 19th,

425
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:14,130
I believe it was. And um, and that's
when pain pills started being dispensed.

426
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,690
It dispense much more liberally. And I
think at the time they didn't really,

427
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,880
really realize what this, you know, the,

428
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,280
the addictive side of this
and what this could do.

429
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,870
How is it possible though? How's it
possible that they could have not known?

430
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,920
I don't buy that. Like everyone's
known that from the time I was a kid,

431
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,730
I knew that people had
problems with quail.

432
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:34,430
Ludes you would hear
about that all the time.

433
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,700
I didn't even know what a quail lewd was,
you know,

434
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,830
but I remember people always on Ludes,
the guy's got a problem with ludes.

435
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,470
So of course they knew
they're full of shit.

436
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,440
They must've bowed down to pressure
from the pharmaceutical companies.

437
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,750
There must, must've been someone
to cut a deal and said, listen,

438
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,170
if you guys just prescribed a little more,

439
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,710
do you know how much money
were you going on Mac?

440
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,560
And we'll give you a little bit of
this, a little bit of that. People say,

441
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:56,990
well that doesn't happen. Well, here's
one thing that definitely does happen.

442
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:00,320
My wife, uh, her mom is a nurse and, um,

443
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,730
her mom was working at this clinic and
she would tell us about the drug reps and

444
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,950
all the things that drug reps
would do for the company.

445
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,790
They take the whole company out to
dinner to a really nice restaurant. Like,

446
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,220
you know,
nurses are on very reasonable salaries.

447
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,100
Like they can't afford like a really
expensive restaurant or really a fine

448
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:18,860
restaurant. They'll take everybody
out by them, all the drinks,

449
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:21,560
order anything on the menu,
lobster and steak and this and that.

450
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,210
And they did it on a regular basis.

451
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:27,500
They gave them trips and all sorts of
other things and they made it everybody

452
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:32,000
like really eager to prescribe these
drugs, get to keep the drug reps around,

453
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:35,960
keep, keep the vacation's coming in, you
know, keep the lobster dinners coming.

454
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,690
It's amazing. Right. It's amazing.

455
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,530
And it's amazing that it takes
someone like you guys to,

456
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,960
to expose this like where's CNN,

457
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,080
where are these so called investigative
journalists that are supposed to be

458
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:51,280
looking out for us, you know, where are
the people that uncovered Watergate where,

459
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:53,690
where are the people that were
really looking out for America? Like,

460
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,930
what the fuck happened? What happened
to journalism in this country?

461
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,850
Well, I mean like for us, I
mean, you know, it's great.

462
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,820
Local reporting is what drew
us to the story. So, um,

463
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,120
they're all great reports but for some
reason, yeah. Some local guys, yes,

464
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,800
we have on the scene people on the
scene and like that's, you know,

465
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,490
we got the lead to this story and so,
um, yeah, why it doesn't get better.

466
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,500
National attention is a definitely a
question that I said we should all be

467
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,970
asking. Yes. Well it's
like w you know, you,

468
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,620
when you hear that the
CIA gives gigantic news,

469
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:27,120
corporations like Fox and CNBC gives
them talking points and that they follow

470
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:32,070
these talking points and then you hear
that these stories are going on and no

471
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:35,430
one's reporting it. Meanwhile,
they'll pay attention to, you know,

472
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,420
Kim Kardashians baby will be like the,
the lead on CNN,

473
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:41,720
Kim Guard ash hand.
Remember bird just harder.

474
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
And did they make it seem like that as
Florida is the fucking apocalypse parts

475
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,330
of Florida that like if,

476
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,450
if it was just a Zombie factory
and then people went in and turned,

477
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:57,210
came out as zombies, you'd be like,
oh well we have to stop this. They,

478
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,270
they're becoming zombies.
But did they are fucking becoming zombies.

479
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,320
They're becoming functional zombies.
Yeah.

480
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,430
Who can sort of walk around and live
amongst you as long as they keep getting

481
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,360
their Zombie medicine.

482
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,530
Yeah. We had that great sheriff in
our, in our doc say that, um, you know,

483
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:13,410
talk about these doctors
and how they were, uh,

484
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:16,770
what was it that he said there were
drug dealers, drug dealers with degrees,

485
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,530
which is such a great way of
fitting in. And they are, I mean,

486
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,340
they know what they're doing.
Right.

487
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,120
You, you, the other thing that you
exposed when you show these pains, Matt,

488
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,000
pain management centers
is that some of them,

489
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:29,970
they're actually connected to pharmacies.
Yeah. It is for, for folks would be,

490
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,560
first of all folks, if you haven't
seen the documentary, you must.

491
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,420
And where can they watch?
It isn't an online line where they get it.

492
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,530
You can actually go to [inaudible] dot TV,

493
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,550
which is mk.tv and you
seeK and u c k. Dot. TV.

494
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,950
It's our production company
and we have all our work there.

495
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:45,830
And the oxycontin
express is feature there.

496
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,780
Beautiful. It's a Mussy. It's
so enlightening. But the,

497
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,740
the pain management centers, you'd go
there and you say, hey man, my back hurts.

498
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,671
And they go,

499
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:59,050
well you definitely need some oxycontin
and just go three feet down the hall and

500
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:01,600
open up that next door.
And that's the prescription place.

501
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,290
And you go in there and the pharmacy
hooks you up and it's like one stop

502
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:09,670
shopping for drugs and it's
legal cash only cash, only cash,

503
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:14,260
only insurance, not that accepted cash
only. And so that's what happened to us.

504
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:14,730
We went,

505
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,190
we went undercover,
we put it,

506
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,410
you've got an undercover camera and went
into one of these and it was I think

507
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:21,120
the first pain clinic we went into.

508
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:24,720
And I just asked the receptionist so
I have a back pain, what can I get?

509
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:27,780
And she said, oh well they'll be
able to prescribe you oxycontin.

510
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:29,170
And she listed the,

511
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:33,630
the long list of drugs and you
just need to go get an Mri.

512
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:37,710
And basically what this is is that an MRI
can show anything and you can point to

513
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,990
something and say that
that's what's hurting you.

514
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,470
And did the doctors just need to see
something that they can then say, look,

515
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,410
I looked at the MRI and it
looked like she had that.

516
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,900
It was legitimate back pain
and that's all they need.

517
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,300
And so we went out the door to get this,

518
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,780
to get this MRI and we stopped and start
talking to these guys that had come to

519
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:57,450
get down from West Virginia and Kentucky
and they were telling us, you know,

520
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,440
we traveled down there here cause it's
just so easy to get these drugs and we

521
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,930
just say we have a back pain.
But of course we don't have anything.

522
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:07,110
We just want to take a lot.
A lot of these rugs back home with us when

523
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,540
people are listening to this and saying,

524
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:14,541
well how easy ready for this doctors
in Florida prescribed 10 times more

525
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:21,450
oxycodone pills than every
other state in the country.

526
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,890
Column bind.
Yeah,

527
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,980
red flags all around.
But if you smoked pot in Florida,

528
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:32,460
they'll put you in a cage son.
They would lock you up in a box,

529
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,270
throw away the key. What are your
damn hippie trail? Ruin your life.

530
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,170
You've got problems.
Go to the pain management clinic,

531
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,370
get a nice American cocktail of opiates.

532
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,590
The, have you guys ever seen the
documentary, the documentary,

533
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:53,490
the wild and wonderful
whites of West Virginia? Yes.

534
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,730
Beautiful and sad at the same
time and hilarious. Look,

535
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,420
if you can't do anything about it and you
just accept that going in, you have to,

536
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:02,680
you can't look at it and say,

537
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,620
Oh that poor child growing up
cause then you'll get all sad.

538
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,600
But if you can treat it as a comedy and
pretend to not real and treat it as like

539
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,460
if you're watching a Coen brothers movie,

540
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,110
a big part of that documentary is pills.
Yeah.

541
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,800
Huge part of what those people are.

542
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,010
And that culture of wild hillbilly white
trash crazy people is about is about

543
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,830
pill addiction. Yeah. We
spoke to some people in jail,

544
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:30,160
some women in jail that were in jail
because of pill trafficking from Florida

545
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,750
and they called themselves pill
billies. Yes. What a great name.

546
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,010
Hilda Hillbilly. Hillary and
heroin. Yeah. Appalachian. Yeah.

547
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,200
It's uh,
it's really confusing and it to,

548
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:49,090
to have it all exposed and one piece
like yours and just all of a sudden be

549
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:51,250
like, why? It's like that's out there.

550
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,000
It's was a real paradigm
shifting moment for me.

551
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:59,860
And it was the thing that really got me
paying attention to pills in general.

552
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,680
And then I started reading all
these other bizarre stories like,

553
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,930
I dunno if you've ever heard about
the man, um, who, uh, was awarded, uh,

554
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,740
the equivalent of 600,000
American dollars because a,

555
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:16,741
he was on a Parkinson's drug called a
Requip and this was by a Glaxo Smith

556
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:17,951
Kline.

557
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:22,951
They had this Parkinson's drug and it
turns him into a gambling and gay sex

558
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:28,621
addict who was a straight man and he took
this pill and it was Parkinson's drug.

559
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:32,080
So apparently it has some
psychoactive properties.

560
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,150
So that's something to
the way the mind works.

561
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,410
And all he wanted to do was
have gay sacks and gamble. Yeah.

562
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,140
Brilliant.
But I mean he got 600,000,

563
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,810
so it's not like just an accusation,

564
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,040
it's an accusation backed up by
at least some science. I mean,

565
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,040
I don't know what they use to show
that there's some sort of a chemical

566
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,340
correlation between his
activities and this drug,

567
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,460
but they pulled the drug off the market.
The drug doesn't exist anymore.

568
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,620
And so he got his $600,000
in gambling.

569
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,890
He got off the Parkinson's medication and
it became a straight man again without

570
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:13,330
a gambling problem. But with $600,000
in his pocket and a lot of bad memories.

571
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,600
A lot of horrible,
horrible gay sex gambling memories.

572
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,110
Yeah, it is weird. But it's just
how did, I mean they, there's,

573
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,500
there's so many drugs like
those late night things,

574
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,620
you know those commercials you
see for those shady legal guys,

575
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,130
two o'clock in the morning like did you
take phen phen in the eighties you know,

576
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,400
call this number and we will get
you the money that you deserve.

577
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,470
It's just shocking.

578
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:42,710
How easy is for these things to get
prescribed or for these things to get

579
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,200
approved. Like how much testing
is involved, do you, do I,

580
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,390
did you guys ever find out as far as like
how much testing is involved in making

581
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:50,940
something?

582
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,700
So the interesting thing is that when
all these pain pills start at being

583
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:55,470
produced,
such as Oxycontin,

584
00:32:55,471 --> 00:33:00,210
they were really easy to manipulate
so that you can use them.

585
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,460
They have this time release.
Um, um, so that when you, you,

586
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,360
when you take a pill, they will
have an effect on your body,

587
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:10,270
but over time,

588
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,760
and that was really easy to manipulate
so that you would take it and it would

589
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,070
immediately have all the effect at once,
which was,

590
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,600
which is what an addict
ultimately wants. Um, so then, uh,

591
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
they were heavily criticized for that.

592
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:24,990
So then they came up
with a pill that was it.

593
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:29,420
So easy to manipulate and um, but
then, you know, that was easy. They,

594
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,480
they found a way around that to, addicts
found a way around that too. And we, we,

595
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,810
you just go online and you search how to
manipulate. Then you walk sees and it's,

596
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,180
you put them,
there were ways,

597
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,170
I remember addicts telling us that you
just put them in a microwave and do all

598
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,220
this certain kinds of things.

599
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,950
And I'm not going to say here because
I'm not trying to get people to do it,

600
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:49,380
but that, that there are ways
to manipulate every line.

601
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,910
So even when they try to
play it safe, um, you know,

602
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,470
there's always a way
around it for an addict,

603
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,310
why are they smoking them?

604
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,230
Yeah, just, I mean it's the quickest way
to get it into your body to adjust it.

605
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,820
You get it all at once,
you know,

606
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,000
it just same as snorting and
crushing and snorting end.

607
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:08,080
Did you just get it all at once?
Like Marianne was saying,

608
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,610
it was initially made as a time release
formula so that it would sort of fall

609
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:16,480
out over eight hours, 12 hours, something
like that. But if you crush it and just,

610
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,840
nor did you get all the active ingredient
once all the oxycodone at Watson.

611
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,880
Thank you Darren. You were much better
at explaining that is having a hard time,

612
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:27,130
but as soon as what people
like freebase cocaine, right,

613
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,590
or small crack and stuff
like that. It just, yeah,

614
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,870
it's um, it's, it's really kind of a
brave new world type thing, isn't it?

615
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,820
It really is sort of a, a horrific version
of the future thing. These numbers,

616
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,170
like especially the,

617
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,980
the Florida number of 10 times the number
of prescriptions for oxycodone on the

618
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:49,980
nene tire country combined. I thought
before I read it like I saw, I bet.

619
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,350
I Bet Florida is certainly number one,

620
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,260
but probably only about like 50%
or something like that. That's,

621
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,800
that was my silly little idea 10 times.
I think there's also a number that the,

622
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,793
the,
uh,

623
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,120
there are a hundred doctors at most
prescribed Oxycontin in America or 99 of

624
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:10,930
them are in Florida or
something like that, which is,
Ooh, Ooh, powerful Florida.

625
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,790
What's that? Yeah. Back. Yeah. Back
then. It's changed somewhat now. Yeah.

626
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,380
But you know,

627
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,380
I'm torn on these things because a part
of me is I'm a huge fan of personal

628
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:25,530
freedom and I'm a huge fan of
civil liberties and I think,

629
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,720
I think if you want to be
an idiot and ruin your life,

630
00:35:27,721 --> 00:35:30,000
you should be able to be an
idiot and ruin your life. And I,

631
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:33,690
there's a lot of things that would
ruin some people's life that I enjoy.

632
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:37,260
Like whiskey. I like whiskey. I
like, like having a couple of shots,

633
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,450
but I'm not a drug addict
and I'm not an alcoholic,

634
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:43,020
so I can have a couple shots of
whiskey and stop and that's it.

635
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,880
I don't need them every
day. And I, you know,

636
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,100
I can do it once a year
if I really wanted to,

637
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,350
but I'm also really keenly aware that
I don't know what I'm talking about

638
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,340
because I've never done an opiate.
Did you guys ever consider

639
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,400
trying it? Yes. No, no, no.
Um, you know, we, we, we,

640
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:05,460
we, we like to immerse
ourselves in stories, but not
that far. Yeah. Yeah. We went,

641
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:09,330
we went to Brazil for example. We did a
story about the Campbell frog. Uh, we did,

642
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,950
we did it would say a drug that does
all this sort of things to your blood

643
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,980
stream and it's supposed to be really
good for you. But, um, it's, it's crazy.

644
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:21,981
It's the skin of a frog that gets dried
and then you punctured a little hole in

645
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:25,280
your body and you put the skin
there, uh, the skin of the frog,

646
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:29,040
of the secretion of the frog. And then
it gives you sort of a burst of energy.

647
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:32,130
You feel your blood coming up and down,
all over your brain.

648
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:34,860
It seems like your brain
is about to explode. Um,

649
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:38,640
and it has a lot of pharmaceutical
promise. This, um, this,

650
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,430
this particular frog Campbell
Campbell for, okay. How actually,

651
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,710
how do you spell that? K. A.
N. B. O. K. And that's it.

652
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,770
And it's beautiful frog.
It is actually a beautiful giant,

653
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:54,510
really green for Alagan. Yeah. So it
creates this chemical, um, and it's,

654
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,373
you know,

655
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,600
sort of slimy that slime they take and
they dry it out and then they, yeah,

656
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:03,810
they do like a crude injection of
like burning you. So it's the, the,

657
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:07,040
the native drives down there that
they use it as sort of like a, uh,

658
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,750
or a cleansing ritual,
but it doesn't,

659
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,120
it's not hallucinogenic or anything
like that. It, it just, um, but what,

660
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:16,940
what attracts like medicine to
it is that it breaks the, the,

661
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,630
the blood brain barrier. So it's
like, I dunno what that exactly means,

662
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,160
but it's very attractive to science,

663
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:24,750
but they haven't figured out
how they're going to use it yet.

664
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,420
I think it's going to be good for heart
disease to treat heart disease. Wow. Yeah.

665
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,800
And so that was, uh, we, we definitely
immersed ourselves. It's not a tough one.

666
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,963
I don't think

667
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,900
it's another sign of how
crazy human beings are.

668
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,690
This one spot in the world like Brazil,

669
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:43,691
the rain forest where there's so much
promise as far as like new healing,

670
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,520
new plants that can do
all sorts of great things.

671
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:49,490
And what are they doing
to just sharpen it down?

672
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,790
Just hacking it down at a record pace.

673
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,700
It's insane. We've done several stories
about that and it's just insane.

674
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,260
It's so sad.
Every time we go back,

675
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,880
so many different wonder cures have
been found in, in the rain forest.

676
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,670
Like they're always looking for the
rain forest to come up with a new new

677
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:08,460
medications for all sorts of things.
And you know,

678
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,440
there's the good side of the
pharmaceutical companies,

679
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:13,770
the fact that pharmaceutical companies
are creating things that are helping keep

680
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:16,890
your grandpa around for longer and
you know, and keep people healthy.

681
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,420
It's such a double edged sword.
And like I said, for me it's,

682
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,310
I'm so torn because I would,

683
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,990
I don't think that I would want to be
in a neighborhood where they're selling

684
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:28,620
heroin,

685
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,130
but I don't think that anybody should
be able to tell anybody else they can't

686
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:32,964
buy heroin.

687
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,540
But then you get into that area of the
addictive properties of it and that's

688
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,820
where it gets sketchy. That's
where it gets like, well,

689
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:44,800
if you're going to do anything
as a community to try to
stop something like that,

690
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,690
boy, there's, there's not a lot of ways
you can convince people to not do things.

691
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,470
It's very difficult and it gets real
weird when you're trying to convince

692
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:58,471
someone to not do something that has a
really good chance of ruining your life.

693
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,540
Absolutely.

694
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,890
And I know you talk a lot about drugs and
I don't know if you've looked into the

695
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:05,290
portrait piece experience.
I'm from Portugal and Portugal,

696
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,070
basically one of the biggest experiments
in drug policy in the world and it

697
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,070
Meson for 10 years and it's
actually quite a success rate.

698
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,040
And what they did is they did
to claimant decriminalize drugs,

699
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,100
they didn't legalize them,
they decriminalized them.

700
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,280
Meaning that if you're caught where
they think it's one gram of heroin or

701
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,260
cocaine,
100 gram of heroin,

702
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:27,640
two grams of cocaine or 25 grams
of marijuana, if it's anything,

703
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:32,020
if it's that or less, you don't go to
jail as you as you do in other countries.

704
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,920
And what they do is they send you to a
drug Rehab Commission and to a group of

705
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:37,930
doctors that know what
they're talking about,

706
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,720
that want to find out if this is the
first time you're trying drugs and why are

707
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:41,410
you doing them.

708
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,280
And they try to address the problem
as a disease and not as a crime.

709
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,500
And it's had actually great success
rate and a much less people are going to

710
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,480
rehab centers,
much less people are dying.

711
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:56,890
So it's definitely being looked at as um,
as a way to go in terms of drug policy.

712
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,430
Well, that's a beautiful idea
also in terms of human nature,

713
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,290
because it's human nature to not want
to be controlled. There's, there's many,

714
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,970
many examples and if you have children,

715
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,180
you know that if you know one of the
best ways to get a kid to want to do

716
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,700
something, just tell them
they can't do it. It's a,

717
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:15,730
it's a natural human tendency to try to
resist and when you tell them they can

718
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:18,810
do whatever they want and the old you'll
be there to help them like you're,

719
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,470
you're honestly better off.

720
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,640
And we would like to think that the
established laws that we have in this

721
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:27,220
country are set up to protect people,
but they're clearly not.

722
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,340
When you're dealing with these numbers,
especially outside of Florida,

723
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,860
like I told you about billings,
Montana newspaper,

724
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:37,180
talking about 240,000 different
prescriptions for that stuff in,

725
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:40,950
in Montana alone, it's obviously
not the case. This is not,

726
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,900
it's not that anybody is
trying to look out for anybody.

727
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,200
It's just simply a matter of a
crazy system where it's become this,

728
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,650
there's this weird sort of method that
you can do to skirt logical thinking and

729
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:01,670
extract money from,
from humans and,

730
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,750
and you can do it in
this is a really immoral,

731
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:09,751
horrible way by getting them addicted to
these things and the fact that doctors

732
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:14,050
are in on it. That's what the, that's
the weirdest aspect of it, that,

733
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:19,170
that these people who
supposedly had dedicated their
lives to helping people and

734
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:21,820
that's what their whole
career was supposed to be,

735
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,590
improving the health of people,

736
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,660
keeping people alive and then somewhere
along the line in the whole storm of

737
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:30,870
student loans and,
and,

738
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,230
and getting sued for malpractice
and all this different shit, they,

739
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,840
they somewhere along the line of bunch
of them just crack and they just go,

740
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,130
let's just make some money.
Yeah.

741
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,010
We spoke to some addicts
in a Florida who's doctor?

742
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:46,160
The one that the doctor prescribed
them. The drugs was, and this was a kid,

743
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:50,540
actually a boy, a man, a 25
year old kid was a gynecologist.

744
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,590
So he was going to a gynecologist
to get his meds. Whoa. Well,

745
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:58,940
if anybody would know.
Wow, that's so crazy.

746
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,150
This story is also close to me
because besides my friend who died,

747
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,300
I had another family member that
had nothing wrong with them.

748
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,850
He was a completely normal,
great guy,

749
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,880
and then got injured in a work accident
and became the biggest fuck up I have

750
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,580
ever met in my life.
And it's,

751
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:21,080
it's hard for me to even imagine that
this is the same guy I knew from high

752
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:25,130
school. He was a, at one point
in time as a hard worker.

753
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:27,560
He was a great kid.
He was always friendly.

754
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,520
And then he just became a
complete loser of compulsive liar.

755
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,090
Anything you could do to get
bills. And, uh, so I, I've,

756
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,660
I've seen the first hand affects of
someone who didn't have an issue.

757
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,580
Like he didn't have any physical issues.

758
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,120
He also didn't have any
family history of people,

759
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:49,310
people being addicted to anything. So
it was just a monster got into a system.

760
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,460
I understand what you say that a person
should be able to get whatever they want.

761
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,590
If they're adults and they
can make up their own lines,

762
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,680
but they should also be able to know
what they're getting too many times the

763
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,230
problem, again, the
injuries, a big problems,

764
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,740
big reason why people get
into prescription drugs is
because they're prescribed

765
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:08,741
this by their doctor and there aren't
enough warnings as to how addictive this

766
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,850
stuff can be. And then, you know,

767
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,160
we spoke to one kid who was also a star
athlete in college and he was featured

768
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:21,161
in the second documentary we did about
this issue and he was in the hospital for

769
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,200
five days and he left us the hospital.

770
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,670
He was already addicted to pills and never
left. And I was shooting heroin. Wow.

771
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,110
It's so crazy. So this is
a story. I know a story.

772
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:34,010
So just imagine how many
stories there are out there.

773
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,120
Just people that get injured and get
addicted. And how do we stop this?

774
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,440
Is there a way, is it too far into
the, the, the cultural system?

775
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,760
I mean, is it a part of us now? I don't
think so. I think a lot, not more.

776
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:50,840
It needs to be done and they're fantastic
people out there. A lot of moms,

777
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,310
actually mothers was lost.

778
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:56,630
Kids who are leading the way and trying
to raise awareness and pass legislation.

779
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,910
I definitely think that
more needs to be done.

780
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:03,750
More doctors need to prescribe the US,
uh, know what they're prescribing and uh,

781
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,810
you know, uh, people know,

782
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,540
need to know more about what they're
being prescribed in the addictive

783
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:13,440
addictiveness of it. Wow. It's, um, it's,

784
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,340
to me it's one of the most
disturbing aspects of our culture.

785
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,170
It's one of the most disturbing.

786
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,150
It's second only to war know the idea
that there's this massive corporations

787
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:27,290
that are profiting off of these people
becoming zombies. It's, uh, it's really,

788
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,490
really crazy.

789
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,490
So I want to thank you very much for doing
that document because you guys really,

790
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,250
you knocked it out of the park and
he changed the way I look at it.

791
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,270
So this new show you're doing,
it's called a inside secret America.

792
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,460
It's on Nat Geo. And does
it aired yet? Does it start?

793
00:44:42,461 --> 00:44:45,950
It starts Wednesday night.
This one's day. This was in it

794
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,710
safety and that is the first episode. Oh,
awesome. And what is the show? What's,

795
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:54,550
what are you guys doing on the
first one is drugs from them.

796
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,640
I actually synthetic drugs.

797
00:44:57,641 --> 00:45:02,641
So we look into sort of a bath salts
and spice and k two and all that stuff.

798
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,210
And the show is basically a Darren who's
my producing partner and my husband and

799
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,510
myself. We go around America exploring
an ill infiltrating these uh,

800
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,700
subcultures. Some of the West is most, um,

801
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:20,490
controversial subcultures and everything
from sex trafficking to unregulated and

802
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:24,970
illegal guns to the first episode,
which is about synthetic drugs.

803
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,013
Wow.

804
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,940
Did you guys follow the John Mcafee
case? Yeah, I made a little bit.

805
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,080
I saw the, the vice guys were down there.
Did you follow the drug aspect of it?

806
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:39,610
So I've heard about it, but I'm not like
to uh, up to speed on what was going on.

807
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:43,720
But I heard it was, he was like making
his own like stuff. Right. I have no idea.

808
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,770
Well that's awesome.
And this is the entrance of all fairness.

809
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,060
He says that it was all troll and then
he was just joking about the drug part.

810
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,270
But the reality is he had a laboratory
set up in his backyard in Billy's like a

811
00:45:58,931 --> 00:46:02,920
real legit laboratory.
And inside that laboratory,

812
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,800
I don't know what he was actually doing,

813
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:10,830
but he made a post under a pseudonym
on this drug forum describing his

814
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,300
freebasing of bath salts. And his,
uh, he did some work with, I dunno,

815
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,750
I dunno what the technical aspects of his,
uh,

816
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,900
t is transformation of the bath
salts and the something else.

817
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,230
But he had claimed that it made you this
incredibly hypersexual a person and he

818
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,780
was trying to market it as like, like, uh,

819
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,250
he was trying to come up with a
drug that would turn women into like

820
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,660
Nymphomaniacs essentially doubled
the female Viagra. Yeah. Sort. SORTA,

821
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:45,400
but Viagra doesn't make you a raw.
Yeah, but, but you know what I mean?

822
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:48,820
Like vi Viagara is an aid to
a man achieving an erection.

823
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:51,670
But it doesn't necessarily make
you like a horny person. Right.

824
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,500
Whereas this was a a mental thing like
who change you, make you very, very,

825
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:59,910
very aroused and you know,
he did describes on the Webs,

826
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,270
his post is like,
you know,

827
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,030
clawing your genitals and like freaking
out masturbating all day. And I mean he,

828
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,080
he had these really detailed depictions
of the chemical transformation of these

829
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:15,580
drugs and clearly had
this massive laboratory,

830
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,900
well not massive but like really high
end high tech laboratory set up and his

831
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,430
crazy fucking jungle house. And this
guy was cooking bath salts back there.

832
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,840
I mean the doctors we spoke
to, he definitely said that
like hypersexuality is,

833
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,540
is one of the sort symptoms, not
symptoms. What the side effects,

834
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,210
side effects or benefits, benefits,
however you wanna describe it of Batsauce.

835
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,420
Yeah. And depending how you slice it,
I wonder who he was starting to think

836
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,071
for these drugs.

837
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:43,400
I know they're for women but with men by
these drugs to give to their wives and

838
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:43,610
girls.

839
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,860
Friends are always, well what
he was doing, it was good.

840
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,430
He had like a bunch of young
girls from this, you know,

841
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,590
it was Billy's a third world country.
I guess sort of developing the PC way.

842
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,160
So he had these,
you know,

843
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,140
young jungle girls like 20 years old
or however the where like I think his

844
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:01,760
girlfriend was 20. And
he was like, you know,

845
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,600
had all these pictures of these different
girls that he was getting hooked up on

846
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:10,400
bath salts. Crazy dude. We had him on the
podcast when he's actually on the run.

847
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah. After he
was being charged with murder,

848
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,880
he fled the country and he was calling us,

849
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:19,920
I think it was caused
from Mexico on a, um, uh,

850
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,300
one of those little Kmart cell phones
that you buy are very nervous. Yeah, yeah,

851
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:27,140
yeah. And so he was, he called into the
podcast and spoke to us for like an hour.

852
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,370
It was fascinating too.

853
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:32,300
We asked him about the drugs and he was
saying that you can't believe everything

854
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,680
you read. I am a notorious
Prankster, you know,

855
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,340
I think that was his, it's
just, just fun and hey,

856
00:48:40,341 --> 00:48:45,230
I know that's how I prank when I prank
I set up a lab and a fucking do it

857
00:48:45,231 --> 00:48:49,640
hardcore, man. I make you really believe
that I'm cooking bass off. Meanwhile,

858
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:54,610
I'm just back there with some like glitter
and glue and I mean he made like this

859
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,530
really like high resolution photographs.

860
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:01,160
It was work and detailed the whole
process. So if he was a troll, like man,

861
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:05,330
he's a really well thought out troll.
He's a, he's a character and a half.

862
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,433
But um,

863
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,910
the bath salts aspects where one of the
parts of the whole story where they just

864
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,060
sort of painted him like
this maniac. Yeah. Yeah.

865
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,870
Some of the names of these bath
salts are just insane. Yeah.

866
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,190
We were able to actually acquire some
just that smoke shops here in southern

867
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:23,490
California that were, one was
called Scooby Doo. The other one,

868
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:26,380
the sec called sexy Zombie.
And we need it.

869
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,850
We went into smoke shop and bought this
stuff. And then we were actually, uh,

870
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,950
so our first episode we actually filmed
some, um, uh, we feature some, uh,

871
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,740
a marine who's addicted to, or who was
at the time addicted to bath salts.

872
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,810
We should explain to people that these
are not actually bath salts to people

873
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:45,710
that live happy lives here. It's
drugs stay off the internet. Right.

874
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,360
The term bath salts as a term given
to these synthetic drugs that escape

875
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,700
regulation because they're not clinically,

876
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:56,570
they're not technically legal or illegal.
Illegal.

877
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,210
Yeah.
Undefined.

878
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,190
Well they're defined and they sell them
and sell them as bath salts and says not

879
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:07,500
for human consumption warrant warrant.
Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. So

880
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,970
there are chemical,
they're made in labs,

881
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:13,020
but they have the same sort of effects
on your body as a cocaine or math,

882
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,530
but it's made in labs so there's nothing
natural about it is entirely made with

883
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:17,041
chemicals,

884
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:21,270
most of which come from China and India
and you can order them and then you have

885
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:23,070
a garage and they're the kids.

886
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:26,370
This is how it started off with these
kids putting all these chemicals together.

887
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:29,630
You have it all the internet step by
step on how to make it pretty easy.

888
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,290
And you make these batches of both what
they call bath salts and the initially

889
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:36,440
call them bath salts so that they
could sell them with a not for human

890
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:37,820
consumption.
We went blank,

891
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,760
although they're super expensive
compared to regular bath salts and you,

892
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,890
and they may be a spice and k two and
these were drugs that were sold over the

893
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,920
counter smoke shops. I mean we were
able to buy them at shell stations,

894
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,860
gas stations,
and they're sold all over the country.

895
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:56,240
And it's really hard to go after these
drugs because as soon as the government

896
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:59,350
comes out and prohibits one
compound, they immediately, you know,

897
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,950
China and India is already have already
all these other chemicals ready to ship.

898
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,810
Um, so they just need to change a little
compounds and it's a new drug and it's

899
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:11,150
legal all of a sudden.
So that's why it's so hard to get.

900
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,810
It's, it's amazing that that
sort of popped up out of nowhere.

901
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:18,350
It's like all of a sudden someone figured
out, oh, we could do this. Yeah. Well,

902
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,190
I think they would like,

903
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:22,640
they were sitting around in like chemistry
labs at universities, like, you know,

904
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:25,550
they were doing legitimate research on
them. And then this sort of, you know,

905
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:29,690
monkey got out of the cage and next
thing you know, it's, uh, you know,

906
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,490
running ramp at 28 days later.

907
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,560
Really interesting.
It was a professor at a university in,

908
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,390
do you remember what the name of the
university was? A Michigan, maybe,

909
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,740
I can't remember, but it was a professor
in the 70s it was doing this research.

910
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:46,190
You wanted to know what kind of
effects drugs have on a person's brain.

911
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:50,410
So he was doing all this research and
came out with all these compounds and all

912
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,850
this came out. And
suddenly it was, you know,

913
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,920
tha tha tha tha tha tha instructions and
the manual on how to create these crazy

914
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,870
drugs that are now everywhere
around us and legal.

915
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,490
Yeah. But, but you know,
John McAfee, McAfee, McAfee,

916
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:12,750
McAfee,
I never know how to say that.

917
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:17,670
It always pops up on your computer and
you're like McAfee graded that, right? No,

918
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:21,780
he didn't create basketball,
McAfee viral software.

919
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:26,330
So He's, he's a legitimate, the smart
guy. Why is it one point in time? Yeah,

920
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,240
it might be a little crazy,

921
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:32,040
but like most of these bath salts and
synthetic marijuana of being put together

922
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:34,020
by like some Yahoo who's in the garage.

923
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,240
So that's where the problem
comes in is that, you know,

924
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,400
you don't know what you're getting and
you don't know how if they're mixing it

925
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:41,400
correctly, they do these things. You
get these things called hotspots,

926
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:44,700
like where at one portion of the batch
we'll have like 30 times the amount of

927
00:52:44,701 --> 00:52:48,210
the product compared to another part
that might just have just been missing,

928
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,510
you know, so, so you never know what
you're getting. And obviously, you know,

929
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:55,610
when you have like a 1920 year old kid
who's just looking to make some money and

930
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,030
mixing it together, he's not probably
doing the best science to, uh, yeah.

931
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,350
Yeah. And you're also, there's a bunch of
different effects of these things, right?

932
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:05,880
It's another night.
It's not uniform.

933
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,980
Yeah, we did. We spoke about the over

934
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:14,250
aggressiveness. People believe that
they have superhuman force. Uh,

935
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:17,490
there's all these videos that you can
search it on youtube to have people going

936
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:20,550
out and believing their superman
and throwing themselves off cliffs.

937
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,670
We spoke to a doctor who had
treated a patient who was a lawyer.

938
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:27,870
He was studying for the bar and took
some of this stuff and decided that his

939
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,040
hands, his own hands, we're trying
to attack him. He thought paranoid.

940
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,370
He thought his hands were
trying to attack him.

941
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,580
So he put both his hands on a stove top
and burned his old art heart arms and he

942
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,550
couldn't feel the pain.

943
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,260
So it was just because the neighbor smelt
the burning of his arms that they came.

944
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,160
So he was cooking his own arms.
Just sitting is on arms.

945
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:53,880
Yeah. So some of these
drugs are related to, um,

946
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,590
other drugs where they like take it
and they change a molecule or twist

947
00:53:57,591 --> 00:54:00,740
something around. But they're,
they're not, it's not uniform.

948
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:04,840
So it's not like they're all
derivatives of this. They're there.

949
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,440
They very like wildly.

950
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,700
So you buy a batch of sexy Zombie today
and do you snort it or smoke it and it

951
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:17,020
does something to you really like it's
a really great high, it wasn't too bad.

952
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:19,090
Next day there's not much of a hangover.

953
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,850
So the next day you decided you want to
go to the smoke shop and buy some more

954
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:24,790
of this stuff. But that batch can
be, have the same name, same name,

955
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,940
possibly come from the same place, but
it's entirely different. You never know.

956
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,890
Every single batch is different.

957
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,610
So suddenly you might be taken to the
hospital or you might be out trying to

958
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:34,444
attack somebody.

959
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,290
And there's also that story in Florida,

960
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:40,730
that guy that ate that guy's face that's
felt on the map. That story. Yeah.

961
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:43,760
Well what's interesting is they
said, well it's been, you know,

962
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:46,790
it's been refuted because he didn't
test positive for bath salts.

963
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,700
But then I read there is
no test for bass salts.

964
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:53,120
Like he didn't test positive and passwords
cause it doesn't exist. You don't,

965
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:55,910
first of all, they don't know what to
look for. Right. Because it could be any,

966
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:58,250
a number one of these different
substances and second of all,

967
00:54:58,251 --> 00:54:58,980
they're not looking.

968
00:54:58,980 --> 00:54:59,431
Exactly.

969
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:03,090
And that's why they're so popular in
that we heard that they're so popular in

970
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,250
places where there's drug testing is,

971
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,280
is a mandatory searches military or we
have communities or even bull fighting.

972
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:13,470
We were in Arizona and interview both
people from the bull fighting community.

973
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:17,070
And this is really popular there because
it's so hard to test these drugs so

974
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:20,280
they can do that. Just take them and know
that nobody's going to ever find out.

975
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:25,430
So they take these bass sauce and then
hop on a ball. Yeah. Holy Shit Jacqueline.

976
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,940
Yeah. We spoke to a kid to
do that reckless person go.

977
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,700
It takes bath salts and
gets it. I'll pull. Wow.

978
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:36,990
So it's very possible apparently that
that guy who he, that guy's face was,

979
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,920
was on pass halls as possible. And
that sounds right. Right. Doesn't it?

980
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:45,470
It's uh, I guess, yeah, it's
consistent with behavior.

981
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,450
That's nice. Very scientific
words. Yeah. I mean we can't,

982
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,280
I have no idea if the guy was on
bath salts. It definitely, you know,

983
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,450
I think the cops were like, this is the
craziest thing you've ever seen. And it,

984
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,780
it's just consistent with behavior that
we've seen of other people that have

985
00:55:59,781 --> 00:56:00,740
been on bath salts.

986
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,980
That's why that jumped to the conclusion
that maybe it was bath salts and even

987
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:06,380
after the autopsy or whatever
they did, you know, they, uh,

988
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,020
they said they ruled out that what that,
I don't know if they rolled it out,

989
00:56:09,021 --> 00:56:11,860
but they said that it probably wasn't
bath salts or something, but who knows

990
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,540
how long before the pharmaceutical
companies realize how much money's in bath

991
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,920
salts and just say,
listen,

992
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:21,510
we need to do is just set up some labs
and like Mexico or Peru or whatever,

993
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,450
turn out our own bath salts, launch
them over the border with catapults,

994
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,060
have people pick them up on trucks.

995
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:28,780
Yeah.

996
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,590
Well there's an article that came out
today actually about how the DEA had just

997
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:35,770
busted and is really concerned about
synthetic drugs because it is becoming

998
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:37,270
quite a big problem here
in the United States.

999
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,120
And how they finding out that
actually it is, uh, they,

1000
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,540
they said that it was their finding
some connections of how it's funding

1001
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,480
terrorism in the Middle East.
It's funny how everything ends up.

1002
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:47,950
Funding terrorism in the Middle East.

1003
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:52,670
It just means we need to spend more money
on tanks. That's the tank companies,

1004
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,780
you know. But there are some really
sad stories that we, you know,

1005
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:57,660
we interviewed the father
of a kid who took baths,

1006
00:56:57,661 --> 00:57:02,560
holes for the first time because a
friend gave it to him and the kids went

1007
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:03,430
totally wild.

1008
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:08,360
Came into his parents house and slit his
throat in front of his parents and uh,

1009
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:14,270
died five days later. Oh. So yeah,
it's definitely something to,

1010
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,660
well, when you have children, that's
when drugs really start worrying you.

1011
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,540
Like drugs never worried me when I was
single because I was like, you know,

1012
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,520
I'm not doing anything stupid.
I'm not worried about it.

1013
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,820
I would hear stories about people dying
and you know, it would make me sad,

1014
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,490
but it didn't, it didn't hit
home. Boy started having children.

1015
00:57:28,491 --> 00:57:31,610
And you think about all the dumb things
that you did growing up and somehow or

1016
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:32,280
another dodge,

1017
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,230
all those bullets and got to be an adult
and you think about these little ones

1018
00:57:36,231 --> 00:57:41,231
growing up in this new world where it's
not so easy because when I was a kid,

1019
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:42,980
there was no such thing as oxycontin.

1020
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:44,930
There was no such thing as
pain management centers.

1021
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:49,460
There's no such thing as 240,000 people
in a year getting a prescription for

1022
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:53,360
oxygen in Montana. There was none
of those things. So those hurdles,

1023
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:58,070
even though it was still, there's lots
of scary stuff that that wasn't there,

1024
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:01,580
but I got really fortunate that I
saw my friends when I was a kid.

1025
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:05,720
My friend's cousin was a coke dealer and
they go, I got to watch him right away.

1026
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,900
I mean, I got to watch his life like
fall apart over the course of a year.

1027
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:12,530
Like I lost all this weight became creepy.
He was hiding all the time.

1028
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,110
Just became like a vampire.

1029
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,590
Like he got bitten by a vampire and
became this like sick person was really,

1030
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,370
he was a dealer. Yes, he was a dealer,
an addict himself who's doing it himself.

1031
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,970
And in watching that and watching them
go from like a regular guy to becoming

1032
00:58:25,971 --> 00:58:30,020
this guy,
it was a huge lesson to be learned.

1033
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,150
And um,
I was in Vegas this weekend and I heard,

1034
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:36,950
I was talking to this guy who was
a, the the driver and I said, uh,

1035
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,190
you know how you like living in Vegas? Is
it, is it problem? He goes, well, he goes,

1036
00:58:40,191 --> 00:58:42,230
you know, the thing is
a, it's the drugs man.

1037
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:44,630
You gotta avoid the drugs if
you can avoid the drugs. It's a,

1038
00:58:44,631 --> 00:58:47,900
it's a good place to live. Like it's
like most people just avoid the strip.

1039
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,520
But fortunately for me,

1040
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:53,030
my sister was hooked on drugs and
southern person was hooked on drugs.

1041
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:55,340
He's telling me all the people he knew
that are hooked on drugs, you know,

1042
00:58:55,341 --> 00:58:59,000
that had sort of, he learned from
them to not do it. It's like,

1043
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,070
it's almost like how we need to learn.

1044
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,660
You need to learn by watching
other people fucking okay. Yup.

1045
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,690
You are going to leave the
belief that government,

1046
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,340
if the government comes out and tells
you to avoid it, you're like, whatever.

1047
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,770
Fuck you crux now you know,

1048
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,770
it's w what can be done to like besides,
you know,

1049
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,760
you talking,
are you doing a show like that?

1050
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:23,000
Did you guys or is there anybody you
talked to that had some really concrete

1051
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:24,540
plans or how this could be hard

1052
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:29,960
now there's some great organizations out
there, support group or organizations.

1053
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,860
You know, again, a lot of them are
being led by women, by mothers,

1054
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,400
which I think is phenomenal and they
are really trying to raise awareness and

1055
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:39,320
pass legislation to make these,
these,

1056
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:43,640
these bills are harder to get into
to stop these, these, you know,

1057
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:48,620
crazy doctors from over prescribing.
Um, but it's, you know, um, the, there,

1058
00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:51,520
there is a way and I,
I do love the,

1059
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,620
whenever I speak to some of these mothers,
it's really refreshing to see these,

1060
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:00,950
these are just women who are so
strong and wanting to fight for this.

1061
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,860
Yeah, well that, that is a nice thing,

1062
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:05,840
but it just sucks that they
have to fight for that. Jamie,

1063
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,720
there's something going on with it.
It's buffering every few minutes.

1064
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:12,330
People complain a lot. Yeah. So
you stream side. Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

1065
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,380
We got a hundred megabytes a second
upload ladies and gentlemen now.

1066
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:18,160
So it's all Ustream, those dirty
bitches. You gotta figure it out,

1067
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:22,730
complained to use trim. We can't
help you. Um, the, uh, the, uh,

1068
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:24,880
the show, you're going
to basically, you're,

1069
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:28,490
you're going after a lot of
different things. It's not,
not just drugs. When you,

1070
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,340
when you do this kind of investigative
journalism and you're like ruffle

1071
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,830
feathers and sort of, uh, make noise.

1072
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,700
Did you guys experience
any blowback from that?

1073
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,370
Um, occasionally, but then, you know,

1074
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:44,350
like this series as we did in the
Ashcan p said that we started with, um,

1075
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,250
you know, we did some on a lot of, on
the cover of filming and uh, you know,

1076
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,210
our sort of approach to that is that
we're not looking to get any individual in

1077
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:55,930
trouble when I try to do any Gotcha. Kind
of journalism and busts any individual.

1078
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,170
We're just trying to shed light on
an issue. And so I think, you know,

1079
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,340
if we were targeting a specific
individual, um, you know,

1080
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,390
there might be a little bit of blowback,
um, whether rightly or wrongly,

1081
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:10,090
whether we were doing it that
way. But I think, you know,

1082
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,390
the fact that we were just trying to
shed light on an issue and the only way

1083
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:16,880
that we can do that is with
on the cover of cameras. You,
you sort of, uh, you know,

1084
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,990
mute the blow back a little bit because
it's just enlightening for most people

1085
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:22,690
to see what goes on when people don't
know the camera's rolling, you know?

1086
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:25,570
Yeah. That's a, that's probably a very
good point. Yeah, I didn't think of that.

1087
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,280
That's um, uh, that,

1088
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,700
that's probably what saved you guys.

1089
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,400
Well, Mike, well, Mike Wallace. Yeah.

1090
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,080
From 60 minutes, 60 minutes pioneered
the undercover camera. Then they,

1091
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:39,650
they started doing away with it and
Mike Wallace said, you know, uh,

1092
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:43,670
the idea was to, to draw
light, but we started drawing
heat. And so once you know,

1093
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:47,450
it just becomes a bit of a, you know,
during heat and not shedding enough light,

1094
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:49,460
then, you know, it's not
time. It's time to sort of

1095
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,190
stopped doing it. So yeah, I think that
will be our, or it's time to stop as well.

1096
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:56,680
But I do get nervous every
time. I know, you know,

1097
01:01:56,681 --> 01:01:59,610
I just rewatched for the 10th time,
the doctor,

1098
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,360
the first episode of this series that
is airing on Wednesday night at 10:00 PM

1099
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,890
and I'm in a,

1100
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:08,470
made me really nervous just to watch
some of the stuff cause we did go

1101
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:10,470
undercover and filmed a lot of things,
films,

1102
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,640
a lot of people selling drugs and
some people taking drugs and um,

1103
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:18,880
a lot of it was filmed undercover and
makes me nervous for sure. But it's,

1104
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,070
it an issue that we thought

1105
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,980
was, you know, an important issue,
not enough people know about it.

1106
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,430
And what other subjects you guys cover?
We have,

1107
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,020
the second one is about guns.
Um,

1108
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:34,440
and we go into, we go to Arizona.
We spent a lot of time in Arizona,

1109
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,690
uh, and we basically became the, the, we
transformed ourselves into the bad guys,

1110
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,870
into criminals trying to get guns
just to see how easy it would be for a

1111
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:47,160
criminal to get their hands on guns in
Arizona. And in the space of about two,

1112
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:51,400
three days, we were able
to get three handguns, uh,

1113
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:56,040
one of which is the most powerful handgun,
a Smith and Wesson 500 magnum. I know.

1114
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,600
I now I'm an expert on guns.

1115
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:02,250
I knew nothing about guns before this
and we were able to get an AK 47 and a 50

1116
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:06,960
cow caliber, which is know most
powerful names in the world. Um, out of,

1117
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:11,760
um, the, the, the AK 47 we got out of the
Taco bell parking lot. We went online,

1118
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:12,270
um,

1119
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:17,270
backpage.com re looked for AK 47 and
within 45 minutes we had bought an AK 47

1120
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:19,074
out of those guys.

1121
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:26,180
Is this car as well? Oh my God.
We were on a budget so we can,

1122
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,850
so this person, when you ere
the, showed you blocked her face,

1123
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,620
black, their faces out. Because who knows
why they're doing this and that case,

1124
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:34,190
they actually looked
like drunk drug addict.

1125
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:37,270
So it was really important for
us to not, again, not knowing,

1126
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,620
going after anyone personally.

1127
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,720
Yeah. Beautiful of you. And
congratulations on handling it that way.

1128
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,030
Cause that's a,
I think the the right way to do it.

1129
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:50,060
And it's also obviously this person as a
part of a much greater issue in to turn

1130
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:52,680
it on to make it about one person.
It's like,

1131
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:57,710
it's a tendency to do in this country I
to victimize or to criminalize this one

1132
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:00,770
person or whatever,
you know,

1133
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,180
focus on one person when really
what's going on is the issue, right?

1134
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,220
Being able to buy cons that easy.

1135
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:09,310
Do you know what's so interesting though
is that right after we bought that AK

1136
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:11,110
47, it was, I think it was, uh,

1137
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,850
it was a first assault rifle
that we bought in Arizona and uh,

1138
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,660
we'd been nervous whether,
you know,

1139
01:04:16,661 --> 01:04:20,260
we'd invested money to go there and we'd
going to be able to, to buy these guns.

1140
01:04:20,261 --> 01:04:23,310
And so to sort of celebrate our
purchase, we went into the, uh,

1141
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,860
bar right next to Taco bell and
we order three beers. Myself,

1142
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,060
Darren and the other
producer, Alex. And, uh,

1143
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:32,530
because Alex didn't have his id with him,
they didn't sell him a beer. Meanwhile,

1144
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:35,520
we just bought a naked 47 outside and no,

1145
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:37,900
no one asked for id or even our names.

1146
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,160
That's funny. It keeps cutting out. Jamie.

1147
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,350
Maybe we should switch it over to a
lower stream or something like that.

1148
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,980
Try that. Try that. See if that helps.
We'll fix it for you folks, folks. Um,

1149
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,650
the, uh, the, the gun issue is a really a,

1150
01:04:50,651 --> 01:04:54,660
a creepy one in this country
and it's also in my opinion,

1151
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,820
connected to the pharmaceutical issue.

1152
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,810
And the reason being is that there's this
massive connection between the things

1153
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:03,150
that people are afraid
of when it comes to guns,

1154
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:05,520
which is school shootings and the in the,

1155
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:10,521
like a massive connection between those
and the use of Ssri and antidepressants.

1156
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,420
And there's something like,

1157
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,720
I think the latest statistic was it was
more than 90% of all school shooters,

1158
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:25,960
uh, either are on antidepressants
when they do it or are recovering from

1159
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:27,370
antidepressants when they do it.

1160
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:30,760
And that's one of those things
that makes you wonder like,

1161
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:35,000
which came first, the chicken or the
egg, right. Yeah. You know? Yeah,

1162
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:39,140
no, definitely. I'm in like a, I think
when you talk about those mass units,

1163
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:43,900
and actually we shot this and the last
day of, of, um, of shooting was, um,

1164
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,080
the aurora shooting less
Dave filming. Oh Wow. Uh,

1165
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,190
the gun space was the, the
Aurora shooting. That's
incredible. Yeah. And then,

1166
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,740
you know, so it's been in the camp for
awhile, this piece. And then, you know,

1167
01:05:54,741 --> 01:05:56,480
when Newtown happened,
you know,

1168
01:05:56,481 --> 01:06:00,200
there was some question of whether
we should air the show, uh, the, the,

1169
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,230
the guns episode early. But,
um, we decided, you know,

1170
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,220
there was enough debate going on at that
point. It just to hold it off. Um, yeah.

1171
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,300
And then he used the guide, the
aura, the, um, the new town, um,

1172
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,680
sandy hook shooting.
He used a bushmaster,

1173
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:19,610
which we also saw for sale at gun shows.
What is that 10 or 15?

1174
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,110
I've thought the Sandy Hook.
I used pistols.

1175
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,560
I think that sandy hook guy used
the Ed Bushmaster. Yeah. Hmm.

1176
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,490
I just look it up.
I'm pretty sure.

1177
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:31,260
Or the,

1178
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:36,260
the new findings or the sandy hook
shooting was that he actually didn't use

1179
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,890
assault weapon pistols.
Hold on.

1180
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,560
I'm saying we should know

1181
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:48,450
NBC admitted no assault rifle
used in new town shooting.

1182
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:51,530
Um,
do,

1183
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,540
do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do too. Um, for hand guns.

1184
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,810
Apparently only handguns
were taking into the school.

1185
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:05,240
Yeah, I think, um, yeah, he had,

1186
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,610
it had been said that he had,
oh,

1187
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:12,360
he had an ar 15 assault rifle
that he taken into the school. Um,

1188
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,480
and it was in the car that he drove there,

1189
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:19,340
but they've been told by several officials
that he had left it in the car and

1190
01:07:19,341 --> 01:07:21,830
then he came in and just
shut everyone pistols.

1191
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,960
I remember when the reports
came out hearing about the
bushmaster that he had to

1192
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:30,640
bushmaster. And I remember clearly
having seen it and the gun shows and we,

1193
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,960
you know,
we almost bought one.

1194
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,280
I mean we're really beach spin.
This is just sort of a technicality here.

1195
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:40,720
But what kind of gun he used, um,
the obviously shot a bunch of people.

1196
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,010
That's what's important is it someone
can get this tool and really that's what

1197
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:50,011
it is and inanimate tool and a person
can get it and go do these things.

1198
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:55,360
And these things happen very rarely.
And when they happen,

1199
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:00,450
there's this massive reaction and the
reaction is almost always to try to take

1200
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:05,470
guns away. And that's what gets
like the real nutters. Crazy,

1201
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:09,970
right? I ain't going to
take my cold dead fingers.

1202
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,570
Romaco and it's, um, it's,

1203
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:17,571
it's almost like it's one the
strangest debates in our culture

1204
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:22,560
because it's not a gun. It's
killing all these people. It's,

1205
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:27,570
it's a person who's doing something
that is horrific and impossible.

1206
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:32,180
Stop. It's, it's, it's a person
that's doing something. So if,

1207
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:35,990
if, if they didn't have a gun, who
knows what they would do? I mean,

1208
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,720
would they try to do it with a car where
they just plow over a bunch of people

1209
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:41,420
in the road? Would they,
would they make a bomb?

1210
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,630
The idea is that this tool makes
it easier for them to do it,

1211
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:47,420
but the reality is the gun's
not doing shit on its own.

1212
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,720
And the real issue in my mind is always
been a person able to do something like

1213
01:08:53,451 --> 01:08:53,721
that.

1214
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:58,721
Like how does that happen and
why is that sort of brushed away?

1215
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:03,470
Everyone just wants to talk about gun
control and then it gets up this debate

1216
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,560
and humans are so wacky
that when there's a debate,

1217
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:10,370
there's two sides screaming at each
other and nothing gets done. You know,

1218
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:11,750
you have the Ted Nugent side,

1219
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:15,740
that stockpile and ammo because
they think Obama's to, uh, you know,

1220
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,770
turn the whole country into
communist Russia. And then, you know,

1221
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:22,490
you've got the other side that want
the, you know, that say, fuck hunters,

1222
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,070
you should just kill hunters. No
one should have a gun, you know,

1223
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:29,000
get your meat from a supermarket. This is
bullshit. We need to, we need to evolve.

1224
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:32,300
You know, there's, there's that,
that argument as well and my opinion,

1225
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,620
it's a mental health issue. And
uh, just the fact that guns exist,

1226
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,120
like guns are crazy.

1227
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,970
The idea that you could just point
at something and make it disappear,

1228
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,250
but there's so many guns,

1229
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,420
there's so many gun owners and it's so
rare if you look at it statistically that

1230
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,800
something like this happens.

1231
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,500
If you look at how many human
beings we have in this country,

1232
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:55,580
it's like 300 million and how many
shootings like this happen where someone

1233
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:57,920
indiscriminately just starts
whacking people around them.

1234
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:01,790
It's kind of strange that it's so rare
because there's so many fucking nuts.

1235
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,210
Yeah. So many fucking crazy people
in this country. It's almost,

1236
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,810
we're like blessed that these things
don't happen on a regular basis. Right.

1237
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,570
Well in many ways I think the gun debate
is an easier debate to have if it's the

1238
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:16,930
same with addiction, right? I mean like
addictions, very complicated issue.

1239
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:20,040
Mental health is a very
complicated issue and you know,

1240
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,630
it's not as easy as to talk about.

1241
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,400
Do you want guns or do you want that
one Collins? And I think you know what,

1242
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:27,940
not to have guns.

1243
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:33,130
And I think what we were trying to show
in an RPA says that like the same laws

1244
01:10:33,131 --> 01:10:37,720
that make it easy for anybody to access
guns also makes it easy for people who

1245
01:10:37,721 --> 01:10:39,130
you don't want to having
guns and have guns.

1246
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,390
And so if you're comfortable with that,

1247
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:42,610
and then there were many states and there
are many people that are comfortable

1248
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:47,560
with that, that that's, that's great. And
uh, if you know, if you're not, if you,

1249
01:10:47,561 --> 01:10:51,880
if you fear the damage that had gun can
do, um, in a, in the wrong person's hand,

1250
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,580
then you know,
that's also a worthy thing to debate.

1251
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:56,980
I think it's a much easier debate.
I agree with you.

1252
01:10:56,981 --> 01:10:58,480
It's much more black and white.

1253
01:10:58,481 --> 01:11:02,650
It's about having the right to bear
arm to have arms and what should be the

1254
01:11:02,651 --> 01:11:06,940
limits on that. And then, and then
pills, which actually, you know, um,

1255
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:10,180
it's a much more of a gray area debate.

1256
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,040
Yeah, it certainly is. Um, and

1257
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,260
even if there is gun laws,

1258
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:21,390
I guess you could punish people harder
for selling you an AK 47 and a parking

1259
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:25,740
lot. But the fact that you could
just do it. Yeah, that's a,

1260
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,580
the anybody wants to stop background
checks from owning guns is an asshole.

1261
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,300
It's really that simple.
Yeah. I mean I think it's,

1262
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:39,470
there is the vast majority of people
just agree on most things and then it's,

1263
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:41,640
you know,

1264
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,270
the sort of extremes of both sides that
sort of hindsight to debate and you know,

1265
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:46,800
background checks.
You know,

1266
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:50,640
we go through background checks anytime
we want to buy a car or you know,

1267
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:53,770
like you know, and they ask
for id if you want to write it.

1268
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,220
So why not ask for your id or to get the
background check if you want to buy a

1269
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:02,670
dangerous weapon.
I saw the best Twitter post on this.

1270
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:06,030
Somebody wrote this is the
way to solve the gun problems.

1271
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,920
Take everybody who has a gun and killed
him. And I was like, Jesus Christ.

1272
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:15,960
See that is talking about missing the
point. That doesn't help the debate.

1273
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:20,550
But it was just one of those things that
like this extreme reaction that people

1274
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:25,530
have to, to the, to the gun issue
when the reality is, and you know,

1275
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:27,060
and I'm not in the Ted Nugent camp,

1276
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:31,080
but the reality is when you look at the
actual numbers of people with guns and

1277
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:34,710
the small amount of times
of these things happen,

1278
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:37,530
it's really not a gun issue.
It's a mental health issue.

1279
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:41,600
But there's the sort of pedestrian
violence that happens every day. Sure.

1280
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:46,260
There's rare mass shootings and stuff
like that, but every day, you know,

1281
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:50,690
either accidentally or on purpose, people
are getting shot with guns and killed.

1282
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:55,260
You know, it's true. And you know,
the thing is, is that, uh, the,

1283
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:58,560
the part that I loved about doing the
piece and was when we started out as we

1284
01:12:58,561 --> 01:13:03,330
went to, uh, this, um, shooting range and
we with Po took part in this festival,

1285
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:07,560
um, independent state rifle
match. Yeah. Um, and you know,

1286
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:11,100
there were guys that are very obviously
very pro gun on and like with disagree

1287
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:15,000
with anybody who says that they should
be any limits on gun ownership or

1288
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:16,840
anything like that. But
at same time, you know,

1289
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,940
a lot of the guys who we're speaking to,

1290
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:21,560
we're very serious about the safety
that went into to, you know, what,

1291
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,300
owning a gun. There's a responsibility
there that if you own something,

1292
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:26,040
just like if you own or drive a car,

1293
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:29,340
there's a responsibility to know how
to drive a car and had, you know, to,

1294
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,890
to educate yourself. And so, you
know, the NRA, um, they often,

1295
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:37,500
they offer these pistol classes and
they teach you how to, you know,

1296
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,710
on load load and how to do
everything safely. And you know,

1297
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:42,750
I think it's not mandatory for gun owners,

1298
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:46,410
but I think anybody that wants to own a
gun should certainly take a class in how

1299
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:50,870
to handle, handle, handle a weapon
because they're super dangerous. Yeah.

1300
01:13:50,871 --> 01:13:52,680
I don't think there's any
debate in that whatsoever.

1301
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:56,850
And I think another issue that needs to
be taken into consideration is how many

1302
01:13:56,851 --> 01:14:00,300
people's lives are saved with guns
from bad guys. I mean, how many, um,

1303
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:05,310
how many times have a police in, in, in
justifiable cases shot people. I mean,

1304
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:07,380
when you look at the number of
people that shot in this country,

1305
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,230
sometimes it's people that are
protecting their home from a,

1306
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:12,250
a burglar and sometimes

1307
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,330
it's a woman trying to prevent a rape. I
mean, all these things are true as well.

1308
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,720
So it isn't a black and white issue.
And that's what gets people really weird.

1309
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,120
And you know, by the way, if you really,

1310
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:25,960
if you really adamant about gun control
and you've really adamant about stopping

1311
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:30,280
gun violence, pay attention to the
fact that we're involved in wars too.

1312
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,210
Crazy ones.

1313
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:35,620
And they're in places that don't make any
sense and people are dying over there.

1314
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:40,630
Just, yeah, a lot of innocent people.
And you know, how about drones,

1315
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,610
you know,
there's a lot of other shit going on.

1316
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:45,670
It's not just happening right here.
It's a violence issue.

1317
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:50,230
It's a attachment from humanity
issue. It's, it's a very strange one.

1318
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:55,340
It's one that seems to be lingering in,
uh, in our transition from this, you know,

1319
01:14:55,450 --> 01:15:00,130
primal, Alpha male monkey thing that we
used to be to whatever we're becoming.

1320
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:04,840
As we become more and more educated and
more and more aware of the consequences

1321
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:08,260
of our actions and more and more
hopefully enlightened. Where were we?

1322
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:08,771
We're still,

1323
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:11,920
we still have this thing where you could
just press a button and people explode,

1324
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:12,671
you know?

1325
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:17,671
And anybody can get one in the parking
lot after being online in 45 minutes,

1326
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:23,170
which sounds strange. I mean,
people are so God damn strange,

1327
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:27,130
and you really look at it that way. If
you were an objective observer, you know,

1328
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:31,060
from another planet that sent
here to report back on earth, boy,

1329
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:32,590
what a fucking story you would have.

1330
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,370
You'd have to sit them down
and you'd have to go, okay,

1331
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:41,290
well this was not what we had hoped for.
And we just say that first.

1332
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,410
They're fucking crazy. First
of all, they're all on pills.

1333
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,960
They got guns, they're on pills. No
one knows what the fuck they're doing.

1334
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,900
It's all bananas.
Yeah.

1335
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:58,540
Journalists are driving into trees or 90
miles an hour, not leaving skid marks.

1336
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:00,910
When you guys saw that,
did you get scared?

1337
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,710
Like thinking about the
business that you're in?

1338
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:07,240
We're talking about Michael Hastings who
a a journalists for the rolling stone

1339
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:12,241
magazine and he was involved in exactly
what you're not involved in and he was

1340
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,590
involved in singling out individuals and
going after them and he did did it to a

1341
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:20,480
very powerful general and wrote
some piece in rolling stone.

1342
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:24,010
They got the guy fired and repeatedly
told people that people had told them

1343
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:24,844
they're going to kill him.

1344
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:30,040
Then one day his car
going 100 miles an hour,

1345
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:31,450
uh,
in Hollywood,

1346
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:36,470
slammed directly into a pole
or a tree and killed them,

1347
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:40,600
burst into flames, no skid marks
at all. And you know, you think,

1348
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:45,370
well that's a, that's crazy.
Then this guy who was, uh,

1349
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:51,090
involved in security for President Clinton
and Bush said that you can hack into

1350
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:56,191
a car now and that today it's possible
to hack into a modern car and control the

1351
01:16:57,971 --> 01:17:01,630
steering, control, the
acceleration and patrol the brakes.

1352
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,550
And then it's very possible you could
remote control a car and make someone

1353
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:11,490
accelerate and slam into a tree,
make the car explode. Wow. Yeah.

1354
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,360
Uh, so when I'm starting to
go where the story, yeah.

1355
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:21,820
I mean I've heard the just, um, and some
of the conspiracies that's around this,

1356
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:25,450
I don't really know the details,
but um, I will say that he was,

1357
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:29,130
he was a great reporter and
uh, definitely, um, yeah,

1358
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,470
big loss for the industry for sure.
That's a good way to play it safe.

1359
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,670
No, no, I don't. I really
don't. I applaud you on your,

1360
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:40,880
so basically tell us what you think.
Oh, I don't know. I have no idea.

1361
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:45,410
I think it would be foolish of me with
my zero understanding of the mechanics of

1362
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:49,970
modern automobiles, zero understanding
of the computer equipment that runs them.

1363
01:17:49,971 --> 01:17:54,920
I have zero technical knowledge,
Richard Clark. So it was, yeah,

1364
01:17:55,470 --> 01:18:00,260
it was a several others as well who
have studied the, the mechanisms behind,

1365
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:04,880
uh, the possibilities of
remote controlling various
things, hacking into them,

1366
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,080
you know, um, I don't know on our
own what's true. I have no idea,

1367
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,280
but it's scary, scary scenario.
It's very scary. Yeah.

1368
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:16,240
I mean it's trying to have a moving.
We've got just drives it. He's,

1369
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:18,050
he's about to release this crazy story,

1370
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,710
tells everyone that the FBI is looking
into them and interviewing all of his

1371
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:22,760
friends and then,

1372
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:28,000
and do a tray boom and the car
explodes and he dies and no story.

1373
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,450
It's just kind of slowly
disappear. You know, Kim Cardiac,

1374
01:18:30,451 --> 01:18:33,230
she won't get pregnant from some other
dudes and like a couple of months and

1375
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,470
Kanye West would be on the
outs and everybody, I forget
about Michael Hastings,

1376
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:41,660
you know, a few people try to talk about
it on the line and uh, other Fox called,

1377
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:46,430
Oh God, he's still talking about Michael
Hanes things. Laennec oh, pulleys.

1378
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,280
No, he's talking about the great work
that it definitely did. Yes. Yeah. Um,

1379
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,640
but you know,

1380
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:57,470
I think also a thing to
take into consideration and
said we live in an age of

1381
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:00,830
extreme transparency and anybody
who does something that evil,

1382
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,390
it's seems like it's almost impossible
to completely cover things up.

1383
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,660
And if it's not impossible now I
feel like it will be in a few years.

1384
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:15,410
I feel like any sort of record of
something of that magnitude. Yes.

1385
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:18,680
If this is going to be a way that that's
going to come to light and some sort of

1386
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:21,200
a wikileaks type scenario,
you're an optimist.

1387
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:27,050
I'm an optimist. I May, I would, I would
call a technological optimist. You know,

1388
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:31,940
there's that famous Orson Welles
CHRO that history is a race between,

1389
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,220
um, between education
and catastrophe. And uh,

1390
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,630
I think if you look at the trends,

1391
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,870
education seems to like
kind of always be winning.

1392
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:47,290
And I think part of that it's that
ultimately what's good for the entire race

1393
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,780
triumphs over what's good for the few.

1394
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:56,350
And I think even what's good for the few
in terms of a band for the entire race

1395
01:19:56,931 --> 01:20:00,440
is bad for the few because I think
there's a thing called Karma.

1396
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:01,580
And I think that's real.

1397
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,120
And I think that the effect that you have
on your environment is a very tangible

1398
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:09,780
thing. The way people react to you is
a very physical, real measurable thing.

1399
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:13,380
And that comes from being a piece of shit.
If you're a piece of shit,

1400
01:20:13,381 --> 01:20:17,430
you do horrible things. It's very
difficult to feel warm and fuzzy and joy,

1401
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:21,030
love and happiness and have
friends. And I think that, uh,

1402
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:27,770
ultimately technology most likely will
be the tool that balances all that out.

1403
01:20:28,411 --> 01:20:31,350
Because I think that with
technology comes as transparency.

1404
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:36,000
And with this transparency,
you get to see the actions of these few,

1405
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:39,570
um, in a different light.
Then we got to see like,

1406
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:43,650
whether it was in the 60s
and the seventies or when
Eisenhower warned of the,

1407
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:47,790
when he left office and he was warning
about the military industrial complex.

1408
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:53,010
That was just of a film that was on
television for one brief moment in a time

1409
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:56,610
where there was no VCRs. So it's like, how
much impact is that even going to have?

1410
01:20:56,611 --> 01:21:00,510
Then we'll, whereas now,
many, many years later,

1411
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,010
over half a century later,

1412
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,730
that film's being played over and over
again on the Internet as an example of

1413
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:09,990
how this is probably an issue that's been
around secretly behind the curtain for

1414
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:11,910
a long time,

1415
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,330
but now every day there's some new thing.

1416
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:18,030
Every day there's some
new piece of information.

1417
01:21:18,031 --> 01:21:20,300
Every day there's some new story,
you know,

1418
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,530
but there it's Edward Snowden
or whether it's, you know,

1419
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:26,310
someone else releasing something else
or it's some people getting arrested for

1420
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:30,060
something that you can't believe is
real. That's, that's almost impossible.

1421
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,710
But cover that stuff up these
days. Yeah, no, it's crazy. Yeah.

1422
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,780
I like that idea that if she,
people say I'm ridiculous,

1423
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,850
you could easily say I'm ridiculous.
First of all,

1424
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:45,260
I'm not qualified to give any
prognostication whatsoever. I'm to camp,

1425
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,180
give a prognosis. I mean,
this is just a gut reaction,

1426
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:53,570
but I think that if you look at the way
life used to be a thousand years ago and

1427
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:57,350
the way life is today, you know, try
living in during the inquisition,

1428
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,990
try living in the Middle Ages
shows, always hear people, oh we're,

1429
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,280
we're living in the most violent time
and it's not actually the least violent

1430
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:09,810
time in history. And we actually
have it pretty good. But yeah,

1431
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,550
but I'm a strong believer
in Karma as well.

1432
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:15,120
I think we're dealing with a
time where we're really confused.

1433
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:18,090
There's obviously some bad spots
everywhere and there always have been.

1434
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,870
It's very difficult to be a human being
and it's very difficult to develop a

1435
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:25,350
human being, to raise a person.
So to have a baby become an adult,

1436
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:29,200
the processes insane. There's so many
pitfalls and nobody gives you a guidebook.

1437
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,420
Nobody knows what the fuck we're doing.

1438
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:35,690
And we're getting information from 7
million or 7 billion rather people a day.

1439
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:39,690
Essentially. We're getting, not all
the information, but anything crazy,

1440
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:43,800
anything fucked up. You know, Nan born
with 10 penis is there he is, you know,

1441
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,300
like that'll get through.
Yeah.

1442
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:50,250
That gets through everything crazy gets
through and it's almost like we weren't,

1443
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:54,510
we were designed for that were designed
for what's happening in the tribe.

1444
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,360
Who are those guys with swords
coming over the hill. Hey,

1445
01:22:57,361 --> 01:22:58,770
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
You know,

1446
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:00,390
that's what we're sort of designed for.

1447
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:04,140
We're dealing with the same genetics
essentially that people had 10,000 years

1448
01:23:04,141 --> 01:23:07,750
ago and there was no communication
back then. There was nothing.

1449
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,100
And now it's on your phone.

1450
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,680
I was at a restaurant the other day
with a buddy of mine and I'm like,

1451
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:14,290
I'm a fucking junkie.
I can't put this goddamn phone down.

1452
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,740
I have to keep checking the stupid
phone. Um, so I such an asshole,

1453
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:21,790
like I can't see what's going on
on Twitter. You know, it's so bad,

1454
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:22,893
but it's this,

1455
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:27,460
what's happening is I keep getting
information and I'll go and I'll see

1456
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:28,300
something and Ooh,

1457
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,820
and maybe I'll see nothing and then
I'll look more and they'll see nothing.

1458
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:33,730
I'll look more than, Ooh, a
new post by someone I follow.

1459
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:34,900
Something crazy is happening,

1460
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,320
especially when it's a married couple
and we were wearing the same sort of

1461
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:41,440
business and we're, you know,
always when it journalists over all,

1462
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:42,490
he's looking for information.

1463
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:45,250
But I find that where it's almost
like a ping pong ball four as well.

1464
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:48,730
I'm looking at the phone and he's really
mad at me cause we're having dinner and

1465
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:51,290
I'm looking at the phone and then I put
it down and then he's looking at the

1466
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:52,124
front,

1467
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:56,530
keep the romance alive and
she's checking her phone.

1468
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,500
I was at a restaurant the other day and
I watched four people and none of them

1469
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:04,260
talked and they all stay on their phone
the entire time they're sitting there

1470
01:24:04,261 --> 01:24:05,094
eating together.

1471
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:07,620
Yeah. But then you look at it
and be like, oh, at least people.

1472
01:24:07,621 --> 01:24:09,620
And then five minutes later you're the
one checking your phone and then we're

1473
01:24:09,621 --> 01:24:12,800
looking to do so at the same
thing. So it's like, yeah,

1474
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:17,330
we are junkies really are.
I interviewed Ray Kurzweil

1475
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,460
for, uh, my, I have a new show
is coming out on by thank you.

1476
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:24,920
And one of the episodes were
talking about the, the convergence,

1477
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:29,480
the human to machine convergence and then
the idea that one day we will be some

1478
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:34,250
sort of a combination of
people and technology and he
was essentially making the

1479
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:39,251
argument that it's already happened and
that it's just we were slowly accepting

1480
01:24:39,381 --> 01:24:39,531
it,

1481
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:44,531
but that technology is in pacemakers and
in hearing aids and we are so attached

1482
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:49,670
to our phones that it could be argued
that if you have a certain number of

1483
01:24:49,671 --> 01:24:51,500
people that constantly
carry phones with them,

1484
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:55,560
their argument could be that you're
already a part of that. Like what?

1485
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,410
You just haven't figured out
a way to put it in your body.

1486
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:00,950
So the way before they had hearing aids,
those dudes used to carry those horns.

1487
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:04,550
They bought lean forward.
You remember those?

1488
01:25:04,551 --> 01:25:07,850
Like you'd see them in the old like three
stooges movies and shit and he's like

1489
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:10,910
a giant Buffalo Horn. What?
I would get close to you.

1490
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,970
Well, not Google glass and now you don't
even have to hold anything. Have you,

1491
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,170
have you played with
Diana? I haven't. Have you?

1492
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:20,220
Yes. Yeah, I got a chance. I have a friend
who works at Google and she let me, uh,

1493
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:24,660
that's one of those things,
yeah. That the, these to look
like that would help you.

1494
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,880
Um, he, she let me play with it. It's,
it's a very, very interesting, and it,

1495
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,530
it, it feels to me like,
uh, a step like, like, Ooh,

1496
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:37,140
I'm holding onto a model t
right here. Like, this is,

1497
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:39,490
this is what's one day going
to be a Tesla? You know,

1498
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:43,720
one day it's going to be a contact lens
and we're all going to have one or it'll

1499
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:46,950
be some sort of an implant.
So describe it to me. Well,

1500
01:25:46,951 --> 01:25:50,950
it's sort of crude because, uh,
sorry, Google, but right now, uh,

1501
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:55,500
it has to be tethered to a phone. Um,
and this is, uh, I played with, uh,

1502
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,620
it's not ready for prime time
prototype. It's a prototype and, uh,

1503
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:04,130
a Google fallen at that and,
um, you do things to it.

1504
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:07,520
Like you can ask for. Um, one of
the things I thought it was cool.

1505
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:12,320
It was like you could
Google like a ray Kurzweil,

1506
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:16,590
you know, Google Ray Kurzweil and, and
all of a sudden it shows you like a,

1507
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,600
a page like right out of Google on Ray
Kurzweil and you can like see like Google

1508
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,230
Gray Kurzweil video and it shows you all
these video options and then you could

1509
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:30,100
play them off of youtube,
but it's like projected somewhere.

1510
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,060
Are you looking at the
glass? Yes, there it is.

1511
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:35,030
That's me with one of those things that
you can see it over there to miss this

1512
01:26:35,031 --> 01:26:39,120
TV in front of you actually at
this one. No worries. Um, yeah. Um,

1513
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,560
you see it sort of floating in space,
but nobody can see it.

1514
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:45,770
Like if I have it on and I'm talking
to you, you can't see what I'm saying.

1515
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,650
I see it. But you can't see it. And it's
one of those things where if you like,

1516
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:52,820
look over here, you don't see it, but
you look here, you see it Israeli trippy.

1517
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,013
It's strange.

1518
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:58,280
But the strangest aspect is that I felt
like I was holding onto something that

1519
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:00,850
was going to be something
way greater someday.

1520
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:05,860
And this is just the first steps of this
weird sort of a transformation and to

1521
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:10,500
the uh, the, the symbiotic. So
while right, it's freaky not,

1522
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:12,350
not sure if I'm looking forward
to it and I have to say,

1523
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:15,260
I feel like I am cause I feel like,
um,

1524
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,740
I enjoy so many aspects
of technology already.

1525
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,190
I think people are afraid for the most,
we're afraid of a loss of privacy.

1526
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,520
But if we could get people
to stop being assholes,

1527
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:28,310
if everybody was like freely cool,

1528
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,940
would you care if everybody looked
at your pictures and got into email?

1529
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,540
We know that everybody is, that people
are looking at everything we do,

1530
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:38,570
but our issue is not with
people looking at our stuff.

1531
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,490
Our issues are with assholes looking
at our stuff or people using our

1532
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:46,820
information against us.
That's what we're really concerned with.

1533
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,890
And I wonder if you could
extrapolate the sort of the, this,

1534
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:52,820
this,
this,

1535
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:57,380
this thing that we're going through with
technology where this is massive curve

1536
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:01,700
and it's spinning and spinning faster
and faster until you're this exponential

1537
01:28:01,701 --> 01:28:02,534
growth.

1538
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:07,660
If it was possible to somehow another
encouraged that and human behavior as well

1539
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:13,190
as with technology.
If technology could be used by in,

1540
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,850
in, in aiding in this sort of like
connection with people in aiding,

1541
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:21,851
in emphasizing empathy and emphasizing
a comradery and friendship and love,

1542
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:27,730
if that could be like seen as like a more
worthwhile ethic and more worthwhile,

1543
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:31,040
like a state of
consciousness and behavior.

1544
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,990
It sounds like very hippie now you're
really optimistic. I think it's possible.

1545
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:40,670
I really do think that
there's repercussions that
people experience now when

1546
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:43,940
they do something terrible to someone on
like on the Internet where there's this

1547
01:28:43,941 --> 01:28:48,680
flood of Red Rock, we'll go after
them now that no one ever had before.

1548
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:52,000
You know, like did you ever see there
was a video where anonymous, uh,

1549
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:57,310
released this video of this girl who was
throwing puppies into a river and then

1550
01:28:57,441 --> 01:29:01,220
they went after, exposed her and
chase her and it was really horrific.

1551
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:04,600
But this, this, this, the,

1552
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,100
the people swarmed on this evil behavior.

1553
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,190
They saw that someone was doing something
terrible and they went after it.

1554
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:14,860
And this one example is also
the example of the, uh, the,

1555
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:18,600
what happened in Ohio with a,
the rapes were they were,

1556
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:23,220
they were trying to cover it up and that
was also exposed by hackers and then

1557
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:26,610
the massive amount of negative attention
that was given on those people.

1558
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:28,920
And it's like in time,

1559
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:33,960
would that not slowly sort
of like cure people of this,

1560
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,660
this sort of behavior
or if not cure people,

1561
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,930
make it far less likely to happen?
Yeah.

1562
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,110
The golden rule becomes a,

1563
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,540
because people know what the fuck's going
on and they're not going to tolerate

1564
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:47,610
it. If everyone knows it's
something like that happened.

1565
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:48,870
Someone did a horrible thing,

1566
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:52,290
wouldn't that lessen the
occurrences of these things?

1567
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,950
If there were repercussions,
the masses had access.

1568
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:58,110
The problem is of course,

1569
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,980
that we don't think we don't think
of that loss of privacy in that way.

1570
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:03,990
We think of a loss of
privacy and big brother.

1571
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:09,480
We think of like the NSA's is listening
to all your phone calls and copying all

1572
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:14,130
your emails and you know, it sounds very,
are well in and dangerous and scary,

1573
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:19,200
you know, and that this is a, an
erosion of privacy, but it's also,

1574
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,600
it seems inevitable.
It seems inevitable.

1575
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:24,780
And if it's not inevitable in the
sense that the government gets it,

1576
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,750
I think they just going to get,
they might get ahold of it first,

1577
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:30,720
but it seems like it's,
everybody's going to get it right.

1578
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:34,140
Like it's just,
that's where it's going.

1579
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:38,970
It's all moving to this area of
no boundaries. It's very weird.

1580
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:43,370
But if you look at how life has
changed since the Internet, you know,

1581
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:47,790
and when did we get it? Like
90 Ish, 94 ish when it really
took hold. I got an AOL,

1582
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:51,900
I think it was in 94 I was on
your side adopter. Yeah. Well, uh,

1583
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,440
I owe it to my friend Robbie. Robbie
was a computer major. Robbie Printz,

1584
01:30:55,441 --> 01:30:56,274
what's up dude?

1585
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:00,060
He was a computer major in college and
then became a standup comedian and was

1586
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:02,850
telling me like, oh, it's a great way to
write your jokes. I can have a fucking,

1587
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,030
I didn't know how to type it all out,

1588
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,890
but I remember getting
online the first day, uh,

1589
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:10,860
on AOL and they have like all
these categories you can look into.

1590
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:13,380
And I was fascinated.
I was like,

1591
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,260
this is the craziest thing I've ever
seen in my life. If you have a question,

1592
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,920
and it was so rudimentary and
crewed with a 14, four baud modem,

1593
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:24,000
but extrapolate that from 1994 take,

1594
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:29,090
take 1994 and go and look at how we are
now in 2013 I would have never guessed,

1595
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,191
first of all,

1596
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:36,600
I'd never guessed that I'd be sitting
in some room talking to some people who

1597
01:31:36,601 --> 01:31:37,730
made a documentary that I said.

1598
01:31:37,731 --> 01:31:41,730
And the only way we communicated
until today was strictly through this

1599
01:31:41,731 --> 01:31:46,230
electronic medium. No publicists,
no nothing, no one hooking this up.

1600
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:51,360
And no, like no formal
process. And then now,

1601
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:54,930
no producers, no network,
no nothing, no filtration,

1602
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:58,830
no censorship instantaneously broadcast.
And My,

1603
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:03,390
my Ustream page as right now
it's 14 million views. Yeah.

1604
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,740
So it's, it's reaches a lot
of people. It's not like,

1605
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:10,150
it's not like a couple of Weirdos are
checking it out and then it goes on iTunes

1606
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:11,800
and it at least a half a million.

1607
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:14,560
We'll download each
individual episode from the,

1608
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:17,230
either that or stitcher
or just the raw MP3.

1609
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:22,231
Like this is a crazy shift in the way
things were done just 20 years from now.

1610
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,960
And then you think about Facebook,
you think about Twitter,

1611
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:27,310
you can take a picture of something,

1612
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:30,280
you put it online and then this guy
retweets it and that guy retweets it.

1613
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,680
And if it's something, especially if
it's something big or a story big,

1614
01:32:32,681 --> 01:32:35,500
it could get retweeted by millions.
And then before you know it,

1615
01:32:35,501 --> 01:32:37,390
it becomes a new story.
And then before you know it,

1616
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,570
it becomes something that the whole
country knows about and it's almost

1617
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:43,240
instantaneous.
I look at that and I say,

1618
01:32:43,241 --> 01:32:46,030
how is it possible that that's not
going to continue to go in that same

1619
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:49,030
direction and I really do think
it's going to be beneficial.

1620
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:52,450
I think there's going to be pitfalls
for sure as we sort of figure out are

1621
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:56,470
weighed and how to navigate this
new world that we live in. You know?

1622
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:00,790
Pardon the phrase, but I ultimately
think that it's going to be beneficial.

1623
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,083
I am

1624
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:06,590
sold.
I think it's going to no dairy

1625
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,670
technology here. No, I am too.

1626
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:16,990
It's just that it's going to make our
romantic dinners even harder. Yeah,

1627
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,340
because you'd be like,
are you looking at me?

1628
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:21,190
Are you looking at your Google
contact lens? Right, right. Exactly.

1629
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:25,590
You son of a bitch, look into my,
I'm not sure what we'll have to,

1630
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:26,650
the thing is about these things.

1631
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:29,440
They seem to want to operate
on voice recognition.

1632
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:32,290
It seems to be that's what the trend
is where these things that'd be very

1633
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:34,840
difficult to hide. Yeah. You know,
you can't say, oh listen honey,

1634
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:39,160
I totally did Google, blah, blah, blah. I
totally agree with you. Google new shoes.

1635
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,270
I don't know, I guess, I mean,

1636
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,020
it'd be nice if we all took our
Google contact lenses off as we, uh,

1637
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:51,830
entered in exactly. Men To town.
Yeah. It's, I guess it's, it's,

1638
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:55,790
it's just an inevitability of the world
we live in and we just have to accept

1639
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:59,870
the fact that the times they
are changing for the better.

1640
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:04,560
Hopefully I think maybe I'm wrong.
I'm fucking wrong. Don't listen to me.

1641
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,690
What are some of the
discussions you guys cover?

1642
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,770
Uh, the third episode is sex
trafficking actually. Oh,

1643
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:15,030
that was really interesting one.
Yes. So, um, it is, you know,

1644
01:34:15,031 --> 01:34:16,140
you think about tex trafficking,

1645
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,380
you think of foreign women being
drawn into the United States. Well,

1646
01:34:19,381 --> 01:34:22,980
it's 10 times more likely that an
American is being trafficked than it is a

1647
01:34:22,981 --> 01:34:26,100
foreigner in another country right here
in American here in the United States.

1648
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:29,730
Yes. And American here in the US.
So we basically went undercover.

1649
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,650
I went undercover as a prostitute trying
to get a job at a massage parlor in

1650
01:34:34,651 --> 01:34:35,190
Houston.

1651
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:39,960
And I mean within five minutes I was
approached by this guy who tried to get me

1652
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:44,160
to be a prostitute for him. He wanted
to be, do you want it to be my pimp?

1653
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,420
And uh,

1654
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,750
meanwhile Darren was filming all of
this from across the street in the car.

1655
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,710
Oh my God.
I know you're not freaking out.

1656
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:54,520
Well you must be freaking out a little
bit. He was. And because, you know,

1657
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:55,670
technology

1658
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:57,980
has evolved so much, but we, we don't,

1659
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,350
we didn't have all the technology
we it with us at the time.

1660
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:01,520
We just had our iPhone,

1661
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:05,480
I had my iPhone on mute but
on speakerphone so he could
hear what was happening.

1662
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,710
And then I had the little glasses,
secret filming glasses and,

1663
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:13,450
but the only way he could hear me was
through my speaker phone, iPhone. And um,

1664
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,340
the whole time I was holding the
iPhone while talking to this guy.

1665
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:20,060
So it looked really strange cause I was
trying to get Darren to hear what was

1666
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:23,600
happening and the guys saying, you
know, you're, where are you from?

1667
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:27,110
You look like you're from Sweden, don't
you? You, you can get a lot of clients.

1668
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:31,280
I can make you thousands of dollars
every night and you look so clean,

1669
01:35:31,281 --> 01:35:33,080
which is a compliment that
I've never gotten before.

1670
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,310
You look really clean when you wonder why

1671
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,580
you're a clean, clean girl. Meanwhile,

1672
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:46,550
and he kept on insisting for me to go
into the car with him and Darren across

1673
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:51,080
the street couldn't see where I was at
and thought that I had gotten into the

1674
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:54,890
car with him and was sort of cursing
communion saying, is she crazy?

1675
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:57,070
What is she doing?
And uh,

1676
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:59,390
and then I hadn't gotten into
the car and he kept on saying,

1677
01:35:59,391 --> 01:36:01,910
why don't you come into the
car with me? And, uh, I just,

1678
01:36:01,911 --> 01:36:04,580
Dave excuses that I didn't
feel very comfortable yet, but,

1679
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,690
but I was really looking forward to
working with him because I wanted to know

1680
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:10,970
more information about how this,
these whole rings,

1681
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:14,390
prostitution rings work here in the United
States. And it's really, really sad.

1682
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:17,810
You know, it's these t many
times teenage girls who you know,

1683
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:20,450
are the shopping mall and they were
approached by this guy who says,

1684
01:36:20,451 --> 01:36:22,550
you're beautiful. You're the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

1685
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:25,430
I'll give you everything you need in
the world. Come with me, travel with me.

1686
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,150
You know, sometimes these girls are, for
whatever reason, they're, they, they're,

1687
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:30,950
they don't have good
relationships with their parents,

1688
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,610
where they come from a
bad background and they,

1689
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:35,930
they accept and they go travel
around America with these guys.

1690
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:38,720
And very soon after they
become, um, you know,

1691
01:36:38,721 --> 01:36:43,721
their sex slaves and they're
sold out for $200 a night.

1692
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:47,360
It's very, very sad. Somehow know the,

1693
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,870
keep them from escaping. They
keep them from escaping. Yes.

1694
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:54,970
First by just persuasion,
persuasion and,

1695
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:58,100
and being,
beating them by violence.

1696
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,300
Branded with like tattoos or
their pimps and stuff. Yeah.

1697
01:37:02,301 --> 01:37:07,020
We interviewed one girl that had a dragon
tattoo with the main panther, sorry,

1698
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:07,851
your Panther Tattoo.

1699
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:11,420
The name of her pimp and the back and
all the girls that were in her ring all

1700
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:16,190
have the same tattoo. And
you know, sometimes they are
scared to go back home. Uh,

1701
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,010
some, some of the girls get hooked
on drugs. The pimps get them hooked,

1702
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,260
hooked on drugs. And, uh,

1703
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:24,620
and a few of the girls that we interviewed
said they went to the police and told

1704
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:25,101
the police,

1705
01:37:25,101 --> 01:37:28,160
but the police didn't believe them
and they just arrested them for being

1706
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:28,781
prostitutes.

1707
01:37:28,781 --> 01:37:31,820
So they spend a night in jail and they
kept on saying they had a pimp and the

1708
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:34,370
police did nothing about it.
And as soon as they were released,

1709
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,620
the pimp was outside of the jail
waiting for them to come out,

1710
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:39,810
put them right back to work,
to work. Yeah. I mean, they're,

1711
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:44,380
they're worth a lot of
money, you know, shepherds,

1712
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:49,610
it is. It's, it was, yeah, it was, it is.

1713
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:52,610
It really is sad. And it was really
interesting. One of the, the operations,

1714
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:55,980
he sort of undercover operations
we did within a Charlotte, which is

1715
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,150
a big place for, for these,
uh, for sex trafficking. Um,

1716
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,640
because there are all these interstates,
this is North Carolina,

1717
01:38:02,641 --> 01:38:05,550
all these interstates
that meet there. And, uh,

1718
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:08,580
so we went out with this religious group
because of religious groups are out

1719
01:38:08,581 --> 01:38:12,810
there doing a lot of outreach for sex
trafficking. And we went out do this,

1720
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:16,590
this religious group that goes
out every night or many weeks,

1721
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,310
many nights a week to look for
women to try to recruit them,

1722
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:23,340
take them out of these rings
out of prostitution essentially.

1723
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:27,750
And it was me and this other woman who
works in this organization and we went

1724
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:30,720
out with, again with a secret camera
Garren again, filming from the car.

1725
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:34,520
And as we saw girl who
seemed to be sort of lost,

1726
01:38:34,521 --> 01:38:35,760
you had just gotten out of the car,

1727
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:40,350
her jeans were ripped and
we called her and, uh,

1728
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:44,340
start us, are you okay? And she said,
no, I'm not okay. A guy just, you know,

1729
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:48,600
just beat me and I'm not feeling well.
And as we're talking to this girl,

1730
01:38:48,601 --> 01:38:53,601
suddenly it's as if we had disrupted
some sort of crazy sex trafficking echo

1731
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:57,660
system and all these pimps come out
of the woodworks, out of the bushes,

1732
01:38:57,661 --> 01:39:00,870
literally in the middle of Charlotte and
the main prostitution street and come

1733
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:02,670
out and start circling us.

1734
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:06,180
And they don't know where watching because
Darren's in the car watching them and

1735
01:39:06,181 --> 01:39:09,650
start seeing these two pimps sort
of circling us to find out what we,

1736
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:13,050
why we were talking to their girl.
And uh,

1737
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:17,970
and that's when they came out and started
calling us and then we left. But it's,

1738
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:21,570
it's really interesting and it's
happening all around the United States.

1739
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:26,460
Wow.
It's so disturbing or no.

1740
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,700
Does that happen in countries
where there's prostitution?

1741
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:33,660
Where's legalized prostitution?
That's a very good question.

1742
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:35,503
I don't know.

1743
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:39,660
I don't, I don't, I, I,

1744
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:44,890
I know just from out of itself, my
head out, I wouldn't think, you know,

1745
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:47,920
obviously one of the big things,
the reason why these rings exist,

1746
01:39:47,921 --> 01:39:51,550
it's because it's illegal to be
prostitutes. So the s the prostitutes,

1747
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:53,230
you feel safer.
Um,

1748
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:57,820
if they want to sell themselves and feel
safer having somebody who looks after

1749
01:39:57,821 --> 01:40:00,310
them and who essentially at the end
of the day takes away all their money.

1750
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:02,440
So this is what we heard again and again,

1751
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:03,740
it's so,

1752
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:08,740
it's sort of the same issue that exists
in the drug world where if you make

1753
01:40:10,191 --> 01:40:11,150
things illegal,

1754
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:15,230
then you sort of create this atmosphere
where only the outlaws profit.

1755
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:20,740
And I know that in Amsterdam where
drugs are pretty much legal or at least

1756
01:40:22,371 --> 01:40:25,940
tolerated as far as, uh,
marijuana and many drugs,

1757
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:29,360
they have like a very low rate of
addiction and very low rate of AIDS.

1758
01:40:29,361 --> 01:40:30,770
They legalize prostitution.

1759
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:35,420
I would wonder how much of a,

1760
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:40,880
how much of this tour type
of thing of sex slavery is,

1761
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:43,100
is mitigated by that.

1762
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:46,210
Most places in Nevada rivalry
where it's where it's legal.

1763
01:40:46,211 --> 01:40:49,390
And I think that's the argument that a
lot of the brothel owners make is that we

1764
01:40:49,391 --> 01:40:52,270
can make it safe. We can make
it, you know, um, you know,

1765
01:40:52,271 --> 01:40:57,220
the girls that tested girls, um, are
there under their own volition and, um,

1766
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,113
you know,
they,

1767
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:01,730
they get to keep their money as
opposed to at the money taken away. Um,

1768
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:06,020
we visited some of these brothels and
I was actually really different. Yeah.

1769
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,360
Different show, but, but
uh, you know, they, they,

1770
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:13,070
they get tested for aids on a weekly
basis for all sorts of sexual transmitted

1771
01:41:13,071 --> 01:41:17,000
disease on a weekly basis. And
you know, the girls feel safe.

1772
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:19,010
At least they're in the brothel
and they're not out in the streets.

1773
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,150
Yeah. I would look. And then
it's another one of those things.

1774
01:41:22,151 --> 01:41:25,570
It's like a personal freedom issue.
Almost like that should a woman,

1775
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:29,830
if she's crazy and she loves sucks,
should she be allowed to be a prostitute?

1776
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:35,320
I wouldn't want my daughter or my age,
my friend's daughter or my friend.

1777
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,780
I wouldn't want anybody
that I know doing that.

1778
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,240
I wouldn't want anyone that
I know being a prostitute.

1779
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:43,030
But I also wouldn't want anybody I know.
Being a hired killer,

1780
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,990
I wouldn't want anybody I know, uh,
working on an oil field when it blows up,

1781
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,360
it is a lot of things I
wouldn't want my friends to do.

1782
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:52,420
But do I think that they should
be allowed to be a prostitute?

1783
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:57,420
Why is it that sex is something that
everybody wants but you can't sell it? No.

1784
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:00,540
Why is that? I mean, I'm
says, yeah, who says,

1785
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:05,590
yeah, we've met. I mean, we've met women
on all sides of this issue and you know,

1786
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:10,240
women that are high paid call girls and
stuff like that, very much. He does it,

1787
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:13,480
you know, and empower him an
issue. And uh, but you know,

1788
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:16,710
the vast majority I think of girls
out there, it'd be an exploited. Um,

1789
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:20,850
I guess it will. And, um, I think that
that's the issue and it is because, uh,

1790
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,710
because it's illegal.
Yeah. Me, it's, again,

1791
01:42:23,711 --> 01:42:26,020
it goes down to that same
issue of human nature. We're,

1792
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:30,670
we're such a strange animal. And when
you tell us that something is wrong,

1793
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:34,270
that we can't do it, then it becomes this
weird itch that people want to scratch.

1794
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,600
You know? And I, I wonder how many
people actually, I wonder if that study,

1795
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:41,410
how many people actually go to prostitutes
because it's illegal as opposed to

1796
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:45,470
legal, prostitutes and countries where
it's tolerated. I wonder if they have, uh,

1797
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:45,850
you know,

1798
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:50,800
less people side by side study between
double blind placebo prostitutes study.

1799
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:54,760
Exactly. Can we do it? Can
we get funding for that?

1800
01:42:55,450 --> 01:43:00,370
Well, it, it's, it's so, uh,
you know, it's, it's, it's so,

1801
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:04,030
it seems like a pattern, you know,
that exists. Things are illegal.

1802
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:07,390
People want to do them, bad people sell
them to the people that want to do them.

1803
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:10,960
Then you have crime. Yeah. Right.
Yeah. And then we go, there we go.

1804
01:43:10,961 --> 01:43:13,230
Do a show about him off.
Um,

1805
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:16,660
is there anything that you guys
did during this new show that,

1806
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:17,640
that really shocked too?

1807
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:20,680
Is there anything that like it really
stands out or something that you'd never

1808
01:43:20,681 --> 01:43:21,514
expected?

1809
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:27,140
Um, I mean I thought it was the,
the, the, the, the pimp moment was,

1810
01:43:27,141 --> 01:43:32,000
it was a shocking one. I've never seen
a uh, uh, a pimp like sort of uses game,

1811
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:35,310
uh, to try to pick someone up before I've
heard, I've heard about it, you know,

1812
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:38,930
secondhand stories, but to actually see,
and especially since it was my wife,

1813
01:43:38,931 --> 01:43:41,360
but that was, that was real
interesting how, how they,

1814
01:43:41,361 --> 01:43:43,620
they sorta talk about
and they try to sell it.

1815
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,500
I was,
I was really nervous going in,

1816
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,040
not only because I was filming under
cover and that is always nerve racking,

1817
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:52,100
but also because I was
trying to apply for a job

1818
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,830
just to show you sort of what,
what this is like,

1819
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:58,190
what these with this sex
trafficking underworld is like, uh,

1820
01:43:58,191 --> 01:44:00,670
not that I was going to work as
a prostitute, but just to do,

1821
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:02,840
to be able to get into
these massage parlors and,

1822
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,580
and see how easy it is to get a job.

1823
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:07,670
And I was nervous that they were
going to turn me down and say,

1824
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:08,570
I'm sorry you were to roll.

1825
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:13,580
Ah, you know, as a woman,
that's the first thing.

1826
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:18,640
So when this guy approaches me and starts
a saying that I looked very clean, um,

1827
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:23,150
and you always go, hey, I came back and
passed. Uh, yeah, I came back to the car.

1828
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:25,790
The first thing I told Daren, it's
like I still have, I still got it.

1829
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:29,990
That's hilarious. Um, what are
the subjects were covered? I mean,

1830
01:44:29,991 --> 01:44:32,930
how many episodes you guys do?
It's six episodes. Six episodes.

1831
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:36,640
We covered animal rights activism.
Um, oh, did you count couple,

1832
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:39,370
the Animal Liberation Organization animal?
Yeah,

1833
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:42,800
no, we, we, we, we didn't really
delve into that too much. What we,

1834
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:45,290
what we were looking into was, um, the,

1835
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,920
the guys that go on the cover and to like
factory farms and film like the abuse

1836
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:53,020
of animals on factory farms and then
they turn it into campaigns to, uh,

1837
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,530
try to get people to stop eating meat or
to sort of improve conditions for, um,

1838
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:01,380
for factory farm animals
and stuff like that. So, um,
there's, yeah, the, you know,

1839
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:03,630
this sort of whole,
um,

1840
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:08,150
very successful campaign by animal rights
groups in the last decade or so that

1841
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:10,850
I've used it on the cover of camera.
And so we figured,

1842
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:14,510
since we're doing a show
about on the cover of filming,
you know, like, what's a,

1843
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:15,940
let's see if we can,
you know,

1844
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,190
hook up with these guys and see
what their world is like. So we,

1845
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:21,890
we hooked up with this one guy who's
been doing it for like 10 years and he's,

1846
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:26,600
he remains anonymous. Um, it goes by,
you know, a fake name in the shell, but,

1847
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:31,400
uh, his whole life has just
been penetrating these farms
and capturing, uh, yeah.

1848
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,370
Pictures of abuse on,
on film and stuff.

1849
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:37,040
And this is a guy who's obviously, he's
Vegan, he's completely against, uh,

1850
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:41,960
the eating, uh, consumption
of animal meat. And he still,

1851
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,960
every day he goes to work when he goes
under cover and he has to kill these

1852
01:45:44,961 --> 01:45:48,740
animals. Um, just to be able to record
what's happens inside these factory farms.

1853
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:49,491
And then there's,

1854
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:53,480
the legislation is being passed right
now in several states to start to try to

1855
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:56,700
stop, to prohibit what these guys are
doing. My filming under cover. So, yeah.

1856
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:59,690
Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah.
And how's, how's that flying?

1857
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:01,370
How are they allowing people to do that?

1858
01:46:01,371 --> 01:46:04,370
Because everyone is outraged when
they see those videos. Even the media,

1859
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:07,870
they watch those videos of people.
Like I saw one of this, uh,

1860
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:10,010
abuse that was going on when these cows,

1861
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:13,970
where this guy was like hitting a cow
with a crowbar. There's so horrific.

1862
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,470
And again, another thing that's
being exposed by technology. Yeah.

1863
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,990
I believe that that video, yeah, video

1864
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:21,960
could have very well come from
the guy that we feature. Um,

1865
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,960
he's sort of the main one of the,
the biggest um,

1866
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:30,140
undercover animal rights
activists altruists voice
and blur out his face or his

1867
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:34,020
voice. But we definitely heard his, he was
in disguise actually, but he's, he has,

1868
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:34,830
he's had,

1869
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:38,160
I don't know how many name changes
throughout his life and he's been doing,

1870
01:46:38,161 --> 01:46:41,190
it's really hard course and he's sort of,

1871
01:46:41,191 --> 01:46:43,080
if you ever want to do
any undercover is filming,

1872
01:46:43,081 --> 01:46:44,160
this is the guy you need to talk to.

1873
01:46:44,161 --> 01:46:47,400
And he actually gave me some training
because a lot of all of this show is about

1874
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:51,120
undercover filming. He gave me
training into filming undercover.

1875
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:55,560
He sent me out into a parking lot and
tell me that first I had to go to that

1876
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:56,161
woman over there.

1877
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:58,920
She's a perfect stranger and you have
to ask are you have to get information

1878
01:46:58,921 --> 01:46:59,220
from her.

1879
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,670
I want to know where she lived before she
lived here and I had to go and do that

1880
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,380
and I passed that really easily.

1881
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:08,580
But then the second test that he made me
do was I had to go out there and make a

1882
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:11,760
woman sort of run away from
me because she was scared.

1883
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:14,940
And I'm not very good at that. I'm good
at getting information from people,

1884
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:15,810
but I can't,

1885
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:20,870
it's not in my nature to be mean
or too scary or intimidating and a,

1886
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,420
so I went to a starking lot
and I just started acting wild,

1887
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:28,020
crazy and not really scary.
Just crazy. Like where is water?

1888
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,550
Where can I find some water?

1889
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:34,200
People were just staring at me with this
crazy woman probably thinking that was

1890
01:47:34,201 --> 01:47:37,080
on bath salts or something.
Why were,

1891
01:47:37,081 --> 01:47:39,170
why were they trying to get you
to do all these different big,

1892
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:42,780
so this is part of the training is that
you have to be able to make people feel

1893
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:46,080
either very comfortable with you, so
they give you information that you need,

1894
01:47:46,081 --> 01:47:47,160
that you want to get for your,

1895
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:52,310
for your undercover filming
or very uncomfortable with
you so that you feel the

1896
01:47:52,351 --> 01:47:56,250
need to either leave so you can fill more
or intimidating to a point intimidated

1897
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:59,040
to the point that you will release any
information you give without actually

1898
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:01,620
resorting to violence,
obviously. So it was really,

1899
01:48:01,621 --> 01:48:04,320
it was really an interesting little
practice that we had with them.

1900
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:07,260
Wow.
And how long has this guy been doing this?

1901
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,840
10 years. Yeah. Trains other
people. He's the major,

1902
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:14,710
the main trainer of undercover filming
for animal rights activists in the United

1903
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:15,000
States.

1904
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,230
It's an incredible guy.

1905
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,050
It seems to me that that's another
one of those things where it sort of a

1906
01:48:19,051 --> 01:48:23,340
diffusion of responsibility thing when
there's so many people that want meet so

1907
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:25,560
many people that want, you know, food.

1908
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:29,610
And if he could figure out how it's
stuff them into smaller packages,

1909
01:48:29,611 --> 01:48:32,460
he can extract more ones in
Zeros. Yeah, definitely correct.

1910
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,090
And I mean that's just it. You know, these
guys that do the undercover, you know,

1911
01:48:37,091 --> 01:48:38,710
filming, they, they
obviously have an agenda,

1912
01:48:38,711 --> 01:48:40,430
which is they want people to
become Vegan, but they, they're,

1913
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:42,640
they're very sympathetic to
the workers who, you know,

1914
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:46,150
sort of toil under conditions that
can be at times be pretty stressful.

1915
01:48:46,151 --> 01:48:50,560
And that's what sort of causes
them to lash out many times. Um,

1916
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:54,030
and then the sort of agriculture
industry obviously just sees this as a,

1917
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,570
you know, a pretty big threat. You know,

1918
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:58,540
these guys coming in and filming on
the cover and their farms and you know,

1919
01:48:58,541 --> 01:49:00,760
their, their argument is that,
you know, they're capturing,

1920
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:05,260
capturing these anomalies. You know,
this doesn't happen every day. Um,

1921
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:08,560
and they're using it to sort
of amplify their issue. Right.

1922
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,480
What is his take on this though?
His take is not that. It's not,

1923
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:12,900
it's not an anomaly at all.
No,

1924
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:17,420
not, he says that in every single farm
he's ever entered and he's ever filmed

1925
01:49:17,421 --> 01:49:20,990
undercover. He is witnessed
animal abuse. Yeah.

1926
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,300
Wow.
That was a stake.

1927
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:27,340
Does he go to these organic free
range places he ever tried to like,

1928
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:31,630
you know, the, the biggest sort of target
for them with a bigger factory farm?

1929
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:36,110
Boy, would it freak people out though if
you could go to the grass fed free range

1930
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:39,200
farm and wash them abusing
cows to and be like, oh shit.

1931
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:43,220
Because that's what everybody wants to
pretend I don't have any murder on my

1932
01:49:43,221 --> 01:49:43,581
hands.

1933
01:49:43,581 --> 01:49:46,900
Why my meat is grass fed and they smile
right before they cut their throats.

1934
01:49:46,901 --> 01:49:48,040
Right.
We actually went to

1935
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,090
a slaughterhouse and now actually that
was probably a, that was possible. Yeah.

1936
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:54,030
Asked before.
It would have been one of the most,

1937
01:49:54,031 --> 01:49:56,900
probably the most surprising thing we
did is we went through a slaughter house,

1938
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:58,360
but it was that, uh,
it was that, you know,

1939
01:49:58,361 --> 01:50:01,150
as humane ranch or certified
humane ranch. And it was, you know,

1940
01:50:01,151 --> 01:50:05,800
like we start the whole process. We saw
them tagging a baby calf, like baby calf.

1941
01:50:05,801 --> 01:50:09,190
That was just bond with born within
the night, the last 24 hours. Uh,

1942
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:12,010
Mariana got to like tie the
cashier and then, you know,

1943
01:50:12,011 --> 01:50:14,350
we saw the other night of the
process where, you know, uh,

1944
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:16,030
what is it 18 months later
or something like that,

1945
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:18,580
that they're slaughtered and they'd let
us onto the float of slaughter house and

1946
01:50:18,581 --> 01:50:21,200
they said, you know, that we have an
open door policy because, you know,

1947
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:24,250
we want to be sort of transparent
as possible and you know,

1948
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:28,930
about how this food is raised and
how it's slaughtered. And, um,

1949
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:30,400
you know, if, you know,

1950
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:34,360
I've been eating meat all my life and
I've never once seen a cow slaughtered.

1951
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:36,730
And I thought it was a really
eye opening experience, you know,

1952
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:40,890
to be able to sort of consume thousands
and thousands of meals and, and you know,

1953
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:44,340
not know exactly where
you're so disconnected from
where our food comes from,

1954
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:47,950
just as you know, how do they
kill the cow? So they use a,

1955
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:51,850
what they call a knocker
and they, um, basically, um,

1956
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,570
it's a like no country for old men.
Yes, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

1957
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:59,230
And it's sort of stuns the cow. It, you
know, it doesn't kill them right away, uh,

1958
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:04,231
but it definitely sort of paralyzes them
for a moment and puts them into a deep

1959
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:09,120
unconscious state. Um, and did I hang
up that upside down and they slept it,

1960
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:10,390
throw it in, they cut the, you know,

1961
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:14,410
the auto reason and they never wake up
from that. You don't lead them to that.

1962
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,820
So it's almost instant. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. And it seems fairly humane. Yeah.

1963
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,820
It's not how it happens at every
farm though. You know, again,

1964
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:22,930
this is a humane farm.

1965
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:27,780
What's the least humane way they
do it? Well, Osha is really bad,

1966
01:51:27,781 --> 01:51:31,590
or I have no idea. Pretty sure kosher.
They just cut their neck. I think kosher,

1967
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:32,260
that's,

1968
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:36,960
there's a process that has to be
followed and I'm one of the parts of the

1969
01:51:36,961 --> 01:51:40,830
process and involves cutting
the neck. Yeah. I think they,

1970
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:44,190
I don't think you're allowed to
use that stun thing. It's kosher.

1971
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:48,690
Yeah. There are some things that are
called standard farming, uh, procedures.

1972
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,500
I think it is,
right.

1973
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:54,500
Standard standing far standard farming
procedures and a of legal common farming

1974
01:51:56,341 --> 01:51:59,400
practices. A perfectly
legal but, but you know,

1975
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:03,410
so violent to see and we watched tons
of videos of this that will filmed

1976
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:07,730
undercover. But the debate, the
DP DV, King of, uh, of chickens,

1977
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:09,900
they don't poke each other because
it gets so close to each other.

1978
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:13,170
Like the cutting of the tales of the pigs,

1979
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,230
all that is just hard to see.
The taking away of the,

1980
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:20,340
the baby pigs from their mom mother is um,
you know,

1981
01:52:20,341 --> 01:52:24,900
when you can see them caged in
these little tiny compartments.

1982
01:52:24,901 --> 01:52:29,550
All that is, you know, again, common
farming practices, but very hard to see.

1983
01:52:29,551 --> 01:52:33,360
And obviously there's a lot of interest
there for us to be disconnected for our

1984
01:52:33,361 --> 01:52:36,450
food and not see what happens. And
I'm not a vegetarian at all. Um,

1985
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:39,900
I still eat meat, but it was definitely
a very interesting piece to be a part of.

1986
01:52:39,901 --> 01:52:43,740
And, and to, to find out more
about how that all works.

1987
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:47,450
I'm not a vegetarian, I'm not
a vegetarian either. But I,

1988
01:52:47,451 --> 01:52:51,380
I certainly am not a fan of human cruelty.

1989
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:53,450
And I think that's the real issue.

1990
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:58,000
It's not whether these animals
do not live forever. And uh,

1991
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,990
the reality is that there,

1992
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,590
there's quite a few realities
when it comes to being a Vegan.

1993
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:08,390
One of them is if you do decide that no
one's going to eat meat anymore and we

1994
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:11,930
make a law and the whole world
has to let all the animals go, um,

1995
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:14,990
they're going to keep fucking and they're
going to keep making baby animals and

1996
01:53:14,991 --> 01:53:17,380
then he got a real problem because
what are you going to do then?

1997
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:18,920
Are you going to castrate the males?

1998
01:53:18,921 --> 01:53:21,950
Are you going to sterilize them in some
way or are you going to reintroduce

1999
01:53:21,951 --> 01:53:24,950
predators into the environment that you're
going to have to do something to keep

2000
01:53:24,951 --> 01:53:27,530
the population down?
And I dunno how you plan on doing that,

2001
01:53:27,531 --> 01:53:30,140
but how are you going to do
that and not put into jeopardy?

2002
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:33,950
Human beings is a reason why we
rose to the top of the food chain.

2003
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:37,100
And one of the reasons why is because
we can control our environment from

2004
01:53:37,101 --> 01:53:39,470
predators.
We can box up a city,

2005
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,660
make it nice and tall and
keep out the mountain lions.

2006
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:44,150
And we know how to do that. There's never
been a mountain lion in New York City.

2007
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,390
Santa Monica recently. See
that one every time I run. And

2008
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:54,980
I saw one very recently in Santa Barbara,

2009
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:57,170
I was driving through Monosito,

2010
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,230
you know where Monosito isn't really
beautiful neighborhood and this fucking

2011
01:54:00,231 --> 01:54:04,370
thing ran across the road. And my wife
initially said Coyote, she goes, look,

2012
01:54:04,371 --> 01:54:06,180
it's a coyote.
And I thought it was a coyote.

2013
01:54:06,181 --> 01:54:10,030
Well you know we saw in our headlights
and then I saw the tail and it's tail and

2014
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,820
I noticed that its body was like kind of
bouncy whereas coyotes are really stiff

2015
01:54:13,821 --> 01:54:17,270
and you know they have that sort of
stiff twitchy leg movement and sort of a

2016
01:54:17,271 --> 01:54:22,220
thing. Oh Shit. Some outline and I'm like
in Santa Barbara, oh man, this is crazy.

2017
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,300
It's like this is a really urban place.
There's a guy,

2018
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:29,690
some guy had national geographic right
now doing a story on like urban wildlife.

2019
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:34,870
And he recently released the pitcher
of um, uh, I think it was a bobcat.

2020
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:35,721
I don't think it was a mountain lion,

2021
01:54:35,721 --> 01:54:39,380
but it was a bobcat and it's like caught
by one of those trigger cams and it's

2022
01:54:39,381 --> 01:54:40,220
like at night.

2023
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:44,150
And the whole background of downtown La
is it basically taken by the observatory

2024
01:54:44,151 --> 01:54:47,570
where either lots of animals
and the children running around.

2025
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:53,480
But the Griffith Observatory is
hardly La. It's pretty rural. Yeah.

2026
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:57,350
That's a small area that's rural,
but they have coyotes biting people there.

2027
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:01,730
Like some homeless person went to sleep
there and woke up because it got bit by

2028
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:06,610
a coyote. Coyote came around and tested
them just to see if they could eat. Yeah.

2029
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:09,380
Is that good? Well the guy might
have been really fucked up, you know,

2030
01:55:09,381 --> 01:55:14,350
who knows how drunk or high or messed
up because he's in our backyard

2031
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:17,770
constantly. Oh yeah.
Watch a caddie, Nassau,

2032
01:55:17,771 --> 01:55:22,280
all they are they still your car? Very
few people in la let their cats out. Well,

2033
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:24,650
cause I mean you see all the missing
signs in the neighborhoods or anything.

2034
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:26,960
It's like, sorry. You
know what happens. Yeah.

2035
01:55:26,961 --> 01:55:29,030
I live in a really rural
place and there's a,

2036
01:55:29,031 --> 01:55:32,450
there was a mountain lion siting in my
neighborhood about a year ago and coyotes

2037
01:55:32,451 --> 01:55:33,350
are there every day,

2038
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:38,150
sea hawks and we saw cro in our yard
and all these other crows were squawking

2039
01:55:38,151 --> 01:55:40,580
and we're trying to figure out
what's going on in the crow was a,

2040
01:55:40,581 --> 01:55:41,630
there's something wrong with it.

2041
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:45,450
Obviously it was like kind of hobbling
and hopping around in this branch,

2042
01:55:45,451 --> 01:55:49,500
but he couldn't fly away. So we went
inside and then we came out like,

2043
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:49,831
I don't know,

2044
01:55:49,831 --> 01:55:53,520
a couple hours later and there was
just feathers and guts everywhere.

2045
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:57,390
All it had to do was people had to get
away for a little bit and then some

2046
01:55:57,391 --> 01:56:01,020
Predator came swooping in. It was
probably a raptor. Okay. Or you know,

2047
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:05,340
some sort of, yeah. Hawk hawks are
everywhere around where I live, man,

2048
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:06,930
they're big too,
man.

2049
01:56:06,931 --> 01:56:10,830
A big creepy murderers just fly
flying murders from the sky,

2050
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:14,910
swooped in and Jack this crow. I mean,
they don't eat berries. Original drones.

2051
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:18,450
Yeah,
hawks hawks don't steal tomatoes.

2052
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:24,690
They didn't have jack moving things and
anything sick. I'll take care of this.

2053
01:56:24,691 --> 01:56:29,520
I got it. They like the cleanup crew
for the wounded animals. So, you know,

2054
01:56:29,521 --> 01:56:32,700
animals eat other animals and it's
another problem I would say is that okay?

2055
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:36,720
Is it much more humane
for a deer to get eaten?

2056
01:56:36,721 --> 01:56:41,200
Slowly buy a pack of wolves. There needs
to get shot by a hunter. You know, it, it,

2057
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:43,980
I don't like the idea of veganism,

2058
01:56:43,981 --> 01:56:46,600
but I don't like the idea
of animal cruelty either.

2059
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:51,630
They think that's what most people lands.
Right. I've been so, um, but you know,

2060
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:54,360
like the, the animal rights
groups that, you know, they,

2061
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:59,420
they I think have done an effective job
of sort of getting people like us who

2062
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:03,580
eat meat and uh, thinking about it.
Yeah. Thinking about it. Yes. You know,

2063
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:06,630
it is hard to watch people beating a
cow or something like that and it should

2064
01:57:06,631 --> 01:57:09,850
never exist. And it's, again, it goes
back to like the same thing. It's,

2065
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,480
it's a human issue. It's about
humanity. It's about what,

2066
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:16,170
what is causing a person to do something
like that? Well, it's a mental illness.

2067
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:20,670
It's a sickness hitting a cow with
a crow bar. What is happening?

2068
01:57:20,671 --> 01:57:23,160
How is that possible? Yeah, I
couldn't do it. You couldn't do it.

2069
01:57:23,161 --> 01:57:24,000
Why is it happening?

2070
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:28,360
Yeah, so I a, when we interviewed the
woman who runs this humane farm, I,

2071
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:30,520
one of the questions I had
was why do you treat that?

2072
01:57:30,521 --> 01:57:33,730
Because they really put a lot of effort
into treating these cows well while

2073
01:57:33,731 --> 01:57:36,910
they're alive. Why? Why do you put such
emphasis and treating well the cows,

2074
01:57:36,911 --> 01:57:38,860
if you know they're going
to die, if you, you know,

2075
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,090
the farm's going to kill them anyway.

2076
01:57:40,091 --> 01:57:43,480
And she said exactly because we are
going to kill them and use them for meat.

2077
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:46,780
They're going to be our food.
Exactly. Because of that we, it is,

2078
01:57:47,230 --> 01:57:50,980
it is mandatory for us to treat them well.

2079
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,270
And I really like that philosophy.

2080
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,100
I think that's a beautiful philosophy.
I watched a,

2081
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:59,760
an episode of Anthony Bourdain's
old show, no reservations. And the,

2082
01:57:59,761 --> 01:58:02,770
one of the things, it was about
this place in New York that is, um,

2083
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,010
they are not just a restaurant there,

2084
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:08,640
a restaurant and they have their own
butcher shop and they also have their own

2085
01:58:08,641 --> 01:58:13,590
farm. So they grow all of their food.
I guess it was Maine. They, yes. Okay.

2086
01:58:13,591 --> 01:58:16,440
I'm confusing two different things.
One of them was a,

2087
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:21,470
a butcher shop that's also a farm and
they grow their own food and they kill

2088
01:58:21,781 --> 01:58:25,260
their own animals and then sell the meat.
So you know, you're getting it humanely.

2089
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:28,470
And the other one was a
farm in Maine where they,

2090
01:58:28,471 --> 01:58:33,030
they locally source everything from
their own farm, all their food, all,

2091
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:35,040
all the vegetables,
all the animals.

2092
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:38,070
And they were showing all the different
pigs they raise and they're petting the

2093
01:58:38,071 --> 01:58:40,770
pigs and you know, talking about the
different parts that are going to be,

2094
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:43,810
and it's Kinda weird because you're like,

2095
01:58:43,811 --> 01:58:47,770
well that's your pet in that thing and
they're going to kill it. But is it,

2096
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,320
is it better that way?
Yeah, it's better that way.

2097
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:54,710
It'd be nice to him until he decided
to be really mean, you know? Yeah.

2098
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:55,953
I mean,

2099
01:58:56,710 --> 01:59:01,710
it's probably one of those things that
as we developed synthetic meat, oh man.

2100
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:04,960
Yeah, we're probably going to move
away. Well, they're really close.

2101
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:09,940
Then some guy in like London
or England has done it Rad.

2102
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:10,960
He's figured out how to do it.

2103
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:13,270
He's made the first hamburger or
something like that. I don't know.

2104
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:15,460
I don't know where they have,
but I do know that they're,

2105
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:20,640
they're capable of doing things now where
they can reproduce cells and they can

2106
01:59:21,611 --> 01:59:24,320
reproduce certain types
of tissue. Like, um,

2107
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:28,180
Kurzweil was telling me about this
woman who had something wrong with her

2108
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:31,420
esophagus.
So they built an Esophagus,

2109
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:36,400
a out of biodegradable material,
used skin cell stem cells,

2110
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:39,630
and you use the biodegradable
material as a scaffolding.

2111
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:44,650
Stem cells built a brand new
esophagus and they operate on her,

2112
01:59:44,861 --> 01:59:48,760
installed the new one, and now she's
fine, you know? And that's like,

2113
01:59:48,761 --> 01:59:50,530
they're making parts for humans.

2114
01:59:50,531 --> 01:59:54,340
So that just seems to make sense that
they're going to make meat. Like,

2115
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:59,640
and I don't know how to feel about that.
Yeah.

2116
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:04,550
Maybe vegans will eat like a fake stick.
Yeah. Maybe they're down with that. Yeah.

2117
02:00:04,551 --> 02:00:08,830
It really is delicious and Karma free.
Nice Karma free cheeseburger.

2118
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:14,590
That'd be awesome. Yeah. I think
that's inevitable. It's common. I mean,

2119
02:00:14,591 --> 02:00:17,470
they're going to there you're
talking about doing it with humans.

2120
02:00:17,471 --> 02:00:21,490
They're talking about developing
parts that are completely artificial,

2121
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:25,780
completely artificial cells that
interact with yourselves with no immune

2122
02:00:25,781 --> 02:00:26,850
response.
There are,

2123
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:30,670
they're talking about these things
being an inevitability of the future.

2124
02:00:30,671 --> 02:00:35,430
That's not science fiction fact. It's
all based on proven research and, and uh,

2125
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:40,070
there's proof of concepts already
available and it just seems to make sense.

2126
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:41,080
They're going to have a fake chicken,

2127
02:00:41,081 --> 02:00:44,560
a fake headless chicken running
around just waiting for you to eat it.

2128
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:47,920
Breasts and legs doesn't
know what's going on.

2129
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,560
That literally has no brain.
It's not that they're stupid.

2130
02:00:50,561 --> 02:00:55,000
They have zero brains because every
chicken stupid. But this would be like,

2131
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:57,610
there's nothing going on. You don't
have to worry at all it. Right.

2132
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,580
Pick it up and kill it. You
know what I mean? Killing it.

2133
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:04,330
I know a lot of other lists. It's like
all the million things that need to do.

2134
02:01:04,331 --> 02:01:06,550
We need, yeah, we've actually
had to kill a chicken.

2135
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:12,190
But in Colombia that was, it's,
it's not a pretty process taking,

2136
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:15,220
taking the feathers off the chicken.
And it seems to be the, the, the,

2137
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:20,050
the real thing about killing an animal
and eating an animal is the fact that

2138
02:01:20,051 --> 02:01:24,040
this, it's not just that it's alive
because vegetables are alive as well.

2139
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:28,690
It's the fact that it's alive
and it can move and feel pain.

2140
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:33,580
But if you could take away the whole
field pain part and they can't think and

2141
02:01:33,581 --> 02:01:37,160
just headless chickens
like you gotta you know,

2142
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:42,170
you have some new sort of a way to
make the heartbeat without a brain just

2143
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:45,830
really fucking stupid headless checkins
he can still wouldn't go for it cause

2144
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:47,730
they don't eat eggs.
And uh,

2145
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:51,440
I have chickens and the chickens lay an
egg every day and you can eat the eggs

2146
02:01:51,441 --> 02:01:54,150
and no one gets hurt. But the deacons
are still not down with that? No,

2147
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:54,710
they're not.

2148
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:59,420
But that's how far removed we are from
the farm is that I only found out that

2149
02:01:59,421 --> 02:02:04,340
chickens lay an egg a day like two years
ago. Yeah, it's true. I had no idea.

2150
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:04,611
Oh,

2151
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:09,611
I only found out that a an
egg doesn't become a chicken.

2152
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:13,280
I thought that an egg
became a chicken and the,

2153
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:15,590
oh you eat them before it happens.
But no,

2154
02:02:15,591 --> 02:02:19,460
it's a hen lays an egg whether
the roosters involved or not.

2155
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:24,080
But if the roosters in the house then
the chicken can get pregnant and then the

2156
02:02:24,081 --> 02:02:28,340
egg can become a check. But if there's
no rooster, I didn't know that. See,

2157
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,780
most people don't know that isn't it?

2158
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:34,370
It's amazing how removed we are
from the whole process of food.

2159
02:02:34,371 --> 02:02:38,480
So there's no life there. No Life at all.
Zero, zero life, zero thread of life.

2160
02:02:38,481 --> 02:02:39,890
Impossible to make life.

2161
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:44,480
And in fact if you don't eat the egg
then the chickens will probably eat their

2162
02:02:44,481 --> 02:02:48,710
own eggs and go crazy and
I'll come fucking cannibals
or something. I don't know.

2163
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,090
And they do eat their own eggs.

2164
02:02:50,091 --> 02:02:52,430
If you don't leave them in
too long for vegans though,

2165
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:56,290
the problem is not that they are eating
because they would be life in Yag.

2166
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,970
It's because you're eating an egg that
comes from a chicken that is probably

2167
02:02:58,971 --> 02:03:02,330
being abused in order to
produce these days. Sure. I
think the thinking behind it,

2168
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:06,230
but you could have it the way I have
it where my, my chickens live on a,

2169
02:03:06,231 --> 02:03:10,850
on a full day of a full acre lawn and
they go inside the chicken coop at night,

2170
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:13,450
which is huge and it's,
we set it up like,

2171
02:03:13,451 --> 02:03:17,810
cause we wanted to make it as nice as
possible. Super humane, really big place.

2172
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:22,340
Like the chicken coop itself is bigger
than this studio where I have 14 chickens

2173
02:03:22,341 --> 02:03:25,610
and they just go in whenever they want
at night and we shut the door and lock it

2174
02:03:25,611 --> 02:03:28,750
down. So you get 14 eggs a
day. What do you do with them?

2175
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:32,720
I eat them all 14 delicious. I don't need
them all. I mean hell the whole family.

2176
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:35,320
But I give them to friends
if they want him to. Yeah,

2177
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:38,330
just they just started laying
the eggs recently. But yeah,

2178
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:40,910
we had people over this weekend
and we gave him some fresh eggs.

2179
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:44,390
It tastes delicious too. Yeah, cause
we give the chickens like vegetables,

2180
02:03:44,391 --> 02:03:45,330
like we buy vegetables,

2181
02:03:45,331 --> 02:03:49,880
like say I make Kale shakes pretty much
every morning and it's cucumbers and

2182
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:52,070
Kale and celery and fruit
and stuff like that.

2183
02:03:52,230 --> 02:03:55,090
So a lot of times you have like leftover
stuff left over Kale and leftover.

2184
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:58,490
And we feed them that and then we feed
them chicken feed and they wander around

2185
02:03:58,491 --> 02:04:02,060
the lawn and they basically eat anything
they find that tried to heat your house.

2186
02:04:02,061 --> 02:04:05,210
They're stupid. Stupidest Shit. Peck
at your house, you're like, hmm,

2187
02:04:05,211 --> 02:04:08,540
maybe this house is edible.
They did is checking everything for food,

2188
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:11,240
but they've become like our
pets. You know, they're not,

2189
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,480
they're not chickens that we're eating,
we're just getting eggs out of him.

2190
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:17,090
But it's amazing how
much you get out of them.

2191
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:21,560
They give you food and that food is based
entirely on food that you give them.

2192
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,390
So it's just this process.

2193
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:26,540
It's like a natural healthy
cycle and nobody gets hurt.

2194
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:29,540
They're happy when they see ya, you
know, there's no cruelty involved.

2195
02:04:29,541 --> 02:04:33,080
And so for me it's like I just
started doing this really recently.

2196
02:04:33,081 --> 02:04:37,350
We started growing her own vegetables
and raising her own chickens and not as

2197
02:04:37,351 --> 02:04:41,040
like a doomsday prepper sort of a thing.
But just as like,

2198
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:43,890
let's see what this is like. You
know, my wife's super got into it,

2199
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:45,420
so it's been really fun.
It's been kind of cool.

2200
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:50,100
What vegetables you grow all sorts
of. Um, we grow a hot peppers,

2201
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:53,670
we grow cucumbers who go tomatoes,
we grow squash,

2202
02:04:53,671 --> 02:04:57,030
we grow lots of different things
that you can eat kale. Uh,

2203
02:04:57,031 --> 02:05:00,730
we haven't started doing that yet, but
that's the next step. You know, Kale, I'm,

2204
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:00,890
we're,

2205
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:05,790
we're trying to move our little a garden
to a new spot and we have this new area

2206
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:09,920
we're going to set up. It gives a lot of
sunlight and the idea is to just, uh, the,

2207
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:12,870
the best idea I think would
be completely self sustaining.

2208
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:15,720
We're going to go solar power too. But
one of the things we found out is like,

2209
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:19,410
solar doesn't help you if the power
goes out. You still need a generator.

2210
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:24,600
And I was like, that's stupid. That's
so dumb. Like how is that possible?

2211
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,640
Like the guy explained to me
at the soccer boys go, I go,

2212
02:05:26,641 --> 02:05:28,560
so if the power goes out
we're still out because no,

2213
02:05:28,561 --> 02:05:32,580
actually you have to have a generator. And
I go, what? What are you talking about?

2214
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:34,680
What does that mean?
It doesn't make any sense.

2215
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:39,240
Like somehow or another there's gotta
be a way to have a completely standalone

2216
02:05:39,241 --> 02:05:43,100
system, but uh, it's, it's not that
easy. I think you have to have,

2217
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:47,860
cause your house is still connected
to the grid is that maybe could be,

2218
02:05:48,090 --> 02:05:50,790
I mean it maybe be completely
removed from the grid maybe.

2219
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:56,880
Oh yeah. I would think that would be
the smartest thing anybody could do. No,

2220
02:05:56,881 --> 02:05:58,980
it's not that I'm a doomsday prepper.
It's at like,

2221
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:03,240
I think to be self sustainable would
be ultimately what I want to do.

2222
02:06:03,241 --> 02:06:04,560
These are my beginning steps.

2223
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:08,730
Ultimately what I want to do is get a
bunch of friends involved and buy piece of

2224
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:13,410
land, build houses and have a farm on it.
Not a cult. Just get like a few couples.

2225
02:06:13,411 --> 02:06:14,191
Sounds a little culty,

2226
02:06:14,191 --> 02:06:17,640
a little call culty everything I do
is a little culty but I, I, I do,

2227
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:22,260
it's a fine dance but my idea is to um,
have a,

2228
02:06:22,290 --> 02:06:24,450
a large plot of land,
you know,

2229
02:06:24,451 --> 02:06:29,451
like several hundred acres with a few
families and everyone sort of have,

2230
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:30,540
uh,

2231
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:35,540
this big space that's their own and we
share it and like a community farm and

2232
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:38,240
that everyone gets their food
from there that way. See,

2233
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:41,880
what I'm weird things about neighborhoods
is that you don't pick them,

2234
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:45,570
you sort of just, you pick where your
neighborhood is. Of course, if you can,

2235
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,750
if you have that freedom but you don't
really pick your neighbors if they're

2236
02:06:48,751 --> 02:06:52,320
there when you, we, we liked this house.
We like, you know, Manhattan beach,

2237
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:53,154
let's move in.

2238
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:55,770
And then you're moving into a bench around
a bunch of people that you don't even

2239
02:06:55,771 --> 02:06:59,570
know. Whereas the whole idea
of community and culture and,

2240
02:06:59,571 --> 02:07:03,030
and tribes used to be that we
lived near all of our loved ones.

2241
02:07:03,031 --> 02:07:05,400
We had them all together.
We don't do that anymore.

2242
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:08,370
It's kind of rare
playing the lottery game.

2243
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:11,460
Get a day as you often
do if you won the load.

2244
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:16,430
And that was definitely on the top
of my list. I'd buy a big house,

2245
02:07:16,431 --> 02:07:19,380
but that I could be lots of houses around
and I could move all the people I love

2246
02:07:19,381 --> 02:07:23,970
around me, my friends and family
and yeah. Well I've actually,

2247
02:07:23,971 --> 02:07:25,910
we've actually sat down,
uh,

2248
02:07:25,950 --> 02:07:28,650
our family sat down with a couple of
other families that we really like and we

2249
02:07:28,651 --> 02:07:31,620
actually started talking
about doing that and uh,

2250
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:35,340
where we've decided to make
some, uh, have some meetings,

2251
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:40,380
have some dinners where we meet and
discuss the idea and look at like various

2252
02:07:40,721 --> 02:07:45,190
locations whether or not be feasible with
all the people that they all have sort

2253
02:07:45,191 --> 02:07:46,930
of alternative entertainment type jobs,

2254
02:07:46,931 --> 02:07:48,670
like comedians and writers
and stuff like that.

2255
02:07:48,671 --> 02:07:51,550
And so we're all just sitting there like
what an awesome community that would be

2256
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:56,020
into til the live in a place where you're
in a town where there's a, you know,

2257
02:07:56,021 --> 02:07:59,500
like a, a good town, like a healthy
place with city that's close by,

2258
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:04,210
but set up an establishment where you
could grow your own food so you don't have

2259
02:08:04,211 --> 02:08:09,000
to worry like is this organic or these
grass raised is this farm, you know,

2260
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:13,090
farm healthy and clean. It's your own
farm and it wouldn't be hard to do.

2261
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:17,440
And if you think about how much
money you spend on food every year,

2262
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:22,840
it seems to me that if you have quite a
few people hiring some really competent,

2263
02:08:22,870 --> 02:08:25,300
nice people to run a farm for you,

2264
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:28,960
while people would appreciate a good
job where they work for nice people and

2265
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:32,530
everybody's ethical about
the whole situation and how
everything's done and fair

2266
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:35,610
and you set up a nice little
community farm. I said,

2267
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:39,220
I don't think that that's impossible.
That doesn't seem like a a big dream.

2268
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:42,310
That seems like something that's
entirely doable, you know,

2269
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:47,050
and a new reality show. Yeah,
that's where it all goes.

2270
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:54,810
Well, it seems like you'd get to need
some money for sure. You need it.

2271
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:56,680
Need some money to set up almost anything,

2272
02:08:56,681 --> 02:09:00,820
but the real problem would be you'd
have to planning and you know,

2273
02:09:00,821 --> 02:09:04,600
you'd have to get permits to build houses
and or you'd have to buy a bunch of

2274
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:05,351
houses together,

2275
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:08,590
which is he even more ridiculous and
how are you going to pull that off?

2276
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:09,453
That would be hard,

2277
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:14,880
but I just think that ultimately that
seems like it would be the ideal situation

2278
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:17,950
to get all of your food that
way. Not all of it. I mean,

2279
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:20,320
he's still go to the supermarket
and buy mayonnaise and some shit.

2280
02:09:20,321 --> 02:09:22,420
You don't want to sit
around making yourself,

2281
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:27,430
but how beautiful would it be to not
worry like, okay, the power goes out.

2282
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:32,140
Well guess what? We have power. Okay. The
supermarkets are empty. We have a farm.

2283
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:34,360
We get all of our food
from this with this area.

2284
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:39,520
Then you just have to worry about the
other people. Yeah, you shit hits the fan.

2285
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:45,330
Chickens. Crops took this to a doomsday
place. Again, that's what I do.

2286
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:50,860
Try to stay positive, um,
guns and six episodes. So any,

2287
02:09:50,861 --> 02:09:52,570
any other interesting topics.

2288
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:56,610
And we did one about homeless youth where
we actually spent a lot of time with a

2289
02:09:56,650 --> 02:09:58,960
young people who are homeless
out here in Los Angeles.

2290
02:09:58,961 --> 02:10:03,480
And we spent a couple of nights sleeping
under the bridge. Oh. Oh my God,

2291
02:10:03,490 --> 02:10:06,040
you did? Yeah, we did
both of you together.

2292
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,430
You live in La,
you know,

2293
02:10:08,450 --> 02:10:13,450
it's like driving downtown or Hollywood
and you see all these homeless kids and

2294
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:17,070
sometimes adults in. Did you guys go
to skid row? So we went to skid row.

2295
02:10:17,071 --> 02:10:19,180
It starts off in skid row and um,
you know,

2296
02:10:19,181 --> 02:10:22,440
we explained that place
for people who don't know.

2297
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:26,850
Good row is the largest homeless
community in the nation. That's, I mean,

2298
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:31,560
uh, thousands and thousands of homeless
people. Yeah, it is. I mean, it's, uh,

2299
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:33,510
sleeping on the streets
in tents and know they've,

2300
02:10:33,570 --> 02:10:38,420
they've tried various times to clean
it up. Um, but, um, it's, you know,

2301
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:40,630
there's a lot of issues there. It
was like, where are you going to,

2302
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:43,030
where are you going, how's them?
Um, and there's a lot of, um,

2303
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:45,110
housing and there is a lot
of shelters down there,

2304
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:49,220
but not enough to sort of meet the
demand of how many homeless people were

2305
02:10:49,221 --> 02:10:53,750
actually down there. And so if you go down
there, um, day or night and you'll see,

2306
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:58,160
you know, uh, hundreds if not thousands
of people walking the streets, um,

2307
02:10:58,670 --> 02:11:03,250
you know, with their carts and
it's, it's just, um, another, uh,

2308
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:06,020
side of the city that, you know, you, you,

2309
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:09,320
it's actually right next to the archduke
shut shutdowns downtown. And so it's,

2310
02:11:09,321 --> 02:11:10,810
you know, it's sort of, you, you, you,

2311
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:13,610
you've run across it here and
there if you're living in la.

2312
02:11:13,611 --> 02:11:17,920
But it's definitely a and eye open
experience and walk down there because

2313
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:22,250
there's a whole ecosystem
down there that, um, sort of,

2314
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:26,780
uh, caters to not cater is probably
not the right word, but you know,

2315
02:11:26,781 --> 02:11:31,580
like that is a s supports,
um, the homeless down there,

2316
02:11:31,810 --> 02:11:34,040
um, from, uh, you know,

2317
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:39,380
clinics and shelters and stuff like that
too, obviously drug the others and uh,

2318
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:42,990
and gangs that sort of run the
territory down there because, um,

2319
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,590
as the activist who we fall
down there told us, you know,

2320
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:49,280
it's not just the homeless community,
it's the,

2321
02:11:49,281 --> 02:11:52,670
probably the largest concentration of
addicts in the, in the country as well.

2322
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:54,770
Because most people,
obviously if you're living on the streets,

2323
02:11:54,771 --> 02:11:57,550
you're either dealing with
the mental health issue or a,

2324
02:11:57,650 --> 02:12:02,210
some sort of addiction or
both. Um, so, um, yeah,

2325
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:04,490
we've,
that was crazy

2326
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:07,900
was, it was fairly eyeopening I'm
sure, to see the population, right?

2327
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:10,370
It was, and it was, it's the, the,

2328
02:12:10,371 --> 02:12:14,020
the idea is that if you are sort
of above 35 and you're homeless,

2329
02:12:14,021 --> 02:12:17,680
you're on skid row. If you're under 35
and you're homeless here in Hollywood,

2330
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:20,950
and that's even more sort of surprising
because you think of Hollywood,

2331
02:12:20,951 --> 02:12:22,240
you think of the walk of fame,
right?

2332
02:12:22,241 --> 02:12:26,620
You think of all the stars and celebrities
and then you know for us who live

2333
02:12:26,621 --> 02:12:29,980
here in La and we drive by the Hollywood
every day and you see all those

2334
02:12:29,981 --> 02:12:32,620
homeless kids every day and you know
that they're sleeping out on the streets

2335
02:12:32,621 --> 02:12:32,980
and this,

2336
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:37,060
again because of mental health issues
or addiction or just because they come

2337
02:12:37,061 --> 02:12:40,660
from broke, broke up, broke down
families and have nowhere to sleep,

2338
02:12:40,661 --> 02:12:42,760
which was some of the cases
of the people that we filmed.

2339
02:12:43,210 --> 02:12:46,480
And so we decided it was sort of important
if we weren't really going to dive

2340
02:12:46,481 --> 02:12:49,450
deeper and deeper into this issue
to spend the night with them,

2341
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,300
two of the people that we were filming,

2342
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:55,570
I would have faked it. I did it just like
that dude. The what? Not Survivor man.

2343
02:12:55,571 --> 02:12:57,880
Who's real les Stroud.
Who's the other guy?

2344
02:12:58,150 --> 02:13:02,680
The fake guy who's English dude?
Uh, some bastard. Their bedroom.

2345
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:05,140
Yeah.
He sleeps in hotels.

2346
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:12,010
Oh yes he does. He got busted. No Way. Yes
he did. Yes. What I like is that when you,

2347
02:13:12,630 --> 02:13:15,850
I can't really describe it. Go ahead. I
like that. It's all you're always like,

2348
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:19,210
and now I'm here in the middle of nowhere.
You can't see I'm,

2349
02:13:19,211 --> 02:13:22,630
you know that there's like a big camera
and a camera guy and everything. Filming.

2350
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:24,730
Well that's one of the beautiful
things about Les Stroud.

2351
02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:28,030
There's nothing but him.
He brings cameras and a backpack.

2352
02:13:28,031 --> 02:13:29,960
He does everything himself.
He sets up the cameras.

2353
02:13:29,961 --> 02:13:34,530
He even has videos of him up the cameras
so you could see him when he walks off.

2354
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,810
Like he would walk a hundred
yards in the distance of films.

2355
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:40,960
He has to go back and get the camera and
then take it and put it a hundred years.

2356
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:44,070
[inaudible] I'm a hundred yards forward
and have him walking towards it.

2357
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:48,390
Like he sets everything up from south.
It's very time consuming and survivor man,

2358
02:13:48,391 --> 02:13:52,980
survivor man is the real one. The the, the
other one bear whatever the fuck it is.

2359
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:55,470
It's Horesh wild total horse shit.

2360
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,670
And the reason why that show was created
was because Les Stroud wouldn't play

2361
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:03,210
ball with producers and set up fake shots.
They wanted to like,

2362
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:06,960
oh less stumbled upon this dead
animal. This is how you, you know,

2363
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:10,740
fix this dead animal so you could eat it.
This is how you meet or cut it up.

2364
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:13,980
Bear Grylls does all that stuff. So
he's like, you know, he would do it.

2365
02:14:13,981 --> 02:14:18,360
He would fudge shit and Les Stroud. So
the only way to do this is to do it real.

2366
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:22,440
Yeah. So he like will starve. He'll be
out there for five days with no food,

2367
02:14:22,770 --> 02:14:23,101
you know,

2368
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:25,940
and really freaking out and not knowing
whether or not he's going to get out of

2369
02:14:25,950 --> 02:14:29,460
there and trying to figure out how to
alert the crew and how to start a fire

2370
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:32,640
when it's raining out. Like all that
stuff is real. When you watch that show,

2371
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:36,660
he deals 100% of it, which
is, it's so fascinating.

2372
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:40,450
When people found out about
the other show, the bear
Grylls show, they were like,

2373
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:44,730
get out. Fuck that Guy Sleeps in tents.
No, come on man. He's out there for real.

2374
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:49,560
They'll hotels. Really? He
really is in a four seasons.

2375
02:14:49,930 --> 02:14:54,060
Oh Man. Like he's pretending he's covered
in mud to keep the flies off your face.

2376
02:14:54,061 --> 02:14:58,290
You got a smile on your face in
mud. No mud dude. He in a mud mask.

2377
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:01,560
He's getting a feet massage.
Pretending he's out there.

2378
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:07,080
It's fake as fuck. It's
totally fake. You know,

2379
02:15:07,081 --> 02:15:11,240
like this one found like a dead sheep
and he like turned the, she like,

2380
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:16,050
like the clothing out of it.
That's probably fake too.
Um, you know, I don't know.

2381
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:17,940
I would assume he's not
taking his own pen. I mean,

2382
02:15:17,941 --> 02:15:21,190
if you're going to fake everything else,
why wouldn't you fake drink home?

2383
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:25,800
I hate to admit this, drinking my own
piss. I'm drinking my own piss before.

2384
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:28,020
Well because someone told me that,
um,

2385
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:32,040
there's a thing called in
therapy and he said that why?

2386
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:35,460
Like this is a person who has covered
investigative journalism for her whole

2387
02:15:35,461 --> 02:15:38,600
life. She's seen horrific
things. She's been to the,

2388
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:40,860
the oxycontin center of the world.
I would tell her,

2389
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:45,260
check my own people just immediately like,
what is wrong with you?

2390
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:46,693
Um,

2391
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:51,730
can you leave now several athletes and
have a thought that it's a good thing to

2392
02:15:51,991 --> 02:15:55,800
do that somehow or another
you get vitamins that pass
through your body and then

2393
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:59,700
you recycle them in your urine and
that your urine is sterile and it's not

2394
02:15:59,701 --> 02:16:02,220
nothing to worry about.
And it's actually antibodies and you're,

2395
02:16:02,221 --> 02:16:06,060
it's very controversial. But I had
done it to see if there's anything to,

2396
02:16:06,061 --> 02:16:07,800
like when I was sick,
I took a drink,

2397
02:16:07,801 --> 02:16:12,330
my own p for times and I
don't know whether it room
temperature right out of the

2398
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:16,480
hatch, right into a cop and
down the old pipe. It's more,

2399
02:16:16,890 --> 02:16:18,150
I don't recommend it.
First of all,

2400
02:16:18,151 --> 02:16:19,950
it was really clear and I
don't do it all the time.

2401
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:22,170
I've done it a few
times once on the radio.

2402
02:16:22,570 --> 02:16:25,030
I'm just cause I wanted to it
cause I'm not squeamish. Right.

2403
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:27,270
I hosted fear factor for six years.
Right.

2404
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:30,940
I know what's bad and what's not drinking
your own urine. Even if it's terrible.

2405
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:34,300
It's no big deal compared to some
of the shit that I've seen face.

2406
02:16:34,301 --> 02:16:38,710
I've seen face to face. People eat
horrific things and not just once.

2407
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,970
I've seen it hundreds of times.
So it's like for me drinking my own pee.

2408
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:47,950
Oh God. Animal Dicks, urine
24 ounces of donkey come.

2409
02:16:47,951 --> 02:16:52,440
I saw people drank donkey semen. That was
what got the show canceled actually. Um,

2410
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:53,590
they had a drink,
donkey,

2411
02:16:53,591 --> 02:16:58,580
semen and the TMC got ahold
of the video and got unlocked.

2412
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:03,640
It got online before the show aired and
then a NBC pulled the episode first and

2413
02:17:03,641 --> 02:17:06,970
then cancel the whole
show. That was, yeah,

2414
02:17:06,971 --> 02:17:10,870
that was the second run
season. A fear factor. The
video's online. Can we take it?

2415
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:15,970
Yeah, exactly. Well that's the thing is
that that was approved by the network.

2416
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:19,270
That's the most fascinating aspect of it.
And when I say by the network,

2417
02:17:19,271 --> 02:17:20,620
I should not say by the network,

2418
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:25,420
I can say some executive that decided for
the network. That's what I should say.

2419
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:28,180
Whether or not represents the
cooperation of NBC as a whole.

2420
02:17:28,181 --> 02:17:31,000
I think that'd be misjudging it cause
they pulled it when they found out about

2421
02:17:31,001 --> 02:17:34,810
it, but someone thought it would be a
brilliant idea to make people drink come,

2422
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:37,930
you know they say like,
Oh seems reasonable as it's,

2423
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:41,770
well it's not going to kill
me. Oh yes. Not just one.

2424
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:46,780
Three people drink it. Yeah.
There was three. It was twins
and three groups. Twins.

2425
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:48,880
The video is actually available online.

2426
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:51,640
You can still get it because in other
countries they didn't censor it in other

2427
02:17:51,641 --> 02:17:53,520
countries,
fear factors and all the,

2428
02:17:53,521 --> 02:17:56,740
everything in the air like more
than a dozen countries worldwide.

2429
02:17:56,741 --> 02:17:59,020
And they are in other countries.
That's customary though.

2430
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:04,620
That's actually one of the ways that
we got it passed really New Zealand.

2431
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:08,890
Um, one of the things about
fear factor is if we ate,

2432
02:18:08,891 --> 02:18:13,120
especially during the first season, if
anyone, if we aired people eating things,

2433
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:16,810
it had to be something that
people ate in other countries.

2434
02:18:16,990 --> 02:18:18,790
So like insects are very common.

2435
02:18:18,791 --> 02:18:21,850
People in poor countries eat
insects all the time. In fact,

2436
02:18:21,851 --> 02:18:26,680
insects are probably eaten more than
livestock and a lot of countries. Um,

2437
02:18:26,681 --> 02:18:29,950
so that was an easy one. We
could prove that. And then, uh,

2438
02:18:29,951 --> 02:18:34,720
in New Zealand they started selling
shots of horse, semen at bars,

2439
02:18:34,930 --> 02:18:37,950
like as a novelty. And
people would, uh, you know,

2440
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:40,360
Mosey up to the bar and
buy a shot, a horse, semen.

2441
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:43,720
And apparently they said it gave him
energy and all sorts of crazy things were

2442
02:18:43,721 --> 02:18:47,340
attributed to it. Most likely
placebo faculty, I don't know. Um,

2443
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:51,610
but they even have a good story
afterwards. He got to justify it somehow.

2444
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:55,030
Somehow or another, you've got to
say, listen, I know it seems crazy,

2445
02:18:55,031 --> 02:18:57,590
but I feel awesome.
I drank that whore.

2446
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,620
He's probably so freaked out
that you drank horse come,

2447
02:18:59,621 --> 02:19:03,030
you don't know what's going on in
your body. Your fingers are tingling.

2448
02:19:03,070 --> 02:19:05,920
You can't feel your feet even know
what the fuck you just did. Um,

2449
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:09,860
so because of that, NBC said, well,
the people are serving it and there's,

2450
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:13,570
there's uh, we brought them a new
story, not we, and it was not my idea.

2451
02:19:13,571 --> 02:19:14,560
I should stress that.

2452
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:20,070
And so that allowed them to sign off on
people drinking 24 ounces of donkey come

2453
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:26,020
24 hours. Yeah. It was ridiculous. Not
only that, how about the contestants? Uh,

2454
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,550
he at least had a shot
at winning some money,

2455
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:31,280
but we had PA's drink it and they,

2456
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:34,040
they only did it because it was part
of their job. Just the friends of them,

2457
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:36,920
they got like a hundred bucks.
No, no, no. See if it can be done.

2458
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:40,040
Whenever do we do a stunt on fear factor?

2459
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:43,910
There was several times where we'd look
at a stunt where there was a physical

2460
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:47,000
task or whether it was something,
some someone eating something.

2461
02:19:47,330 --> 02:19:52,330
We had to figure out what's the correct
amount and whether or not physically a

2462
02:19:52,521 --> 02:19:55,000
task could be completed.
So the,

2463
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:58,520
the physical aspect was handled
by stunt man first of all,

2464
02:19:58,610 --> 02:19:59,720
who would look at it and say,

2465
02:19:59,721 --> 02:20:02,240
well you shouldn't do it that way cause
I don't think the guy could do that.

2466
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:05,600
And if he does do that, it's
probably gonna hurt himself
in this way or that way.

2467
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:09,100
And then with the eating thing, this
really only way to find out you got it.

2468
02:20:09,101 --> 02:20:12,590
Like how many bugs can I person
eat? Hmm, let's see. Okay,

2469
02:20:12,591 --> 02:20:16,430
we'll try to get a phd 10 and then
let the PA would have like 10 minutes.

2470
02:20:16,431 --> 02:20:20,660
He 10 bugs and they'd be like three bugs
in just rolling. And you're like, okay,

2471
02:20:20,661 --> 02:20:23,660
this is too much. Let's cut it
down to five or you know, we'd,

2472
02:20:23,661 --> 02:20:25,520
we'd have to make it some
sort of a reasonable amount.

2473
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:28,790
So you'd have to have more than one pa
because you want to have a control group.

2474
02:20:28,791 --> 02:20:31,760
So you know, those a few pas and
I hope you pay them really well.

2475
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:34,550
I would give them extra money. I would
give them extra money all the time,

2476
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:37,930
especially the horrific ones.
I don't remember how many dollars I go.

2477
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:40,730
Several hundred dollars. I gave one
of the extra pas, but that's nothing.

2478
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:42,730
Several hundred dollars the fuck man,
you just strike to calm.

2479
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:48,060
You know what's really making a note here
that next time have a PA complaints to

2480
02:20:48,261 --> 02:20:50,870
us. I think we should tell
them about fear factor. Yeah.

2481
02:20:50,930 --> 02:20:55,400
Being a PA socks for a lot of a lot
of places. I mean sometimes it's cool,

2482
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:57,080
you know,
but for the most

2483
02:20:57,110 --> 02:21:01,760
park not good. We were offered, actually
we didn't eat. We off. We were offered um,

2484
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:04,850
monkey brain in the Amazon, but
that's it. The time remembering.

2485
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:09,050
What was that awful? It wasn't
the break, it was just monkey. No,

2486
02:21:09,051 --> 02:21:11,760
it was a monkey head. He cut
off the monkey, the hills there.

2487
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:15,650
And then what was it that you, you ate
that I hated that had all those hairs.

2488
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:20,810
It was the little hairs. The, the
Armadillo of the Amazon, the Tattoo,

2489
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:21,903
that tool.

2490
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:27,470
And it's an Armadillo and Amazonian
armadillos. Hey, spelled tattoo.

2491
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:32,670
T. T. U. T. No, I think that to you.

2492
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:37,680
Maybe I should know this, but I know,
yeah, you should. What's up, just like,

2493
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:40,270
Hey, I'm from Portugal. We don't have
thought too is in our, my country.

2494
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:45,210
Oh, but port is um, the Brazilian
Portuguese or same everything.

2495
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,920
Same. Yeah, like you don't,
there's nothing. No confusion.

2496
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:50,820
And there's some words here
and there are different,

2497
02:21:50,821 --> 02:21:54,910
but not English and American.
I went to talk to all this.

2498
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:58,650
This is what Darren is. There it is.
Whoa. It's an ugly looking thing, right?

2499
02:21:58,860 --> 02:22:03,750
How do you spell that? It tastes like
it looks g. T. U. T. A. T you. Wow.

2500
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:07,710
What a creepy looking thing.
It was awful. It tasted,

2501
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:09,900
I mean worse than it looks like

2502
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:15,010
there's also a Russian music duo of pot
Russians called tattoo tonight to you.

2503
02:22:16,371 --> 02:22:17,630
And there's always pictures of them.
Like

2504
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:22,080
good touching. Yeah. I didn't mean to.

2505
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:24,960
But the thing is that when they've
never, when we eat, the meat,

2506
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:26,040
hair is still there,

2507
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:28,170
so they sort of burn.
They don't take the hit.

2508
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:31,210
So it's slightly burned from the
barbecuing of the meat. That's it.

2509
02:22:31,211 --> 02:22:34,530
You can still taste it and it tastes
awful. It really does. But they love it.

2510
02:22:34,531 --> 02:22:37,060
It's a delicacy there. They did. They did.

2511
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:43,050
It just tastes terrible. It tastes,
it tastes like, uh Oh. What's that?

2512
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:48,260
Oh Man. What's this stuff? Um,
three tribes. Tribe, tribe, tribe.

2513
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:52,410
You really, yeah. I like 'em udo. Uh,

2514
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:56,910
yeah. I log my noodle. I like tribe and
Menudo and organs and all that stuff.

2515
02:22:56,940 --> 02:23:01,440
It's a little game. Here is a place in
boulder, Colorado called the pop who says,

2516
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:05,160
Oh man, we should go there all the time.
If you ever, if you're in boulder, it's a,

2517
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:09,420
um, I guess it's not Mexican. It's
a Spanish food. Maybe it is Mexican.

2518
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:13,860
Pupusa as though they have the most
sensational menudo. It's amazing.

2519
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:18,120
It's all like hearts and Oregon's
and liver and tripe. Sounds terrible.

2520
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:22,300
It's fantastic. It's fantastic
stuff. Super legit. Yeah.

2521
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:26,030
Like that with this one place, it's
like so good. Spicy and like, oh,

2522
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:29,430
they say it's hangover cure.
I think it's just so good.

2523
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,990
You forget the fact that you're hung over.
Right.

2524
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:33,690
So what I've had in other places,
and it's nasty,

2525
02:23:33,691 --> 02:23:37,560
like I had an a place in Atlanta, it
tastes like shit. It's all about doing it.

2526
02:23:37,561 --> 02:23:39,990
It's definitely tasted like shit.
That'd be, it wasn't, it wasn't good.

2527
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,200
I've had menudo and then maybe
it's not a fair comparison. Well,

2528
02:23:43,230 --> 02:23:46,600
if you live in the middle of the Amazon
you got here, what were you going to,

2529
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:49,560
he was there. Right? Do
they eat those copy borrows,

2530
02:23:49,561 --> 02:23:53,310
those crazy big rat things
to eat those things. It must,

2531
02:23:53,311 --> 02:23:55,350
I mean it must and we saw a couple of,

2532
02:23:55,351 --> 02:23:57,690
we didn't get in but we saw
the copy virus everywhere.

2533
02:23:58,050 --> 02:24:00,630
I think anything is theirs is open.

2534
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:04,290
It's open season for whatever's there if
you're actually need to survive there.

2535
02:24:04,830 --> 02:24:08,400
Um, yeah, the crazy shit. Do they jaguars?

2536
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:13,940
Well, probably not there. Hardly there.

2537
02:24:13,941 --> 02:24:15,680
It's actually really
hard to see it like that.

2538
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:20,520
Like I think most people that come in
contact with them is, it's too late.

2539
02:24:20,521 --> 02:24:23,360
It's too late. Yeah. They're
like really stealth predators.

2540
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:28,080
You know, I was almost attacked
by a Jaguar. Really? So we went,

2541
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:31,500
we went to do the story on the Campbell
frog looking for the pharmaceutical

2542
02:24:31,530 --> 02:24:35,430
pharmaceutical promise of the Amazon.
And we went in with two herpetologists.

2543
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:40,431
These are guys who study
poisonous amphibians and
snakes and they go out every

2544
02:24:40,771 --> 02:24:43,260
month. They go out for a week at
a time and they go deep, deep,

2545
02:24:43,261 --> 02:24:44,310
deep into the Amazon.

2546
02:24:44,311 --> 02:24:49,080
I mean they take a canoe deep inside
where there's nothing around and they said

2547
02:24:49,081 --> 02:24:50,490
that we,
after much haggling,

2548
02:24:50,491 --> 02:24:53,640
they decided that they were going to
take these two gringos along with them.

2549
02:24:53,641 --> 02:24:56,940
Me and Darren and we are camped
out in the middle of nowhere.

2550
02:24:56,970 --> 02:25:00,520
There's nothing there's we put out are
we bought, we bought a couple of um,

2551
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:01,621
hammocks.

2552
02:25:01,621 --> 02:25:05,250
We hung them as soon as we got there
and then at night they go out with these

2553
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:05,641
lights,

2554
02:25:05,641 --> 02:25:09,210
with these headlamps to look for the
most dangerous and most venomous venomous

2555
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:14,340
snakes and frogs they are on in the world,
in the middle of the Amazon.

2556
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:15,810
It was a crazy,
crazy experience,

2557
02:25:15,811 --> 02:25:18,990
but for some reason because we were
filming it and we were on this high of

2558
02:25:18,991 --> 02:25:22,170
filming this documentary and how cool it
would be if we found the most dangerous

2559
02:25:22,171 --> 02:25:23,930
thing in the world.
For us it was,

2560
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:26,980
we didn't feel like scared
and we thought it was great.

2561
02:25:26,981 --> 02:25:28,990
We were filming all this crazy stuff.

2562
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:33,760
We got back to the hammocks at night and
I'm sleeping on the edge because they

2563
02:25:33,761 --> 02:25:35,470
decided they wanted to
give me a little privacy.

2564
02:25:35,471 --> 02:25:40,270
So it was a sort of like little wooden
camp thing and I, but no walls, no roof,

2565
02:25:40,271 --> 02:25:41,830
nothing,
just these hammocks.

2566
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:45,640
And I was on the last hammock right on
the edge and in the middle of the night I

2567
02:25:45,641 --> 02:25:48,400
woke up, nobody told me that in the
Amazon it gets really cold at night.

2568
02:25:48,401 --> 02:25:51,040
So we had nothing to protect us
and we had these mosquito nets.

2569
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:55,210
And middle of the night I, I heard,
I woke up because I was freezing.

2570
02:25:55,211 --> 02:25:58,300
And then I heard and we'd been talking
about all the stories they've been

2571
02:25:58,301 --> 02:26:02,290
telling us, all these stories on the,
the, the all side they call it, they also,

2572
02:26:02,291 --> 02:26:05,140
they are and how the, it's the most
dangerous animal in the Amazon.

2573
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:07,750
And suddenly I start hearing it,
a hearing,

2574
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:11,680
breathing right next to my head and it
was breathing in is breathing really hard

2575
02:26:11,681 --> 02:26:16,540
and I could smell it, I could
smell. It was a big creature of big,

2576
02:26:16,541 --> 02:26:20,860
hairy, scary creature breeding right next
to me. And I had one of those, you know,

2577
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:23,800
when you have those dreams and you try
to scream and it does, nothing comes out.

2578
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:24,791
That happened to me.

2579
02:26:24,791 --> 02:26:28,410
I panicked and I was trying to call out
for Darren or for the other guys and

2580
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:30,730
nothing came out.
Like I was literally frozen,

2581
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:36,060
panicked and Darren woke up with my
breathing because I was breathing really

2582
02:26:37,601 --> 02:26:40,270
heavily and really scared and he asked me,
are you okay?

2583
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:45,010
And I was able to get out just,
and Darren comes up to me and uh,

2584
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:50,940
I told him I was about to be
attacked by an author by a Jaguar.

2585
02:26:52,931 --> 02:26:56,380
And we went around the camp with the
lights just so I could see that there was

2586
02:26:56,381 --> 02:26:58,270
nothing there.
In the morning after I wake up,

2587
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:03,790
I look at my bag and it was full
of hair, full of hair. And I said,

2588
02:27:03,791 --> 02:27:07,000
I told you I knew it. I knew. And I
told the scientists that were with us,

2589
02:27:07,001 --> 02:27:09,730
you know, I saw, I know it was a
Jaguar. I was right next to me.

2590
02:27:09,970 --> 02:27:13,480
And then we looked around and there was
a freaking stray dog that had come from

2591
02:27:13,481 --> 02:27:17,020
like an Indian reservation calls
by Ann had been the stray dog.

2592
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:18,850
Oh.
So it would have been a much,

2593
02:27:19,170 --> 02:27:23,370
sorry if it was a Jaguar.
It was the scare of my life

2594
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:29,340
for no reason.
Just smell of death.

2595
02:27:30,770 --> 02:27:34,320
The mosquito netting is just a dream.

2596
02:27:34,530 --> 02:27:38,300
I am terrified of big cats more than
anything on the planet. They're there.

2597
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:42,690
So I have cats at home, like little cats
and I just watched the way they move,

2598
02:27:42,691 --> 02:27:45,810
I'd jump on, we feed them on, they're
all, they was eat on the counter,

2599
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:49,470
which is the equivalent of me jumping
on the roof of this building. I mean,

2600
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:52,730
it's not happening, but to them
it's like bullying. They just,

2601
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:54,660
they just hop up on
the counter and eat it.

2602
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:59,460
It's so crazy to think that there's
one of those that's 200 pounds and it's

2603
02:27:59,670 --> 02:28:03,030
black as night and it's
wandering the jungle.

2604
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:07,680
Yeah, it's, uh, that's what I was thinking
about when that was breathing heavily.

2605
02:28:07,681 --> 02:28:08,390
And

2606
02:28:08,390 --> 02:28:08,800
what is the,

2607
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:11,610
what kind of poison and stuff did
you guys find when you're out there?

2608
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:17,750
Bushmaster awesome. The snake, not the
gun, not the gun. Um, a lot of things,

2609
02:28:17,751 --> 02:28:18,171
but you know,

2610
02:28:18,171 --> 02:28:21,350
ultimately we were afraid of all
these things and actually Darren has a

2611
02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:24,020
fascination for, for snake. So
he wasn't as scared as I was,

2612
02:28:24,021 --> 02:28:27,560
but what got us was several
months after we came back. Um,

2613
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:31,730
I had this little thing growing on my
finger that I thought it was just a bug.

2614
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,880
And then I decided I had to get it
checked out because he was growing and

2615
02:28:34,881 --> 02:28:36,740
growing and suddenly possible
was coming out of it.

2616
02:28:36,741 --> 02:28:38,300
So I thought it was maybe skin cancer.

2617
02:28:38,301 --> 02:28:41,720
And I went to dermatologist and
turns out I got a flesh eating Perez.

2618
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:45,710
Couple leishmaniasis that I caught in
Brazil only exists in a few parts of the

2619
02:28:45,711 --> 02:28:48,470
world. So they didn't have
the treatment here. So by CDC,

2620
02:28:48,471 --> 02:28:51,590
the Center for Disease Control had to
make a special treatment for me. That was,

2621
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:55,070
that had a nurse come to my house
and, and it was, it was pretty scary.

2622
02:28:55,170 --> 02:28:59,800
That's why I say fuck going in the
air. I hear stories like that. Um,

2623
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:05,340
it's near that or what does that show
the enemy inside you or something like

2624
02:29:05,341 --> 02:29:07,590
that as a show that it was always
about people going to these places and

2625
02:29:07,591 --> 02:29:09,210
catching parasites. Uh, yeah.

2626
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:12,700
They don't realize they have them
until they crawls across their eyeball.

2627
02:29:13,310 --> 02:29:17,940
They started having weird behavior because
there's like a baseball size cluster

2628
02:29:17,941 --> 02:29:19,320
of worms growing inside their head.

2629
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:24,750
I wasn't that sure you
scared nature is very scary.

2630
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:29,780
So this Wednesday is the show and it's
