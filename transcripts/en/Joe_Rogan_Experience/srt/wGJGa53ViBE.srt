1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,050
Experience.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,050
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:19,760
welcome to the post UFC wrap
up show with Tony Hinchcliffe.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Hey everybody and be your host Joe Rogan.

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,940
We are on a flight right now.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm coming back from Dallas, Texas. Sorry,

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,970
I sound like just kicked that lady chair.
Um,

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,250
where we had a great old time at uh,

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,290
the Verizon wireless theater
on Friday night and uh,

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,880
and then the UFC last night and now we're
headed back. Shout out to Brian Doobie.

11
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,100
Had Breakfast with,
turned out to be all right.

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,190
Turned out to be an interesting guy.
I was a little worried about him at first.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,300
Came in strong with a future.
Many questions. You get
interrupted a little bit,

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,070
but turned out to be a very good
dude. Um, but you never know man.

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,900
You know, meet some strange dude. Have
Breakfast with them. Can Be Rough,

16
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,610
but you turned out to be very
cool. I think I snapped at
him. No, I was like, what?

17
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,490
Is this a questionnaire, bro. Relax.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,633
Nervous.

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,090
He's a good dude. He
just, oh, thank you ma'am.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,830
The young ladies bringing us the towels.
Thank you.

21
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,310
She's got a crazy accent and a,
I don't ever think like this,

22
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,860
but Tony was wondering what she would
sound like if she was having sex.

23
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,110
Uh, yeah. Anyway, so, uh,
we're on the flight back.

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,870
We got to give up my
little wet towel and uh,

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,450
do you like to caress the towel?

26
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,390
Hold onto it for a little bit.
I like it.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,660
I like to feel like it cold
still hot and she took it back.

28
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,800
What does it, what does that
four to refresh you on the I do.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,260
Would it make you know that you're not in,
you're not in business class or coach?

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,530
Yeah, business costs. They just
give you a piece of toilet paper.

31
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,330
His class, they, they treat
you almost as good, don't they?

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,610
How does that work? You haven't flown
business class in such a long time.

33
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:20,120
You don't remember what it's like?
I flew coach just a month ago.

34
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,890
That's one thing,
like if you can afford it,

35
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,660
it doesn't seem like it would be worth it.

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,060
But what's worth it is you don't
have to think about it as much.

37
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,610
You have more space, you can relax. Get
off quicker. You get on quicker. Yeah,

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,970
but people don't like it. It's
weird, like people like southwest,

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,280
I feel like it's an egalitarian airline.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,840
If you get on southwest and
you know everybody's the same.

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,740
Yeah.
I'm not into that at all

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,800
bad. It's effective. It gets people
on board and not too much bullshit.

43
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,040
I think it's a good system and you can
occasionally get lucky to sit next to

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
some front people.

45
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,890
I met a girl over the weekend that
works for southwest and she's all like,

46
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,250
she's like, hey, you know, you
must travel a lot if you ever want,

47
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:12,180
I can get you a discount on southwest
flights. I'm like, Eh, I'm okay.

48
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,400
Sometimes you have to take them though.
Jeb Blues are good airline.

49
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:24,360
That jet blue that we flew from
buffalo to New York City. Jetblue.

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,740
Jetblue is nice.
Yeah.

51
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,580
I feel like it's just,

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,140
there's a thing going on where they just
decided to shove as many people into a

53
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:37,410
plain as possible.
Forget about how good the experiences,

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,750
but what if you worked for an airline?
I would,

55
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,950
I'd have to imagine working for jet
blue feels better than working for.

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,333
So like,

57
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,000
like United right now and everybody hates
United after that dude got beat up and

58
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,020
dragged off a plane.

59
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,100
Oh it must be such a bummer.

60
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,090
I mean I've had like flight attendants
have to deal with all sorts of mean

61
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,940
people that are snapping at
them cause that guy got beat up.

62
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,840
Right? Like Megan reverse threats
like oh what are you going to do?

63
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:11,820
Drag me off the here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh for
sure. I just offered you a bag of peanuts.

64
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,700
Ah Yeah,

65
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,850
for sure. Right? Like what
a terrible thing to see.

66
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,570
We decided he's already sitting down,
he's already about to fly.

67
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,110
I mean and they say nope,
you got to get up.

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,740
And what's really weird is that
like one dude made that decision.

69
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,710
He's just a security guy
probably for the airport.

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,660
Probably not specifically for you
tonight. And he's just like, he's like,

71
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:43,130
he had it with that Asian surgeon
doctor guys like you know what,

72
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,690
if too much of an attitude for an Asian
Guy, I'm going to drag you out of here.

73
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,340
Cause that what happened?
I don't know. Like,

74
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,230
I mean I don't know if it had anything
to do with the Asian guy part,

75
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,930
but it felt like it,
I think

76
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,870
the story was that they had some
important United employees that had to be

77
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,520
somewhere like that day.

78
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,250
They had to be that somewhere
for some sort of a meeting.

79
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,930
And so in their company,

80
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:12,340
their ideas that these
people take priority over the
customer to the point where

81
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:15,550
they like physically removed
or customer and beat him up.

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,590
I mean the way they grab that guy and
he's screaming like that is crazy for

83
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:24,190
someone who's done nothing. Yeah. And
all that guy did was be a customer.

84
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,970
And that's like one of the most
devastating things you could ever watch if

85
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,860
you're like,
uh,

86
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,560
one of the people that's
in charge of publicity for
their company, you'd be like,

87
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:36,780
what the fuck did you guys
do? Yeah, I think, oh my God.

88
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:41,350
And you beat that guy up and dragged him
off the plane so an employee can steal

89
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,840
his seat.
You're inconveniencing him.

90
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,360
You saying you're not as
important as our employees.

91
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,260
Our employees are more
important than you like.

92
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,700
That's so crazy that that's their policy

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,750
and good for it to be a doctor like that.
It's crazy too.

94
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,540
Hmm? Is that what it was? It was a dark

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,210
during. Yeah, it was a doctor
or dentist or something,

96
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:04,050
but he had patients the next day
and he's like, I have appointments.

97
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,390
I can't miss this flight.
Patients need me.

98
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,010
Man. That's so crazy. That's
so crazy. It's just so sad.

99
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,883
It's so sad.

100
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,890
Especially since he paid for it.
That's a really controversial stuff.

101
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,141
Right?

102
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,460
So if you like think of the morale and
the way it feels to be on that airplane

103
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:28,180
versus the way it feels to be on like a
jet blue. You get those nice big seats.

104
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,620
Little Tvs behind the seats. Sound
bad at all. Right, so a good ride.

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,580
It's like just enough space. Like
maybe not if you're a big giant person.

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,150
Don't feel like a dude.
My size is just an space.

107
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,670
Have you had you met my buddy Justin,
Justin Collet and Vegas? Yeah,

108
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,140
the giant. Yeah. He's a legit giant. It
was like seven feet tall. Huge. Yeah.

109
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,280
That guy. He can't even sit on
JetBlue without being [inaudible].

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,290
But those are the outliers,
you know.

111
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,620
Does that blue does
the a flat bed that Oh,

112
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,870
do there?
Yeah.

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,230
Yeah man.
Jet Blue is a solid notch up.

114
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,831
Joey Diaz,

115
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:19,720
the big jet blue fan was the jet blue
air airplane commercial we're doing here.

116
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,180
It's not what we were trying to do.
We're on virgin right now,

117
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,120
which is my favorite.

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,160
They just got bought by Alaska.
So it might be Jeff, please.

119
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,210
I wonder what's going to happen.
What do I give a fuck? That's true.

120
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,790
This is early morning nonsense.
Talk with Joe and Tony.

121
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,820
I thought you guys were going to
talk about the fights. We will. God,

122
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,750
we will warm it up. So, um, before fight,

123
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,350
when do you think that you want to end?
You will go on your first date.

124
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,830
I think it's going to be really soon.

125
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Is My theory as you saw in this fight
and she defended her championship last

126
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,480
night. Uh, she's very into
me. She kept looking at me.

127
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,710
Dude, she did keep looking at you between
every round. She made a point to like,

128
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,250
you know, like I sorta felt
like our backup corner man,

129
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,120
she looked over at you pointed to you
had started talking to you at one point.

130
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,150
Yeah. That was like,
this is crazy. I know.

131
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Even show in DC and at one point like
what the hell and she's guys thing

132
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,130
pointing at Tony and talking to him.
Yeah, it's hilarious. And like, um,

133
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,790
you know,
we inspire each other.

134
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,200
Like she was looking at me and I'm
like clapping. I'm looking at her like

135
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,160
that's so crazy.

136
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:44,630
And then she was doing some sort of an
interview before the fight and she said

137
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,790
something and people were laughing
and they were joking around about it.

138
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,640
She was maybe Joe Dogan and
Tony Hinchcliffe would take
me on the road with them.

139
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,040
She's so funny.
She could

140
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,070
be, she could do anything
she wants the way she works.

141
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,050
She's already funny. Two
cheese, she's up bad woman.

142
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,060
She gave her opponent a piece of cloth
cut out to look like a belt that just

143
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,770
said fantasy across the way.

144
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,390
So she probably did that herself in
the bathroom and shit at the hotel.

145
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,930
I've making her fantasy, Beth,
this is all you get, bitch.

146
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,110
This is as close in j a piece of cloth,
but man,

147
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,590
that girl that she fought,
Jessica Andraj blood a tank. Yeah.

148
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,880
That woman has a tank.

149
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,280
It's interesting, man though.
The women in that weight class,

150
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:41,281
they're all very tough and they always
put up a fight up until the rounds go on.

151
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,710
She just doesn't get any
more tired than she does.

152
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,180
You know what I mean?
Like she does,

153
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:52,750
but she doesn't show it in this
chick's I'll start to wear down.

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,740
You could see the slightest evidence of
it in the last round and she was slowing

155
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:02,630
down a little bit, but still,
always on our feet. Still
moving. Yeah. Both of them,

156
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:06,820
man. They're both in phenomenal
shape because you got to
give it up to and drive.

157
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,540
She took a fucking beating man.
Beating and kept coming forward.

158
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,740
Yeah. A lot of friends lake
kicks, she absorbed as with her,

159
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,750
that'll you go on up Polish Iron Lake.

160
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,950
She had us switch your stance a couple
of times to switch back and forth.

161
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,510
She's getting that leg chewed up.

162
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,800
She got tagged with some good
shots including a few head kits.

163
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,650
Yeah, a lot. I had kids three,

164
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,090
five and 10 is like this big
snappy had ones in the front.

165
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:42,840
Snap kick to the chest. That
shoe looks, it makes me cringe.

166
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,360
That would hurt anybody.

167
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,070
Yes. It was a really interesting
combination. Oh Jesus.

168
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,970
This is now you get to understand
why Tony was attracted to her voice

169
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,590
but it was a perfect combination of
like a ruthlessly powerful attacking

170
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:09,591
determined person versus like a person
who maybe doesn't have as much physical

171
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:12,540
power or maybe doesn't have
as much pop on their shots.

172
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,110
But it is a brilliant tactician.
We have brilliant technician.

173
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,820
Like her technique is so good. Man
of footwork is so good. She pops out,

174
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,680
jab out the way she like,
she like slips that leg kick in slack.

175
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,720
You know like she's so
high level man and I'm,

176
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,540
I kept trying to corner her
and she's like, no, not today.
No, we're not stand put.

177
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,690
We're not standing in front of you.
She never really stood in front of her.

178
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:37,524
She kept moving.

179
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,740
She kept doing a lot of
like just one punches.

180
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:45,450
I noticed Yolanda was in the first few
rounds a little bit different than the

181
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:49,650
multiple combinations that I usually see
her throat and I was going to yell like

182
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,440
combinations, but then I'm
like, what the hell do I know?

183
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,490
Then I just started yelling,
set it up, set it up. Yolana

184
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,290
you know what's interesting man?

185
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,770
The real high level kickboxing like
a world championship Moitai and Bella

186
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,260
Beltour and glory and all those like
high level kickboxing events you see on

187
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,070
television.

188
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,070
It's all three minute rounds and what
she's doing is she's kickboxing like

189
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:19,250
massive foot work, but she's also
fighting off takedown defense,

190
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,760
which makes you more tired and
she's adding another two minutes.

191
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,530
It's really interesting.

192
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,180
Well, I mean if I shoot you at
least all the fights that I've seen,

193
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:32,950
which is the last four or five,
whatever UFC fights. If we took,

194
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,210
if we made a compile nation of her
getting taken down, Yolanda young j check,

195
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,270
she pops right back up.
Yeah.

196
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,310
Every single time against
get Dalia against Valerie.

197
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,240
The turnout again, everyone
she has, she refuses.

198
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,890
Absolutely refuses to stay down.
Yeah,

199
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,830
she's here mentality that my old wrestling
coach I know wishes I had all the

200
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:57,820
times he yelled at me

201
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,640
and it's hard because there's
a big muscular person.

202
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,720
I knew her back but she
just like sees through it.

203
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,820
She just looks at a one step at a time.

204
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:11,560
You can almost see she was lance her foot,
she posts up and she stands up.

205
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,430
It's like she doesn't even
look at it like a challenge.

206
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,910
She's also a superior athlete and a
big part of her athleticism and in a

207
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:25,740
kickboxing is her legs. She's a big
part of it is her ability to move,

208
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,830
which is like a lot of plyometric type
activities and also her ability to throw

209
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,810
power like in our leg kicks and
your knees and stuff like that.

210
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,890
So her base and her legs are really
strong and when you take her down,

211
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,100
she's so technical, they're more
tired that she becomes that technical.

212
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,570
I'm sure where they're grappling too.

213
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,570
So she's doing the right things
and she's got a lot of power,

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,520
a lot of physical power with her legs.
She's explosive and fast or balances sick.

215
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,720
Very, very hard to take down. And if
you get her down, good luck. Keep it a,

216
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:57,960
now she's a little cat. Yeah,
she's really interesting man.

217
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,890
And she was in full control when the,

218
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,090
the what seeming to be the, you know, um,

219
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,770
oh my God, I forget her name, but she,
despite last name Jessica and Drudge,

220
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,480
drudge, when androgyny put her
against the fence, she would spin,

221
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,120
she would put her against
the fence almost immediately.

222
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,860
Just like she didn't want to end judge
to think that she had control at all for

223
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:26,130
a second. Yeah, she did it. It
turns out she didn't have control.

224
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,900
It was really interesting because
she was always dangerous though.

225
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,990
Even though she had control of entourage
on drivers, still winging bombs at her,

226
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,870
like any one of those could shut the
lights out. That curl was so tough, man.

227
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:43,610
I'm so impressed. Yeah, I mean, I'm super
impressed with Yolanda because I mean,

228
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:46,070
she's so skillful or
movement was beautiful.

229
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:50,590
And the fact that she was able to do
that for 25 minutes against a marauding

230
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,130
challenge or like that that

231
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,240
girl just kept coming forward. Man,
she tagger kept coming forward.

232
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,480
Kicker keep coming forward. I mean, yeah,

233
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,320
it's really hard for women to knock
out other women in that weight class

234
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:03,490
especially.
Right.

235
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,240
But I think that it would be beneficial
to some of these women if Yolanda was

236
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,860
just a little bit stronger
to knock them out.

237
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,120
I think taking 300 of those have have,
have,

238
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:19,960
have like little demon
stone hands to the face.

239
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,794
Like

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,600
I me, I said, who's doing
commentary? He goes,

241
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,660
she should have gone to jail for
what she did to Carla Esparza.

242
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,490
She should have gone to jail. And he was
laughing at me saying he's a funny dude.

243
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:35,990
Man is for me a is fun and he's so
comfortable now. It's really interesting.

244
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,610
He so loose cause trash talk is better.
Like he's a different person.

245
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,810
I've never heard you guys both
on there at the same time.

246
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:47,890
Are you guys both covering the like the,
like what's happened?

247
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of it. And is
that weird for you to have solid. Great.

248
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,880
Love it. Yeah. Yeah,
it's awesome man. It's,

249
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,190
I like doing it with him and I'd like
doing it with Dominick Cruz too and I want

250
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:02,980
to do it Brian Stann. Um, but man, it's
fun. It's like doing it with a friend.

251
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,080
It's like, you know, and plus you're
both enjoying the fights together.

252
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,700
Like there was one point tried to,
Daniel Cormier is a fun guy, man.

253
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,170
He's really fun.

254
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,770
Like he says funny shit and he'll look
over me in the middle of the fight,

255
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:20,550
like a crazy fight. You're like,
slap me on the arm, go God tail and,

256
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,470
and he'll like Mauldin sometimes like
he'll like share a moment with you.

257
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,110
Like where he's looking at this like,
are you seeing what I'm seeing?

258
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,350
Like Holy Shit,
you know,

259
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:33,860
and cause there's a hi,
how you doing? I just,

260
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,390
I just ate. I just ate. Yeah,
we just, we bold just hate.

261
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,110
Right before we got on board.
I'll just like a water please.

262
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,230
Yeah.
Actually I have a coffee as well.

263
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,020
Just cream please. Thank you. Um, but two,

264
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:56,020
he's really funny, man. Like super funny
and like real friendly. It's like a,

265
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,240
it's real weird how people
don't see him that way.

266
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,680
Like in the public eye and I think he's
been like a little stiff in some press

267
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:07,640
conferences. But this recent one that
he did with Jon Jones, it was hilarious.

268
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,930
You hear what he said to him, which he
goes, he goes, he goes, John, he goes,

269
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,560
I don't even know if his fights going to
take place if you don't get in trouble

270
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,450
for steroids but doing cocaine.
I sandblasted a prostitute,

271
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,940
dude, dude, he was hilarious.
Does that even mean?

272
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,190
But he was hilarious cause talking
over John. John was frustrated.

273
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,710
He was laughing,
he was all jovial.

274
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,550
It's like he's found the fun in this man.
Yeah,

275
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,810
DC's found the fun in it was
really interesting. He's so great.

276
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,990
That's another one. And
he's like, I mean him,

277
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:50,020
the Diaz brothers and Yolanda
and I like really my, yeah,

278
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,360
DC is really, really, really
been growing on me especially.

279
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,823
Um,

280
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,810
I mean it's like just so many people
at him count it out against rumble.

281
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:05,160
Even in the second fight, which he won
the first one and still people are like,

282
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:09,150
no way he's going to get his
head knocked off and yeah man,

283
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,750
you want to talk about being in there
with someone dangerous like you can hear

284
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:16,110
and feel the wind to blow by
you and humbleness is a punch.

285
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,420
Like it causes a fucking a tornado in
Japan somewhere when rumble and this is a

286
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:25,260
punch here in Vegas,
like that's shit are raising,

287
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,770
but don't you think in that fight the
rumble was Kinda done with fighting?

288
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,970
I think people said that looking
back, I, I think he was trying,

289
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,330
I think it's sort of a cop out way to
look like you didn't lose twice to core me

290
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,550
by saying I was going to
retire anyway. It's like, dude,

291
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:46,090
if you're going to go out like that,
then maybe retire before the fight.

292
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,530
No, I think he wanted to just, first
of all, I'm sure he wanted the money.

293
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,560
It was real good money. Yeah. I think
you wanted to give it one more try,

294
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
but I think that as good as rumble is,

295
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,570
and I think he's physically one of
the most talented guys of all time,

296
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,400
if you don't want to do it,

297
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,460
you shouldn't be doing it and clearly
if you're retired afterwards is cause he

298
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:03,294
didn't want to do it.

299
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,170
This doesn't take anything away from
his ability or who he is or it should in

300
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:08,640
any way be thought of as an insult.

301
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,800
It's a decision that he's made a personal
decision in life and it's his decision

302
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:18,570
to make and it's just put, when you make
that decision, it changes who you are.

303
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,660
It's not a bad thing,
but it does change who you are.

304
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,290
There's guys that like
they're their focus,

305
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:30,260
they're like a Max Holloway Focus and
goal right now is being a champion focus

306
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,190
and goal right now is being,

307
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:33,990
but he's not thinking whether or not
it shouldn't be fighting anymore.

308
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,230
Like he's not thinking that way
and it's a personal decision.

309
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:41,340
One day he's going to think that way
and when he does he'll step away to just

310
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,174
like rumbled it.

311
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,360
But he probably had already decided
in his head who's going to step away.

312
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,290
Do you think he would have
stepped away had he won that?

313
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,750
He might've, yeah, he might've.
He might've just decided
to go out with the belt.

314
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,950
Look, he's been in a long time, so a lot
of hard fights, hard training sessions.

315
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,070
He said it himself, I don't want
to get punched in the head anymore.

316
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,370
I don't want to wrestle the dudes anymore.
And I get it, man. It's like, you know,

317
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:06,330
as talented as he is, he has to do what
he wants to do. That's what a man does.

318
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,940
That's what a human does.
If you want to be happy and fulfilled,

319
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,280
you can't do something just
because you're successful at it.

320
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,710
And so he just didn't
want to do it anymore.

321
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,560
And I think it's should be
applauded that he had the, the, the,

322
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,150
the sense of self to do that and that he
could thank you very much because dude,

323
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,600
he's one of the top contenders.

324
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,760
I'll take some half and half please.
Thank you very much.

325
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,110
So like I, you know, I mean Daniel,

326
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,360
Daniel beat him up both
times, but I feel like, uh,

327
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,300
the second time I was just so surprised
that he was clenching with Daniel.

328
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,790
I was like,
this is crazy.

329
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,073
Yeah.

330
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,320
I guess that's sort of
see the entire thank you.

331
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,550
Maybe he wanted to go out with a bang
and try to take Daniel down, you know,

332
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,140
which would it be crazy.
Yeah, but either way, man,

333
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,940
the dude had an awesome career.

334
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,710
He's had crazy highlight reel
kaos that will be his forever.

335
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,750
You know, like what he did to over
to Sherra what he did to Minotauro.

336
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:24,980
Nogueira yeah. Ryan Bader.
I mean, come on son,

337
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,770
rumble Johnson put the heat
on people like no other

338
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,320
watching them Gustafson cry in Sweden,

339
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:34,670
like flying all the way to the other
side of the world to watch a guy cry in

340
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:38,630
front of his own people. Like,
because some monster came and eat it.

341
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,620
But you know what that just goes to show
you that in life sometimes you've got

342
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,580
to do what you want to do regardless
of what everybody else thinks.

343
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,950
Because here's this guy who's,

344
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,440
if not number one number two
right behind the champ, right?

345
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:59,550
So you got DC, he's either number one or
John Jones is and they've never fought.

346
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,360
So we don't know. But if, if, if
rumble and Jon Jones did fight,

347
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,170
then we would know if rumbles number two
of reason number one in terms of like

348
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,640
the the biggest challenge to call me yet,
but you know,

349
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,320
he's got to do what he's got to do. If
the cool thing about, you know, like life,

350
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,130
you make decisions like you
don't say to a guy, hey man,

351
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:23,370
I'll keep me on point Numa Moon because
he's, I got a, I don't want him shit.

352
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,280
I never even trained it. Like come
on pussy, you're scared. Like, no,

353
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:29,190
I don't want to, I
don't have to. You know,

354
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:31,350
and that's just cause rumble
was really good at it.

355
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,800
It doesn't mean he has to keep doing it.
Yeah.

356
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,043
Yeah.

357
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,540
Now he's going to go knock
down airplanes out of the sky.

358
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,330
All right, last thing is
a giant. Are you drunk?

359
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,710
What happened to you?
You just fell apart.

360
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,250
You like in the middle of that
referred, you lost faith in it, right?

361
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,000
I can see it in your face.
They're like,

362
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,290
I'm just going to follow
through with this.

363
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,970
I'm just going to leave
this tear down here. Yeah,

364
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,470
I think he's got to do something
with football. Is involved with uh,

365
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,660
the rams or something like that in
the like the business side of it.

366
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,790
That's the rumor I heard. I shouldn't
be spreading rumors, but uh, anyway,

367
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,620
real good dude to rumble.

368
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:18,070
Johnson always been a super
nice guy like that dude.

369
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,840
And again,

370
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,910
that highlight reel that he has head
kick knock out of Kevin Burns mean he's,

371
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:29,110
that's crazy. Knockouts
man. The duty knocked out.

372
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,730
The one from the ultimate fighter.
Jesus Louisa's remember that? Oh,

373
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,793
he's a beast.

374
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,270
Every time he hits somebody
square their knees buckle. Yeah,

375
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,810
he hits them and their needs. It's like
electric heats the body in the shit.

376
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,800
It's like the whole body tenses up.

377
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,390
It's really interesting
because he obviously has a
very good technique and the

378
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:52,150
throws his body into everything very well.
And you know,

379
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:57,160
like he's obviously a really strong guy,
but the strength that he has,

380
00:23:57,161 --> 00:24:01,660
the power that he has in his striking
is almost like you're born with that.

381
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,860
Like he has all the elements
to accentuate that power.

382
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,240
Like he has all the technique and he
has, his movement is excellent. He's,

383
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,540
he's quick.
So like as he's delivering these shots,

384
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,750
it's really well timed but it's,
there's more than that. There's,

385
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,310
there's a component that is like a natural
gift that he asked for hitting really

386
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:23,470
hard.
And then it's what separates him.

387
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:25,450
It's like you have all these
people that are like really,

388
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,340
really dangerous and then you have rumble.

389
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,900
It's like he's in this total different
dimension of his own where you just can't

390
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:33,940
get hit if you get hit,
you're fucked.

391
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,220
And the only guy has been able to
absorb it somehow is Cormier. Yeah.

392
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,460
Yeah. And he barely was. That's
why like, I mean that's why I love,

393
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,900
I mean for me it's really growing
on me so much lately is like,

394
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,270
cause he did absorb that you have a crowd,

395
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:52,260
like not give him credit for
being an outstanding wrestler.

396
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,320
And barely avoiding,
you know,

397
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,440
I mean he did got his head got hit by
rumble in that first bite especially and

398
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:04,710
like it all started coming down,
but he was avoided it and bought a battle.

399
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:09,711
It's a battle and like getting hit and
recuperating is a huge part of it and not

400
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,480
getting stuck in a choke hold by a
wrestlers. Another part of it. Yeah.

401
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,840
And you know,

402
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,210
[inaudible] survived his
spark and it surprises me
that the crowd is against him.

403
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I think that fight against Silva sort
of heard him with a crowd because of

404
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,700
course, yes, he's going to
wrestle the shit out of Salva.
What are you going to do?

405
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,810
I don't think that was it.

406
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:34,560
I think it was all the John Jones stuff
is the fact that he got the title sort

407
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,890
of in what many people consider
an illegitimate manner.

408
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,640
Meaning are they strip Jon Jones,
which makes sense that they stripped him,

409
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:41,941
you know,

410
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:46,410
he violated the code of the organization
and he personally and mentally fucked

411
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,580
up,
made giant mistakes.

412
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,300
But everybody knew that John was the
baddest motherfucker on the planet when it

413
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,560
came to 205 pounds.

414
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:55,680
There was one dude that dude was Jon
Jones and the only thing that was beaten,

415
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:56,391
John Jones is it.

416
00:25:56,391 --> 00:26:00,000
John Jones wasn't training and Jon Jones
did this press conference the other day

417
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:04,230
with Daniel two and 10 was talking about
kinds of ship. John went deep. He goes,

418
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,300
I beat you after a weekend of cocaine.

419
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,830
Do you know? And to Michael Johnson
was cry and laugh and he was like,

420
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,940
Oh shit. Oh Shit. That's the most
cold blooded stuff in the world.

421
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,650
I mean the Diaz brothers,
you know,

422
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:23,180
blatantly smoking pot and beating
up their opponents is one thing.

423
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,040
It's a brag about doing an entire
weekend of cocaine to Jon Jones.

424
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,220
A bad motherfucker. Cause they mean
nobody just does cocaine. Right.

425
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:35,360
That means you've been drinking
probably hooking up or whatever.

426
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,720
I mean that seems to be helped.
Most people do cocaine. I
don't know how it works,

427
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:41,780
but it doesn't seem like that
thing. You just, you by yourself.

428
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,130
You know what Jon Jones

429
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,820
can be the best of all time. Really
could still, it's only 30 years old.

430
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,720
You've got to realize one way for us to
know Daniel for me has to do cocaine for

431
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:56,400
a week to ag. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

432
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,410
I cut you off.
I think.

433
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,950
I think Daniel in that fight was
hampered by emotion and I think that John

434
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,570
Really got under his skin and really
taunted him and got him fired up to the

435
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:13,690
point where it was detrimental to them.
He got overcome with emotion. John,

436
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,680
it's good shit talker man.
We did an interview,

437
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:19,340
whereas I sat in the middle
and Daniel sat to my right.

438
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,130
Charles had to my lab and dude,
John's ruthless.

439
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,750
He's so ruthless. It's a whole another
part of the game. Rack it up there with,

440
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,170
you know,
with boxing and Jujitsu,

441
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,080
but you didn't even get to see it and
they didn't even put part of it online.

442
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,620
The best of the best shit. But I'm
just saying about shit talking overall,

443
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,500
but I'm saying Jon Jones is shit
talking to Daniel called me.

444
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,000
The best part did he would get online.

445
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,220
The best part he was calling
them is pussy. He's like,
he goes, you're my pussy.

446
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,820
He goes, you're always going to be
my person. He does. I'll fuck you up.

447
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:55,380
Every time we fight, it's
just like, he's like,

448
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:59,520
it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
what, what happens? He goes, you know,

449
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,920
every time we fight out,
fuck you up. He goes,

450
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:05,820
you're supposed to be a big time
wrestler. He goes, I took you down man,

451
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,510
because you're an Olympic wrestler.
I took you down. He's like,

452
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:14,220
I beat your ass and you could,
Daniel was very mad. I mean,

453
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,380
the two of them were, it was very intense.
I was that face to face interview. Yeah.

454
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:22,500
It was intense in the middle
and like a director's chair. No,

455
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,140
that's how Max Kellerman
does it. Uh, you know. Yeah.

456
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:27,300
I wasn't a director share
Max Kellerman does it,

457
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:31,350
I think better honestly because like Max
Kellerman does is he sort of faces the

458
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:35,370
screen and the fighters face each other
beside him to his right into his left.

459
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,140
We had it almost like a sort of a
semi circle. And so, uh, the fighters,

460
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,660
it would have been better if we did
it at a table the way HBO did it,

461
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,680
but it was the only time we ever did
it and it was very, very intense.

462
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,690
It was very intense. John John
says he's a bad motherfucker dude.

463
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,480
And like DC had this whole crew
with them and John Jones was like,

464
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:58,080
I'll fuck all you up. I'll fuck you
up. He goes, don't look at me big boy.

465
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,020
I'll fuck you up like I do.
I do.

466
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:05,640
To scare him with the dudes and stare at
them and try to give him some attitude.

467
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,280
John's just straight up looks at
it was like, I'll fuck you up.

468
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,290
I'm looking at me like that. You think is
going to make it to this fight? Oh yeah,

469
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:16,710
for sure. Yeah, for sure. He's not
going to fuck this up. And it's,

470
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,900
what's fascinating to me is
when you watch these guys,

471
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,250
John had each other when no one can see.
That's when you know there's no press.

472
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,490
There's me and a couple of the people
that are around for the UFC employees. Me,

473
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,980
this is real.
Like this is,

474
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,300
this is two guys trying to get under each
other's skin and John was very good at

475
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:37,410
it. So this was after the first fight
when they were supposed to fight for the

476
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:40,200
second time and then it got canceled and
John got stripped and the whole deal.

477
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,530
So now,
now they're finally going to go after it.

478
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:48,670
But John's only been back in the octagon
once since then against [inaudible] St

479
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,513
Crute.
Yeah.

480
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,720
Yeah. I remember that. We were at the bar,

481
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,020
so all this shit's been going down and
the only time John's been in the cage

482
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:00,780
since all this shit went down
because the open st pursuit of,

483
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,500
they were originally going to rematch.
He fought over in Saint Peru.

484
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,190
He beat him,
but he felt like he was off.

485
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,770
It seemed like it was good. Big. I
think overtake proves real good. Yeah.

486
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,470
And I also think he wasn't
planning for open st pro.

487
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,230
They have the WHO's planning
for someone else, you know,

488
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,130
that was when Daniel got injured,
wasn't it? No, the day and get injured.

489
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,180
I don't even remember. I'm not even going
to look it up. How about that folks?

490
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,510
The point being that's
an interesting fight man,

491
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:33,300
because they're going to go at it again
in July and now Cormier has got all this

492
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:36,750
momentum on his side.
Core me a beat rumble.

493
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,190
He defended against Gustafson or
did he beat Gustovsen to win it?

494
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,530
Uh, cause it was, it was rumble

495
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,120
core may be rumbled a win it. That's
how he got the title. That's right.

496
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,090
And then he defended against Gustafson
and then he defended against her.

497
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:54,924
I'm home.
Yeah.

498
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,773
Yeah.

499
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,420
And he just rubbed Silva and a non
title mentioned between, that's right.

500
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,130
That's right. And that was a
weird fight. Yeah, that was,

501
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,950
yeah. Double leg. Take down shoe
low. Call it the room. Yeah, he does.

502
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,880
Was a bigger man. That's a
wrestler. Should, I mean if it,

503
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,740
it's one of those like if it ain't
broke, don't fix it things right. Yeah.

504
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,350
Well Cormier is just such a stud wrestler.

505
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:29,300
You ever see his fight with Dan Anderson?
It's been awhile.

506
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,680
Dan Henderson, who's a beast, you know,
he's a former Olympic wrestler himself,

507
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,980
but just not really the
same size and call me a,

508
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:42,980
just threw him around man. I mean
just through him all over the place.

509
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,940
I think he choked him out too.
When you choke them unconscious,

510
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,320
that'd be just manhandled them and you
realize like how strong call me a really

511
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:55,100
is and how good his wrestling really is.
It's like super,

512
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:57,020
super high level shit man.

513
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,290
That play last night that's
stole the show was uh,

514
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,450
chase,
Chase Sherman and Rashad cold.

515
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,840
Oh my. Yeah. Good Lord
rock 'em sock. 'Em robots.

516
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,710
Crazy in and off they go.

517
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,020
It was interesting because again,
like,

518
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,170
I don't know what you guys are saying
and commentary or just far enough away

519
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:26,040
where I can't hear you.
Like I ain't notice that the guy,

520
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,430
not leshawn but his opponent,

521
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Rashad, Rashad leshawn just
giving some random black day.

522
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,580
I'm from an all black neighborhood.
I just call everybody listening. Um,

523
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,470
he was kicking Rashad's leg over
and over again to where we shot,

524
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,304
couldn't use it,

525
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,510
but then he kept going for this knock
out instead of just keeping attacking the

526
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:50,240
leg.
Like what do you think about that?

527
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,490
Well,

528
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,700
we definitely got a little anxious and
he allowed Russia to get back into it by

529
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,040
walking them with some
haymakers but you know,

530
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,280
it's just part of what's going to come
with experience. He's a young kid.

531
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,190
I'm thinking he's only 24 years old,
24,

532
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,430
25 Sherman and um,

533
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,520
if I remember correctly and he's under
the tutelage of Alan Belcher. And um,

534
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,110
so he's like, I think he's got like real
potential. Matt, you start also done some,

535
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:22,810
uh, some work in Albuquerque. I think
he was there with a Winkeljohn no,

536
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,320
the um, Jackson people in
Albuquerque, so, so great coaching,

537
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,920
look real good man. Look real
good on his feet and just, just,

538
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:34,460
it was a slobber knocker man. Crazy
back and forth, heavyweight fine.

539
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,600
But if that kid can get it together,
like he's got real good movement,

540
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:42,980
real good kicks, just got to make good
choices. Like decide when to go in,

541
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,310
when to charge for, when to put
yourself in danger. He didn't have to,

542
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,810
he could've kept doing what he was doing.

543
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:50,780
That dude was kind of
incapacitated with those leg kicks.

544
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,110
Yeah. It was a firework show. Yeah.
I'm one of those ones. Where was that?

545
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,300
Is that guy from American top team too?

546
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,190
Who? The shot? No, that his
opponent. Sherman. No, no,

547
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,380
no. He was a, I'm pretty
sure he's with Jackson's.

548
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
That American top team had like
so many fighters like oh yeah,

549
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:17,820
Billy, right. Yeah, it's pretty
crazy. And they all did pretty good.

550
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,370
Yeah. Yeah, they did pretty good.

551
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:24,970
I mean y'all wanna one obviously
junior got knocked out. Um,

552
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,380
well one was called a job at
the Eddie Alvarez is neat,

553
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,543
but that was,

554
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,650
well Mazda dog who's American top team
lost to Maya and as close to decisions

555
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,653
you're ever going to get.

556
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,390
It was a split decision and then
Daniel was trying to lose, try out.

557
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:46,991
He was like,

558
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:51,991
he give the guy more credit for doing
damage for the first half of the round or

559
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:56,820
do you give the guy more credit for being
able to control the guy and go after

560
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,220
submissions for the second half of
the round and what is worth more?

561
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,050
It's a really good question because the
mosfet all Damien Maia fight like one

562
00:35:05,051 --> 00:35:09,070
round of it particularly like the second
round is a really good like case study

563
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,750
and judging and maybe like
athletic commissions should
review that fight and say,

564
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:14,531
hey,
this is a,

565
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:19,531
this fight is a really good example of
a fight where it's really subjective.

566
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,680
Like we, and we have to kind of quantify
what, what is more important. Like if you,

567
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:28,090
if you got the exact same amount of
time but one thing hurt the guy and one

568
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:33,000
thing didn't, is that a, uh,
you know, is that uh, uh,

569
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,030
does it go towards,

570
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,950
does it go go towards a kickboxer or did
it go towards to like the one half of

571
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,200
the round where the guy was fighting
off being strangled for every second of

572
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,780
that two and a half minutes?
Where do you think, I don't know.

573
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,850
It's an interesting argument.

574
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:52,620
Like on one side I feel like Mosbey Dell
did more damage and that that should be

575
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:56,860
worth something. But in the second part
of it, like he was threatening at Mazda.

576
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:59,940
Dahl wasn't threatening at
all once my got on his back,

577
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,060
you know, so once my I got on his
back is like, Jesus man, this is a,

578
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,930
this is a constrictor on top
of you. Yeah. And you know,

579
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,520
Mosfet all did defend at one time and
at the end of one of the rounds, uh,

580
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,230
got the first round I believe,

581
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,610
got my office back and landed some good
shots at Maya was trying to take them

582
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,370
down and control them again.
So he did get off some damage.

583
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:27,700
So arguably he could have got that round
because he did a little damage in the

584
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:28,790
beginning.
My,

585
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:33,150
it took him down and defended successfully
and then he did some damage at the

586
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:36,990
end. But you'd really have to like have
a real conversation about what's most

587
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:37,824
important.

588
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,210
Is Control most important or is
damaged most important or threat?

589
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:46,890
Most important because like Mazda Dahl
wasn't close to knocking Maya out.

590
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,500
You didn't have them like
staggering around the cage.

591
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,060
But that could have come at any moment.
Yeah.

592
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,400
So it's like there's threat there and
he's clearly hitting Maya more than my is

593
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:57,234
hitting him.

594
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,780
So you have to assess like what's more
threatening because when my has got you

595
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:02,730
down,
it's got your back boy,

596
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:04,890
there's a really high likelihood
you're getting choked.

597
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,830
But yet Mazda it all figured
out a way to get out of that.

598
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:11,670
So he should also get a little bit
of credit for his great defense,

599
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,210
but more credit should be tomorrow to
Maya's control and my as attacking in

600
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,930
Maya's owning the position,

601
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,680
like he pretty much controlled
the position for a good
chunk of that fight when

602
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:25,080
he got the back or when he got
him on the ground. So it's a,

603
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:26,400
it's a weird conversation.

604
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:31,450
Judges last night with the Texas State
Athletic Commission, some of them,

605
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:34,990
did these people like work with, are they
the same people that are in the Vegas?

606
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,680
Sometimes it depends on the
commission. I, that's a good question.

607
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:41,740
I think I would have to,
I'd have to look it up to be sure.

608
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,280
But I think some commissions will
bring in more experienced guys.

609
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,640
They'll hire people like
especially with the referees,

610
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,200
you see that there's referees.
I curb dean's like super
experienced and you know,

611
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:56,710
you get like Eve Levine's also
super experienced Dan Burglar Yada,

612
00:37:56,711 --> 00:38:00,220
super experienced and you get these guys,
you'll see them all over the place,

613
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:01,010
they'll do it.

614
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,990
So you ask her dean after that,
Eddie Alvarez,

615
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,230
I don't know if we heard yeah,
the answer,

616
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,530
well her first of all,

617
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:13,180
herb is like one of the most reasonable
and logical guys will ever talk to after

618
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:16,540
a fight like that. He's not,
he's not emotional at all. He's,

619
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,090
and it's one of the reasons why I
think he's like the gold standard.

620
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,420
It's him in big John McCarthy and
my eyes were the best of the best.

621
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,150
And you know, not that there's
anything wrong with the other people.

622
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,330
It's a lot of great referees. I think
Dan Burglar Yada does a great job too.

623
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:31,990
But uh, herb is so like
calm in there. He's,

624
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,340
he just makes good decisions.

625
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:38,790
And he is a not a fan at all
of guys playing that game
of touching the hand down

626
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:41,950
to the ground and avoiding the knee.
He thinks it's bullshit.

627
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:46,810
Anythings if you get hit when
you're playing that game, he's,

628
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,230
he's going to let it go. He's like
just too, it's too much of a scrap,

629
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:54,940
like any offers of saying this is a fist
fight and he's just trying to win and

630
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:58,630
there's, he's pulling triggers and
they're in questionable moments.

631
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,710
The referee's not stopping him. He's not
saying is he's down to fighters down.

632
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,600
Like you can't even see sometimes if
you're holding onto a guy, oh you're in a,

633
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:09,130
a situation where you're
just a few inches from him.

634
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,310
You're not sure whether or not
his hand is touching the ground.

635
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,560
Fuck you are sure you can
fucking knee him in the head.

636
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,960
A lot of times you're just going
to go for that knee to the head.

637
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,280
You got to take that chance.

638
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,550
And I think that's what Eddie said
and I think Dustin believed him too.

639
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:25,480
Cause you know Dustin's stood up for
him in the, the post fight interview.

640
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,950
He was like,
don't you do this band?

641
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,730
It's like he's the guy who got hit with
the illegal shot and he was still saying,

642
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:35,470
don't do this God.
So I asked her after the fight,

643
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:40,210
I said, what did you think that
go? These are the old rules, right?

644
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,160
So if the, if it's the old
rules and one hands down, uh,

645
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,500
then it's illegal, right?
He goes, yes, he goes,

646
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,800
but I don't feel like it was
bearing weight. He goes, you know,

647
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:53,860
he's definitely playing the game. And he
definitely was putting his hands down,

648
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:58,861
but I felt like the first time it wasn't
bearing weight and that's how I define

649
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:04,660
it. And he's like, and then the second
time, uh, it was a legit mistake.

650
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:07,060
The second time was,
was definitely illegal,

651
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,380
but I felt like he was in the middle
of throwing it when it all happened.

652
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,270
And I think he's correct in that.

653
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,500
So he's the guy that's closest to the
action and he's got to make like the most

654
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,251
pertinent decision.

655
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:23,251
I also think it's going to be a weird
issue with referees that do events that

656
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:25,300
have the new rules.

657
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,990
And then do events that have the old
rules and it's pretty much universally

658
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,000
agreed that the new
rules are the way to go.

659
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,730
So with the touching and
the hands on the mat,

660
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,900
it's going to be interesting to see
if there's like an interpretation that

661
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:41,770
favors the way the new rules
perceive it versus the old rules.

662
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:45,670
Cause that's how her kind of referee
that fight. He went with the sort of the,

663
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,630
the feeling of the new rules or like
what people want out of the new rules,

664
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,620
but still within the confines he believes
and he knows it better than me of the

665
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:58,310
old rules. Why weren't the new
rules adopted for Texas last year?

666
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,450
I don't know.
You know,

667
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,980
I mean I think it's probably
different with each organization.

668
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,260
They have to make decisions
and they decide themselves
whether or not they have,

669
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,810
I mean it might be a budget issue and
maybe they don't have the time to review

670
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:12,580
it. I don't know. It might be a, they
disagree, you know, I who knows man.

671
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:13,414
And you know,

672
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,990
these athletic commissions can make their
own decisions when it comes to that.

673
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,120
But as far as like the good of the sport,

674
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,760
it would be nice if we
all agreed and I think,

675
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,150
I don't think the real concern would be
whether or not it's bad for the safety

676
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:25,960
of the fighter.

677
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,500
I don't think it is because I think
it encourages fighting more than an

678
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:33,220
encouraged stall techniques.
So if you give someone a stall technique,

679
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,350
the ability to put your hands on the
ground, you won't get kneed in the face,

680
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,870
you're going to take it.
Some guys are,

681
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,780
in some situations it's going to be a
desperado move that if it's there you're

682
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,380
going to reach for it. But if it's
not there, you won't reach for it.

683
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,030
So like it terms of like the actual
effectiveness of overall fighting and like

684
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:53,840
the realism of real, of of
fighting. It's better to get it out.

685
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,550
We don't want it in there because I don't
think it really does protect people.

686
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,390
I think the people that are going
to get need are going to get need.

687
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,690
I think what it does is it
protects you for that brief moment,

688
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,690
but in the decision that
you make to do that,

689
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,180
like you're making a
purely defensive decision,

690
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,610
you're putting your hands on the mat,
both of them.

691
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,790
So this guy can't need you in
the face. That's, you know,

692
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:16,160
that's like not a good sign
in a fight. Right. You know,

693
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:19,220
you're in a bad position and sometimes
you can rebound from a that position,

694
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:22,160
no doubt about it. But it's, I
don't think we should reward,

695
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,390
I don't think you should have these
escape routes where somebody can touch the

696
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:30,260
mat and not yet be able to. It's
like I'm on base safe, you know?

697
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,090
So I think her was right ultimately,
but according to the right,

698
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,010
the strict interpretation of the rules,
it was an illegal blow.

699
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,500
So it was interesting that
he made it a no contest.

700
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,180
You can sort of get away with
that Sorta as leeway. Right.

701
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,100
Well, it's, um, you know, it's open to
interpretation. I guarantee you the,

702
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,450
I haven't read anything online, but I
guarantee you it'll be a controversial,

703
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,290
I mean it's just a hot button subjects
to people to be debating it back and

704
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:58,110
forth and there's going to be people
that agree with her is going to be people

705
00:42:58,111 --> 00:43:01,080
that disagree with them. But um, you know,

706
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:04,650
ultimately that's the toughest
job next to being a fighter.

707
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,930
It MMA did get be the guy who has to make
those calls and I give them a shit ton

708
00:43:09,931 --> 00:43:10,764
of respect,
man.

709
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,230
I used to be on a baseball umpire,
like for little league and that,

710
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,390
that was hard and like to think
like, man, so much passion. Yeah.

711
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,260
It's like a tie in. If I go safe that
this side goes crazy, but if I go out,

712
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,600
that's side goes crazy and it's so close.

713
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,590
And to think that those guys have to
make those decisions we do to health and

714
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,820
lies that those are fathers and children
and brothers and sisters and everything

715
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,050
and like that's crazy gig.
Yeah.

716
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,740
Knowing how many punches and whether
the person's just sort of seems like

717
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:46,100
they're out of it or if there's still
defending themselves and their whole

718
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:49,220
livelihood. Yeah. Crazy job.

719
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,560
Yeah, it is a crazy job, Ben. It's, um,

720
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,640
and you have to know a lot about MMA
and you have to really understand when a

721
00:43:56,641 --> 00:44:00,150
guy's actually in trouble, when
you need to step in, you know,

722
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,670
you have to have seen a
bunch of guys get hit.

723
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,390
You got to know when a guy has done
and it's subjective and you know,

724
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:09,150
you can make bad calls and
sometimes you make bad calls.

725
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,800
There's nothing you can do about it. I
mean, the early days, big John McCarthy,

726
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,080
uh,

727
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,730
was refereeing a fight between Matt
Lindland and Barolo Bustamante and Marilla

728
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,050
booster Montay taps Matt Lindland. And
then Lynn Lynn said that you didn't tap.

729
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,210
So they restarted the fight and they
went back at it again and then Bustamonte

730
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:35,010
tapped them again at later round.
So he tapped him twice in the same fight

731
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,080
when it happened. And when you were
commentating? I believe so. And like,

732
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,260
did you see him tap on the video?
Do you remember?

733
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,970
Trying to remember if I was commentating.
It's hard to remember.

734
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:49,650
It's like they all get blurry after a
while. I'm pretty sure I was, but man,

735
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:53,970
I might not have been. Now that I think
about it, I'll have to go back and listen.

736
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,160
But I remember the fight clearly cause
I remember I remember going, oh no,

737
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,590
it's stood him up and now they're going
to make them fight again. I'm like,

738
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:04,200
that's crazy. You already
won though. He Won.

739
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,530
Like all you got to do is look at the
replay and you get see Lindland Tab.

740
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,710
And he said, look, he's, if they
give him another chance to fight,

741
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,630
he's going to take another
chance to fight. If he can.

742
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:16,980
Con is way back in the fight and
he's going to do it. So he, he said,

743
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,680
I didn't tell him because have to go back
in there again. That's a ball or move.

744
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,020
It's a jump ball or move.

745
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,170
I didn't have,
I was just moving my hand bag.

746
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,560
Well more ball or move his Bustamonte
tapping them again is there go really.

747
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,600
And then he caught him with
the GFC and the second time,

748
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,970
but that's happened before.

749
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,510
That's happened in fights before we'd
guys said they didn't tap when they did.

750
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,580
And so because of that people have been
forced to like hold submissions and you

751
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:45,010
know, and wait till the referee
like literally separates them.

752
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,440
But that's also what got people like
people are super sensitive about that with

753
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:54,060
knee bars. Like what? Chokes
doesn't seem to bother be bliss.

754
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,450
Much like people don't get mad
if somebody holds onto it. Shows

755
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,110
speaking nice.
Another thing I thought was really cool,

756
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,820
the last thing with the other female fight

757
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,130
and the lady's kicks from her back.
Oh yeah.

758
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,810
Unbelievably effective. Cortney
Casey. Yeah, right on the kneecap.

759
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,720
Trying to hyper extend those legs.

760
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,680
And even from our angle it looked
like it was really working.

761
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:27,130
You could see her leg bending back
and she didn't want to fuck with that.

762
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,280
After awhile.
No.

763
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,230
In the beginning crowd was going crazy
cause the bigger girl dragged her to the

764
00:46:32,231 --> 00:46:35,980
middle of the ring by your foot. You know
what I mean? It got the crowd into it.

765
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,540
But as the fight went on,

766
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:41,530
she was beating the shit out of her from
her back with feed. It was very, very,

767
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:43,360
very awesome.
Again,

768
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:46,330
like I wish I knew what you guys were
talking about over there because over

769
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:50,890
there I'm like, it's interesting because
you're sort of watching fight in arena.

770
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,470
You're sorta like on an island
by yourself when you're not,

771
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,460
we need under the headset on
and you can't hear you guys. But

772
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,610
watching it right in front of you too,

773
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,890
you're not really seeing it on
the monitor is very much. Right,

774
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,120
exactly.
So it's all very like,

775
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,390
we're just trying to make sure
that what you're seeing is real.

776
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,850
It's weird not hearing you guys.

777
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,320
I hear you guys everywhere else at
home on the Internet, on the phone,

778
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:19,460
but you're that close to the action.
Yeah, it's habit. It's bizarre. Yeah.

779
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,750
So what were you guys,
what was that like where you going?

780
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,570
Well I was impressed.

781
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,740
Well saying that like what she's doing
is like kind of next level up kicking

782
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,390
like are up kicks were so good and
that was making a mistake. I mean,

783
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,460
right in front of her. It was Daniel's
point and then Aguilar's Niesr are jacked.

784
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,720
She kept getting hyper
extended and Daniel's saying
all the different things she

785
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:38,650
could do to avoid that,

786
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:42,040
but I was just so impressed with
Courtney Casey's up kegs. I was like,

787
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:45,250
she's taken up, kicks to the next
level and I'm thinking like, man,

788
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,250
I bet up kicks here. Just one of those
things that if you just practice it,

789
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:49,570
you get really good at it.

790
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:52,810
I bet we haven't really seen
the full potential of appkit's.

791
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,860
I bet somebody would just be so deadly
that you wouldn't even want to get close

792
00:47:56,861 --> 00:47:57,580
to them when they're on their,
yeah,

793
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,130
bad. Right. Imagine that opponent, the
one that just lays down as soon as the,

794
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,470
just pretend to fall down and
fuck you up off their back.

795
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,021
Hey,

796
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:11,550
I still feel like Nate Diaz was setting
a trap for Conor in that second fight.

797
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:12,600
Those two times

798
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,160
that could have very well big,
right.

799
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,790
Totally see him move. Trying to make it
look like that was one of their plans.

800
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,280
Make it look like Conor
got me on the chin.

801
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:25,030
Like Connor overreact and then
did he say that? Did he say that?

802
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,590
I never officially heard it.

803
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:29,140
He may have said it in like a post
press conference or something,

804
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:33,060
but it felt like a mousetrap
to me and I don't even know.

805
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,130
I don't even know if he would admit
that if, if it, even if he would,

806
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:37,960
because I don't think he'd
want to give away strategies.

807
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,150
Right, right. Well I think, look,

808
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,940
he's got such a giant
advantage on the ground.

809
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,920
Imagine if Nate Diaz became like a
killer wrestler. Like Nate Diaz is like,

810
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,140
you know Kevin Randleman
back in the day like, shoot,

811
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:54,110
these power doubles and Kevin
dudes on the ground like Nate Diaz,

812
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:56,660
his ground game is very high level man.

813
00:48:56,661 --> 00:49:00,710
He's super nasty and mixing up
strikes with his submissions too.

814
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,400
Like what's set up? That's a mission.
First of all is the strikes on the feet.

815
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,970
He popped Connor and the jaw had them
rocks and they got him on the ground.

816
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:11,810
It was busting them up on the ground and
then Conner gave up his back trying to

817
00:49:11,811 --> 00:49:15,110
escape the mount and he chokes up mean

818
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:20,380
beat him standing up. Yup. That's
shot. Connor took was absolute garbage.

819
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,770
Oh, he was just, it was really hurt.
Yeah. Yeah. He was just trying to hang on.

820
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,540
It was just trying to hang on.

821
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:32,240
It's Harvard. Was that right
last week? Said that too.

822
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,000
Tarver yeah. The guy who was the
Alexa. Yeah. He's, you know, he's the,

823
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:41,680
I'm new striking coach for American
top team. Oh really? Oh Wow.

824
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,330
I did not know that. Or the
black zillions. I'm sorry.
The black zillions. Sorry.

825
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,940
Yeah, he's, the new striking
coach was backstage. Man,

826
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:50,770
that's such an offensive
thing that I just said.

827
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:55,030
You don't even know blacks don't answer
the American top team of a giant, uh,

828
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,770
they have a giant rivalry with each other.

829
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,290
So that's the point where they had
an ultimate fighter where they,

830
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,870
the two teams faced off against
each other for a whole season.

831
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,920
So my apologies to American top
team. Black zillions go. Either way.

832
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,940
Tarver is a bad motherfucker. Remember
when he knocked out Roy Jones. Yeah.

833
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,730
Amazing Dude.
Anyway,

834
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:16,420
he said that it should be Nate Diaz
going up against Floyd Mayweather because

835
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:21,421
Niki as be Conor McGregor and I'm
totally on that same wavelength.

836
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,890
Reds like, yeah, what are
we talking about here?

837
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:27,680
Like I just want to see more of
the Diaz brothers overall anything.

838
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:29,090
I guess that's my thing is that,

839
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,170
well, I agree that it definitely
was still sell a shit ton of money.

840
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,070
That's a shit ton of paper views.
Rather make a shit ton of money. I mean,

841
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,850
I just don't think that Nate Diaz has
the international appeal to Connor has,

842
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,470
right?
Nate Diaz should,

843
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,240
Nate Diaz and America as a Goddamn hero
and I don't think the UFC is totally

844
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:49,150
aware of what a big star he is.

845
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,850
I think so either. I think, I think
he's, he could be just three, four,

846
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:57,350
five fights away from me. My Gregory
is to Ireland. Yeah, from Mexico.

847
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,900
He's American, Bro. I know.
Trust me, we're all American,

848
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,970
but my point is like,
you know, they need that.

849
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:13,070
I think. I think UFC really still
needs huge Mexican superstar.

850
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:16,550
I think that they've had them, and
I don't mean from Mexico, Mexico,

851
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:17,780
I mean like just Mexico.

852
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,560
Does that help people get into it
and it's a big part of it? Well,

853
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:22,700
that's one of the champions.

854
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,970
One of the things that people are
excited about what the IEA Rodriguez, uh,

855
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,840
but it just bit off way more than he could
chew last night against Frankie Edgar.

856
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,760
Frankie just mauled him.
Yeah. Like literally Malden.

857
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,360
The best defense is a good offense
and he just kept going at it. Well,

858
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,930
yeah, as a person who's a kicker,
like you, you realize when you're,

859
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,350
you're kicking and you're standing on
one leg, I mean, you're vulnerable.

860
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:52,060
You're just more vulnerable to being
taken down by a guy who's an elite MMA

861
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:55,990
wrestler. And when I say MMA wrestler, I
mean the guy was used to catching kicks,

862
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,660
understands where the kicks are coming,
where they're coming from,

863
00:51:58,661 --> 00:52:03,370
knows when it's happening.
There's no hesitation. Dives
on it and takes you down.

864
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:09,590
No, thank you. No, no, thank you. I know
I'm good at, I'm good at everything. Okay.

865
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,600
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

866
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,010
Feel like I've been watching Frankie
Edgar forever. You have been,

867
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,390
I mean he beat Bj Penn for the title Shit.

868
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,190
I don't know when it was,

869
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:26,110
but I want to say it was
like 2008 or nine maybe.

870
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,760
That was a long time ago.
Man,

871
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:33,810
he's still in the heat at one 45 I mean
he proved with that fight that he is in

872
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:34,654
the heat.

873
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:35,741
He looks great.

874
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:39,980
Afterwards he walked out near us and
like it's like didn't even look like he

875
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:42,190
fought that day.
Very amazing.

876
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:46,710
Yeah. It just goes to show you how
good although really is, you know,

877
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:51,510
cause all of those already beaten
them twice. Yeah. The thing is, man,

878
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,980
I want to see all doe vs Mcgregor,
but it's a hard sell.

879
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,800
When someone knocks you out in 13 seconds,

880
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,010
it's super hard to say. I got an and
you've got to get a second shot at him.

881
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,220
I think it goes both ways.

882
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:10,520
I think it makes it hard to get another
shot at him and I think it makes it easy

883
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:14,800
to get another shot at them because we
know that's like God damn nominally.

884
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,810
I know we would all feel silly if,

885
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:21,110
say they did it again and he knocked
him out in eight seconds and we're like,

886
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:21,963
are you

887
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,730
good? Let me tell you something.
He could. Connor could

888
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,120
if does that,
that we melt down that belt.

889
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,650
We melt down the gold into a crown and
you cut it on Connor's head and you say

890
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,850
you're done. Go enjoy your
crown. Done. You're on your,

891
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,690
you're now on game of Thrones.
You're no longer a fighter.

892
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,580
Isn't that an amazing as the
land he requested a crown. Yeah.

893
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,220
I don't fight for belts anymore.
I fight for crowns.

894
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:52,170
I melted my belt into the crown.
That's a terrible accident. That's a,

895
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,650
I don't do that.
That's what the undertaker once did.

896
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:00,060
Even ones melted down
the WWF belt into like a,

897
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,740
a championship, like a necklace.
Didn't really, no, it wasn't
actually, I wasn't him.

898
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,040
That was like a, the Godfather.
That was like a pimp. He was like,

899
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,040
he won the ww belt and the had the gold
melted down into like a pimps left.

900
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,840
Oh my God. Basically fuck
yo belt. That's hilarious.

901
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,230
My necklace now. I love the
storylines like that. Oh yeah.

902
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,880
It's wrestling is so campy.
It's so silly as my,

903
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,380
the thing about wrestling as though,
man, when you joke around about it,

904
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,080
people get super upset who they supported.
Oh,

905
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,970
they get upset.
They get sort of very happy to.

906
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,320
I think it goes both ways.

907
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,010
It takes those real more
on Nigga upset about it.

908
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,150
There's a lot of real morons out
there though. Hey, you had me up,

909
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:55,151
said that one time saying that it was
not real and we know it's not real.

910
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:58,200
Like that part's not surprising.

911
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,050
But you kept saying that like
game of Thrones was a real,

912
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:10,800
you're watching a play. You go to see
musicals. It might as well be singing.

913
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,470
Sometimes they sing on wrestling too.

914
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,270
You know Daniel Cormier is a big
wrestling fan. Oh yeah. I'm sure he is.

915
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,980
He's a silly fellow.
Yeah,

916
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,720
but there's definitely a lot of that.

917
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:28,490
I mean we talked about this years ago
on a podcast where I said, you know,

918
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:33,550
I think more elements of pro wrestling
in the UFC would do him justice because

919
00:55:33,711 --> 00:55:36,890
it's just makes for entertainment.
And since then this, you know,

920
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:39,920
this Irishman has become a big deal,

921
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,870
the Diaz brothers and
these tough characters.

922
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,020
We're starting to just find out more
about the characters and that's sort of

923
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:46,730
what I meant.
Nothing fake or anything,

924
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:51,260
but just the entertainment part is a big
side of the UFC and it's a big side of

925
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:54,760
boxing and it's a big side of
the wall of sports. And uh,

926
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:59,390
I think the UFC is like really embracing
that and also having a little bit of

927
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:01,900
trouble embracing it,
but also embrace it.

928
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,060
Well,
I think they definitely embrace it,

929
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,980
but you also have to respect the
hierarchy of championship. Like when the,

930
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,360
like the Amanda Nunez Ronda Rousey thing,

931
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:14,140
when they were doing that big promo and
they were only featuring Ronda Rousey,

932
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,810
I don't know whose decision that was.
I'm not going to criticize them.

933
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:19,450
They did their best.
They created a very interesting,

934
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,630
compelling little peeps that
got me fired up about the fight.

935
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,560
I fired up about the fight when I saw
that. So they did a good job on it,

936
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,780
but I don't think they paid nearly enough
attention to the danger that is Amanda

937
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,220
Nunez.
And I think that if they showed that,

938
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,750
it would have made it even more
compelling as Amanda's a fucking monster.

939
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,410
That chick hits hard,
she's ferocious,

940
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,190
she's nasty on the ground and she
knows how to win and she's an attacker.

941
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:49,270
And if they just showed the highlights,
man just showed her, beaten up,

942
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:53,470
Misha Tate strangling her. They
showed her putting it to people, man,

943
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:57,340
the way she did the Sarah Coffin
or not Sarah Copy Sam Mcmahon did.

944
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:58,300
She's a beast.

945
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,800
And so they didn't even really concentrate
on it and she was the champion.

946
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,100
And I was like, well that's silly.
I got them all for the showbiz part.

947
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:07,900
But you're missing out on one star here.

948
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:13,170
You're focusing on one on your current
star and missing out on an opportunity to

949
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:14,770
highlight a new star,

950
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,390
by the way.
And that's not even,

951
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:20,960
that's what I'm saying is that that
isn't the show. Best Way to do it.

952
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:24,480
The show Biz way to do it
is to pump up nooner. Yes.

953
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,860
And to show that when like if
Vince Mcmahon was running it.

954
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:28,880
I know that sounds crazy,

955
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:31,520
but that's what he would do is since
he doesn't know who's going to win,

956
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,660
he would pump up Nunez instead of Rhonda.
We already know Rhonda.

957
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,560
So when Rhonda Beats Nunez,
it's like Ron does bad.

958
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,131
You didn't know,

959
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:44,660
I had heard that Vince Mcmahon
was thinking about buying
the UFC when it was for

960
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,900
sale. Crazy. That would
have been if he took over.

961
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,930
He's bought all of his other competition
except for boxing throughout history.

962
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,700
And I think the UFC is obviously not
competition, but I think that uh,

963
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,110
I think it would have been interesting
to see what he would've done.

964
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,830
It would've been interesting to see if
he would have let it keep building or if

965
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:06,160
he would've just cut it out
and disintegration. Yeah.

966
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,640
Well it's also interesting,

967
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:11,300
we'll just see whether or
not it's problematic to
have a guy from the show Biz

968
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,900
side of athletics,
which there's no doubt about it.

969
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:16,880
Those pro wrestlers are fucking athletes.
Yeah.

970
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,340
You can't look at Brock Lesnar
and tell him he's not an athlete.

971
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:22,850
You can't look at John Cena. Tell me he's
not an athlete. The Rock, all those guys,

972
00:58:22,851 --> 00:58:25,640
they're fucking stud athletes.
No doubt about it. Yeah.

973
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,110
I don't know another gay guy.

974
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,250
Yeah, that's mark was the guy that, yeah,

975
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,290
like when Bronc Lester did that three
60 flip in the air and landed on his

976
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:36,560
fucking head and still finish the match,
like okay,

977
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,580
that's if you like Cirque de Solei.
Do you think those people are athletes?

978
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,510
For sure. This guy, this
is a serious athlete. Yeah.

979
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,160
But there's also the fact
that it's entertainment.

980
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,510
So if a guy goes from that side of
the business and then it goes to the,

981
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,250
the side of the business where
it's supposed to be pure sport,

982
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,590
which is the pure sport MMA,
right.

983
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:59,690
And a sport that has
always had a reputation,

984
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,540
or at least the whispers of being fixed.

985
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:06,590
You're always hearing about a fixed fight.
Like in Japan in particular,

986
00:59:06,591 --> 00:59:10,850
you heard about a bunch of fixed fights
and there was a recent case where

987
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:15,851
someone in the UFC had an offer to fix
a fight but didn't go through with it.

988
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:18,080
But there was evidence,

989
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:23,081
apparently there's a big story about
couple of couple weeks ago about the first

990
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:26,120
evidence that someone was
attempting to fix a fight.

991
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,070
So even though it didn't get fixed,

992
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:32,300
someone had tried to put influence
on someone to fix a fight, allegedly.

993
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,790
But in pride,
we know for a fact it happened.

994
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,020
I know that I know firsthand from
people that were in fixed fights.

995
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,700
I know from people that were told that
a fight was going to be fixed for them.

996
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,260
So it's,
it's not,

997
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,950
it's not speculation whether or not there
was fights that had been fixed in the

998
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:52,040
past. So to have a guy like Vince
McMahon come over and run things,

999
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,880
they would have to be a
very clear delineation.

1000
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,020
I think he'd have at least really good
ideas. Oh really? No doubt about it.

1001
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,640
But I know this, the Diaz brothers would
be fighting and it would be crazy shit.

1002
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,670
It'd be Connor versus nick after
the neat thing, and it would be,

1003
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,770
I think you're right. And things like
that because it's, he knows that pop,

1004
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,020
you know what they do is they
just listened to the crowd.

1005
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,480
That's how they write it.

1006
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:18,580
It's not like some thing where
he's going to stick to some,

1007
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:19,780
well sometimes he does.

1008
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:22,900
That's why everybody hates that one
guy Roman reigns because he just keeps

1009
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:23,770
letting him win,

1010
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:27,430
which is like for the first time a
storyline that we've never even heard of.

1011
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,130
This is the crowd hates this guy,
but they keep letting him win.

1012
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:33,670
So now he gets nothing that heat, nothing
but booze because we were like, fuck,

1013
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:37,240
this guy sucks. Why? We know you're
going to let him win. It makes no sense.

1014
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,240
So he's fucking with us really good.
But other than that guy,

1015
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:44,080
other than that exception, he listens
to the crowd and then like you know,

1016
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,540
I mean it's just another perfect example.

1017
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:49,450
Looking back with a new nose Rhonda thing.
Looking at that analogy,

1018
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:53,320
he would have focused
on the Diaz brothers.

1019
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:58,350
Any would have focused on Nate waking
up and smoking a joint and going for a

1020
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:02,590
run. Like he would embrace that side
of that storyline because that is the

1021
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:07,570
interesting part. That's what
everybody's saying about, you know, the,

1022
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:12,760
the Jon Jones for me, I think over
the er at that presser is like,

1023
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,260
I did cocaine all weekend and beat you
up with the Diaz brothers have been

1024
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:20,620
running triathlons while drinking
tequila and smoking joints.

1025
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,890
Like it's nothing like,
they don't even think about that.

1026
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,900
It's like how we have a cup
of coffee in the morning.

1027
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:30,130
They literally smoke a joint. I read
an in thing, they smoke a joint,

1028
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,990
but for getting up and going on a
10 mile run the fuck outta here.

1029
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,230
This guys their hand. I'm also,
and that should be embraced.

1030
01:01:38,231 --> 01:01:40,570
That should be talked about.
That should be part of their storyline.

1031
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:43,510
That's what I love about
them is because by the way,

1032
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,300
even though I'm not a super athlete,
that's sort of how I live.

1033
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,890
I like smoking pot.

1034
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:52,990
I like drinking at night with my friends
and I think I still can get my work

1035
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:56,140
done and do all that and
have fun and be productive.

1036
01:01:56,141 --> 01:01:59,290
And that's sort of where I connect
with those guys and why I liked her.

1037
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,700
So granted,
I'm a comedian,

1038
01:02:00,701 --> 01:02:03,700
it's more fitting for my lifestyle
to be able to smoke pot and drink,

1039
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:09,190
but I think that them being able to do
all that inspirational and goes to show

1040
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:13,000
you that you can have fun and work
hard and work hard and have fun.

1041
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:13,501
Yeah,

1042
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:18,501
they're really unusual too in that most
people associate triathletes and you

1043
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:20,010
know athletes

1044
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,160
and we'll likely that you don't think
of them as like thugs, you know?

1045
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,300
But you think of Nick Diaz,

1046
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,350
you think of it as this bad motherfucker
that also happens to run triathletes.

1047
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:32,310
He's not like some granola crunch and
I can just street dude who knows how to

1048
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:37,230
fight and then at the same time he is
what? I'll have another one. Me Too.

1049
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:42,210
Please. Thank you very much. Thank
you. It's funny because like yeah,

1050
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,000
they're there. They go both
ways to where it's like, yeah,

1051
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:49,110
that's a thug street dude.
If you look at his Instagram,

1052
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:53,030
you see him in this like little bicycle
outfits. The guys on bicycles, the way

1053
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,910
Nick Diaz wearing a fucking bicycle
helmet get out of here. What?

1054
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,100
He has a hilarious story about getting
in a Bra. In one of those things,

1055
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,770
people didn't know any better
like something happened.

1056
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:07,740
He was riding a bike and he wound up
getting a fight with this other dude is

1057
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:11,870
riding a bike and a couple of dudes at
the same time. It takes one Duke down,

1058
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,070
get some any heel hook fucks his leg up.

1059
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:19,740
Some other dude,
I've got back on his bike control off,

1060
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,240
but just they fucked with them.

1061
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:24,120
The of the mayor in a bicycle race
and you're like, you know what?

1062
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:27,750
I'm mad at this guy. I'm going to
start a fight with this guy. Hey Man,

1063
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:29,880
if you'd want to go looking for fights,
you can find them.

1064
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,910
Here's a lot of people out there that
are just looking for a fight. I mean,

1065
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:34,410
if I was going to look for a fight,

1066
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:38,790
that's where I would look for a bunch
of people racing bicycles, right?

1067
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,560
Boy, did you fuck up and he picked a
fight with Nick Diaz. You're like, wait,

1068
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,600
this dude is a little bicycle shorts.
I'm gonna beat his ass.

1069
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:50,310
All of a sudden you're like, why is
my knee sideways rips? What a fucking,

1070
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,180
what a crazy move to doing up
street fight. He heal hooks.

1071
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:58,920
You tears your Nia part.
That's what's interesting.

1072
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:03,150
You know, and not only that aspect but
so many more with those guys. It's like,

1073
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:03,570
yeah.

1074
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:08,130
And they also look like street fighters
that are going to punch you in the face,

1075
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,030
but they're also great
seeing high level black belt.

1076
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:17,820
You know, Jujitsu super hardest.
Yeah, 100% of the highest degree.

1077
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:19,590
So it's like they just,
because,

1078
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:24,270
and I think that helps and that perception
like psychologically like it's like,

1079
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:27,120
you know,
it makes you think like fuck this con,

1080
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,800
but you're realizing that there's
eloquent beauty coming at you in the art.

1081
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:36,310
It's just because they look one way.
It's almost a distraction of like,

1082
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:39,750
it's almost like a Venus fly trap.
How it's like all pretty and it's like,

1083
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,850
you know, the opposite,
but it's like made to,

1084
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:47,190
made to bring you in and then it just
snaps by using its natural element where I

1085
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:50,880
think it's sorta reverse where they
sort of make you think they're punks.

1086
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:55,980
But they're not. They're smart as
fuck and there it's a trap. Yeah.

1087
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,740
Yeah. It's good point, man. It's like a,

1088
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,930
you would think that dude's
doesn't have that kind of shit.

1089
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,610
Talking attitude couldn't really fight,

1090
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,830
but they fight real good and they're
real technical and they have crazy

1091
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:09,210
endurance and discipline,

1092
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,950
which is what's really weird about it is
how much discipline may have, you know,

1093
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,030
you would think a guy,

1094
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,100
when a guy would talk a lot of shared
like with something mother fucker stocked

1095
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,880
and Motherfucker,

1096
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,970
that's not going to be a guy who run
marathons and swim back and forth from

1097
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:26,320
Alcatraz, but it is. That's what's
crazy about. Thank you so much.

1098
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,570
Is it okay if your voice is used
in the background of a podcast?

1099
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,800
Is it okay if your voice is in
the background of a podcast?

1100
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,270
We're recording something. Many people are
going to us. Is that okay? That's fine.

1101
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:48,340
That's okay. Do you have a
beautiful accident? It's great.

1102
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,070
It's very pretty.
It's just a comedy podcast and we do,

1103
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:58,520
sometimes we do one on a
plane on occasion. Yeah. Okay,

1104
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:04,070
good. All right, thank you. What's
your name again? Yup, Sylvie.

1105
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:09,160
So thank you. Silvie listening.
Sylvie's our guest for this evening,

1106
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:12,340
Ladies and gentlemen.
You heard it, Sylvie?

1107
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,830
A lovely lady with a beautiful accent.

1108
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:21,580
They treat you nice up here and first
class. Yeah, it's fun. Super Nice.

1109
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:23,790
A lot better than being the peasants.
Dude,

1110
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,760
I'm going to take your spoon in your
mouth and I'm putting in my coffee.

1111
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:29,830
I don't give a fuck.
How about that dude?

1112
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:34,810
I'm not scared of Shit even
embedded in my mouth. But like uh,

1113
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,680
people will share joints that you won't
share a spoon or do you think you're

1114
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:39,514
doing bitch,

1115
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,193
don't be scared

1116
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,320
with those guys is really wacky and
it's big part of their success, man.

1117
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And another crazy thing is that is how
psychologically damming the flatbeds.

1118
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:59,370
Oh, yet the way that guy beat you
have about it is fucking hilarious.

1119
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,290
And it's so true.
And because of the bed,

1120
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:05,970
I'd gotten to think about it a lot more
in sort of analyze it a lot more in from

1121
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:09,420
different angles than just as
I was as an MMA fan before.

1122
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:13,260
And really figure out what it
is sort of behind it. I mean,

1123
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,880
not that I know more than anybody,
but it's sorta like the guys,

1124
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,700
if it makes you overcharge,

1125
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:25,701
all of a sudden they become a matador
and you're the bowl by poking you like

1126
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:29,610
that because if you punch another
guy in the face that's expected,

1127
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,790
any of you kick your opponent
in the head that's expected,

1128
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:38,360
but open hand slapping your opponent like
makes people laugh at you and you can

1129
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:42,510
hear like laughter in the crowd.
It's a different type of roar. Right?

1130
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,720
Or like that ric flair woo
that you hear a lot lately.

1131
01:07:45,721 --> 01:07:48,420
Like ooh that those types of pop's.

1132
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,800
I feel like even though you know a lot
of those guys talk about tunnel vision

1133
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:55,080
and this and that,
they can still hear that crowd.

1134
01:07:55,081 --> 01:07:58,470
They feed off of that energy
just like anybody does it alive.

1135
01:07:58,471 --> 01:08:03,030
Anything and you don't want
to get slapped no matter what.

1136
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:03,893
You just don't.

1137
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,240
Randy couture fought
two door Tz spanked him,

1138
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:12,220
got on top of when we stack them
and then we had them stacked.

1139
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,470
He was spanking him and
the crowd was going crazy.

1140
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,060
Spanked his butt.

1141
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,600
Oh Man.
It's ridiculous.

1142
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,580
Some ridiculous shit happens in fights.

1143
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,040
The first time Nick Diaz
fought Robbie Lawler,

1144
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,590
I'll never forget it
because I knew about nick,

1145
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:34,570
I knew about his fights
with Jeremy Jackson,

1146
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:38,290
who is this a really talented striker
that was on the ultimate fighter,

1147
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:41,530
but one of getting in trouble, he was in
jail for something. I forget what it is.

1148
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,240
Uh, it might some bad, like you
said, jail for a long time. Um,

1149
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,020
but anyway, uh, when I first
saw nick fight Robbie Lawler,

1150
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:54,050
he got into the cage and Robbie Lawler
was a phenom back then. You know,

1151
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:57,220
it was probably like, he's probably
like 20 years old, 21 years old.

1152
01:08:57,490 --> 01:09:01,900
And Nick just starts going stucked
in motherfucker. And Robbie's like,

1153
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:06,790
what is this dude said? He said,
come on bitch, come on bitch.

1154
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:10,290
Come on bitch. And while he's calling a
bitch, you could see Robbie Lawler's head.

1155
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:13,150
Like, I can't believe this
dude is calling me bitch. Like,

1156
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:16,150
I can't believe he's telling me a bitch.
He's like trying to get you emotional.

1157
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:18,610
And he got inside Robbie's
head a little bit.

1158
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,870
Yeah. Oh, he got in a
fight. Conor said too,

1159
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:25,800
they don't want to show you those
clips, nick. Never Fuck Conor.

1160
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,950
Nick did fight. Conor kind being a lot
of trouble next. A different animal.

1161
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,440
That would be,

1162
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,570
I was saying that would be a really
interesting fight and everybody's like,

1163
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,320
Nick Diaz is so much bigger. I'm like,
look, Nick Diaz fight 155 pounds.

1164
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:43,520
Nick Diaz can get to one 70 no problem.
Connor fights at one 70

1165
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:47,630
yeah. That is the fight. Yeah. Or
Nay or Nate. That is the fight. Yeah,

1166
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:52,060
the shamrock versus the pop leaf. Yeah.
Look, I liked the idea of them coming.

1167
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:55,270
That's a good, I liked that
dude. I like that marketing.

1168
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:58,750
They do look Kimmy knuckles on
that shamrock and the pot leaf.

1169
01:09:58,751 --> 01:10:01,270
That's strong on Dana White.
Yeah.

1170
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:03,550
They need to hire you and
have some great ideas.

1171
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,860
Would you be interested in
trying to turn this ship around?

1172
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:10,600
As for loose battleship has taken on
some damage. I'd be so little with us.

1173
01:10:10,601 --> 01:10:15,190
Rhonda gets some water damage. I really,
I'm not even kidding. And I, Hey,

1174
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:19,120
I would love that. And B, I
would actually enjoy it. Like,

1175
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:22,810
I mean like we should have a it out
at it. We should have a meeting. It's,

1176
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:27,100
it was such a fan of both
UFC and entertainment,

1177
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:32,050
but my brain naturally, yeah, you
got to do another fight companion.

1178
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,690
Yeah. Those are so much
fun. I missed those.

1179
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:37,280
We haven't had a chance to do one of
those and so long for it. It'll be like,

1180
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,550
I think a lot of guys back when,

1181
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:44,590
back in the day when it was just the TV
used to want to be on like the late show

1182
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:46,720
with David Letterman and stuff tonight.

1183
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:50,980
So literally my goal is
to do more FYC companions.

1184
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,780
That's so fun. It's like the coolest
thing. Yeah. They're so fun, man.

1185
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:00,080
They're the most fun learning some
of that flat earth. She Jitsu,

1186
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,250
they do go off the rails
and the booze gets flowing.

1187
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:11,160
There's just no doubt about it. I'm
both sides. Everybody's side. It's just,

1188
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:15,060
people get so crazy when the boos starts,
but it's,

1189
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,480
it's the best way to watch fights
cause you're not interrupting anybody.

1190
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:21,060
It's not like you're like talking to a
lot of shit while you're in the arena and

1191
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,410
the other people try to enjoy the fight.

1192
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:25,280
You're just the comfort of
your own little studio there.

1193
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,870
You're talking shit with your
friends and people don't have,

1194
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,100
like if I did that during commentary,
it would be incredibly disrespectful.

1195
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:36,180
Like if I wasn't watching the fights
when we were talking about Ufo shows or

1196
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:37,950
pussy or feet,

1197
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,450
like a big flood or whatever
the fuck we're talking about.

1198
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,030
Yeah. You keep it on the fights.
Even yesterday jre and you're like,

1199
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:48,610
let's talk about the fight.
That was a crazy moment.

1200
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,860
Oh, it was nice if you wanted to.
Yeah. Jason Knight, crazy motherfucker.

1201
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,950
You slip a joke. How can I even
been on the Joe Rogan experience?

1202
01:11:56,090 --> 01:12:00,160
Uh, onions have fun. We just did
a companion with wrestlemania.

1203
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:04,320
Me and my pro wrestling friends. We
do a pro wrestling podcasts now. Yeah,

1204
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,070
we did a companion to
Wrestlemania five minutes.

1205
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,170
We got to do that.
You and I have to do one of those.

1206
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,120
It's going to let me know when there's
another big wrestling thing and you and I

1207
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,460
will do a wrestling companion.
Yeah.

1208
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,980
I'm supposed to do a soccer
companion with Ian too.

1209
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,050
Oh Jesus. Why don't you just
do a sleeping companion?

1210
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,030
No, no, no. We're going
to get high as fuck.

1211
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,190
Then we're going to talk some shit about
soccer and you're going with me to see

1212
01:12:28,191 --> 01:12:33,090
Ian knows all lot about soccer. Oh
yeah. Ian Edwards is a real soccer fan.

1213
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:37,680
He does a soccer podcast with some
other dude. I forget who it is.

1214
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,580
See, I think soccer's speak. Some
people think wrestling snake.

1215
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:47,050
Uh, uh, I'm here to tell
ya it's real as fuck.

1216
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:50,770
They definitely have some fake
moments in soccer. I'll tell you that.

1217
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,160
Like when guys accidentally barely get
touched in the face and they fall down

1218
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:58,060
like they got shot, there's a lot of
bitch shit that goes on in soccer games.

1219
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,860
I mean when I say bitch shit with all
disrespect to the bitches out there,

1220
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,750
I'll disrespect or respect rather whatever

1221
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:09,380
team that got like possessed by demons.
That's my team bro.

1222
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:13,781
Yeah.

1223
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:18,250
I gave them the Santa Maria before I
told them we're going to win this shit at

1224
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:19,084
all costs.

1225
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,760
Some scary shit.
No,

1226
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:26,800
that's when you know someone's retarded.
When they believe in demons. Like it's,

1227
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,580
it's a funny thing. I used to have a
bit about this, I need to bring it back.

1228
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,180
But the bit was that like you could talk
about God you want and all you want and

1229
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:40,620
nobody freaks out. But if you started
talking about the devil, people go what?

1230
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,120
And the bill was at like,
George Bush can go, uh,

1231
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:48,570
make God bless our troops in
Afghanistan and everybody goes,

1232
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,950
that's a beautiful sentiment.
But if he says we've located the devil,

1233
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,210
he's in Pakistan,

1234
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:57,530
he's in the mountains and we are going
to knock him out of existence and evil

1235
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:01,620
will end on earth. You'd be like,
what? Hold on. Wait a minute. Hold on.

1236
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,490
The actual devil. Like you found the
devil and you're going to go shoot him.

1237
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:08,100
Is that what you just said?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1238
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,070
You think there's a
real devil? Like if, if,

1239
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:13,300
if someone was on TV and they started
talking about the will of God,

1240
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,680
we wouldn't have a problem with it.

1241
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,780
But if they started talking about the
devil having influence on all the events

1242
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:24,190
of the world and that we have to repent
and we have to realize the Christian way

1243
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:25,870
is the only path to see like Whoa,

1244
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,390
people would go with the fuck
are you talking about the devil?

1245
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:33,890
Like that's the one aspect of Christianity
than in 2017 is super touch and go

1246
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:37,960
with the populace.
Like that's real fringe stuff.

1247
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:42,220
So which shows you like how the religion
is sort of evolving in a weird way.

1248
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:45,580
It's moving away from the most
ridiculous thing to the lease rate.

1249
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:48,790
Like the least ridiculous thing
is like this university is so big,

1250
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,050
it's so infinite.

1251
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:53,470
What are the likelihood that something
is far more powerful than US created it?

1252
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,281
Probably man,

1253
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:59,281
who knows make sense and what if God is
love and the love that binds us together

1254
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:02,770
and creates everything that is life and
other building blocks of life and it's

1255
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:07,210
all, it's one infinite plan that's
too complex for us to understand.

1256
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,790
We can call it God. Okay, I'll
buy that. I'm a smart guy.

1257
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:12,760
I'll buy him a nonsecular
or a secular God,

1258
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,870
but when you start talking about
the devil like it actual devil,

1259
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:20,830
like an actual demon that is tempting
you into doing bad things like,

1260
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,110
come on bitch,
I can't do this with you.

1261
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,000
Like that's too ridiculous
for people today.

1262
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,790
Totally.
It's crazy.

1263
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:32,620
That video that you tweeted out a couple
of days ago that had the entire history

1264
01:15:32,621 --> 01:15:34,210
of the universe and 10 minutes

1265
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,360
isn't that amazing?
So amazing.

1266
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,260
And it just goes to show you how silly
religion is because it's like three

1267
01:15:40,261 --> 01:15:44,880
minutes into the video for
10 seconds. It's just like
Jesus is born, he's existed.

1268
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:49,820
You worship Jesus. Jesus died and
all the other religions too. Yeah,

1269
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:54,830
but it was just one small part of such
a huge millions of years and hundreds of

1270
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,580
thousands of gaps of space in between.
You know what?

1271
01:15:59,581 --> 01:16:02,640
I was horrified by in that
video how little I knew,

1272
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,710
but what he was talking about,
the empires and the Hawaiian God who,

1273
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:11,430
how many you know happened?
Wow, okay. That's what happened.

1274
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,340
Like I really need to like

1275
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,590
get a comprehensive,

1276
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,110
some sort of a book that will give
me like a great world history.

1277
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:23,840
That's something that's easy to follow
or you know what I need to do, man,

1278
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:28,970
I need to listen to Dan Carlin more
listen to hardcore history. Yeah, but see,

1279
01:16:28,971 --> 01:16:31,460
there's just some,
there's so much history.

1280
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:36,110
I mean if you go back thousands of
years like Mesopotamia to today,

1281
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,260
how many different things you have to
be aware of how many different events

1282
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:43,070
and thinking about this stuff when I'm
out there in Joshua tree in the middle,

1283
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:43,621
that doesn't it.

1284
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:47,780
I just took one of those trips a few
weeks ago and I'm looking around at these

1285
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:49,970
rocks.
I'm like sort of by myself,

1286
01:16:49,971 --> 01:16:54,740
these crazy beautiful mountain ranges
that don't even look real and I'm thinking

1287
01:16:54,741 --> 01:16:59,500
like, Oh fuck, have you been doing all
this time? Like yeah, I'm like taught,

1288
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:04,400
you know, not talking to
them but literally like
wondering like, so they just,

1289
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,330
it's like
everything's always changing.

1290
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:13,280
It is just as like I see new and
temporary to those mountains.

1291
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:17,090
Like you watched that video of the history
of the world and all of a sudden you

1292
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:22,091
realize those mountains are just
as temporary as a blurb of lava,

1293
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,750
but it just doesn't seem temporary to
us because our timeframe is messed up.

1294
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,850
But that all that shit used
to be underground like that
Salsa will stall molten

1295
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:35,780
rock from before and it's amazing.

1296
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:40,640
Like the perspective switch on everything,
everything is something else entirely.

1297
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:44,240
That shit was all under water
and it was all in the Mantel.

1298
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,330
It was on the center of the earth.
Now it's high up above.

1299
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,200
It's all fucking like the crazy,

1300
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:54,680
I mean obviously I was deep on mushrooms
as well, having these thoughts,

1301
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,960
but like that's what
it took to get it out.

1302
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:01,820
Yeah, it sometimes takes them like that.
Just to give you a new perspective on it.

1303
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:05,540
You, have you ever been Hawaii?
Not yet. Oh, you gotta go

1304
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:10,560
on the planning on it.
Castillo just went super jealous.

1305
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:14,670
He took his gross battle winnings and
took this girl to Hawaii and the pictures

1306
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,320
just send me that looks so fun,

1307
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,690
Dude. It's amazing there. It's amazing.

1308
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,360
It's a volcano. It's a series of
volcanoes in the middle of the ocean.

1309
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:28,520
They're popping up and there's more of
them that are building up around it.

1310
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:32,900
It's like a a museum that you can go
to his show you the history of Hawaii,

1311
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:37,470
how it was created, and then they also
show you the surrounding islands and, Gee,

1312
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:41,720
I guess it would be like a laba.
Vents are lava,

1313
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,820
like volcanoes that are
underwater right now.

1314
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,910
They're building up and eventually
break the surface of the water,

1315
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:50,990
but they've actually spot and I think,
I can't remember what part,

1316
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:55,490
I think it was in the South Pacific where
they actually watched islands get born.

1317
01:18:55,970 --> 01:19:00,680
They saw volcanic activity and
we're there while islands will,

1318
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:02,840
we're breaking the surface of the water.

1319
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:06,470
Like you can actually see it in some
places and I'm pretty sure they have video

1320
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:09,530
of it. You know, it's basically just
breaching the surface of the water.

1321
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:12,910
But that's how an island is
born and that's what Hawaii is.

1322
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,280
Yeah. And then like once
you go above that water,

1323
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:19,680
you're probably never going
back. No, I don't. I don't

1324
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,970
think so.
I mean who knows?

1325
01:19:20,971 --> 01:19:24,610
I mean maybe millions of years later it
flattens out again or it becomes like

1326
01:19:24,611 --> 01:19:28,680
yellow stone and it blows up and
the whole top pops off of it.

1327
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:32,340
That's the nuttiest shit dude.
Super Volcanoes.

1328
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:35,910
Do they think that a super volcano,
I'm want to say,

1329
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,940
I'm trying to think of how
many thousands of years ago,

1330
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:43,200
I forget how many thousands of years ago,
it might've been like 60,000 years ago.

1331
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:47,340
It think that the human race might have
gotten down to as few as a few thousand

1332
01:19:47,341 --> 01:19:52,020
people. Yeah. That these super volcanoes,

1333
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:56,340
when they below,
they kill enormous amounts of things.

1334
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:00,000
People, animals. But we're so weak, bro.

1335
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,220
When we have to live in the natural world,

1336
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:05,640
we have to try to put it out there
with the bears and the Moose and shit.

1337
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,930
We don't make it now.

1338
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:12,230
We're only doing like we have been living
with clothes on and with fire for so

1339
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:14,670
long we're such bitches.

1340
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:18,240
Cause even cave people were
bitches compared to animals.

1341
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:23,750
You know you still need a cave by figuring
out caves and by figuring out fire

1342
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:29,550
and how to stay warm, we fucked ourselves.
It's probably what made us smarter.

1343
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,570
Yeah. But we, when we first
manipulated our environment,

1344
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,000
we first figured out how to
manipulate our environment.

1345
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:38,430
This has been like a bunch of
desserts day, different stages of it,

1346
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:43,100
but one different states. If it was
shelter so you could be safe. So the,

1347
01:20:43,101 --> 01:20:45,360
the animals weren't
picking off the soft ones.

1348
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,320
So people didn't get as hard as
they were before they had shelter.

1349
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:53,340
If they had some people that survived
that maybe wouldn't have survived a few

1350
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:56,130
decades ago or a few generations ago
or before they figured out caves.

1351
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,730
So those people get to fuck and those
soft bitches make more soft pitches.

1352
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,810
And then they figured out weapons and
then people survive even further and they,

1353
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:06,180
you know, and like they don't
ever get a chance to beat.

1354
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:11,180
Like if imagine if people would be
people with the brains of people with the

1355
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:12,750
bodies of gorillas,

1356
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,870
we'd probably be covered
in hair and arguing. Yeah.

1357
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:23,670
Well it's a compromise because in becoming
softer and softer will become smarter

1358
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:24,840
and smarter.
Right?

1359
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:29,841
Like you don't associate Elan Musk with
being the most shredded barbarian on

1360
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:35,370
earth. Right? No. You associated with a
been a gentleman in a nice suit and a tie.

1361
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:38,490
It was a reasonable human body.
Right.

1362
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:43,820
But when you think about someone who's
like just a super conquer like some Brock

1363
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,193
Lesnar type dude,

1364
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,490
you don't think of Brock Lesnar inventing
some new way to manipulate traffic in

1365
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:54,930
Los Angeles to cut down commute time from
Santa Monica to lax to three minutes,

1366
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:59,070
go on 130 miles an hour and a fucking
sled underground do this. Right.

1367
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,740
I'm not taking Brock
Lesnar's rocket to the moon.

1368
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,030
That's a perfect way to describe it
as the perfect way to describe it.

1369
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:14,010
The brocket.
Yeah.

1370
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:19,220
So it's like as as we become
more and more civilized,

1371
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,530
we all,
and more and more like innovative,

1372
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:25,040
figuring out new ways
to like stockpile food.

1373
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,980
We just get softer and softer and softer.
So when something goes wrong,

1374
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:34,190
like boom, fucking volcano blows up and
you lose everything and it's like it's,

1375
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,930
there's no sun anymore.
You can't grow food anymore.

1376
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,090
You got to go find things
to eat in the woods.

1377
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:41,850
Everybody dies like
you're almost nobody left.

1378
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:46,200
They got down on a few thousand people
and they say that it happens in North

1379
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:51,000
America every six to 800,000 years.
The Yellowstone just Bolos.

1380
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,300
You don't, they didn't even know
about this until satellites,

1381
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,600
when they had satellites, when as soon
as they started looking at images,

1382
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,190
the Yellowstone region,
they,

1383
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:04,250
there was a theory of if being a Caldera
volcano and then they confirmed it that

1384
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,460
the whole yellow stone,

1385
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:10,390
I guess they would call it a base in the
Yellowstone basin is really one giant

1386
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:13,180
crater from a volcano that was so big.

1387
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:18,181
The top blows off and flava shoots like
a mile into the sky or some shit and it

1388
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:23,140
just blocks out everything.
It's like the ultimate super earths zit.

1389
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:27,790
It just, did you ever seen
that website on Instagram?

1390
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:32,800
Instagram page rather Dr Pimple
Popper? Never seen it. It's hilarious.

1391
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:34,690
Is it just this chick is this chick,

1392
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:39,640
she's a doctor but she's a dermatologist
and all she does is like lance assists

1393
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,480
in, squeeze them out. You can't look away.

1394
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,010
You can't look away.

1395
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,990
I know I've watched those
videos but not like that.

1396
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:50,650
I been followed that person yet,
but I bought,

1397
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:53,360
I've gone off on like
youtube tangents of that.

1398
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:58,490
It's just deep Pershing and just
watching it scored out. I'm like,

1399
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,430
Hey,
I don't know why I can't stop watching.

1400
01:24:01,431 --> 01:24:05,060
But it is interesting like whatever
it goes on deep in our bodies.

1401
01:24:05,061 --> 01:24:06,200
It's fucking disgusting.

1402
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:11,390
Well she's amazing at it because she's
a doctor and she has fun with it so it's

1403
01:24:11,391 --> 01:24:15,860
hilarious. She has funny captions
that are a little Instagram account.

1404
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:20,090
It's fucking hilarious dude. And
she has exploders. She's, she's,

1405
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,130
she's cutting the holes on people's heads
and squeeze out like a banana of pus

1406
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,350
and I'm not even exaggerating,
it's just costing.

1407
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,780
Some people's bodies are just nasty.

1408
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:34,580
They just have these like
literal softballs on the
side of their face and she

1409
01:24:34,581 --> 01:24:38,990
caught someone squeezes out
all this yellow shit and
blackheads the size of your

1410
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:43,580
fist. It's so nasty. I
watch it if you insist

1411
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:50,390
upon it, but the get it,

1412
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,760
get it,
get it says

1413
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,900
that's like what the super
volcano is in the earth.

1414
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:02,050
It's just like this giant exploding pos
of Laba and it happens all the time,

1415
01:25:02,991 --> 01:25:05,810
man. And in terms of like
the, the history of the earth,

1416
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,300
it happens every six to 800,000 years.

1417
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,560
They have thousands of oak or thousands
of earthquakes in Yellowstone every year.

1418
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,230
Thousands.
Like little rumbles.

1419
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:20,280
The comedian earthquake was at the
comedy store last week. It's funny, Dude.

1420
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:25,170
So funny dude. He's a good dude too.
Yeah, it's a really friendly guy.

1421
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:29,010
One of the coolest stories like that.
I mean, he's one of the coolest,

1422
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,730
not completely mainstream
famous comedians I know of.

1423
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,490
And I remember working the
door at the comedy store.

1424
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:38,850
He was pretty famous 10 years ago.
I guess you're just white.

1425
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,000
I mean I guess I don't,

1426
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,430
black community earthquake is a
monster in the black community.

1427
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,940
That's different and people are
laying, let's just face it. Exactly.

1428
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,410
Mandy white people laugh at earthquake.
Yeah.

1429
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,820
In the point is it's like I didn't know
about him until I was a door guy at the

1430
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:57,360
store and then all of a sudden somebody
is like earthquakes popping in and

1431
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:58,740
popping of the comedy store.

1432
01:25:58,741 --> 01:26:01,620
If you don't know like there's already
a set lineup so you have to be like

1433
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,490
Onstar,

1434
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:06,510
like a Dave Chappelle comes in or Seinfeld
or like the pop and in it's somebody

1435
01:26:06,511 --> 01:26:09,860
who's like earthquakes popping in. I'm
like, what the fuck is an earthquake?

1436
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:11,470
That man though,

1437
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:15,230
the guy literally got that
name from because like they
said that when he used to

1438
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:16,940
perform in Atlanta and he hit the ground

1439
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,083
shape.

1440
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:23,030
Gee, what a beast. He's like a
black Joey Diaz sort of laser.

1441
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:27,350
He's a very wise, he's a very,
very funny dude and you know,

1442
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:31,650
earthquake is, he's been around man.
He's been killing for a long time.

1443
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:35,910
I couldn't, I just, there's nothing more
fun than finding out those three kids.

1444
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:39,480
No. About, you know, what else is cool
meeting him. He's a nice guy. Yeah.

1445
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,961
That's nice.

1446
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:43,890
When you run into someone like an
earthquake or someone that you respect to

1447
01:26:43,891 --> 01:26:47,190
think they're really funny and they're
cool as fuck too. That's, you know,

1448
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,380
one of the nicest things.
And that's one thing,

1449
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:54,650
like comedians that don't have other
comedian friends are always so weird to me

1450
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,200
because I only know a few of them,
but they're so weird.

1451
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:04,580
A handful of non comedian friends and
I see them very rarely and it's fun.

1452
01:27:05,391 --> 01:27:10,250
I mean, we have fun, but I mean,
I really can't let her rip on us.

1453
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:12,920
It's a comedian,

1454
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:17,410
the one that's having fun and fucking
working a lot, you know what I mean?

1455
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:19,610
No, I do know what you mean. But I,

1456
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:22,570
I have a lot of friends that are comedians
because I feel like it balances me

1457
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:23,290
out a little bit.

1458
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:23,501
Yeah.

1459
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:27,220
You're like a real super human that you
have like hunting buddies and shit and I

1460
01:27:27,221 --> 01:27:30,280
don't have that
pro wrestling,

1461
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:34,320
my hunting buddies or some of my
favorite friends. Yeah, they uh,

1462
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,650
they experience hunting buddies
or some of my favorite friends.

1463
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,510
That's how small bite my,
like John Dudley.

1464
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,500
Yeah. Rebuts yeah, the rivets. Yeah.
They're really good people. Man.

1465
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:51,370
My friend Adam Green tree from Australia.
Fun with him when I was there. Yeah.

1466
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:55,020
Yeah. We had a good time up there, man
in Melbourne. God Damn, that was fun.

1467
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:59,380
Adam Green trees, the salt of the earth,
but it's like all those guys are, um,

1468
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:04,650
they've experienced like intense
form of life and adversity.

1469
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,470
They're hunters and their bow hunters,
which is even more intense.

1470
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:11,130
Like guys like Dudley and guys like Cam,
like they're not,

1471
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,840
they don't have like a
chip on their shoulder.

1472
01:28:12,841 --> 01:28:15,830
They don't have to prove themselves
to anybody. They're out there.

1473
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:20,610
They're trying to do better for themselves
and better at this really difficult

1474
01:28:20,611 --> 01:28:24,720
thing. I was thinking about that man
was like, I'm wearing this shirt today.

1475
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:26,340
She was sure tomorrow.

1476
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:31,410
This is a Eastman's
bowhunting shirt they sent me.

1477
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:37,010
It's a bowhunting magazine and I'm a
podcast Eastman's elevators as podcasts

1478
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,420
that I listen to on bow hunting.

1479
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:44,700
And I was thinking about it like these
people that pursue it the way this guy

1480
01:28:44,701 --> 01:28:47,370
from the Eastman elevated
podcast name is Bryan Barney,

1481
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:51,540
or the way Cam Haynes does it, or the way
John Dudley does it, or Adam Green tree,

1482
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:56,520
they're like, it's, it's not
just like they're hunters.
They're also like athletes.

1483
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,670
Like there's,
this is a very difficult pursuit.

1484
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,940
It's not what everybody thinks is like,

1485
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,860
it's not just simple as finding
an animal shooting with an Arrow,

1486
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:07,590
like getting to the position where
you can shoot an animal with an arrow.

1487
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:09,870
You have to be physically fit.
It's hard to do.

1488
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:11,510
You've got to get up a giant fucking hill.

1489
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:14,870
You got to be able to get there in time.
You gotta be patient,

1490
01:29:14,871 --> 01:29:17,400
you've got to be knowledgeable. You
gotta be quiet, you got to be stealthy.

1491
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,040
You gotta be skillful.
You gotta be able to handle pressure.

1492
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:23,370
You gotta be able to handle your nerves
when you're ready to make this shot.

1493
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:26,610
On an animal's life with a bow and arrow.
There's a lot of shit going on, man.

1494
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,340
You gotta be safe.
You're up in the mountains by yourself.

1495
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:32,850
You've gotta be aware of,
there's predators out there
like real mountain lions,

1496
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:35,910
bears. You're running into grizzlies
knew what I was thinking the other day.

1497
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:39,810
How do you guys eat when you're out
there and bring food? They bring food.

1498
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,400
Like sandwiches. No, you bring,

1499
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:45,240
well there's one company that I
actually had the owner on my podcast.

1500
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:50,390
Uh, God damn it. What the
fuck is Chris's last name?

1501
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,250
I got to, I got to Google his
last name now because if I don't,

1502
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,050
I'm going to feel mad at myself.

1503
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,840
But he's got this company
called green belly meals.

1504
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,363
Was

1505
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:09,040
this the smell? Is the smell
of the food? Make more animals?

1506
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,790
No,
I mean it can shit.

1507
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,370
Now I feel like I have to
log on and find his name.

1508
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,660
Maybe I'll have it on this.
Um,

1509
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,950
anyway, I forget his last name. I
Apologize Dude. You're a good guy.

1510
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,770
I don't mean to diss you life.
Forgetting your name.

1511
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:34,540
He wrote a book too on
the Appalachian Trail.

1512
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:38,650
I just had a mom such a fucking space
cadet. The problem is in the morning.

1513
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:41,530
Tell me if you feel like this when you
have to get up early in the morning and

1514
01:30:41,531 --> 01:30:42,460
like take a flight.

1515
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:47,730
My brain literally works on
like 30% of its capacity.

1516
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,020
Yeah.

1517
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:54,020
We're built like our brains are supposed
to turn on and we have something.

1518
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,660
I'm going to find him in my
little podcast list here.

1519
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:07,080
You got a in here? Yeah, no, I'm
just fucking stupid dude. Yeah,

1520
01:31:07,081 --> 01:31:11,290
I remember when I said that Rumble
Johnson knocks airplanes out of the hair.

1521
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,353
Yeah.

1522
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:19,270
Okay. Chris cage. That's
his name. Sorry Chris. Um,

1523
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:23,480
yeah, it happens. You fuck up. But
my point being he makes us, uh,

1524
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:27,730
he makes these meal bars called
green belly meal bars and uh,

1525
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,580
they're super dense.
You have one packet,

1526
01:31:30,581 --> 01:31:32,770
it's one third of your
nutritional requirements.

1527
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:36,790
Really heavy in calories and like
you want to take stuff like that,

1528
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,530
stuff that's dance,
like take people,

1529
01:31:38,531 --> 01:31:42,550
take a lot of almond butter and
peanut butter, like healthy fats. Um,

1530
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:46,400
there's a company that I really liked
called phat fudge and they make uh, this,

1531
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:48,550
this woman,
she makes a Mary,

1532
01:31:48,551 --> 01:31:52,720
she makes these little packets
and they're like Paleo Fudge.

1533
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:57,160
It's got MCT oil in it and raw
cocoa and it's really good for you.

1534
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,780
It's Matt again,
like real healthy.

1535
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:03,670
You want to take things that are like
real calorie dense cheese is good.

1536
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,280
I'm like Salamis good. Some people
like to take candy bars. They like,

1537
01:32:08,281 --> 01:32:09,490
like some simple sugar,

1538
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:13,330
like if they're really crashing to pick
them back up because the demands are

1539
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:16,600
like pretty extreme and the
demands of on your body.

1540
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:19,630
And I think that's one of the things that
people underestimate when you're going

1541
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:23,470
like 12,000 feet elevation,
13,000 feet elevation,

1542
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,280
the air's super thin. You're
carrying a pack. If you have a rifle,

1543
01:32:27,281 --> 01:32:30,880
the rifles having you're in, you're
hiking and you're going up these steep,

1544
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:32,350
steep hills and you're doing it for many,

1545
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:35,260
many miles to try to get into
position where if the animals are,

1546
01:32:35,261 --> 01:32:37,390
and if your bow hunting,
you know you,

1547
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:41,620
you've got to do that and then you
have to draw your bow back and steady

1548
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:45,340
yourself and execute a shot. When you're
holding your boasts like it's difficult,

1549
01:32:45,341 --> 01:32:48,850
you're holding it freehand, it a rifle,
at least you could rest on something,

1550
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:49,301
you know,

1551
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:53,680
you can rest it on the raw log and all
you have to do is just squeeze slowly and

1552
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:54,910
evenly and pull the trigger.

1553
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,850
You're so much more of a man than I am.

1554
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:59,840
I use all the cheat codes
on grand theft auto.

1555
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:04,370
I don't even know who my way through
the missions on that. I just,

1556
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:08,780
well did you do stand up and stand up
as one of the hardest things for your

1557
01:33:08,781 --> 01:33:13,370
brain that you could do as far as like
dealing with pressure and this is coming

1558
01:33:13,371 --> 01:33:15,180
from someone who is now I know you,

1559
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:19,340
you wrestled in high school so he had
some one on one competition that was nerve

1560
01:33:19,341 --> 01:33:21,230
wracking when you were young and you know,

1561
01:33:21,231 --> 01:33:23,740
and I did a little bit of wrestling
in high school and then I,

1562
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,320
I fought in martial arts tournaments
for a long time and all those things are

1563
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:28,870
scary and nerve wracking.

1564
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:34,370
But comedy is almost ask area at least
was like doing it the first time.

1565
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,780
I was so scared the first time I did it.
And you do that,

1566
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:43,540
you push yourself. I mean, you know
what I mean? Like we do, it never ends.

1567
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:47,680
I mean there's nights probably tonight
when the lineup ends up falling,

1568
01:33:47,681 --> 01:33:48,580
how it falls.

1569
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:53,410
I'm going to be run at one 15
whatever ends up happening.

1570
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:55,900
I'm going to be, it is a
fight. Last week, you know,

1571
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:01,690
last week I remember I had my best
Tuesday spot in my life and it was like,

1572
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:05,860
you know, 11:00 PM or something like
that. Kevin Hart pops and doesn't hour.

1573
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:10,730
I end up judging gross battles to be
popped in and doing an hour an hour on a

1574
01:34:10,731 --> 01:34:14,260
pop band,
which is just a devastating blow.

1575
01:34:14,261 --> 01:34:17,620
That means that everybody,
including myself,

1576
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:19,360
is going on an hour later,

1577
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:24,420
plus audiences drained extra dream from
watching one person do an hour when the

1578
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:27,460
rest of the show was fundamentally
cut up for 15 minutes.

1579
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:30,240
That alone makes it a drag,
like,

1580
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,670
yeah, that's interesting. I didn't
know guys. We're doing that now.

1581
01:34:32,671 --> 01:34:34,470
I didn't know they're allowing
guys to do a whole hour.

1582
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,010
It's on that weird,
you know,

1583
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:40,950
really shouldn't do that though. Oh,
I agree. That fucks with the lot.

1584
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:43,910
If it's a regular night, was it a regular?
Is Tuesdays? I was just saying. Yeah.

1585
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:48,410
Yeah, that's, that's not really that cool
because like it's cool that he comes in,

1586
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,690
that's for sure. Cool. But a whole hour.

1587
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,270
Well that's a part of the word Tommy.

1588
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:55,690
People Thought Tommy was insane back in
the day because he would literally go,

1589
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,280
oh, thank you. What are you crazy?

1590
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,740
You think he's been with an hour here?
This is Mitsis club.

1591
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:02,210
You know when he was nuts with that shit,

1592
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:08,030
I think he was probably the only one
that would, uh, talk to people like that.

1593
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:12,980
Dude, I'm going to paint, so we're
going to pause this. I know folks.

1594
01:35:12,981 --> 01:35:17,180
I never pee during podcasts by surprise.
She been drinking a lot of water.

1595
01:35:17,181 --> 01:35:20,390
I'm trying to hydrate myself more
and it's right now it's a problem.

1596
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:24,080
So we were looking right back. All
right, we're back, ladies and gentlemen.

1597
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:29,081
You know what technology where they really
been slacking is in the innovation of

1598
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:32,880
make an airline. Bathrooms
not smell like poop. Yeah.

1599
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,440
It always smells like poop.
Specifically poop. Yeah,

1600
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:40,010
because someone's pooping into a hole
in the ground and it's not even really a

1601
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:44,120
toilet bowl. It's not wishy washy
water. Here's you plop in a log,

1602
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:45,650
write down on the aluminum siding.

1603
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,100
It's like if you were doing like,

1604
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,240
like it's like those Koala daycare
things where you pull the table down.

1605
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:57,580
Oh yeah. Eating breakfast stuff.
Morning airport restaurants.

1606
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:02,300
Like in people love pooping on flights
by the way. It's like, it's like,

1607
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,830
well, they get nervous. It's people
get nervous, they have to poop.

1608
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:06,923
There's people like,

1609
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:10,430
you know the seatbelt sign goes off
and a guy just goes and takes a dump.

1610
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,280
It's like going to Vegas,
Bro. It's like a 35 minutes.

1611
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:19,380
You can't hold on where people were
already making our descent and you have to

1612
01:36:19,381 --> 01:36:22,980
go take a shit right now. Some
people can't, man. Some people can't.

1613
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:32,040
These virgin stewardesses are
always like very flirtatious

1614
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:34,790
by the flirting with you.
Well not this one,

1615
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:38,950
but the one on the flight out here
you liked or didn't you loved her?

1616
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:43,070
You did. Didn't you heard some ladies
that are not urgent, urgent at all?

1617
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:47,680
Beat up. How dare you? She
went home and have a good way.

1618
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:51,530
You stumbled on the word virgin and you
tried to recover like something extra

1619
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:56,120
hard. Turn off. The TV is upset
that I'm talking about this.

1620
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:01,070
She's like returned DRC time.
Stop Talking Shit About,

1621
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,380
Oh, you're done like me. What? You
like to go from the other flights.

1622
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:14,490
Yeah. Um, anyway, Texas
is a bad ass place,

1623
01:37:14,491 --> 01:37:16,940
isn't it? Yeah. I love
doing chosen Dallas.

1624
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:20,200
I'd been having so much
fun this year in Texas.

1625
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:24,190
I've already been here a few times back
and forth. Austin, Houston, Dallas,

1626
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,660
one of the best comedies,
dates in the country. No doubt.

1627
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,740
I never been to San Antonio. I heard.
That's great too. A lot of guys like work.

1628
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:32,480
I was just there in January.
You got to take all my buddies.

1629
01:37:32,481 --> 01:37:35,600
We went to the royal rumble because
a lot of fun. We ran into Ron White,

1630
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,630
some lady showed up on a
Saturday night at the club.

1631
01:37:38,631 --> 01:37:41,210
We had just gotten to the club.
Some lady comes up to me, he goes,

1632
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:45,020

This mother fucker sent a human being.

1635
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:56,340

He sent a real life human being,

1636
01:37:56,341 --> 01:38:00,720

White's man. It's got its own Tequila son.

1646
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,110
That's crazy. My Mom's
comedian. It's mother's Day.

1647
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,450
That's awesome. It is mother's Day, right?

1648
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:45,320
Shout out to the moms hollow and all
the ladies out there getting knocked up.

1649
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:50,460
Oh yeah. Holla. Making babies strong.

1650
01:38:50,461 --> 01:38:54,720
Thank you to all the chicks out there.
Loved Dick. That's how you make people.

1651
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,530

1654
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,420
It's an amazing that that's like that.

1655
01:39:04,421 --> 01:39:08,260
People are so jealous that we
don't like a girl likes Dick.

1656
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:12,220
I like you should like a girl likes
Dick Cause this isn't that like like you

1657
01:39:12,221 --> 01:39:16,210
want, but no really you really what
you want is her to like you're a Dick,

1658
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,340
right? No other decks don't want
her to just like Dick and general,

1659
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:25,590
those girls are problematic,
but it's,

1660
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:30,750
it's commonly understood
that all guys love sex.

1661
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,370
Like they were all guys
love Pussy, right? Yeah.

1662
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:36,820
You only supposed to love like
one kind of guy or one girl. Yeah.

1663
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:42,040
But guys are disgusting. Whereas girls,
it's thought of like to be virtuous.

1664
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,330
You're like one day maybe try one out
and you don't like it anymore and you get

1665
01:39:46,331 --> 01:39:50,050
a new one but one on death
can't just love deck. Yeah.

1666
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,100
Yeah.

1667
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:57,260
Yeah.
You got love that.

1668
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,330
Do you know how bad people must've
loved Dick back on people, Diane?

1669
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:03,750
Like all the time,
like nobody lived

1670
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,130
and when there was nothing else going on.
Oh,

1671
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,890

stick attached to you in the front of your

1672
01:40:09,891 --> 01:40:10,340
body.

1673
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:13,760
And no one would tell you that you're
not supposed to fuck cause it was wasn't

1674
01:40:13,761 --> 01:40:17,750
even a language yet. Yeah, you
would just fuck everybody is fuck.

1675
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:20,720
And then you wash your friends get
eaten by Jaguars in front of you.

1676
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:25,610
Yeah.
Make

1677
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:27,510
babies together.
Your month intense.

1678
01:40:27,511 --> 01:40:29,830
A baby must have been
before they new language.

1679
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:34,510
It's just you and you're smart and you
have a, do you think, here's the question,

1680
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:40,120
how smart where Hillman's
or modern humans,

1681
01:40:40,121 --> 01:40:45,121
when they came up with the first noises
that meant things like ditch chimps.

1682
01:40:45,881 --> 01:40:48,760
Do that now, do you think, do you
think they have noises for shit?

1683
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,090
Like they must right,
like certain noises for stuff.

1684
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,550
I think it all comes to like animalistic

1685
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:56,230
stuff. Right? So like if

1686
01:40:56,830 --> 01:41:00,850
yeah. Oh yeah.

1687
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:03,730
And then like you hear that noise,
it's like, oh that always means snake.

1688
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:07,780
I'm sure I'm almost positive I read
something like that, that they uh,

1689
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,430
they did that with certain monkeys.

1690
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:12,970
They had certain sounds they
interpreted after a while.

1691
01:41:12,971 --> 01:41:17,170
Like they do this sound always
when an eagle's nearby. Like,

1692
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:21,190
have you ever seen those Harpy Eagles
in Venezuela? You know what that is?

1693
01:41:21,650 --> 01:41:26,170
It's a monkey. Neagle
Bro. A monkey, a monkey.

1694
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:31,090
Eaton Eagle. I love to eat monkeys
and ego that Oh yes they do.

1695
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:36,040
It's one of the things they found
about some of the early humans. Um,

1696
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:38,620
when they found fossils
and skulls and shit,

1697
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:42,340
they found that the inside of
the skull had been scraped,

1698
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:46,690
which there was some speculation that
maybe it was tools and sometimes they

1699
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,830
looked at the scraping on.

1700
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:52,090
This one looks like a raptors claw and
they think it was people that had gotten

1701
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:57,091
killed by Egos make that early human
beings were prey to a larger birds.

1702
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:03,910
Yeah. Particularly this one in New
Zealand that they know existed, you know.

1703
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:07,720
So there's all this speculation about
like how many different birds existed and

1704
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:08,580
you know,

1705
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:12,700
we have like a pretty good fossil record
of really big eagles and these things

1706
01:42:12,701 --> 01:42:15,160
called terror birds at eight
people and shit like that.

1707
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:17,440
But they think back on when
we were like smaller monkey,

1708
01:42:17,441 --> 01:42:21,820
like things that we probably got
jacked by eagles man. Especially,

1709
01:42:21,821 --> 01:42:26,440
there was a Haast eagle that lived in
New Zealand alongside people for sure.

1710
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,490
Because I think they made it
extinct just thousands of years ago,

1711
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:33,460
like 14,000 years ago or something.
I might be wrong about the number,

1712
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,990
but it was a huge eagle that had
like a 10 foot 11 foot wingspan

1713
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,473
and they aid people.

1714
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:45,610
If births could talk, if
Burt's could talk, they would
just take shit over. Oh God.

1715
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:50,140
You realize that if bird's somehow like
learn how to talk today. Two are big.

1716
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,650
Yeah. They would just take everything
over. Fuck your computer. Mine.

1717
01:42:53,651 --> 01:42:58,330
Now we have guns. You, I'm
still have guns. They're birds,

1718
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,390
but guns change everything and

1719
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:05,910
you're in one of those tanks with a slot
and you got the machine gun out there

1720
01:43:05,911 --> 01:43:10,740
and you're just blasting them out of
the sky. A gun only has one barrel.

1721
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:16,290
Birds can attack from
multiple angles at once.

1722
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:18,960
Yeah, that's true. At least 60 attack,

1723
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,450
but you hide in a tank and
you shoot him out of the sky.

1724
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:26,230
They don't play that dude tanks.
Yeah. They don't feel like that.

1725
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,720
They'll stay above and they'll
let you run out of your artillery.

1726
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,400
If they were smart enough to talk,

1727
01:43:31,401 --> 01:43:33,800
then they'd be smart enough
to let you run out of bullets.

1728
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:34,400
Right?

1729
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,290
Like what if they had hands along with
the wings and the grab gravity tank,

1730
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:40,910
the flag out of the tank.
It's me talking bird.

1731
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:43,820
They would do what they do
with like goats. How Eagles,

1732
01:43:43,821 --> 01:43:46,160
Greg goats and they throw him off cliffs.
Yeah.

1733
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:51,110
That's cold blooded shit
early is they drag them off,

1734
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:55,360
thrown them to their death. Like
they know what they're doing. Yeah.

1735
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:58,910
That's mean to ruthless animal,
man.

1736
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:03,680
It's a fascinating animal.
But so you think that uh,

1737
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:08,150
those things preyed on people like
early humans, they found these skulls.

1738
01:44:08,151 --> 01:44:12,830
The inside of them were all
scraped out. Scary. Ooh,

1739
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,700
dog. Just, there's
something about birds, man.

1740
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:19,640
They just so they don't
give a fuck about you.

1741
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,220
Like if you look at a dog or even a cat,

1742
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:26,900
a cat at least per hours and looks at you
and like likes that you petting it and

1743
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:29,330
it's like an interaction
between you and the cat.

1744
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:33,060
Right? The affects us. We're
on the same level. Yeah, man.

1745
01:44:33,061 --> 01:44:37,360
You look in the Eagle's eye, you're like,
why am, why am I keeping you alive? Right.

1746
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:40,860
Crazy comp. But I didn't know I was
looking at us salsa. Yeah, exactly.

1747
01:44:40,861 --> 01:44:43,770
And they're looking at us like,
why do you guys just stay on this floor?

1748
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,990
Why don't you guys, when you guys
flap your arms, you fucking idiot.

1749
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,990
You guys can move them around.
You just down here like prey,

1750
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,260
right?
Can you just sit here on this level?

1751
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,000
I think about what an eagle can do.
It's,

1752
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:01,070
it's swoops down and scoops of
fish out of a fucking river,

1753
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,330
a big one and carries it away.
Grabs a fish.

1754
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:09,350
No fucking strong. You have to be
to grab a salmon with your hands.

1755
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:14,720
Talons. It's sink into it. He
just carries it off flying.

1756
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,880
That's,
that's an Sushi.

1757
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:25,160
Oh my God. What a ruthless
bird. Crazy. It's kind of nuts.

1758
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,720
That's our national bird too.

1759
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,000
Somebody didn't want it to be,
uh,

1760
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:36,910
was it Ben Franklin? I think
thought it was like a punk ass bird.

1761
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:41,620
You said? That's a fungus ass bird. He
had like reasons for it. I read it last.

1762
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,900
Why he has an eagle whiny. Can't
remember whether it was him, John Adams,

1763
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:50,010
Jefferson, one of those weird old guys.
But like they're like fuck the eagle.

1764
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:56,670
How could use fuck the Eagle? They are
so hungry for it. They're gangster,

1765
01:45:56,671 --> 01:46:01,320
but it's like they're also a,
I wish I could remember what it was.

1766
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:04,990
I think it was like he didn't like,

1767
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:09,780
like how they like squawk cause like
they caught him like squat the or

1768
01:46:09,781 --> 01:46:12,150
something. You don't want that.
You don't need that squawky bird.

1769
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:16,030
Then you really should it be an eagle
though. We're America, which are really,

1770
01:46:16,031 --> 01:46:19,590
really,
what's the truly the most truly

1771
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:24,440
angels are pretty bad ass word. A brass
bird rather. Yeah, but it's still a bird.

1772
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:29,450
Well there's no, what about the
shark? We should be a puppy.

1773
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,710
Yeah. So, well sneaky. We don't have to
be some killer murderous thing. Right.

1774
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:34,900
I love that.
I can be,

1775
01:46:34,901 --> 01:46:38,280
it'd be something cute to the
fucks you up some of the youtube,

1776
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:43,950
like a snapchat filter that's, we are
one of those puppies. It's cartoon ones.

1777
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,830
Little dog ears and nose.

1778
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,200
What happened instead of having like
a mascot that's an actual animal,

1779
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:50,070
have a fake

1780
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,900
one. Like a, like a team. Teams
have a gopher that wears a tie.

1781
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:00,510
That's telling me US three. Your College
football team. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1782
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,900
We'd be a mascot. Yeah. You know,

1783
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:07,770
I mean the whole idea of having a mass
guys kind of crazy, isn't it? Yeah.

1784
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:12,390
A national animal. We have a
were the blues, Merck Eagle.

1785
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:16,320
Just colds doing run bro.
Yeah. The whole thing is weird.

1786
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:20,580
It's like we have a birth weight
but we're a bird where bird. Okay.

1787
01:47:20,581 --> 01:47:24,150
And Russia is a bear. Okay, we're, we'll,
we'll, we're fucked. I have news for you.

1788
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,640
Bears and eagles. I'll fucking blow my
money on the bear all day long. Yeah.

1789
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:30,840
That's a lot of good.
But that's not a good deal

1790
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:34,140
for sure.
The,

1791
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:38,280
I wonder if the other countries look
at us like we're morons for that.

1792
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:43,370
Like is Afghanistan here that we have
like represent this eagle and they're just

1793
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:45,600
like,
what are they doing?

1794
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:48,280
Don't you think that other
countries have an animal too?

1795
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:52,750
No,
I think other countries,

1796
01:47:52,751 --> 01:47:54,820
some people just like there,

1797
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:57,870
they don't even have anything.

1798
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,150
There's comprehending of
our silly shit that we do.

1799
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,380
Oh, cool. Yeah.

1800
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,880
Do you know that the Mississippi
state flag still has confederate flag?

1801
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:13,400
Yes. I wanted to do this this last
night when the guy from Jackson,

1802
01:48:13,401 --> 01:48:16,760
Mississippi within the
two white trash guys spot

1803
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,340
like trash guys and you
know who I'm talking about.

1804
01:48:19,341 --> 01:48:21,950
They literally listen to own
it. First of all, how dare you,

1805
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,200
Jason Knight and Chaz Kelly,

1806
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:30,820
I was with the guy

1807
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,650
from Jackson, Mississippi. His
whole family was in the audience,

1808
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:38,070
her family and friends and they were
all wearing the same shirt. Yeah.

1809
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,580
And I just thought it
was the confederate flag.

1810
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:45,510
I didn't realize that it was the
Mississippi state flag and they were going

1811
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:46,980
fucking crazy.

1812
01:48:46,981 --> 01:48:51,600
Like they were the craziest patch of
people in the whole arena last night.

1813
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:55,230
Literally they had a whole
section that was insane.

1814
01:48:55,890 --> 01:49:00,140
And I, he ended up saying to, uh,

1815
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:03,930
the sound guy who I was sitting next to,
I'm like,

1816
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:08,040
look at these crazy people. They have
the confederate flag on their shirt.

1817
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:12,600
And he's like, oh no, that's just a the
Mississippi state flag, and I'm like,

1818
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,210
oh wow.
I didn't know that I'm a complete idiot.

1819
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:19,320
I thought they were just going to
fucking burn a cross in victory up there.

1820
01:49:19,321 --> 01:49:21,650
Like they seemed like
they were the [inaudible]

1821
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,490
party.

1822
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:26,890
Do you think that people
know that Mississippi has
a confederate flag it state

1823
01:49:26,891 --> 01:49:30,530
flag? I didn't know how many people do
think like outside of Mississippi are even

1824
01:49:30,531 --> 01:49:31,230
aware of that.

1825
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:33,420
I would probably guess
if you and I don't know,

1826
01:49:33,421 --> 01:49:37,350
then I would guess somewhere in like
the 10% I would say three to 5%.

1827
01:49:37,351 --> 01:49:38,940
I think 10% is very giving.

1828
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:43,690
Wow. How did they not know that people
right now are screaming, you're idiots.

1829
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:44,800
Everybody knows.

1830
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:49,950
Yeah. If you know that, then I'm, you
live in one of the two really lit,

1831
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,970
one interlocking,
stayed away from Mississippi.

1832
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:56,060
If you know that or you're one of
those people that really got into the

1833
01:49:56,061 --> 01:49:59,540
confederate flags origins when they
pulled it off the general lead or are you

1834
01:49:59,541 --> 01:50:03,720
memorized overall? Just state
flags. In which case, Whoa,

1835
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,770
this is the wiser.
Your hobbies are out of control,

1836
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:10,970
but when they pulled that state flag or
they pull the confederate flag rather

1837
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:12,020
off the general Lee,

1838
01:50:12,021 --> 01:50:15,590
they pulled generally off if they don't
have the Dukes of Hazzard on TV land

1839
01:50:15,591 --> 01:50:19,790
anymore because of that flag,
which I found fascinating man,

1840
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,770
like for years and years and years.

1841
01:50:21,771 --> 01:50:24,860
And I'm not saying I'm not against
the idea of pulling the show,

1842
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:28,850
I understand the sentiment behind it that
in their eyes that's a racist symbol.

1843
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:33,650
But it's just fascinating
to me just purely from like
just an observers point of

1844
01:50:33,651 --> 01:50:36,590
view. Like, oh look at how
the culture is shifting.

1845
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:40,610
Like we used to be able to have this
on TV and no one said a word about it.

1846
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:44,240
It was on the roof of a car
that was on television and the,

1847
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:49,450
the car was arguably one of the big stars
of the show because like you got cards

1848
01:50:50,391 --> 01:50:54,970
from Bach, it's hot as fuck. You got the
daisy dukes. Yeah. You got the doors.

1849
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:59,240
Yeah. And then you got a Bo and
Luke Duke, right? They're the stars.

1850
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:04,250
And then you've got the fucking car,
man. Wait, what was the cops theme? Uh,

1851
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:07,370
well there was Roscoe p
Coltrane, boss Hog, right.

1852
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,910
Boss Hog and Roscoe p Coltrane.
Right. That's all I remember.

1853
01:51:11,870 --> 01:51:16,390
Ross boss Hog and Roscoe was a
sheriff. Right? I guess I said No.

1854
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:20,690
Who was the sheriff? But he, he was the
mayor. Mayor boss Hog, right. Wasn't he?

1855
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:25,130
There was a sheriff Roscoe p Coltrane,
I of don't remember.

1856
01:51:25,131 --> 01:51:27,410
And then there was Cletus who
was in love with daisy Duke.

1857
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:30,580
I remember when they made the movie with
Johnny Knoxville and Jessica Simpson.

1858
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:33,560
And of course I don't remember that.
Nobody saw, I don't remember that.

1859
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:36,860
I literally don't remember that.
That movie was so bad.

1860
01:51:36,861 --> 01:51:38,240
It got the TV show canceled.

1861
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:45,500
Two Jessica Simpson was hot as
the sun at one point in time

1862
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,210
at one point.
Now Lisa Simpson,

1863
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,920
uh, why I'm on it. Don't

1864
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:02,160
homer Simpson might be the greatest
character and the history of television

1865
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:06,770
probably. Cause cause he's so card too.
It was right up there with a cart. Ma'Am.

1866
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:12,040
Carbon might be as well. Yeah.
They're almost like, but homer,

1867
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:16,840
he's like the ultimate
buffoons and he's immortal.

1868
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,520
And you didn't do anything to them.

1869
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:20,010
All right.

1870
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:25,010
It's interesting him in Cartman both
don't edge and sorta troublemakers.

1871
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,620
Very stubborn.
It's very much the American way.

1872
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:32,760
I mean it's just like imagine that
and imagine that homer Simpson adopted

1873
01:52:32,761 --> 01:52:37,260
Cartman like that's a movie.
Wow, that's another great idea.

1874
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:43,260
Another one,
homer Simpson adopts carbon.

1875
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:45,140
He dated

1876
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:49,280
two totally different
styles, but in, you know,

1877
01:52:49,281 --> 01:52:53,480
it's like you got your king of the
hill style of a animated comedy.

1878
01:52:53,481 --> 01:52:56,930
You've got F F is for family is
coming out soon to season two.

1879
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:02,420
I bet that's going to be killer as a funny
show, man. That's a really funny show.

1880
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,900
You don't really watch comedy shows.

1881
01:53:03,901 --> 01:53:06,780
I'm looking forward to the return of
house of cards and the return of game of

1882
01:53:06,781 --> 01:53:07,614
Thrones.

1883
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:13,730
Uh, I watched, uh, efforts for
family. It's legitimately funny, Dude.

1884
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:20,630
It's a legitimately funny show. But
uh, yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

1885
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:25,610
I gave up on game of Thrones.
I mean that game of Thrones walking dead.

1886
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:27,320
So when I gave up on walking dead,

1887
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:31,610
I created some space that house of cards
filled feel much better about myself.

1888
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:33,290
I can't deal with zombies anymore.

1889
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:38,310
I'm with you buddy. I'm going to do,
zombies are dead to me. Literally

1890
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:42,920
you just, after awhile I was like, okay,
this isn't, this can't go anywhere. Yeah.

1891
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,510
Like when the sales nation rebuild,
when do you dummies kill all these armies.

1892
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:49,060
What are these zombies eating?
How this thing alive?

1893
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:51,160
How they here for so long or you just,

1894
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:54,310
how come they're not just
skeletons now they stopped riding.

1895
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:58,720
They brought for years. Oh, they just rot
fears. How about fuck you. Yeah. What?

1896
01:53:58,721 --> 01:54:02,170
Are you not making any sense anymore?
Yeah. You should all be dead.

1897
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:03,263
It should be gone.

1898
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:07,020
I never got into the walking dead.
I'm not in any of that stuff. I can't.

1899
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:12,200
They violate physics. Yeah, did violate
nature. It's not just that it's a Zombie.

1900
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:17,260
It doesn't rot away. We talk to them.
It doesn't rot away. It's dead. Come on.

1901
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:18,350
You told me that the dead.
Right.

1902
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:21,500
So how come it doesn't like
in the beginning of the show,

1903
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:26,480
like at the beginning seasons
they had like more shit going on.

1904
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:27,171
You know,

1905
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:32,171
like I remember when they had to blow up
that building that had the anti Zombie

1906
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:36,230
Shit in it where they created the Zombie
in the first place and there was a guy

1907
01:54:36,231 --> 01:54:39,620
and his wife turned the whole deal. That
was, that was the walking dead. Right.

1908
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:43,800
It just was, I don't remember in the
beginning it was just better. Yeah.

1909
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:47,150
It was just, it seemed like
it was interesting. And then
after a while, like, oh,

1910
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:51,530
I get it, it's always going to suck.
Look, your life always gonna suck.

1911
01:54:51,531 --> 01:54:53,630
It's gonna suck here that
it's gonna suck there.

1912
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:54,980
And then this guy is going to get killed,

1913
01:54:54,981 --> 01:54:57,770
the baseball bat and this person's
going to turn into a Zombie.

1914
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:02,120
You're going to have to watch this
person get torn apart. Okay, I get it.

1915
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:05,030
You just fucking with me.
It doesn't really.

1916
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:06,011
Meanwhile,

1917
01:55:06,011 --> 01:55:10,990
those game of Thrones guys are taking
literally just blowing our minds. Yeah.

1918
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,050
And as his house of cards.
Yeah.

1919
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:19,260
How's the cards is crazy
because they were like,

1920
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:23,860
they were really giving us an,
even though it's obviously fiction,

1921
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:29,280
I feel like they're giving us a real
window on sort of house stuff does work in

1922
01:55:30,131 --> 01:55:32,500
a weird way, even though
again, it's fiction.

1923
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,800
Like did they just show you how people
communicate with one another to get what

1924
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:40,570
they want?
They show you what politics is,

1925
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:44,980
how you can use that in your everyday
life. But it's just that business, I mean,

1926
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:48,690
they are in the business of
like being shady to one another.

1927
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:53,510
That's what it is. It's a weird field.
It's crazy. Very bizarre industry.

1928
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:58,670
Almost all gossip, drama and lying to
people and knowing people favors, yeah.

1929
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:02,630
By powers and politics and all that
stuff that we see on a daily basis in the

1930
01:56:02,631 --> 01:56:06,920
real world. It's just like they're doing
a fictional account of it. Exaggerated.

1931
01:56:06,921 --> 01:56:07,330
It is.
Yeah.

1932
01:56:07,330 --> 01:56:10,630
I was just going to say, you can tell
that they're doing the research. Yeah.

1933
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:14,230
You could tell that a lot of that's real.
And

1934
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,740
I mean they definitely push,
right.

1935
01:56:18,010 --> 01:56:21,900
The pushes the boundaries is pushing
people on to change reps. Yeah.

1936
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:26,860
But, um, they're definitely colluding,

1937
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,120
colluding with,
you know,

1938
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:33,130
the press and leaking things and trading
favors and I think it's a lot of why

1939
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:36,470
shit so goddamn stagnant.

1940
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:40,850
If the Republicans or the Democrats
10 favors and the Democrats or the

1941
01:56:40,851 --> 01:56:43,690
Republicans and pavers and
what the fuck are we doing?

1942
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:48,550
Yeah, it's all weird, but uh, it's,

1943
01:56:48,590 --> 01:56:53,580
it's a system that's been around for a
long time and it just never been exposed

1944
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:56,940
in a drama the way it's been
on this show and this show,

1945
01:56:56,941 --> 01:57:00,570
like they go so deep with it and
obviously the bunch of crazy shit murders,

1946
01:57:00,571 --> 01:57:02,510
all the studies show
look, but who knows, man,

1947
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:06,120
you look at some of the stuff that the
Clintons were accused of and some other

1948
01:57:06,121 --> 01:57:09,000
presidents are accused of and look at
the Kennedy assassination when who the

1949
01:57:09,001 --> 01:57:11,910
fuck knows what's really going on
behind the scenes with these people?

1950
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:15,660
They definitely are colluding
on some things, you know,

1951
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:20,661
they're definitely talking
and coordinating things and
they're strategizing and

1952
01:57:21,541 --> 01:57:25,970
they definitely have plans. It's just to
what, what extent does it really go? No,

1953
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:29,790
another great show that I can't wait for
it. I don't know. When it comes back,

1954
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:34,290
the stranger things on Netflix.
Did you watch that season?

1955
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:36,450
I just watched episode one.

1956
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:39,660
I'm not really into like aliens.

1957
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:44,280
Oh dare you like pro wrestling and
not like aliens. You son of a bitch.

1958
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:46,860
Really different things.
Yeah. One of them wrestling

1959
01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:51,963
aliens.

1960
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:57,240
Are you telling me you're not into
seeing this new Ripley Scott alien movie

1961
01:57:57,241 --> 01:58:01,530
that's coming out? Rip Late. Ridley Scott
Rather. Oh, said Ripley's car. I saw that.

1962
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,000
The preview for that the other night.

1963
01:58:03,001 --> 01:58:08,001
I do want to see the good Lord that
looks good and what they can do now with

1964
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:10,800
special effects.
Make things way more terrifying.

1965
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:14,780
That hasn't always been my favorite
science fiction franchise I bought.

1966
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:16,600
I mean there was a couple of them.
They were a little lame,

1967
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:21,870
but I'm a giant fan of that.
That creature,

1968
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:26,200
what do they call the Xena form? Sina
more Xena more? Is that what they call it?

1969
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:28,920
I think it was.
I thought it was just called the alien.

1970
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:34,110
I think they called it the xenomorph.
I forgot. Maybe I'm making that up,

1971
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:35,550
but I think that's what it is,

1972
01:58:35,551 --> 01:58:39,600
but it's that that is just the
most terrifying alien ever,

1973
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:43,280
just as vicious insect,
like thing that

1974
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:48,040
grows to full size and like a few days.

1975
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:54,130
That's totally possible to man.
It's totally possible.

1976
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,080
So we'd have to get some food though.

1977
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,600
That's the only thing that
I didn't like about that.

1978
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,220
Like how's it growing without food?
Yeah.

1979
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,350
I mean it has to be eating those people.
Okay,

1980
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:10,450
but how many people does it eat to get
to be 700 pounds or whatever it was?

1981
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:15,910
It seems like it would have to eat 700
pounds of the people to even get in the

1982
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:19,450
ballpark or 700 pounds.
Yeah. Where do they,

1983
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:24,330
did it come on it's own ship. It
came for the dude's chest, remember?

1984
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:30,550
Yeah. He grabbed a hold of
his face and it makes it suck.

1985
01:59:30,551 --> 01:59:31,840
It's little alien Dick.

1986
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:36,340
And it comes in its stomach and it makes
a person inside your body and it blows

1987
01:59:36,341 --> 01:59:40,720
out your chest.
Remember that coming back to the face,

1988
01:59:40,721 --> 01:59:45,460
grabs it with his hand and
then a literally like an
alien tentacle Dick Thing

1989
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:49,150
comes out of the palm
and just mouth fucks you.

1990
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:53,810
Oh God.
It's a great ending.

1991
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
A great animal.

1992
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:58,510
Like as far as like something that
someone created to terrify you,

1993
01:59:58,830 --> 02:00:01,390
it's an amazing being,
you know?

1994
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:06,590
I mean I think it's the best alien
science fiction creation and also it's HR

1995
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:09,160
Geiger's like design.

1996
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:12,970
So his design was so freaky
and dark and twisted.

1997
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,500
Like it was a,

1998
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:19,830
it was like the creature of the
black lagoon meets like the wiring,

1999
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:22,660
the of the Millennium Falcon meet me.

2000
02:00:22,661 --> 02:00:27,550
It's almost like a semi mechanical
looking and insect like,

2001
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:30,160
but also like kinetic.

2002
02:00:30,161 --> 02:00:34,840
It looks like it has muscles and it looks
just like it would just rip you apart

2003
02:00:34,841 --> 02:00:39,360
man. It looks terrifying.
Giant head of it. Yeah.

2004
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:44,260
This is scary shit up.
The fact that it's,

2005
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:48,240
it's blood as Amanda and an acid.
I mean come on son.

2006
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,470
That that animal thing,

2007
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:55,740
that alien being is the coolest creation
I think in all of science fiction.

2008
02:00:58,390 --> 02:01:01,870
And this, this is Nick's
this week, man. This Friday.

2009
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:07,610
My dark is on full pointe right now.
Full Scifi Dork.

2010
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:10,760
Can we see movies?
Do you actually go to the movie theater?

2011
02:01:10,761 --> 02:01:14,810
Like a normal human being ever?
The fuck you talking about blaming here,

2012
02:01:14,811 --> 02:01:17,030
Joe Rogan. I mean, I
don't know how that works.

2013
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:19,910
Do you live right next
to you on a normal plane?

2014
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,620
I go to normal restaurants with you.

2015
02:01:21,621 --> 02:01:23,870
I do shit with you all at
this isn't a normal planes.

2016
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:28,610
When I'm by myself I'm not flying
this plane. It's still a plane.

2017
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:31,580
But yeah, no, the movie theater
like everybody else man.

2018
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:35,240
So like you're going to go see
alien with like a friend or,

2019
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:41,330
okay. Are you, do you
want to go on a date?

2020
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:45,200
Is that what you're doing or you're
beating around the Bush and then I'm just

2021
02:01:45,201 --> 02:01:49,820
curious like I can't really, I just
go to the movies, go to the movies.

2022
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:52,540
Like buy a ticket, go to the movies. No.

2023
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:56,630
Well the friend Jesus Christ,
I wouldn't go by myself.

2024
02:01:57,050 --> 02:02:00,860
That's a little rough. That's
weird. She went by herself.

2025
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:04,730
People would like stare at you. Hey man,
chill. Rob Has got no friends like, hey,

2026
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:09,700
I got friends. Just no one's, no one's
available right now. Okay. This is,

2027
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:12,460
this time was convenient for me.
Yeah.

2028
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:16,370
It's like watching a movie at
home by herself. Totally normal.

2029
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:21,020
Going to the movies by yourself. Ooh,
I've done that before on the road though.

2030
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:24,110
And it's awesome because you actually
get to enjoy the movie. Yeah.

2031
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,290
People going to a movie with
people can only be a distraction.

2032
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:34,100
I think I've only gone to the movies by
myself and then may less than maybe six

2033
02:02:34,771 --> 02:02:36,960
times ever in my whole life,
but they're good trips.

2034
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:39,780
I live right next to a
Tarantino's movie theater.

2035
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:42,870
Really cool movies.
They're like,

2036
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:47,400
they just had the 25th anniversary of
reservoir dogs this past month and they

2037
02:02:47,401 --> 02:02:51,420
played it every night at midnight
for like two weeks. And um,

2038
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:52,920
that helps my point.
Oh yeah.

2039
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:55,530
I don't mind going and checking
out a movie by myself at all.

2040
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:00,840
What I ate is going with someone that
has a fucking bag of candy that they keep

2041
02:03:00,841 --> 02:03:03,920
digging into and shit or
crunch crunch and like,

2042
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:06,570
I know it's like a cheesy subject,

2043
02:03:06,571 --> 02:03:10,980
but how popcorn became a movie theater.

2044
02:03:10,981 --> 02:03:13,300
Food makes zero sense of it.

2045
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:18,000
It's one of the smelliest foods is
one of the weirdest sounding foods.

2046
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:22,590
Makes people dig in.
It's too much.

2047
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:23,790
It makes a mess.

2048
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:29,280
There's like a list of a laundry
list of complaints about popcorn.

2049
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:31,500
Yeah.
It's definitely not a quiet food.

2050
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:35,940
It kind of turns and when you get
it in a bag, that's the worst.

2051
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:40,320
Someone's ruffling their bag around
or plastic. Anything in plastic.

2052
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,950
We got to dig into the plastic
crackle, crackle, crackle.

2053
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:47,390
All those bags are too loud.
The reeses pieces bag,

2054
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:52,070
they make it so that you break
it open trying to open it.

2055
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:54,740
It's at the reasons pcs fly everywhere.
No,

2056
02:03:54,741 --> 02:03:56,750
they know and then you
have to buy you back here.

2057
02:03:58,290 --> 02:04:03,290
That's the dumbest conspiracy or pcs
or pieces you call it Reese's pieces.

2058
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:09,420
Reese's pieces, Reese's pieces. It's not,

2059
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:10,870
it's not reeses pcs.

2060
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:18,720
It's Reese's pieces.
See this is one of the great conundrums.

2061
02:04:20,030 --> 02:04:24,320
It's like the Berenstain bears.
Yeah, sorry. It's confusing it.

2062
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:26,850
You think it's one thing, but
it's really another thing. Okay,

2063
02:04:26,851 --> 02:04:30,930
well what are the peanut butter cups?
Reese's Reese's peanut butter cups.

2064
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:36,860
R. E. E. S. E. Reese. Lisa's. Yeah.

2065
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,280
I think maybe

2066
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,170
it's,
I know I have a thing.

2067
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:43,170
It was definitely always
receipts when I was growing up.

2068
02:04:43,171 --> 02:04:44,310
I feel like maybe I'm wrong.

2069
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:46,760
Well, people get used to saying
shit wrong. Like in Texas,

2070
02:04:46,761 --> 02:04:50,780
they say especially that's a big
thing that people say instead of,

2071
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:54,660
especially x especially. Oh Wow. Yeah.

2072
02:04:56,270 --> 02:05:00,230
Yeah. I don't, it's like there's
an x in there. They'll say, well,

2073
02:05:00,231 --> 02:05:04,670
y'all is expecially need to worry
about that. [inaudible] spatially.

2074
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,990
It's a beautiful accent.

2075
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:10,230
Texas people are truly, I was just gonna
say that might be my favorite accent.

2076
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:15,240
They're just so cool. Even when I
disagree with someone from Texas,

2077
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:18,280
like one time,
uh,

2078
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:22,550
one time a cop tried to arrest me
and my buddy Matt at a Whataburger,

2079
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:27,310
this is like eight years ago and
we didn't know why he wanted he,

2080
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,600
he's like, you guys need to get out of
this. What a burger. It was like 3:00 AM.

2081
02:05:30,601 --> 02:05:34,680
It was our first time in a water burger
ever. We had just placed our order.

2082
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:38,220
I just handed the cashier a $5 bill.

2083
02:05:38,221 --> 02:05:41,460
I'll never forget it in a sheriff,
comes over my shoulder and he goes,

2084
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:44,670
you and your friend need to get out
of here. I'm like, really? What?

2085
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,730
Cut To our other buddy.
Uh,

2086
02:05:46,731 --> 02:05:50,220
other comedian gets in trouble
for defending us. It's like,

2087
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:53,460
you can't kick my friends out and stuff
first trip on a water or where are you

2088
02:05:53,461 --> 02:05:55,860
kicking them out of here? And the
cop's like, don't worry about it.

2089
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:58,410
And cut to the next day.

2090
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,460
Our buddy who ended up spending a
little bit of time in jail that night

2091
02:06:02,461 --> 02:06:04,070
defending us.
Me and my,

2092
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:08,680
my other little la friend
got to leave the Whataburger,

2093
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:13,020
but our buddy from Texas got in trouble
or buddy from Texas the next day as his

2094
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:17,810
friend who's the chief of police on
speaker phone and we're sitting in the car

2095
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:21,510
traveling back to California and
he's like, dude, so what happened?

2096
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:26,580
What happened buddy? You know, and the
head chief of police literally goes,

2097
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,511
uh,
yeah,

2098
02:06:27,511 --> 02:06:31,320
the cop told me that you are defending
your friends that appears is of low.

2099
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:33,120
According to this officer,

2100
02:06:33,121 --> 02:06:36,660
a couple of faggots were five metal
water burger or something like that.

2101
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:41,070
And me and my buddy were the obviously
a couple of faggots in this story.

2102
02:06:41,071 --> 02:06:43,440
We started dying of laughter.

2103
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:48,150
I mean dying of laughter.
But with that said,

2104
02:06:48,151 --> 02:06:51,960
the guy with this Texas accent, you can
tell he's wearing like a cowboy hat,

2105
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:54,930
chief of police,
a couple of faggots by metal water burger.

2106
02:06:55,230 --> 02:06:58,260
And me and my buddy were having like
a flight argument at the time, like,

2107
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,970
you know about whatever it was.
We weren't,

2108
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,360
obviously we weren't fighting was me
and Matt Edgar Wright, a California kid.

2109
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:09,510
That's hilarious. I have a water. Thank
you. Awesome dude. That's hilarious.

2110
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:13,030
So the cop was just being
homophobic. Totally. Oh,

2111
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:15,660
so will you guys joking
around about stuff?

2112
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:19,400
Yeah, we were literally having
some like play fight about like,

2113
02:07:19,610 --> 02:07:23,470
like it was like a play argument about,
I can't remember who knows a lot,

2114
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:26,660
you know, literally a couple La
comedians excited to be on the road.

2115
02:07:26,661 --> 02:07:30,040
Probably opening for free
for who we were working with.

2116
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,150
That is so funny.

2117
02:07:31,151 --> 02:07:36,040
So you were just basically being comedians
and being loud and they decided you

2118
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,870
were two gay guys in the middle
of a spat. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

2119
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:44,740
Well there's definitely that in Texas too.
Like in the south in general.

2120
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:48,610
Like I had some friends that moved to
Nashville from La Love Nashville too.

2121
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:52,240
I do too. But they had this idea
that they were gonna, you know,

2122
02:07:52,241 --> 02:07:55,660
they're going to be in Nashville and
nationals, all open mind and artists.

2123
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:59,470
And she said like right around like the
third or fourth time I heard the word

2124
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:03,730
nigger and I was like,
oh, okay. This is like,

2125
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,020
there's some outlying areas that you're
in a mall Walmart an hour away from

2126
02:08:08,021 --> 02:08:10,810
Nashville and you hear that kind
of talk and you're like, okay,

2127
02:08:10,811 --> 02:08:15,490
I'm still in Tennessee
like this, you know? Ooh.

2128
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:20,310
But I at least they know what have a
confederate flag on their tee shirts,

2129
02:08:20,430 --> 02:08:22,690
but Jesus Christ.
But I mean,

2130
02:08:22,691 --> 02:08:27,691
like the way that that cop called
us a couple of couple of faggots,

2131
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:31,480
it's like, I believe that,
wow, this convinced me,

2132
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:34,810
I guess Texas.
I'm a faggot

2133
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:40,180
in California. I'm Tony.
I wonder if that's like,

2134
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:44,160
where are you where you were in
Houston, right? Uh, doing that. Well,

2135
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:47,560
that was like eight or nine years
ago. That was in Corpus Christi. Okay.

2136
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:50,970
But I don't think that would happen
in the Austin now. Yeah, no. Yeah.

2137
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:54,520
Austin has got it. It's
more progressive. Yeah.

2138
02:08:54,830 --> 02:08:57,550
Austin is a total livable place.
Yeah.

2139
02:08:58,390 --> 02:09:01,990
Like it would be a nice place to live.
You would enjoy it there.

2140
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:06,880
When we do shows there, man, they like
particularly epic shows. Oh my God, yes.

2141
02:09:07,290 --> 02:09:10,510
The cap city. Yeah, man. Yeah.

2142
02:09:11,090 --> 02:09:15,490
Cap City's amazing. Uh, Austin city
limits that theater there. That's amazing.

2143
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:21,020
Yeah. There's a, it's a special
place, man. In my eyes in Texas,

2144
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:23,080
it's a different spot.

2145
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:26,350
It's like it's more rowdy than
a lot of places in the country,

2146
02:09:26,351 --> 02:09:30,160
but it's also a friendly, yep. It's
got a lot of like good qualities.

2147
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:32,280
Like a happy I lightness to it.
Yeah.

2148
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:37,180
It's like they greet you at the
front of the store when you walk in,

2149
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:41,200
but they also make sure
you're not stealing anything.
Yeah. Now it's like, yeah,

2150
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:45,040
it's just a little more
extreme on both levels. Yeah.

2151
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:48,910
But then there's like so much space to
like what you're talking about is just

2152
02:09:48,911 --> 02:09:50,740
the cities and what's
interesting he has to,

2153
02:09:50,741 --> 02:09:55,180
cities are just a small percentage of
this monstrous landmass that's known as

2154
02:09:55,181 --> 02:09:56,014
Texas.

2155
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:58,570
You don't realize how big it is until
you have to drive through it and you're

2156
02:09:58,571 --> 02:10:02,560
like, oh my God, it tastes
like a day. It's huge.

2157
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:08,320
It's an enormous state. Great
place though. It's crazy.

2158
02:10:08,321 --> 02:10:09,880
I'll states have different fields,
man.

2159
02:10:09,881 --> 02:10:14,050
They really do like a show in Albany is
just going to be different than a show

2160
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:17,500
in Dallas. It's just going
to be different. It just is.

2161
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:22,210
It's going to be diabolically
worse Albany, New York.

2162
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:26,590
Oh my God. No. Yeah, you
didn't enjoy it up their home.

2163
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:28,960
We never again.
What do you think it is?

2164
02:10:28,961 --> 02:10:31,360
You think it's just like a
lack of opportunity up there.

2165
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:36,140
The weather's not so good. Keep
feel trapped. Yup, keep going at it.

2166
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:39,070
You're just getting started.
You call, you're 100% right,

2167
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:43,580
so you could go on and on.
The y is the real question.

2168
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:47,210
Don't you think though that in
Albany? Well, they got stuck there.

2169
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,500
They were there from another time.

2170
02:10:48,590 --> 02:10:52,130
You know their parents were their parents
parents, but don't you think that like,

2171
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:54,140
Oh God,
here she goes.

2172
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:58,090
Should I pick had that person might be
35 minutes remaining and I went, oh shit.

2173
02:10:58,610 --> 02:11:02,610
We be cannot sharpie for the next few
minutes to reach an item to get these

2174
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:05,970
overhead or take care of both your need.
If you have any remaining

2175
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:10,710
just looking at a smiling because
she knows she's on the show. Yeah.

2176
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:13,490
Like she doesn't even know this show is,

2177
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:16,730
I think she was about to plug around
podcasts because I think this going to be

2178
02:11:16,731 --> 02:11:19,910
cool because she'll be on a podcast and
she doesn't even know exists. Right.

2179
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:24,510
She'll never find it private. You think
someone or friends will tell her? Maybe.

2180
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:28,180
Maybe.
Um,

2181
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,590
but we're bringing this podcast to a,

2182
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:34,580
on a plane down for landing young Tony.
So in conclusion,

2183
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:40,070
crazy ass night of awesome fights.
Steep Emile chick is a bad motherfucker.

2184
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:42,530
Yes. CLEVELAND, Ohio,

2185
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:48,290
Ohio and now a lot of fun people to root
for last night and my people dominated

2186
02:11:48,291 --> 02:11:53,291
all the way through everybody that I
picked a one one Yolana is my everything.

2187
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:55,560
I mean we were really
connected during that. Right.

2188
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:58,580
She's your everything like your
love. She's your love. Yeah.

2189
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:01,970
I feel like this is real.
I really want it to be real.

2190
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:04,850
I mean she stops in the middle
of fights and looks over at you.

2191
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:09,440
I'm so glad that you finally started
to notice this because one of the funny

2192
02:12:09,441 --> 02:12:13,030
things is I've been sorta telling
you like you thought I was crazy.

2193
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,590
Oh No, it's definitely happening
now in a few fights ago,

2194
02:12:15,591 --> 02:12:18,530
you literally thought I could tell why
by the way you were those starting with

2195
02:12:18,531 --> 02:12:23,070
trolling me. Right. I know
and I don't ever tell you,

2196
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:25,510
but like I'm so glad that you see it.

2197
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:29,200
It's like, to me it's like that
part of teen wolf or Michael J.

2198
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,840
Fox goes to his dad and he's like,
damn a werewolf the Werewolf.

2199
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:33,660
But the dad's like,
I'm aware of old to

2200
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:43,180
finally saw it. Like when she was
doing that before the fifth round,

2201
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:46,540
she was just looking at me
pointing right at me and stuff.

2202
02:12:46,541 --> 02:12:51,430
And you end DC c me both look back at
me over your right shoulders at the same

2203
02:12:51,431 --> 02:12:52,900
time.
Like is this motherfucker?

2204
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:57,540
Yeah, I was not sure if it was you
and I look back on my God damn,

2205
02:12:57,541 --> 02:12:58,910
she's pointing right?
We're telling him sit

2206
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:02,780
doing it and she kept looking at me after
each round and everything. And we're,

2207
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:05,360
I feel like we're exchanging energies.

2208
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:08,340
I feel like, I feel like we
need to do a podcast with her.

2209
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:12,030
And then you and her need to go to
dinner. Yeah. Just whatever you do,

2210
02:13:12,031 --> 02:13:15,870
don't talk about it on the
internet or, uh, her boyfriend,
we'll find out too late.

2211
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:21,420
I don't care about her boyfriend is a
soccer player from Polish to don't out the

2212
02:13:22,591 --> 02:13:26,370
guy. Son of a bitch. So ruthless,

2213
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:30,420
ruthless. Tony Hinchcliffe. Um,
what do you got coming up, man?

2214
02:13:30,421 --> 02:13:32,220
You've got some dates.
Huge dates.

2215
02:13:32,410 --> 02:13:34,940
Do you want a big tour, right?
Monster Energy outbreak tour.

2216
02:13:34,941 --> 02:13:39,540
I'll all of the month of August.
Uh, Nashville, you're like a STD.

2217

The Monster Energy outbreak

2218
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:46,860

Like a beverage that monster Ng has.

2219
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:50,800
Um, no. If that's the tour
that they do. Oh, they do,

2220
02:13:50,801 --> 02:13:53,710

2221
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:57,860
monster like doesn't do billboards,
like APP commercials.

2222
02:13:58,220 --> 02:14:02,900
They invest in like cool things like the
UFC and like people like learned this

2223
02:14:02,901 --> 02:14:06,470
all recently from this whole thing.
So they do this outbreak tour thing,

2224
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:10,400
which they've had some really cool
bands and rappers do and it's been very

2225
02:14:10,401 --> 02:14:11,760
successful.
Really.

2226
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:15,760
They do it and they'd be doing it
Fetty wap and the Chainsmokers and

2227
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:20,030
Ben, but I mean, what do they do
when you say they do a tour like a,

2228
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:23,510
did they just put their name
on it? They promote it. Yeah.

2229
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,120
Yeah. They do that and it's just a
really cool way of like, you know,

2230
02:14:28,121 --> 02:14:33,121
not compromising anything's a integrity
while just being associated with

2231
02:14:34,121 --> 02:14:35,590
something that they think is cool.

2232
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:40,040
Right. Yeah. They, they're
in kickboxing to the sponsor.

2233
02:14:40,041 --> 02:14:44,840
John Wayne par. Oh, awesome. Yeah. They
sponsor a lot of MMA fighters. Of course.

2234
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:47,290
What I'm really excited
about this tour dates,

2235
02:14:47,291 --> 02:14:51,190
it's my first ever like small
theater tour and like rock club tour,

2236
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:55,660
House of Blues and Cleveland Grammer
seat theater in New York City and was

2237
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:59,860
absolutely going everywhere in North
Carolina, Florida. I mean, you name it.

2238
02:14:59,890 --> 02:15:02,220
That's dope. Columbus,
Ohio, Cleveland, Akron,

2239
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:05,710
powerful. Tony and Portland. Seattle,

2240
02:15:05,711 --> 02:15:10,570
the Aladdin Theater and Portland.
Oh Man. How Fun. It's Portland.

2241
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:14,470
Oh my God. How Fun was for 20
their glass. They chose epic.

2242
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:20,260
That's a real holiday. That became
a holiday during our life. Totally.

2243
02:15:20,290 --> 02:15:23,250
Really? During the last
what, 20 years maybe? Yeah,

2244
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:25,960
like nobody used to do for 20 shows,

2245
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:30,910
but just a few years ago I started doing
for 20 shows on April 20th and it's a

2246
02:15:30,911 --> 02:15:34,690
holiday man. Yeah, it's a holiday
for us. Like it feels festive.

2247
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,530
Like when we go out and we did
those for 20 shows like uh,

2248
02:15:38,590 --> 02:15:41,830
last year and this year they feel festive.
Yeah.

2249
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:46,390
Where the fuck did we go last year?
Seattle, Seattle for four 20 last year.

2250
02:15:46,570 --> 02:15:50,710
Next year. Probably. Either Denver or
maybe San Francisco. That'll be fun.

2251
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:55,200
Denver might be fun,
but San Francisco gets into,

2252
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:57,890
it might be fun to do it up there.
I'm going to Denver too.

2253
02:15:57,891 --> 02:15:59,500
I'm going to absolutely everywhere.

2254
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:04,150
All those seats
available@tonyhinchcliffe.com
Jesus and there's an e on the end

2255
02:16:04,151 --> 02:16:06,650
of that. Unlike the picture
that's up at the ice house.

2256
02:16:06,710 --> 02:16:11,710
And I have podcasts kill Tony the pony
hour where I interview people and the

2257
02:16:13,601 --> 02:16:16,750
store horsemen, which is a
pro wrestling podcast. Oh God,

2258
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:21,900
I hate the name store horseman.
Yeah. That's hilarious then.

2259
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,680
But we're all from the comedy store.
I get it. And so these are all, uh,

2260
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:30,130
at Itunes, you get them all on Itunes,
right? Yeah. Glorious. Well Ladies

2261
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,950
and gentlemen, we'll bring in
this big bird down to the ground.

2262
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:35,260
Just going to give a shout out
to all the mommies out there.

2263
02:16:35,261 --> 02:16:39,880
Cause today's mother's Day and future.
Mommy's to like Yolanda. Yen check.

2264
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:43,480
Are you going to retire? Get a retired
when you knock her up? Yeah. Wow.

2265
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:47,790
We're going to double retire together.
Whoa. You're going to retire to, well,

2266
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:51,550
you're going to be inspired and see every
kid, but yeah, but that savage. Yeah.

2267
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:55,270
Oh God. Yeah. I have to learn
how to fight. I love it.

2268
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:59,790
I'm going to have to learn how to
satisfy a woman and actual woman.

2269
02:17:00,530 --> 02:17:05,250
All Right, ladies and gentlemen.
Um, so, uh, one thing that
did happen this week, uh,

2270
02:17:05,290 --> 02:17:10,120
Everlast had to cancel something came up
so he won't be on this week and he'll a,

2271
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:14,410
he'll have to reschedule. He's a
busy man, but he's got his, uh, new,

2272
02:17:14,411 --> 02:17:18,610
a new project war porn industries,
which is great shit.

2273
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:21,880
You can catch it on youtube. You catch
some of the videos he's played. Well,

2274
02:17:21,930 --> 02:17:23,590
actually, no, I don't know
if you can get it on youtube.

2275
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:26,200
I've seen it on Instagram though,
but um,

2276
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:30,850
I think they're trying to figure out how
to distributor out how you can get it.

2277
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:35,200
Um, but they're doing that. That's an
independent project, you know, I like,

2278
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:39,130
I like that music is kind of going along
the same ways that standup is gone.

2279
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:39,581
You know,

2280
02:17:39,581 --> 02:17:42,790
they're doing their own shit and they're
trying to do things independently.

2281
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:48,420
I had a Shirley Manson on the other
day from garbage and she was kind of

2282
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:53,050
breaking down the music business and
what it's like and how difficult it is to

2283
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:54,520
make money as a band today.

2284
02:17:54,521 --> 02:17:59,290
And how now music companies
these t take everything.

2285
02:17:59,291 --> 02:18:02,860
They take a piece of your merchandise.
It take a piece of your live touring,

2286
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:06,220
they'd take a percentage of everything.
Everything you do across the board.

2287
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:09,700
So they do these deals with these artists
or when they distribute their music,

2288
02:18:09,701 --> 02:18:12,990
they essentially own a chunk of them and

2289
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:17,800
yeah, they do that and stand up. It's
very weird. How did it go on and stand up?

2290
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:21,910
Stand up. There's this weird
company, you know like,

2291
02:18:21,911 --> 02:18:25,330
have you ever heard of like
comedy dynamics? Who does that?

2292
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:30,010
A lot of our friends,
they make a lot of our friends.

2293
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:34,810
What do they do is they distribute.
But what's weird is that they sell it,

2294
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:37,060
which they don't really sell it,

2295
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:40,690
but you need to have some of these
big companies you need to have.

2296
02:18:40,691 --> 02:18:43,600
Like it's the most bureaucratic bull
shit you'll ever hear in your life.

2297
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:45,340
You would never put up
with it for a second.

2298
02:18:45,490 --> 02:18:49,120
You probably get to bypass it because
you're obviously at the top of the game.

2299
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:50,270
But

2300
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:53,710
like what do you mean they make a deal
where they don't own their specials?

2301
02:18:53,730 --> 02:18:54,563
That what you're saying?

2302
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:58,890
We're at least at, first of all, I don't
think they own it forever. Second of all,

2303
02:18:58,891 --> 02:19:02,220
I don't think they own the entire thing.
Uh,

2304
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:07,640
but these companies take 20 30% of your
special for absolutely zero reason,

2305
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:11,940
especially, you already have to give what
10% of your manager and this and that,

2306
02:19:11,941 --> 02:19:12,720
blah, blah, blah, blah.

2307
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:16,290
Well, I know there was a podcast
production company that uh,

2308
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:19,980
David Taylor and Ari Shapiro had a real
problem with cause they were pitching a

2309
02:19:19,981 --> 02:19:23,100
television show and they
created a television show.

2310
02:19:23,101 --> 02:19:26,850
They wanted someone to
help them try to sell it.

2311
02:19:26,851 --> 02:19:31,820
Like we set something up and these people
apparently wanted a ridiculous amount

2312
02:19:31,821 --> 02:19:35,000
of money, like 40% of the show.
And they're like, Whoa, whoa, Whoa,

2313
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:39,230
there's 100% and there's two
of us and you get 40 like,

2314
02:19:39,231 --> 02:19:40,460
are you fucking crazy?

2315
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:45,640
Like they wanted more than a third to
just come in and just sort of like help

2316
02:19:45,711 --> 02:19:50,510
them negotiate a deal with their products.
I didn't create it hidden, sculpted.

2317
02:19:50,511 --> 02:19:51,920
They didn't, they didn't, you know,

2318
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:54,950
you didn't think it through
and do all the work on it.

2319
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:59,450
So people get real squirrely when it
comes to those kind of weird deals where

2320
02:19:59,630 --> 02:20:03,830
you're not a content creator, but
you're instead some company. Right?

2321
02:20:03,831 --> 02:20:06,370
And there's somebody else that
creates the content. Well,

2322
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:09,920
what's beautiful now it's like guys like
you or me or all these people that do

2323
02:20:09,921 --> 02:20:13,940
podcasts, you're all of a sudden your
own content creator and you could,

2324
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:15,020
you don't have to be at,

2325
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,690
you don't have to have all these
fucking people in your ear.

2326
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:20,520
You don't have to have everybody
giving you other, okay.

2327
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:25,360
I mean opinion and like special man.
Yeah, the Ice House. That shit's crazy.

2328
02:20:25,650 --> 02:20:26,910
Like,
think about a show like,

2329
02:20:26,970 --> 02:20:30,180
have you ever done like Cole
bear or one of those shows?

2330
02:20:30,610 --> 02:20:33,510
Do you ever done one of those?
When you do,

2331
02:20:33,511 --> 02:20:36,660
do those one thing that you do
realize by the way he drank both.

2332
02:20:36,661 --> 02:20:40,200
My water's just son of a
bitch. I had one. You had one.

2333
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:45,270
I'll have one right
here. Um, when you, uh,

2334
02:20:45,271 --> 02:20:46,440
when you watch those shows,

2335
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:50,250
you see how many people were working
behind the scenes. Like, wait a minute,

2336
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:53,730
hold on. That's one thing that I
noticed when I did, um, that dude's,

2337
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:58,620
what's his name? Bill Russell, the
podcast guy. I did it is HBO show.

2338
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:00,180
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

2339
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:04,020
we're just hits him and me sitting down
having a conversation and there was a

2340
02:21:04,021 --> 02:21:06,270
Corolla people here,
Mike,

2341
02:21:06,330 --> 02:21:10,470
this is essentially like an overstaffed
podcast. No doubt. No doubt.

2342
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:13,400
And because of that, it all
gets like weird. It's all weird.

2343
02:21:13,550 --> 02:21:16,700
Yeah. When I made TV shows
man with eyebrows, you know,

2344
02:21:16,930 --> 02:21:18,890
it's a major comedy central shows.

2345
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:23,840
And the thing that shocked me the entire
time, and I don't mean slight shock,

2346
02:21:23,841 --> 02:21:24,351
I mean sure.

2347
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:29,330
Shock was the amazing
waste of money they have.

2348
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:32,780
They're just throwing money away.
What do you think that is?

2349
02:21:32,781 --> 02:21:37,020
They don't know any better or they think
they're on an old Hollywood system.

2350
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,470
Right. And when they were coming
up, they were trained that way.

2351
02:21:39,770 --> 02:21:41,240
It's like if comedians all,

2352
02:21:41,241 --> 02:21:44,480
we're still only focused on getting
five minutes on the tonight show.

2353
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:49,190
That's how I feel like some of those
executives state instead of being like,

2354
02:21:49,191 --> 02:21:53,030
what's next? Well, this Netflix thing
we'll never have to worry about that.

2355
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:55,820
I remember,
I remember one exact literally saying,

2356
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:59,600
I'm not kidding you in 2011 we
don't have to worry about them.

2357
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:03,760
We don't have to worry about the Internet.
People always come back to TV.

2358
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:07,340
TV is priceless. They will always come
back. And I remember literally thinking,

2359
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:10,820
I don't know about that,
like watching this

2360
02:22:11,370 --> 02:22:15,270
since up until the point where you could
watch the internet on your TV and then

2361
02:22:15,271 --> 02:22:16,104
all games are off.

2362
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:19,980
Well, yeah, but then he was also, yes,
but he wasn't saying it like that.

2363
02:22:19,981 --> 02:22:22,870
He was saying like,
they're always gonna need TV channels.

2364
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:26,040
Like he was saying like, yeah,
well there's always people like

2365
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:30,120
that, man. I mean there's people
that tell you how to do clean comedy.

2366
02:22:30,121 --> 02:22:32,580
There's people that tell you, you
have to do this, you have to do that.

2367
02:22:32,650 --> 02:22:33,360
Right.

2368
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:37,270
And they convince themselves and then
all of a sudden they can't even see the

2369
02:22:37,271 --> 02:22:37,770
light.

2370
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:37,921
Well,

2371
02:22:37,921 --> 02:22:40,200
you remember that girl that
you were dating that was
telling you that you had to

2372
02:22:40,201 --> 02:22:43,400
do dark comedy. You should
be all dark. Should actually,

2373
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:47,700
people give shit advice all the time.
They just do.

2374
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:52,920
It's a, it's a real common
thing man. And I don't,

2375
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:56,910
sometimes I wonder if they're
trying to sabotage you or you.

2376
02:22:56,911 --> 02:22:59,100
Sometimes when I hear people's
really shitty advice I'm like,

2377
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:03,840
do you really believe this or are you
subconsciously want to sabotage this

2378
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:07,440
person?
Are you like not making sense,

2379
02:23:07,441 --> 02:23:09,750
but you're pushing it and
pretending you're making sense.

2380
02:23:09,751 --> 02:23:10,950
Like what's really going on here?

2381
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:14,820
Cause this is like your own internal
turmoil bubbling to the surface.

2382
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,220
Right.
I think a lot of people,

2383
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:21,590
I think a lot of people want to be given
advice from people they think are smart.

2384
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,710
So sometimes they'll get
those people bad advice,

2385
02:23:25,580 --> 02:23:29,900
not realizing that we know
it's bad advice, hoping that
we give them good advice.

2386
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:31,123
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

2387
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:35,230
Maybe like the, you'll correct
them and give them good advice.

2388
02:23:35,231 --> 02:23:38,390
I think that some people were
also, yeah. EGOMANIACS yeah.

2389
02:23:38,410 --> 02:23:40,270
And they think that they're
right all the time. Yeah.

2390
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:46,740
It's super hard to just step outside of
yourself and look at your own opinions

2391
02:23:47,711 --> 02:23:50,560
and look at someone else's opinion
to go, hmm, who's right here.

2392
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:52,450
Cause you automatically want
to pick the year. Right.

2393
02:23:52,451 --> 02:23:54,690
So you start out from the
position that you're right.

2394
02:23:56,490 --> 02:24:01,120
It's cause we get attached to ideas and
the ideas sort of become a part of you.

2395
02:24:01,150 --> 02:24:03,460
They define you.
They're not just an idea,

2396
02:24:03,461 --> 02:24:06,220
it's you and your idea all connected.

2397
02:24:06,670 --> 02:24:09,190
And that that's a real problem that
a lot of people have with thinking.

2398
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:13,570
I've had it myself and it's something
that I've had to work really hard to push

2399
02:24:13,571 --> 02:24:15,100
away to knock out.

2400
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:18,760
You don't thinking and
learning how to think.

2401
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:22,210
It's like one of the weirdest things
because it's one of the most important

2402
02:24:22,211 --> 02:24:26,230
parts of life. But it's one of the few
things that we discussed here in school.

2403
02:24:27,310 --> 02:24:29,800
Like when you're in school,
you're learning information,

2404
02:24:30,130 --> 02:24:33,460
but are you learning how to think?
Are you learning how to be objective?

2405
02:24:33,490 --> 02:24:36,760
Are you learning how to look at yourself
and look at your actions and how you

2406
02:24:36,761 --> 02:24:38,860
treat others,
how you treat yourself,

2407
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:44,140
and what distractions you're throwing
up in your life in order to deal with

2408
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:47,720
your, uh, uh, you know, like, uh,

2409
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:53,520
especially if you're not getting
things done or you're procrastinating,

2410
02:24:54,011 --> 02:24:55,360
you're putting things off.

2411
02:24:55,361 --> 02:24:57,820
If you have any addictions
or things along those lines,

2412
02:24:58,290 --> 02:25:02,280
you start creating all these problems in
your life to distract yourself with and

2413
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:04,470
they don't teach you about that in school.
It's really interesting.

2414
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:07,420
It's really interesting.
And they don't teach you a lot of shit,

2415
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:09,490
which is really interesting.

2416
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:13,390
It was just thinking about this last night
while I was smoking weed before going

2417
02:25:13,391 --> 02:25:18,130
to bed and I was thinking somebody gave
me a dirty look cause I was blatantly

2418
02:25:18,131 --> 02:25:20,980
just smoking a joint. Like it was
a cigarette in front of that hotel.

2419
02:25:20,981 --> 02:25:25,570
I don't give a fuck. Right. And
somebody gave me a look like, Eh, Eh,

2420
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:26,433
like that book

2421
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:30,560
Texas, they do that fine. I know
in California nobody gives a shit.

2422
02:25:30,561 --> 02:25:31,970
That's why you're used to doing it.

2423
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:35,300
Like if you're hanging out at the comedy
store outside and someone's parks and

2424
02:25:35,301 --> 02:25:36,860
join up, it's super normal. Yeah.

2425
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:41,660
Well,
what's crazy is that like if I was,

2426
02:25:41,690 --> 02:25:45,200
if I took out a pill bottle and put a
pill in my hand and popped it in my mouth,

2427
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:48,530
if I like, nobody even goes, what's that?

2428
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:53,730
Oh, I think they do. It could be anything.
Oh, I do. I see somebody take a pill. My,

2429
02:25:53,731 --> 02:25:55,340
what's going on, dude? He trippin

2430
02:25:57,250 --> 02:26:01,580
you up to man stranger. If I
see a dot dude, pop a pill,

2431
02:26:01,581 --> 02:26:04,830
we would make eye contact. I very
well might say, what's the pill man?

2432
02:26:07,710 --> 02:26:11,980
I'm nosy. Meanwhile, it's funny, people
get judgy about joints, but it's like, oh,

2433
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:13,590
how about drink right in front of you,
right?

2434
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:19,200
Antidepressants and a painkiller and
an anti. He was an inside the medicine,

2435
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:21,210
but they'll give you a
funny look for smoking.

2436
02:26:21,211 --> 02:26:25,160
A joint self-medicating after
meditating. You know what I mean? Yeah.

2437
02:26:25,170 --> 02:26:25,831
But the joint,

2438
02:26:25,831 --> 02:26:30,060
the problem is if you went now other
people have to smell it and some people

2439
02:26:30,061 --> 02:26:33,990
think about like secondhand smoke and
they think you're in some your way.

2440
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:37,590
You're making them smell this thing that
you're doing. You see what I'm saying?

2441
02:26:37,830 --> 02:26:42,090
Yeah. I guess smelling. Yeah. It's
like someone with a big stinky cigar.

2442
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:45,270
There's sitting right next to you
at a bar. You'd be like, oh Jesus,

2443
02:26:45,271 --> 02:26:48,210
this guy is stinky ass
cigar or cigarettes.

2444
02:26:48,410 --> 02:26:51,090
So you smoked cigarettes so you
don't realize how vital they are.

2445
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:53,880
But when someone else who
doesn't smoke cigarettes,

2446
02:26:53,930 --> 02:26:57,870
Nelson like I had to be with Stan
hope we were in a closed room.

2447
02:26:57,871 --> 02:27:00,150
We were talking about something.
Then he just sparks up.

2448
02:27:00,330 --> 02:27:03,950
We're in the comedy store bar, the little
comedians bar. I had to stand outside.

2449
02:27:03,951 --> 02:27:06,150
I'm like, dude, you just smoked
three cigarettes in five minutes.

2450
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:07,111
I got to go outside.

2451
02:27:07,111 --> 02:27:09,990
There's no air left in this room
and just all cigarette smoke.

2452
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,780
You don't even think about
it because it's super normal.

2453
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:16,610
I love it. How much do you smoke? Now?

2454
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:21,130
I'm cutting back a little bit.
I'm gonna pack a day a little bit less.

2455
02:27:21,660 --> 02:27:24,620
Little bit less. We're getting there.
I really am. I'm doing some work.

2456
02:27:24,621 --> 02:27:25,580
I just got some,
uh,

2457
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,530
I just got this DVD set that's supposed
to like hypnotize the magic out of it.

2458
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:34,070
It's supposed to make you realize what
like a terrible person you are for

2459
02:27:34,071 --> 02:27:35,180
smoking cigarettes.

2460
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:37,530
Well, you know, terrible
person. You're just being silly.

2461
02:27:37,650 --> 02:27:40,200
Yeah, I was tortured. You're
just like, I know that it's bad.

2462
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:44,770
It's an interesting feeling though.
I've smoked one of your cigarettes before.

2463
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:46,840
It gives you like a little head rush.

2464
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:49,930
Like it's good to do right before
a show worth nine. Yeah. I mean,

2465
02:27:49,931 --> 02:27:52,530
I don't think you should do it because if
you do it, you'll get addicted and you,

2466
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:53,710
you'll swap a lot of them.

2467
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:57,970
But if you're the type of person that
gets smoke one cigarette and then go do

2468
02:27:57,971 --> 02:28:01,720
something, I think it has a, it's
been kind of proven that nicotine,

2469
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:04,570
you actually wouldn't have to smoke,
just take nicotine gum,

2470
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:08,920
but that nicotine has a cognitive benefit,
but it's actually like a nootropic.

2471
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:17,200
I can't imagine writing or performing
without nicotine. That part's weird.

2472
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:21,980
Wow. That's crazy. You can go without
anything else. But that, that part's guys,

2473
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:24,650
that's crazy. They
started on it. You know,

2474
02:28:24,651 --> 02:28:28,250
it sucks where I'm from and young sound,
I'm not making lazy excuses,

2475
02:28:28,251 --> 02:28:30,980
but where I'm from,
tons of people smoked,

2476
02:28:30,981 --> 02:28:35,960
everybody smoked and my parents smoked
and you know they both quit now.

2477
02:28:35,961 --> 02:28:40,310
But when I was growing up it was like my,
I thought my dad was cool as hell.

2478
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:43,990
This cool Italian guy. What uptone and
he'd light up a cigarette all cool.

2479
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:48,230
Like a real Italian guy with a Zippo
and the pack of Marlboro Lights and he

2480
02:28:48,231 --> 02:28:53,030
looked cool and it in my favorite movie
was good my whole life and everybody

2481
02:28:53,031 --> 02:28:57,060
mixed smoking look cool on that.
Real Weird of Robert Deniro joke has she?

2482
02:28:57,061 --> 02:29:02,010
Everybody's fucking smoking as
selling cigarettes, eaten pasta block,

2483
02:29:02,310 --> 02:29:05,390
taking a lobster out of the ice.
Everything looks better in that will.

2484
02:29:06,270 --> 02:29:11,270
It is crazy that cigarettes are thought
of as a cool thing and it's also,

2485
02:29:11,341 --> 02:29:13,560
there's a thing where you
know that it's bad for you.

2486
02:29:13,561 --> 02:29:15,600
You're doing it any way
because you don't give a fuck.

2487
02:29:15,610 --> 02:29:20,200
It is, it's definitely the
weirdest, stupidest thing that I do.

2488
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:24,610
Like, I've never even
tried cocaine, not once,

2489
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:28,420
which I think is almost like unheard of
for somebody doing standup in a life for

2490
02:29:28,421 --> 02:29:32,770
10 years. I've never tried it
either. Really? Nope. Yeah.

2491
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:37,600
But meanwhile I, and the reason why I
don't try it is because I don't, you know,

2492
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:38,850
I don't want to know.

2493
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:42,630
Well, I did a, um, a tea once,
it's called Mata de Coco.

2494
02:29:42,990 --> 02:29:47,670
It's a tea that you make
with coca leaves and um,

2495
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:51,090
it's not, it's like a super mild
tea. Like, you know, the coca leaves,

2496
02:29:51,091 --> 02:29:54,240
they chew them and it gives him energy
almost like, like a coffee thing.

2497
02:29:54,241 --> 02:29:56,760
But I didn't like the feeling,
I couldn't shut the fuck up.

2498
02:29:56,761 --> 02:29:57,780
I was talking too much.

2499
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:03,900
I was just feeling like really? And that
was just from that, I was like, God,

2500
02:30:03,901 --> 02:30:04,920
what would I be like on coke?

2501
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:10,130
Yeah. But anyway, so yeah, I think
that has a lot to do with it.

2502
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:12,830
Like makes shitty environment coming up.

2503
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:17,740
And now that I'm used to doing
everything with that Crotch,

2504
02:30:17,770 --> 02:30:22,640
like it's sort of just trying to like
slowly retrain the brain and slowly create

2505
02:30:22,641 --> 02:30:26,690
new habits and figure it all out.
But definitely going to quit here.

2506
02:30:26,691 --> 02:30:29,870
So let's start smiling.
More proud.

2507
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,980
Good move. Yeah. I mean,

2508
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:36,910
it's just so bad for your health
and you don't want to die young man,

2509
02:30:37,690 --> 02:30:41,480
and you don't want to like have a
slow death either. The worst thing is,

2510
02:30:43,060 --> 02:30:47,230
oh shit. That's it ladies and
gentlemen. And on that note,

2511
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:50,050
we're going to wrap this bitch
up and bringing it on down.

2512
02:30:50,051 --> 02:30:52,990
I see the ground outside the window.
Yep.

2513
02:30:54,730 --> 02:30:59,560
No chem trails again. I keep waiting.
All right folks. We'll see you.

2514
02:31:00,010 --> 02:31:00,820
Thanks.
Bye.
