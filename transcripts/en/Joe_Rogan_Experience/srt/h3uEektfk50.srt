00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,530
Isn't it amazing that we even have
what's legal and what's not legal?

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:07,771
I mean,

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:08,550
what does that mean?

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,480
Wrote it down on paper.

6
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:10,230
We all agreed.

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,770
I mean thinking about the shit that isn't
isn't illegal and the fact that war is

8
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:14,670
on that list at all.

9
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,590
I had like laws.

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,470
Do you like what wants you
can't beat the shit out of him.

11
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:20,304
He

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,160
can't come into my house to take my stuff.

13
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:23,994
What am I going to do?

14
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,680
What am I honestly going to do about it?

15
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,030
I was thinking about that when I was
watching the UFC this past weekend.

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,260
I was watching this,

17
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:36,261
a frightful beating that
Alexander Gustafson put on
glover to share and it was

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,130
just a ruthless knockout,

19
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:42,060
just fucking vicious beat down and
then eventually stopped him and I was

20
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:42,301
thinking,

21
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,360
it's kind of crazy that
these guys agree to do this.

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,590
They agree to do this.

23
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:49,200
Everybody signs away and then you go
do something that anywhere else in the

24
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,880
world you would get locked down for.

25
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,290
The rest of that happens in hockey every
once in awhile where somebody goes too

26
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,930
far and then the government gets involved.

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,590
Really?

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,250
Yeah.

29
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,250
Like what do they do if you hit somebody
in the head with a stick goes outside

30
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,990
the boundaries of a setting.

31
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,740
The tone.

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,060
That seems like a pussy move though.

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,350
Hit Him with a stick.

34
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,180
You're supposed to punch.

35
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,730
Well,

36
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,220
it's so weird when you got
this stick in your hand.

37
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,540
You know it,

38
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,170
it just the shit that you
sometimes think of doing.

39
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,720
I would bury each other and the balls.

40
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,000
They fucking whack at the bay.

41
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,620
There's no padding behind your legs.

42
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,490
Just imagine that just taken
up would stick it just ah,

43
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,310
with NHL level strength and just given
someone a two hander the backlight,

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,620
they break people's finger.

45
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:34,590
Crosby almost took somebody's
finger off this year.

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,960
If they get too far,

47
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,320
like if the.

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,290
If it gets really.

49
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,030
If they just opened the
rules up a little bit.

50
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:39,721
You know what's gonna Happen?

51
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:39,931
They're gonna.

52
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,840
Bring in figure skaters and they
going to teach them taekwondo.

53
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,510
I'm going to cut people's fucking
heads off with the skates.

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,871
Dude.

55
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,230
You're spinning elk man.

56
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,480
If you ever learned how to skate,

57
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,620
you'd be fucking dangerous.

58
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,970
If you have a did that with skates on,

59
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,571
that would be it.

60
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,171
That's what I'm saying.

61
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,400
If you teach that to somebody,

62
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,500
teach that to somebody with skates.

63
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,810
I mean if you could hit
someone with a hockey stick,

64
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,970
why can't you hit them with skate?

65
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,270
Like where were you on the line?

66
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,860
He can't hit them with
this that they do it.

67
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,010
Somebody does it to you.

68
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:07,860
I know they slashed and
they do stuff like that.

69
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,240
You can't club somebody over.

70
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,950
I mean even slashing so.

71
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:11,281
Okay.

72
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll just slash your leg out.

73
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,153
What would you rather have?

74
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,550
Would you rather have ticket get hit
by a piece of wood and you don't have a

75
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,980
bruise there or have somebody
slash you with escape?

76
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,050
I would absolutely rather
get hit by the piece of wood,

77
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,610
but I shouldn't get hit
by the piece of wood.

78
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,030
I don't.

79
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,930
I don't play hockey,

80
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,970
but if I did play hockey
I'd be pretty pissed.

81
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:27,990
If somebody hit me with a stick,

82
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:28,381
I'd be like,

83
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,210
you fucking pussy and I'd want to hit.

84
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:34,380
It became like the second coming of
Thai Domi you have the exact same build.

85
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,620
He's a fucking guy who somehow was
like my height and was considered a

86
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:44,700
heavyweight fighter and he's
the guy according to him,

87
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,830
he came up with the,

88
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,780
grab them by,

89
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,350
right,

90
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,160
right underneath your collar and then
turn all the way sideways because he

91
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,600
didn't have the reach advantage.

92
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,483
Oh.

93
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,221
And then he would,

94
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:59,560
he would wait for them to throw he
duck under and then come over the top.

95
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,041
And Dude,

96
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,360
I,

97
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,290
I met him one time,

98
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,460
great fucking guy.

99
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:03,850
And he,

100
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,100
he's got these as like
your hands use your hands.

101
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,641
You make like that.

102
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,510
It turns into a hammer.

103
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,261
It's the same thing.

104
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:13,261
He has like these inexplicably like bare
fucking pause and I might be a little

105
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,544
taller than him.

106
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,110
And I remember when he's tried to show
me when he grabbed the front of my shirt

107
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:20,890
to show me,

108
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,131
like,

109
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,390
I literally felt like an adrenaline,

110
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,500
like a flashback.

111
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,670
I hope this guy doesn't snap.

112
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,990
Now he's one of the,

113
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,260
like,

114
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,620
he's,

115
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,060
he's one of the toughest guys
that ever you ever played?

116
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,550
Uh,

117
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,650
there's some girls in Portland that had
taken a rash of shit because they're

118
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,210
selling burritos and they're white.

119
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,770
They made a burrito truck and people are
going crazy trying to shut them down,

120
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,720
shut them down because they're not
Mexican and they're selling burritos like

121
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,483
they're not.

122
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,260
They're not pretending.

123
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,600
They're not like putting shoe
Polish on and pretending.

124
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,000
And I put in Brown face on there
just fucking selling burritos.

125
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,180
Like it's so crazy.

126
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,000
Critics close,

127
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,970
white women's Portland Burrito
stand for cultural theft.

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,050
What the fuck man?

129
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:07,270
Their burritos assholes next against.

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,620
Don't even even free to just.

131
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,473
They do.

132
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,160
You mentioned a Mexican expert Burritos A.

133
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,120
I've eaten Burritos in Mexico.

134
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,403
Yes.

135
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,130
I have had a real chicken burrito
in Mexico and was quite delicious.

136
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,993
I love Mexico.

137
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,320
I just don't understand why anybody
thinks that there's something wrong with

138
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,270
learning a style of cooking.

139
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,260
It's like,

140
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,330
I think if you have
cultural appropriation,

141
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:35,100
if you have like a person who's pretending
they're from Laos and they start

142
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,560
talking with the fake accent and you know,

143
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,251
and you go,

144
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:38,940
hey man,

145
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,320
you're full fucking Cleveland.

146
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,154
You're not even.

147
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,240
You're not even have Laos to scent like
you do at 23 and me on you and you find

148
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,710
out like your family is from Finland,

149
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,030
like the fuck is wrong with you.

150
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,420
Like,

151
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,910
but there are people that
do that and that is crazy.

152
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,690
Right?

153
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,070
But that's just deceptive.

154
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,400
This is not deceptive.

155
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,100
Someone who likes making Burritos,

156
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:59,670
they're making burritos and then these
goofy white kids are fucking closing them

157
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:00,420
down.

158
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,530
And that's what it is.

159
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,270
Cultural Appropriation,

160
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:06,810
heroes just shouting out from
the rooftop that you're wrong,

161
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,921
you're wrong.

162
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:08,551
It's like you said,

163
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:10,590
we're just always
looking for who to blame,

164
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,550
who to be mad at,

165
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,530
who to make sort of the,

166
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:16,200
the persecutor of our felt wrongness.

167
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,370
It's that same issue.

168
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,013
Wow.

169
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,170
We premiered last night and
it will air this Sunday.

170
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,920
And uh,

171
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,540
Jim Carey said some amazing things,

172
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,320
man.

173
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,501
Yeah.

174
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:26,400
That's our cast photo.

175
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,510
That one that you clicked that one.

176
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,340
Yeah.

177
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,840
Did it feel weird to beyond that?

178
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,201
I mean,

179
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:31,190
it must have been like,

180
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,700
I can tell you from
the bottom of my heart,

181
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,080
it was the most important
thing I've done so far.

182
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,003
Wow,

183
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,341
dude.

184
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:38,581
I mean,

185
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,960
we're paying homage to the world that,

186
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,240
that we love and respect so much and it
was a big effort on Jim's part and his

187
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:45,781
producing partner,

188
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:47,310
Michael Aguilar to like tell real stories.

189
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,800
A lot of the stories that people will
see if you watch the show and I hope you

190
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,860
do come from Jim's real life
to dudes from Boston moved.

191
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:55,650
They live in a fucking dude's closet in
West Hollywood and they used to be a guy

192
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,110
that would jerk off and
watched him change him,

193
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,300
put that story in the show man.

194
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,750
He wanted all these little great tidbits.

195
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,890
There's a great moment about jokes
dealing in there and a fucking huge fist

196
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:05,571
fight that breaks out.

197
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:09,470
That was real from Jim's personal life
about guys who used to come in from the

198
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,101
fucking radio,

199
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,900
from talk radio in the morning.

200
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,950
They come to the club at night,

201
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,903
come to the store,

202
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,600
steal shit.

203
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,220
The next morning comics
would fucking hear it.

204
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,791
Yeah.

205
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,700
That's a real common thing
and that was always going on.

206
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,660
You know what else was going on?

207
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,690
A big one was a writers for sitcoms
would come same shit and they would watch

208
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:28,320
people do sets and then they
would wind up putting their,

209
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,420
their bits and like even on
fucking Seinfeld kept wanting.

210
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,810
Kevin James Signature bits got used on
Seinfeld after he had a bunch of meetings

211
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,580
and then they came to see him perform.

212
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,930
A bunch of top writers came to see
him performing and NBC showcase.

213
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,040
It was only when Kevin was getting a
development deal and they came down and

214
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,420
watched him and then like the next
season his muffin bit was on a Seinfeld

215
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,290
episode.

216
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,831
It was like,

217
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,120
what the fuck man?

218
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,230
Well nowadays they fucking.

219
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,310
They're blatantly tell you,

220
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,550
like I tested for Saturday night live
and you sign a form that says these

221
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,550
characters can be used after the audition.

222
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,030
Whoa,

223
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,741
and this is crazy.

224
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm not calling out
anybody or saying anything,

225
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:06,260
but they did.

226
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,380
There was a character ended up on the
show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking

227
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,071
hilariously,

228
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,570
that I did something
similar in my audition.

229
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:11,841
I was like,

230
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,081
damn,

231
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:12,810
that was really good.

232
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,490
It's me.

233
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,050
So you,

234
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,900
you audition,

235
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,711
you have a character.

236
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,550
You audition with,

237
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:16,701
yeah,

238
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,870
I did this character at is fake.

239
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,790
They can steal that.

240
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,663
They own that now.

241
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,510
Cause you audition,

242
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,021
you audition,

243
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,010
you surrender the character.

244
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,090
Fuck you man.

245
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Yeah,

246
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,110
you sign a piece of paper,

247
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:24,251
man.

248
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:28,010
It's crazy to not even giving you money
and they're stealing your idea when you

249
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:28,844
get there.

250
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,380
That's the respect that,

251
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,050
uh,

252
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,870
the SNL has earned in the community.

253
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,540
You don't,

254
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,000
you don't have that respect.

255
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,260
It's crazy that stealing.

256
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,950
You're stealing while I signed the form,

257
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:38,570
man.

258
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,403
Oh my God,

259
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,430
that's so awful.

260
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,680
I signed that shit because of the.

261
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,980
Because you can almost taste it,

262
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,400
you know,

263
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,190
they're making you sign something
saying we're going to steal from you.

264
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,880
Totally.

265
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,820
So there was an instance
where a faculty member,

266
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,130
I'm accused those that were challenging
any of these equity proposals as being

267
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:57,140
part of a racist backlash.

268
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,140
And she was clearly talking
about me because I'm the most,

269
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,740
um,

270
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,250
the most prominent a person
objects as faculty member,

271
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
a white person or no.

272
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,883
Um,

273
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,341
so anyway,

274
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,230
she says in a faculty meeting that,

275
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,360
uh,

276
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,850
this is a racist backlash.

277
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,150
And I said to her in front
of this faculty meeting,

278
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,870
I said,

279
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,350
somebody might want to check on the
question of whether or not I'm actually a

280
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:18,801
racist,

281
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,960
because if you do check on it,

282
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,650
um,

283
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,880
you will discover I'm not,

284
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:23,571
and if you don't,

285
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,920
this is going to blow up on you.

286
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,610
And the chair of the Faculty told me that
the faculty meeting was not the place

287
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,250
to defend myself against
accusations of racism.

288
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,420
I said to her,

289
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,800
that's fine.

290
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,060
Where is not the place to
level to level the accusations.

291
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,661
But I said,

292
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,620
where is the place?

293
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,010
And then the faculty member who
had made the accusation said,

294
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:49,280
you should not expect there to be a
venue in which to defend yourself.

295
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,800
You should just get used
to these accusations.

296
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,970
In a separate case.

297
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,320
I was telling who said
that a white guy or oh,

298
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,170
it's the same faculty member
who made the accusation,

299
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,040
wait a minute,

300
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,910
the person said that you should just
accept these untrue accusations.

301
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,773
Yes.

302
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,823
Um,

303
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,160
yeah.

304
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,321
I mean,

305
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,300
what's your reaction to that?

306
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,810
That this is not a place for you to defend
yourself against racist accusations.

307
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,850
This is a place for you to just eat shit,

308
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,180
right?

309
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,730
You just have to accept these
accusations on a separate occasion.

310
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,590
We were also told that,

311
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,513
um,

312
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
that to question,

313
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,550
uh,

314
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,740
an allegation of racism is racist.

315
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,700
Oh,

316
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,481
so convenient.

317
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:27,900
Yeah.

318
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
We'll try to wrap your mind around that.

319
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:33,600
One question and accusation
of racism is racist,

320
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:33,780
right?

321
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,040
We have an obligation to believe.

322
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,750
Wow.

323
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,620
I know.
