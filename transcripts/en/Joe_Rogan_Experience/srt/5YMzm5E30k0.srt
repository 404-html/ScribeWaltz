1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,800
The joe rogan experience.
Dot.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,680
I'm not,
I just don't have any room.

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:07,450
I look,
I watch professional pool.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,750
One of those that you love going to
Canada.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,860
I go to Canada and I turned on their
espn in Canada sneaker and it,

6
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,870
and they got like,
they got the darling,

7
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,610
they got curling may got stuff where I
go,

8
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:22,050
we would never show this bullshit cap
up.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,440
Can I get a Kleenex man nasally and we
just ran out.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,593
Here you go.
Nasally.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,030
Yeah.
So it's not that like I don't,

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,290
I'm a caveman.
It's just,

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,410
I like what Jesus.
Sarah,

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,620
are you doing that on Mike?
I've got a big nose pushed up

15
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,940
microphone.
You,

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,220
but yeah,
but you're blowing hard with that Schnoz

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,230
old you go deep son.
You just made people throw up because

18
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:52,120
people listening to the,
it's funny how the fluid coming out of

19
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:55,480
people's nose is so vile that sound,
you know,

20
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,790
like when something like you on a
basketball court or something like that

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,310
and someone does a solid rock,
you see it like,

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,643
whoa.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,610
And he tells me on Monday I got to get
out of the apartment.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,360
So instead of going to look for a new
apartment over the weekend,

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,180
I go to my friend's Bachelor Party on
the Jersey Shore.

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm at the Bachelor Party.
I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see

27
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,370
this girl.
I started chatting with her.

28
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,160
She asked me where I live.
I told her actually,

29
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,080
as of Monday,
I have nowhere to go.

30
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,680
She takes out a Napkin.
She writes her address on the Napkin.

31
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm 21 years old and she says,
if it's an emergency on Monday and

32
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,450
you're stuck,
you can come live with me.

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,660
Monday comes,
I get kicked out of my friend's

34
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,310
apartment.
I have nowhere to go.

35
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:38,050
I'm like,
this is an emergency.

36
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,680
I take out the Napkin and I live with
this girl and her roommate for six

37
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:46,000
months.
It turns out that her father is a big

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,030
entrepreneur business man.

39
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,610
He owns a piece of the Yankees,
dislike monster mogul.

40
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,430
I write this song for the New York
Knicks called [inaudible] and it becomes

41
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,670
a big success.
You remember that song?

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,991
No,
no,

43
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:00,420
no.
Okay.

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,620
That's okay.
That's okay.

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm not a sports fan.
That's fine.

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,840
It becomes a big hit.
And I just realized that there's an

47
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:10,080
opportunity to write theme songs for all
these professional sports teams.

48
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:14,370
But I don't have a penny to go in the
studio to do the demos,

49
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,530
to shop him to the team.
So I need money.

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,950
So I go to this music guy and he says,
I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these

51
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:25,590
songs for 10% of everything you make for
the rest of your life.

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,960
He wants to buy me like a style the rest
of your life.

53
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,180
I'm 21 he's like the rest of the rest of
your life.

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,970
Everything you do,
I will invest in you own an airplane

55
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:33,510
business.

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,460
He owns 10% yes.
Forever.

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,870
Yes.
You have to kill him then.

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,370
Yes.
Yeah,

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,290
you have to kill that guy.
But I need the 10 grand.

60
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,730
So I say,
I'll take it.

61
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,440
So before I take it,
I go to this girl's father for advice,

62
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,730
this business mogul.
Then I'm living with her and I sit down

63
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,420
and I'd go to this guy's apartment
again.

64
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,421
I'm 21 he's got in his apartment,
he's got a swimming pool artwork like

65
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,770
fancy fuck women.
He's macked out man.

66
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,730
It's like,
I've never seen anything like this in

67
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,990
Manhattan,
in Manhattan.

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,550
I'm just setting the stage of the
conversation and I go in and I tell him

69
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,180
the story about the percent grant and he
says to me,

70
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,840
I would trade,
this is exactly what he said to me.

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,220
I will trade everything that I have for
you to get out of my daughter's life.

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,170
Exactly.
Outweighed everything I have for the one

73
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,640
thing that you have.
And I'm like,

74
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,840
man,
I'm fucking broke.

75
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,760
What he taught me,
I go,

76
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,080
what's that?
And he said,

77
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,260
youth,
because he had already gone through the

78
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:43,261
journey even though he had everything,
he already had gone through the process.

79
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,040
He wasn't that 20 year old that you're
talking about that whatever he had gone

80
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,510
through it,
he had it all.

81
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,150
He he,
he missed the process.

82
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:57,151
The journey of being you coming up at 20
and not know like you know here you are.

83
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,910
But it was the,
those were the years man.

84
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,070
The first fight,
the first this like that.

85
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,340
That's what,
that's what makes you like so,

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
and that stuck with me,
man.

87
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,470
At 21 years old,
it's stuck with me and realize that

88
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:11,801
like,
man,

89
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:16,330
I got to enjoy the process and it's
really never rubbed off on me in front

90
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:16,470
of me.

91
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,730
Oh,
well why didn't that guy,

92
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,950
how old was this guy at the time?
The old rich dude,

93
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,000
he was,
let's see,

94
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,280
he must have been his sixties.
What did I just do?

95
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,770
Shit to a bunch of shoot day lounge
around his fucking swimming pool did.

96
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,920
And he did.
He had an amazing,

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,000
he was 20.
He had an amazing life.

98
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,000
He had an amazing life.
So what did you wind up doing?

99
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,400
Uh,
he said the SEC,

100
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,140
the second part of that conversation,
he said,

101
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,003
do you,
um,

102
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,830
will you make this work on your own?
I said,

103
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,120
I think I can.
He said,

104
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,300
I didn't ask if you can.
He said,

105
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:45,940
I,
I said,

106
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,130
he said,
will you make it work?

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,713
I said,
I will.

108
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,040
He said,
and then go tell the guy to fuck off and

109
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,660
make it.
And it goes and go make it work.

110
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,003
And I did,

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,330
but it was only like occasionally like a
party.

112
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,740
And I always felt like a loser for doing
it.

113
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,540
You know,
like everybody else would be getting

114
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,110
high and I'm but who?
And,

115
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,800
but I was probably already drunk anyway,
you know,

116
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,870
like when I was 14 or 15 or something
like that.

117
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,310
So maybe I smoked weed a handful of
times,

118
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:18,170
less than a dozen times until I was 30.
And then Eddie Bravo got me into it when

119
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:21,230
I was 30 years old.
We were doing Jujitsu together and,

120
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,480
uh,
he was telling me how marijuana was

121
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:27,050
helping his Jujitsu and helping his
music and his creativity.

122
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,060
It was like,
what the fuck is this guy talking about?

123
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,190
My Dude,
marijuana just makes it stupid.

124
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,761
Like,
don't,

125
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:32,960
you know,
you know,

126
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:33,950
and he's like,
just try it.

127
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,010
And he,
we got high and,

128
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,930
uh,
I remember thinking like,

129
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,150
Oh,
this is what it is.

130
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,070
Like,
wow,

131
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,780
I did not know
that feeling.

132
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,291
Like,
you're like,

133
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,840
why are you by yourself?
It's this,

134
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,710
no,
it's just me and Eddie.

135
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,663
Oh,
sweet.

136
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,091
Oh,
sorry.

137
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,490
I can't believe this.
We went and got something to eat.

138
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,750
We're talking,
Oh yeah,

139
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:59,990
we gave go by crazy,
talked about all kinds of crazy shit.

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,820
And then I remember I started smoking
pot and getting on stage and got her,

141
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,610
it was her kitten.
Real quick eat with Mike,

142
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,410
my comedy and then smoking pot and doing
Jujitsu.

143
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,700
I was like,
I can't believe how zoned in and gets

144
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:15,480
you with training,
smoking pot and hitting the bag to this

145
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,580
day is like one of my all time favorite
things.

146
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,850
I get paranoid,
I get weirded out,

147
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,740
I get,
I get freaked out,

148
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,490
but I just fucking wrap up my hands,
put on the timer and just,

149
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,950
once that sweat starts flowing and she's
tall

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,590
and it's almost like the paranoia and
the weirdness of it all,

151
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,110
you just fight it off by hitting that
bag.

152
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,030
Boom,
boom.

153
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,690
You know,
and you,

154
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,350
you hear the bell that says 30 seconds
and your flurry in and then you get that

155
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:48,351
one minute off to think about life and
the future and the fuck can universe and

156
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,130
volcanoes and Guatemala and Hawaiian.
Oh God,

157
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,290
the bell goes off again.
You got another three rounds,

158
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,000
three minutes,
man.

159
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,180
It's one of my,
my like it's,

160
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,030
it's a psychedelic experience.
It's like a cleansing experience hitting

161
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,550
the bag when you're high.
I like,

162
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,200
I love shadowboxing.
When I'm hiring,

163
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,030
I'll take a rip out at home and just sit
there,

164
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,340
have a little mirror and I'll just
shadowbox don't even know how long.

165
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,010
I just can just shout a box for it.
Go.

166
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you know what's weird?
Like you feel balance when you're high.

167
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,390
You feel like,
like maybe like if you got an injury,

168
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,930
you feel it more,
you feel like we're a laser off.

169
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,150
You know what I mean?
And like for me,

170
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,380
I,
I feel my transfer of power better when

171
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:30,450
I'm high.
Like,

172
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,440
like certain techniques.
I,

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,370
I really get the timing of when to turn
the hip over.

174
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,840
I feel it more when I'm high.
I like,

175
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,920
I feel the connection with all that
tissue,

176
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,370
all of it working together.
And I think that is,

177
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,830
that's what's happening.
I think that's what's happening with,

178
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:50,200
with this Allah phrenia thing,
if that's what it's called.

179
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,000
Um,
I might be remembering that incorrectly,

180
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,390
but this,
this thing that being around his

181
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:59,391
schizophrenia person,
like whatever weird error or brain is

182
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,890
making your,
your brain tunes into that air and you

183
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:05,860
start going crazy too.
As soon as that shit made sense,

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,930
I was like,
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

185
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,640
Cause he's done.
He's harmless.

186
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,780
He's never heard anyone,
but he still,

187
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:16,460
you know,
these days he's what he's prop guy.

188
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,430
He's probably in his sixties,
not in any kind of shape,

189
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,860
but back then when he still knew of
martial arts.

190
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,080
Oh he,
your stage,

191
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:24,310
your man.
But he never hurt anybody,

192
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:27,060
but he knew how to.
And um,

193
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,160
so one day there's eastern avenue in
Baltimore's,

194
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,970
for lack of a better term,
the Ventura Boulevard of Baltimore shops

195
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,700
everywhere and everything.
And there was this one woman that had

196
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:40,510
cut his hair one time and for him,
excuse me,

197
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:43,690
to touch his head,
was a big deal for him.

198
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,450
This.
So he immediately fell in love with this

199
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:48,280
lady.
Her name was Carissa.

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,990
So he went home and got his guitar.
And the thing about this guitar,

201
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,830
like this dude would pawn his bed,
his guitar,

202
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,693
everything.

203
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,700
But that guitar was always out of tune.
Exactly the same way.

204
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,600
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Does that make sense?

205
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,220
Okay.
So always fucked up,

206
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,740
but always consistently fucked up every
guitar he had.

207
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,780
That's how he tuned it.
That's how he heard it.

208
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,970
Oh Wow.
So he writes her,

209
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,150
he writes her a love song and he wants
to go up to her shop and now sing it for

210
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:22,260
her.
So he goes up and he stands out in front

211
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,670
of the shop and he's gets her attention.
He's got his guitar and he's gone and

212
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,140
starts off where he goes.
He goes,

213
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,390
Chris,
I love you and Baltimore accents.

214
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,920
Car Name's Karissa.
But he says,

215
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,340
Chrissa Okay Chris,
I love you Chris.

216
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,510
I need you.
Then he goes,

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,080
Chris,
at all,

218
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,170
dogs of crystal,
all crack is not what a dye crystal.

219
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,980
And she's freaking out like,
what the fuck?

220
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,701
Yeah,
like your eyes.

221
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:45,630
So they call the police,
he gets arrested.

222
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,940
Oh No.
When he doesn't understand why he's

223
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,760
arrested in his mind,
what did I do wrong?

224
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,760
I just wrote a beautiful song for
someone I care about and I wanted to

225
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,980
share it with her.
So my cousins,

226
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,380
all of us were like,
we gotta go to court and watch this.

227
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,150
This is going to,
cause he's got,

228
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,890
he's got to go to court.
So they bring them out from the back.

229
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,930
Oh No.
And he stands up and it's a,

230
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,730
it's a female judge.
And um,

231
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,511
my,
his mom,

232
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,690
my aunt Margaret and my great aunt,
my grandma's sister,

233
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:12,990
rods,
extended family,

234
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,770
big time and we're all there watching.
And the judge says,

235
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,930
ask the girl her side of things.
And she's like,

236
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:19,561
well,
this happened.

237
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,430
And he's like,
she's like,

238
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,530
would you like to speak on your behalf?

239
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,300
And he's like,
I just don't understand what I did

240
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,430
wrong.
I wrote a song for someone I care about

241
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,320
and I just wanted to share it.
And she's like,

242
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,630
would you mind sharing some of the
lyrics of,

243
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,100
we're all like,
aw shit.

244
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,930
And he fucking,
Chris,

245
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,850
I love you Chris.
I need you crystal.

246
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:36,780
All crack is,
I want to die.

247
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:37,470
She goes,
okay,

248
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,303
okay,
that's enough.

249
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,550
That's enough.
And then they're about to let him go

250
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,970
because they understand I'm gonna put a
restraining order.

251
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,590
He's under supervision,
but they're about to let him go.

252
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,011
And she goes,
oh,

253
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,270
wait a second.
Oh,

254
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,380
there's a,
Oh,

255
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,110
there's still an open charge here on the
books,

256
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,170
so we're going to have to take you back
to,

257
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,830
he starts losing his shit.
Like what?

258
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,680
Maya?
Marguerite stands up and to a judge,

259
00:10:58,681 --> 00:10:59,670
she goes,
Hun,

260
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,780
we dropped those charges.

261
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,720
Everyone Calls People Han in Baltimore.
She goes,

262
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,750
[inaudible] job,
those charter.

263
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,010
That lady said,
first of all,

264
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,030
you don't call me Hud.
I am a judge.

265
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,100
You address me as your honor.
We're all like,

266
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,160
I am augury got skull.
And they fucking took him back and he

267
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,380
was screaming going on.
Did they put,

268
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:20,220
uh,
the family put a charge on him?

269
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,090
Yeah,
he had,

270
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,300
he would do things like,
he would show up to their place in a cab

271
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,830
demand.
They pay for it.

272
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:27,480
They didn't,
he throw a brick through the window.

273
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,540
So they have
for that Jesus Christ.

274
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,160
And they really did drop the charges,
but it was just a clerical error that

275
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,870
never made it to the paperwork.
And she's like,

276
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,880
I got to do what I gotta do.
We're taking you back today.

277
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,680
And he was,
they were pulling it back and he was

278
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,620
gone nuts.
Oh my God,

279
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,454
yes.

280
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
Okay.

281
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,170
Okay.
