1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,190
Sure.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,530
Three,
two,

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,010
one.
He.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,480
Ha Ha.
Colin,

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,630
how are you buddy?
I'm good man.

6
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,260
How are you?
Good,

7
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,250
thanks.
What's going on?

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,570
What's cracking?
Not a lot.

9
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,040
It's a great honor for you to ask me 
back.

10
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,300
I appreciate it.
Oh my pleasure,

11
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,010
dude.
I had a great time with you last time.

12
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:17,940
It's good to see,
but thank you.

13
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,410
Good to see you too.
Congratulations.

14
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,640
You were just showing me around this 
space.

15
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,450
Thanks.
Very cool.

16
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,900
Thank you.
I'm very excited for weeks.

17
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,300
I'm excited too.
I bet.

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,350
Thanks man.
Appreciate it.

19
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,300
Jamie's moving shit around.
What happened?

20
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
Oh,
I was out of line.

21
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,170
Um,
so a welcome and a house Colin's last 

22
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,170
stand going.
It's good.

23
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,430
It's fun.
It's,

24
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,030
you know,
I always describe it.

25
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:42,031
It's not big.
It's just got this little narrow slice 

26
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,031
of the Internet and uh,
it's attracted,

27
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,210
you know,
videos do 20,

28
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:42,750
30,
40,

29
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,840
50,000
views and I have a good spot.

30
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,760
That's a good place to be.
I'm happy with it.

31
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,690
And uh,
you know,

32
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,750
I have like 4,500
people on Patriot and supporting me and 

33
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,780
I don't serve ads on anything I do.
So I'm just trying to make it organic 

34
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,510
and see how far I can take it and then 
go from there.

35
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,900
Sam Harris says his entire podcast.
That way he doesn't have any ads,

36
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,490
which uh,
I think it's amazing.

37
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,060
Yeah,
it's cool.

38
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:03,860
Like I have no,
I,

39
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,400
you know,
I worked at ign for a long time,

40
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,970
the video game site and my old company 
so we had ads and I have no problem with

41
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:12,350
them but I was trying to just kind of 
say like,

42
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,430
I don't need more than what you're 
giving me.

43
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,760
This is Brittany and I'm doing fine.
And so,

44
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,260
you know,
maybe I'll do ads on future products but

45
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,170
not with us dot well,
yeah,

46
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,170
I mean why not,
right.

47
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,720
I mean just if you're enjoying it.
I mean,

48
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,200
you.
Yeah.

49
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,640
Do,
you could do different products,

50
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,760
you could do different projects whether 
you can do it different ways.

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,610
Yep.
Yeah.

52
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,120
It's,
it's,

53
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,140
it's interesting now to try to figure 
out like what's the best way for people 

54
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,680
to put their stuff out there.
Like I know a lot of people,

55
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,140
like in the podcast world,
some people use soundcloud,

56
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,250
some puppies,
other things,

57
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:44,190
some people just go straight to youtube.
I mean it's a,

58
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,200
there's a lot of experimentation going 
on now.

59
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,950
Yeah.
And,

60
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,780
and I,
I'm always fascinated by that particular

61
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,781
thing about how I do a podcast now just 
on the side called fireside chats where 

62
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,930
I just have random people into talk 
about random things.

63
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,400
Um,
and uh,

64
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,350
it was similar but not nearly as good as
your show.

65
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,180
And uh,
I,

66
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm always amazed that people are like,
why don't you put this on Youtube?

67
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,460
And I'm like,
you just want to stare at a static image

68
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,190
on youtube.
There's like,

69
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,260
not,
I don't even have it on video.

70
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,210
People just anxious about how people 
consume the content.

71
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,030
So maybe like a spreadsheet approach is 
probably the smartest idea.

72
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Well,
if you could hire someone to do images 

73
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,701
that represent the conversation,
maybe that would be a reason to have it 

74
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:19,701
on youtube.
But I hear you.

75
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:24,440
Yeah.
It's people just get excited about our 

76
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,350
platform.
They get locked into a platform and then

77
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,300
they just digest everything in that 
platform,

78
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:30,720
whether it's snapchat or instagram or 
youtube,

79
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,950
they just,
it's.

80
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,220
And it's weird with Jamie and I have 
been talking about this a lot lately 

81
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,370
about like what,
what makes it through,

82
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:43,371
like how did youtube become the only one
where people upload videos?

83
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:48,441
That seems insane.
It seems like that seems so 

84
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:50,730
straightforward.
You have it so people can upload videos.

85
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,190
You put ads on those videos and that's 
it.

86
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,340
I mean it seems like there would be 
hundreds of those sites.

87
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Yeah,
I think they were just first and it was 

88
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,460
kind of like,
uh,

89
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,460
was like ubiquitous

90
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,830
quickly.
So I find that with a lot of like social

91
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,000
media too,
like you think about,

92
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,030
um,
like snapchat's really faltering now 

93
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,041
because instagram is basically stolen 
it's entire platform and it's all about 

94
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,740
like kind of these little monopolies 
that exist.

95
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,420
Monopolies were pictures,
monopolies for video,

96
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:18,421
monopoly for interacting with friends 
and family on facebook and stuff like 

97
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:18,421
that.
There's no thinking about,

98
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:19,710
there's no facebook competitor.
No,

99
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,890
no,
no.

100
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,950
I mean,
facebook seems to me to be more 

101
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,590
indulgent medium though it seems like,
like I've read some,

102
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,850
like sometimes I'll see people's 
facebook posts and I just see the first 

103
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,550
paragraph and then we'll see how long 
ago was.

104
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm like fuck,
reading that.

105
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,420
Just keep moving.
It's just too much.

106
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,890
It's so,
yeah,

107
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:42,891
it's like I find my girlfriend just 
deactivated her facebook account and I 

108
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:46,861
was like,
I don't find so much utility in it 

109
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:46,861
anymore.

110
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:47,470
Especially after the election.
I'm like,

111
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,080
everyone hates each other on here and 
it's not fun.

112
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,670
I already have twitter for that,
you know,

113
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,700
but like you're saying on twitter you 
can't go on and on and on and on about 

114
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:56,830
how much you hate Donald Trump or 
Hillary Clinton.

115
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,831
So there's like no way to retreat.
I find that I don't even use facebook 

116
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:05,761
that much anymore.
I use it because my instagram posts 

117
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:07,720
directly to twitter and to facebook.
That's how I use it.

118
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,160
And.
But it's interesting that it shows that 

119
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,570
and the amount of people that engage 
like my facebook as a fraction of what 

120
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,840
everything else has and I think it's 
because I don't use it.

121
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,730
Yeah,
I think.

122
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,600
I think algorithmically the more you use
it,

123
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,910
probably the more massages you to the 
top of,

124
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,990
of a person's feet or whatever.
Because that's what's annoying about 

125
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:26,990
facebook is you can't put anything in 
order.

126
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,340
We have no idea what you've seen 
already.

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
I was just talking to someone the other 
day.

128
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,610
I only have 700 friends on there or 
whatever.

129
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,640
A lot of people from college that I 
might've had a class with or something 

130
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:35,890
and I'm like,
why did the same 15 people to show up on

131
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,210
that?
I don't even interact with these people,

132
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:42,211
so I feel like I'm missing a ton of 
stuff and I still find twitter is the 

133
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,450
most useful for me.
People love facebook though for arguing.

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,920
They fucking love it,
man.

135
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:49,921
I,
I've gone over some political arguments 

136
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:49,921
that people have on facebook and it's 
like,

137
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,680
Jesus,
how do you have the time for this?

138
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,020
Do people have other things that you 
enjoy?

139
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,150
Yeah,
know there's something about that sort 

140
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,880
of tit for tat verbal exchange,
like trying to one up someone and trying

141
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,220
to make a better point and it's.

142
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,950
I feel like it's replaced sport for 
people,

143
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,380
you know,
for some folks I feel like it's a game 

144
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,651
and sort of what in some sort of a way,
like a text based video game or saying 

145
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:17,980
yeah,
like an old text adventure or something 

146
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:17,980
like that.
Yeah,

147
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:17,980
I,
I.

148
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,580
What I find in the.
One interesting thing about the 

149
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,351
interesting thing about facebook that I 
think is worth noting is that it's 

150
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:23,290
typically real people with real names 
and real picture,

151
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,800
so at least they're putting themselves 
out there as opposed to twitter.

152
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,660
The kind of the anonymous nature of 
that.

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
So I respect that for the most part on 
facebook.

154
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:31,990
But again,
I agree with you,

155
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,310
it's like no one's winning this 
argument.

156
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,311
It's just the repetitive.
How many times am I going to see the 

157
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:40,261
same thing over and over again?
I've kind of just withdrawn from that 

158
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:40,261
entirely because.
Yeah,

159
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:44,520
well you know,
I'm wanting to talk to you about 

160
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,141
Internet controversy because when we had
you on the first time it was Kinda just 

161
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,730
after your whole thing and happen with 
this.

162
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,150
He had made this one like incredibly 
innocuous tweet.

163
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,200
It was a like a day without women or 
something like that.

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,800
Silence.
Like what was the tweet?

165
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,630
It was a our peace and quiet hashtag a 
day without a woman.

166
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,780
Yeah,
I mean which is like an Al Bundy joke 

167
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:07,780
maybe.

168
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,110
And but the thing is like if that 
happened today,

169
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,510
nobody would give a shit.
It's weird.

170
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,040
It's like then it was,
it was a boiling controversial,

171
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:20,330
like the first bubbles of just social 
media outrage.

172
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:22,220
It seems like you were one of the first 
bubble.

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,610
All right.
Like I explained to you originally,

174
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:29,611
I feel like it was partially a political
hit because of the industry I worked in 

175
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:32,851
and all of that kind of stuff.
But also like I was telling you before 

176
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,611
we started the more.
I've had time to think after all things 

177
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:35,611
things,
things happen.

178
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:36,250
I want you to a company.
I was working 70 hours a week.

179
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:39,760
I had no bandwidth to really think about
what the hell happened.

180
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
The more I think about it,
the angrier I actually got about about 

181
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,910
like how I had to go through that and 
watch other people also kind of go 

182
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,421
through similar things as the outrage 
machine just eats people and spits them 

183
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:52,040
out as they go along.
When you stop it,

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,020
I think about what you actually said and
that,

185
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,700
that what that actually cost like that 
actually caused you to stop working with

186
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:03,960
people like this one silly joke.
Like they don't know you.

187
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,020
They don't know.
You know that one joke that one thing 

188
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,931
that you said is so awful and outrageous
that all of our years of collaborating,

189
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,930
working together,
trying to do projects,

190
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,480
trying to be creative,
having fun,

191
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:23,481
all the conversations we've had about 
life and about humans and politics had 

192
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,080
men and women.
Those are all out the window.

193
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:28,440
Man.
You made a joke that I find marginally.

194
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:28,500
Yeah,

195
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,460
maybe uncertain day.
Marginally offensive.

196
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,190
It's if it was a woman,
if a woman said that like a day of peace

197
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:36,600
and quiet a day without men.

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Yeah,
that's what I would go out to keep them 

199
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,080
and move on with your life.
The idea that like,

200
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,150
oh,
I've got to get this lady fired.

201
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:49,151
She's a terrible person.
It was the only thing that I can think 

202
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:52,361
about is that I was at least in a 
position where it didn't destroy me or 

203
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:53,240
whatever.
Like I was.

204
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,990
I actually am doing,
you know,

205
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,460
financially better and feel happier and 
what I'm doing now.

206
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,520
So it didn't,
it kind of backfired or other people 

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,520
that we're trying to do whatever they 
were doing to me anyway,

208
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,780
but I feel for the people that find 
themselves in similar situations that 

209
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:07,780
don't have and I don't know,
like some,

210
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,100
some sort of Internet cloud or some sort
of community that can kind of rally 

211
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,740
around them and lift them up,
which is what my community did to me,

212
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,790
which I'm so appreciative of.

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,520
So I just think about how it's just sad.
Like I,

214
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,250
I don't know that I've ever been so 
offended by something.

215
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,980
Somebody tweeted or even said that I 
like went out of my way to,

216
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,410
to make it personal and try to destroy 
them.

217
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:29,411
I'm not saying people don't do terrible 
shit happens all the time where we're 

218
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,840
seeing that play out with Harvey 
Weinstein and all these kinds of things.

219
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Absolutely awful really awful things and
I feel like people are kind of like 

220
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,791
being distracted by the shiny object in 
the corner when they're losing sight of 

221
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,030
what's important.
Well today it feels like there's blood 

222
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,030
in the water,
you know?

223
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,460
I mean,
it just,

224
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:47,270
it seems like there's so many people 
going after so many people.

225
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,820
It's just people are running around 
looking for targets.

226
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,821
I the way I met,
imagine I'm imagining like the Internet 

227
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,550
and people on the Internet being like an
angry mob

228
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,280
running through the streets,
frothing at the mouth,

229
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,320
just looking for somewhere to point 
their gun.

230
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,090
I mean,
that's really what it feels like.

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,940
It feels like there's definitely some 
real targets out there.

232
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
Yeah,
there's definitely some.

233
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,380
This Kevin Spacey thing is,
is a scary thing.

234
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,590
I mean apparently Rosie O'donnell start 
tweeting that he had been doing this 

235
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,791
forever and that this is just the tip of
the iceberg and there's a bunch of boys 

236
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,920
that he went after.
I don't know what's true,

237
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:23,980
what's not true right now.
I'm a,

238
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm assuming,
but that's real.

239
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,170
That's a real horrible thing.
That's not a joke.

240
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,700
It's not someone with an innocuous maybe
off color joke.

241
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,170
I mean this is like real stuff.
So I think the good part is all of this 

242
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,470
awful behavior,
predatory evil,

243
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,800
you know,
all the Harvey Weinstein and whatever 

244
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:48,800
else is probably a million other ones.
Right.

245
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,140
That stuff's going to get exposed,
but it seems like the negative part 

246
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:57,120
about it is that people are looking for 
targets.

247
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,270
They're just,
you know.

248
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,770
Yeah.
And well that's what kind of scares me.

249
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:04,771
I was telling you,
I don't know if you're a black mirror 

250
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:04,771
fan,
but I was,

251
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:04,771
well I've only watched one episode,
but I love it.

252
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,860
I highly recommend you get two eps.
I love that show and it's,

253
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,870
it's what's going on now.
Reminds me a little bit of like a Black 

254
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,620
Mirror episode where like,
it's like people are,

255
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:15,850
like you said,
are targeting others,

256
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:20,851
but I feel and I feel like accusations 
are part of the process are part of due 

257
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:25,471
process really starts with the 
accusation and I feel like people 

258
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:25,471
aren't,
you know,

259
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,410
and I'm,
I'm not defending anything that anyone's

260
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:31,411
done,
but I feel like everyone just assumes 

261
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,211
guilt no matter what and it scares me 
because now we're getting to the point 

262
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,691
where anyone can accuse someone of 
anything at all and they're 

263
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,180
automatically guilty and they're 
automatically shame that I'm like,

264
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,070
but aren't you curious what's true?

265
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,780
Maybe half or 75 percent of this is 
true,

266
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:45,781
but certainly not all of this is true.
Certainly not all of these accusations 

267
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,781
are true at.
The one thing that I was interested in 

268
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,731
is um,
Mark Halperin who the political writer 

269
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:50,980
who was accused of things last week.
He didn't hear this one.

270
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,980
There's so many to keep up with.
Yeah,

271
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,260
no,
it's,

272
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,290
it's happening a lot.
Mark Halperin is a famous political 

273
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,081
writer.
He wrote a game change and double down 

274
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,450
those famous books.
About 2008 and 2012 with John Heilemann 

275
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,841
who was his partner.
He was on Msnbc and all this stuff and 

276
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,010
he was accused of some sexual harassment
when he was at ABC News in the early two

277
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:12,100
thousands.
And he came out and was basically like,

278
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,750
I'm sorry for my behavior and all that 
kind of stuff.

279
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:16,490
And what I thought was interesting about
it was that he was like,

280
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,520
not all of these accusations are true,
but he kind of just then went on and 

281
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,880
apologize and did all this and I'm like,
but I'm interested in,

282
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,890
in like,
what are you going to contest any of 

283
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:27,890
this?

284
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:27,890
Like what is true and what isn't true?
Why aren't we interested in what is true

285
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,500
and what isn't true?
Clearly you are a scumbag in some way,

286
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,500
but I'm also curious in,
are you going to defend yourself?

287
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,870
Are we in a situation where no one can 
defend themselves from these,

288
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,930
from these terrible accusations?
And it reminds me of a black mirror a 

289
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,330
lot and that's a worthy accusations.
He was a basically accused of um,

290
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,880
heavily hitting on women like that were 
junior than him.

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,590
Some when we're working with.
Yeah,

292
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,400
exactly.
Somewhere,

293
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,350
somewhere like,
I don't think any of them accused him of

294
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,470
sexual assault or anything like that,
but apparently he might've rubbed up 

295
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,620
against some women or did some,
some things that are sexual assault.

296
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,660
Yeah,
presume I assume so,

297
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:03,661
but I guess what I'm saying is like on 
somebody that's essentially sexual 

298
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:06,901
assault,
I mean more like I don't think they're 

299
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:06,901
accusing him of raping them or 
something,

300
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,140
like something like something was 
absolutely horrifying.

301
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,040
Horrific,
you know.

302
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,270
Um,
and I'm like,

303
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:10,930
well,
clearly,

304
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,100
you know,
I liked him a lot and I'm like,

305
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:12,790
well I can't,
I don't,

306
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,880
you know,
you're clearly not a good person.

307
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,420
But I was also just interested in that,
in that,

308
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,190
that dynamic of his statement where I 
was like,

309
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,510
well,
what isn't true?

310
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm curious what isn't true,
why,

311
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,940
you know,
it almost suggests that everything is 

312
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,051
true,
but then you just never know any 

313
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:31,051
situation.
So I just kind of reserve judgment until

314
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,170
more information is known about all of 
these people.

315
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:37,171
And I'm not,
I don't want to jump in on it because I 

316
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:37,171
don't know,

317
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:37,171
even want to know,
I mean,

318
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:39,880
unless it's people that are in my world,
I mean at a certain point in time,

319
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,490
look,
I mean I want to know about Kevin Spacey

320
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,370
type situations or Harvey Weinstein type
situations,

321
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:50,371
but I think there's a lot of men that 
are in that position where they're are a

322
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,760
boss or they are,
you know,

323
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,120
the owner of a company and they have 
these people under them and these people

324
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,290
behave in a certain way.
Like almost like as if they are royalty,

325
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,870
you know.
And I think that's what Harvey Weinstein

326
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:09,871
experienced.
I mean essentially he was like the 

327
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:10,750
royalty of is this enormous movie 
empire.

328
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,220
Right?
And we find that particularly offensive,

329
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,240
this not just,
he's not just a creep trying to get 

330
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,621
laid.
He's a guy that was trying to hold that 

331
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:24,130
power over people and use it against 
them.

332
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,320
And then on top of that he was like 
physically forceful.

333
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,320
So you've got like your worst case 
scenarios and then you have guys that 

334
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,020
are just trying to get laid and you're 
like,

335
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,640
okay,
how do you,

336
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,050
what,
what,

337
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,470
what,
what we,

338
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,370
we demonizing aggressive 
heterosexuality,

339
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,180
like where does this go?
Where does this go into sexual assault?

340
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,390
Like rubbing up against someone 
physically touching them when they don't

341
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:51,391
want you to.
Well that's sexual assault but hitting 

342
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,140
on someone but that doesn't seem like 
sexual assault or anything.

343
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,730
It seems like someone just trying to get
laid,

344
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:59,731
like where does it?
But then when someone's the boss he 

345
00:13:59,731 --> 00:13:59,731
goes,
okay,

346
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:00,430
but then you're not supposed to do that 
when you're a boss.

347
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,000
I always knew I was very interested in 
the,

348
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:05,280
in the,
in the dynamic between what specifically

349
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:10,170
with Harvey Weinstein and his people 
under him for many decades about.

350
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,120
I always trying to put myself in this 
position of like,

351
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,660
how does this stay quiet for so long?
Even though there's a little rumblings,

352
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:20,661
like they talk about Seth Mcfarlane's 
joke at some award show Kevin Spacey to 

353
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,890
Family Guy,
family guy.

354
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:25,160
Like a little kid was running away from 
silos with locked and Kevin Spacey,

355
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,250
spacement.
It's amazing that this stuff is kind of 

356
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,680
like an open secret and so,
but still doesn't seep out or really.

357
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,750
And um,
it makes you think about the pie,

358
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,780
the power dynamics and how fearful 
people are in these positions because 

359
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:38,780
it's easy.
My initial instinct was like,

360
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,370
why didn't anyone say anything that was 
similar to the bill cosby thing?

361
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm like,
why didn't anyone say anything?

362
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,340
But then you realized people were saying
things.

363
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,930
They were,
they were being given hush money.

364
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,000
They were being shut up.
But these are really,

365
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,400
really bad people.
But I agree with you that it,

366
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,270
you know,
never been a um,

367
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,330
an aggressive flirt flirter as it were.
I've always been very passive with women

368
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,270
because I never really believed in 
myself that much and all that.

369
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,940
But I've known people that have been 
very flirtatious and,

370
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,270
and you know,
um,

371
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,310
and all of that,
I'm like,

372
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,980
I wonder what is the line there now?
And is it okay to,

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,180
to be flirtatious,
to call a woman beautiful at a bar or to

374
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:13,300
do something like that as opposed to,
you know,

375
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,940
kind of if a girl likes you,
that's the thing.

376
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,600
Like if you meet a girl at a bar and the
girl's like,

377
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,430
Colin is a really cool guy,
God,

378
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,550
I'm so into him and collins like,
you're really beautiful.

379
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,120
And she's like,
oh,

380
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,860
I gotta thank you.
And then next thing you know,

381
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,400
you guys are hanging out or you meet a 
girl at a bar,

382
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,780
she has nothing.

383
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,160
She doesn't want to have anything to do 
with you.

384
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,930
She's sober,
you're drinking,

385
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,880
your breath smells and you know,
like,

386
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,130
you're really beautiful and you're like,
oh gross,

387
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,840
get the fuck away from me.
You know,

388
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,100
it can be exactly the same attempt,
but the person is just not into you.

389
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,450
You become a creep.
Right?

390
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:48,210
Exactly.
So,

391
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,390
uh,
I,

392
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,390
I don't,
uh,

393
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,660
I don't look at the situation now in 
2017 with on college campuses and all 

394
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,560
these things as,
as desirable for anyone because who 

395
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:00,560
knows who the hell knows the rules of 
the landscape.

396
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,960
Now I think a lot of it just comes down 
to mutual respect and all of that,

397
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,680
you know?
Well,

398
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,850
you know what I think it is,
man.

399
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,020
I really think we're shifting a like 
culturally,

400
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,380
I think this is a big gigantic shift,
almost like an earthquake of 

401
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,971
consciousness.
I think that over the course of human 

402
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:22,391
history we have slowly but surely become
better to each other and like we were 

403
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:22,391
playing.

404
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,010
We had a photograph that we put up 
yesterday have an ad from 1911.

405
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
It was a gum add and it was a mixture of
instructing a man how to go about 

406
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,440
kissing a woman and a lot of it was 
like,

407
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,510
do not ask permission,
look in her eyes a gaze dreamily.

408
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:46,460
It was like really like weird to 
instructing how to grab her face,

409
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,620
how to like,
leaned down to kiss her.

410
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,300
It was very,
very bizarre.

411
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,590
I was like,
if you tried to put that ad out today,

412
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:57,340
he will be fucking skewered publicly.
Yeah.

413
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,470
So after you.
But there's the ad right there.

414
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,860
Do you know how to kiss a girl?
Then learn,

415
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,290
stand facing her to not tell her your 
intentions,

416
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,680
do not ask for permission to kiss her 
urine and shit.

417
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,960
We went up whenever,
the whole thing yesterday so I won't go 

418
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:13,960
over it again.

419
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,420
But that's funny.
It's the with the name of the game 

420
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,420
again,
common sense.

421
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,360
What is it?
Common Sense Gum company,

422
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,390
the common sense gum company from 1911 
and I think what's happening right now 

423
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,600
is this a like a really big shift and I 
think the beneficiaries of this big 

424
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,060
shift are going to be the next 
generation of kids that are growing up.

425
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,850
They're probably not going to have to 
deal with nearly as much shit.

426
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,170
I think,
and I'm absolutely not giving bill cosby

427
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:43,280
any sort of fucking excuse at all,
but I think that in bill cosby's Day,

428
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,940
I think a lot of men did that.
I think it was really common.

429
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,070
I mean I don't think they thought 
anything of it just like

430
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,400
you ever watch like an old clint 
eastwood movie and they slap women.

431
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,160
They just used to beat the shit out of 
women in those movies.

432
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,790
Times have changed it and they're 
changing now like today at an 

433
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,130
unprecedented rate.
I think ultimately it's good.

434
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,530
Um,
I ultimately everyone,

435
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,270
when you,
you catch people at like a,

436
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,330
a good static state,
like a good calm state and you,

437
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:18,510
if they're not under duress and they're 
thinking clearly and to ask them like,

438
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,511
what,
what's the best way to get along with 

439
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:23,511
other people?
What's about,

440
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:23,790
won't treat them fairly.
Treat them kindly,

441
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,070
have good friends.
Just be nice,

442
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,810
be nice to everybody.
Everybody would agree with that.

443
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,700
But the problem is maybe they want 
something from you,

444
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,770
like column wants to fuck the girl at 
the bar,

445
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:35,270
but she's sober and collins got gross 
breath and he's,

446
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,700
you know,
like,

447
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:40,701
you know what I mean?
There's just all sorts of extenuating 

448
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:40,800
circumstances that make people behave.
I'm really fucked up ways.

449
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,470
But the consequences of those 
circumstances or that,

450
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,390
that behavior was,
was minimized by power.

451
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,920
Right?
It was minimized by,

452
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,230
you know,
like a guy like Harvey Weinstein.

453
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,390
They could put these gals on movies,
you know,

454
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,870
or a guy like Kevin Spacey was hitting 
on a 14 year old and has no one to say,

455
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
you know,
all that stuff that,

456
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,270
that,
that ability to squash it,

457
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,280
it minimized people,
you know,

458
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,420
it reminds me to,
not that I know deeply anything deep 

459
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,511
about it,
but I was just thinking about it in the 

460
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:14,831
shower this morning actually.
It reminds me a lot of Michael Jackson 

461
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,040
and the sense of like,
what,

462
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:20,041
what was going on in the early mid 
nineties with him in the accusations 

463
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,041
there.
And I'm like,

464
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,041
was this,
I don't know if that's true or false.

465
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,620
I don't know what he's accused 
overnight.

466
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,690
People kind of,
I think treat him as if he was innocent.

467
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,630
Maybe he is,
I don't know.

468
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,380
But it reminds me of like,
there was like telltale signs of some of

469
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:31,070
some sexual corruption and Hollywood and
the music industry,

470
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,690
the movie industry in all of that and 
some years ago,

471
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,900
um,
that's kind of bubbled back to the 

472
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:37,900
surface with some big names.
So I just,

473
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,021
I agree with you like it.
I just wish people just need to be good 

474
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:44,651
to talk to each other and like act 
normal and these guys and and be 

475
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,821
respectful and these things.
You don't find yourself in these 

476
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,681
terrible situations,
but then you see this desperation with 

477
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,901
Harvey Weinstein where you,
you learned that he might've sexually 

478
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,330
assaulted,
even raped the woman who then appears in

479
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,210
a movie some years later because he,
he,

480
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,520
the gravity well around him is so strong
that they have no choice.

481
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,740
So it's a very sad situation for those 
women as well.

482
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,570
Situation for humanity.
Right.

483
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,690
It's like there's just certain things 
that people were able to get away with.

484
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,650
You know,
like the cosby thing to me is probably 

485
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,920
number one.
That's the number one worst whenever,

486
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,160
because he represented this sort of like
really moral,

487
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,950
very ethical,
you know,

488
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,180
like doesn't,
doesn't swear on stage.

489
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Like he's the last one that you would 
expect to be what he's described been 

490
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
described as the number one serial 
rapist of all time and you're like,

491
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:36,090
wait,
wow.

492
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,670
Is that,
how is that possible?

493
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,130
It's

494
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,130
incredible.
It's just a crazy on an unfortunate and 

495
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,130
sad situation and ruined his whole 
legacy,

496
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,750
you know?
Um,

497
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,730
you know,
like who,

498
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,890
who could ever.
I seen the cosby show,

499
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,010
I don't

500
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,230
even know if it's syndicated anymore 
since all the accusations came up,

501
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,590
but who could watch that now and,
and,

502
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,460
and,
and just look past that.

503
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:58,461
Like I certainly don't,
especially because a lot of that is 

504
00:20:58,461 --> 00:20:58,461
contemporaneous to that show is still on
the air.

505
00:20:58,461 --> 00:20:58,461
Well,
I don't,

506
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:02,941
I,
I assume that they got their stuff 

507
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:02,941
pulled.
There's something capable.

508
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:03,040
What about Fat Albert?
That'd be weird.

509
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

510
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,640
Again,
again,

511
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,920
contemporaneous to a lot of his 
accusations going back to,

512
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,420
to um,
uh,

513
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,340
what was that original show that he did 
in the high spot?

514
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,010
Right?
Yeah.

515
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,100
That was the first one,
right?

516
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,930
Yeah.
So it's,

517
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:21,030
it's like,
I think a lot of that's like 50 years 

518
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,030
where the accusations like,
Holy Shit,

519
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,060
you know,
Hollywood was a different animal back 

520
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,060
then is a different animal when people 
didn't have a voice,

521
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,040
you know,
but do you,

522
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,950
because you have some,
you have,

523
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,460
you,
you're,

524
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,070
you were on TV and you do it.

525
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,650
You do hear rumblings like this,
I mean,

526
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm not asking you to be specific,
but do you hear.

527
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,000
Well I haven't been on TV in a long 
time,

528
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,940
but I did hear the cosby thing way back 
in the nineties.

529
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,160
I heard that when I was on the set of 
news radio,

530
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:44,320
I remember people talking about it,
but,

531
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:46,390
and I had heard the Kevin Spacey thing 
too,

532
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,740
but you know,
you don't,

533
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,860
you don't know.
You know,

534
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,120
it's not like,
well you should have gone to the press,

535
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,820
like with what information,
you know,

536
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:58,821
you know,
like someone accused Rosie O'donnell 

537
00:21:58,821 --> 00:21:59,410
because Rosie O'donnell was talking 
about Kevin Spacey.

538
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,790
She's like,
you're a Sicko.

539
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,080
You know,
everyone knew you were a Sicko.

540
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,970
And so someone said,
hold on a second.

541
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:07,720
So you're saying that you knew that he 
was like this and you didn't do anything

542
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,000
about it?
And she.

543
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,080
And she said,
well there was always rumors,

544
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:15,310
but no one had any evidence right now 
until this actor came forth.

545
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,490
Is he an actor or a director and is a 
broadway actor.

546
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,440
Which Broadway.
Yeah,

547
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,790
that's the whole thing is fucked.
He was in television show though.

548
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,910
He was a Broadway actor with Kevin 
Spacey in Nineteen.

549
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:31,240
Whatever the hell it was when,
when this happened 30 years ago.

550
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,430
What do you think about the whole 
misdirection thing in his statement too?

551
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,860
About being like crazy weird.
Sneaky.

552
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,270
Yeah.
Not Good.

553
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,140
Yeah.
I think very,

554
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:40,770
very transparent,
very transparent.

555
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,910
Deflecting.
Now I live my life as a gay man.

556
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:43,510
Hey,
fuck face.

557
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:45,820
Nobody asked you.
Did you try to rape a kid?

558
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,480
Yeah,
that's it.

559
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,710
That's it.
It was very weird.

560
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,050
I don't know why he decided to do that.
Well,

561
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,570
I think he's probably panicking,
you know,

562
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,920
I mean and ultimately he probably should
be.

563
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,740
Yeah,
I,

564
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:02,741
I would assume so.
Especially because maybe there are more 

565
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,801
accusations and then the whole weird 
thing with Netflix with house of cards 

566
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:04,801
where they were like,
this is going to be the last season now.

567
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,130
Apparently they stopped production so 
they stopped the completely.

568
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,050
So Jamie was saying,
oh,

569
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:10,460
interesting.
This morning I'll shut up,

570
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:11,240
pull it up.
Okay.

571
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:16,350
Yeah,
because I thought that was interesting 

572
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,521
specifically because they had apparently
heard already announced that it was the 

573
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:17,521
last season anyway.
Like in the summer,

574
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,850
so they're making it seem like they're 
reacting to it.

575
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:20,650
So everyone's just playing the PR game 
now,

576
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,090
you know,
I wonder.

577
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Yeah.
I don't know because they made an 

578
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,611
announcement pretty quickly.
Maybe they made it an announcement 

579
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:29,611
sorta.
Just to let everybody know,

580
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,220
you know?
Yeah.

581
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,030
That is the last season,
but okay.

582
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,810
Here it goes.
Production on Netflix,

583
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:38,770
special series suspended indefinitely 
following Kevin Spacey.

584
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:42,450
Allegations.
Is it allegation or s?

585
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,660
S is this poor girl?
Yeah,

586
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,680
there.
Is there a second or third allegation 

587
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,301
that I might've missed it?
I'm sure he has a Gore vidal movie that 

588
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,510
they're filming as well,
which will be interesting.

589
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,530
It's an interesting guy.
Corporate.

590
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

591
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:00,881
Oh Man.
Did you know what's a great fucking 

592
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:00,881
film?
I'm Gore Vidal.

593
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:03,410
And um,
who's the super conservative guy?

594
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:08,070
William F Buckley at a series of debates
in 1960,

595
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,330
I want to say 68.
And they televise them and it,

596
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,730
it was like a huge boom to whatever 
network it was.

597
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,840
ABC,
I believe it was.

598
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,380
And um,
they made a documentary about these two 

599
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,660
going back and forth with each other.
It's brilliant.

600
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,140
It's amazing and it's so interesting to 
see their minds.

601
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,650
I'm interacting with each other.
Wasn't that the debate series where 

602
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,290
William f Buckley said something super 
homophobic?

603
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

604
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,080
Called him,
called him.

605
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,520
She called him a Faggot,
like yeah.

606
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,680
Unlike network television,
and he said he would.

607
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,670
He would knock him out.
He'd said something like,

608
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,590
you'll stay plastered or something like 
that.

609
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:47,520
I forget his,
his,

610
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,960
his,
his statement,

611
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:53,961
but Gore Vidal said something to William
f Buckley that like really pushed his 

612
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:59,430
button on her.
I don't remember what he said to him 

613
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,430
because I remember watching and being 
like,

614
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:04,071
oh my God was dead,
but it was devastating to William f 

615
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,890
Buckley.
It was pretty much the end of his being 

616
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:06,890
taken seriously because people realized,
well,

617
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,211
he's kind of a fool and his ego and his 
mind is just not within his control and 

618
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:16,201
it just got out of hand and Gore Vidal 
just sort of sat there while you said 

619
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:16,310
it,
right?

620
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,430
Yeah.
Corbin Allison.

621
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:18,580
Interesting.
My exposure to him,

622
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:23,581
and initially it was like he wrote,
I think some historical fiction about 

623
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:24,510
some various things that now listen,
you queer,

624
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:29,511
stop calling me a Crypton Nazi or I'll 
socking your goddamn face and you'll 

625
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,460
stay plastered.
Whoa.

626
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,660
That's like incredible to listen to you 
queer.

627
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,570
Stop calling me a crypto Nazi.
Whoa.

628
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,210
I'm concerned.
The only pro or crypto Nazi I can think 

629
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,541
of is yourself.
So people were calling each other Nazis 

630
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:48,470
even way back after,
you know,

631
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,680
right after World War Two.
Yeah.

632
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,910
It's a weird one,
right?

633
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,400
It's like,
the problem is like when we,

634
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,670
what we saw in Charlottesville is like,
hey look guys,

635
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,700
there's real Nazis.
Like don't call someone a Nazi because 

636
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,420
they voted for trump because they think 
that uh,

637
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:04,620
you know,
a right wing,

638
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:07,200
conservative values are being diminished
in this country.

639
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,590
Don't call him a Nazi for that.
It just bothers me.

640
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,430
The same thing with the word fascist 
where I'm like,

641
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:12,930
you don't even really understand what 
these words mean.

642
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:13,710
A lot of you like,
I don't.

643
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,250
These words aren't only loaded.
They have definitions and I don't know 

644
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,911
what it's like when everyone says we 
live in a fascist state in America 

645
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:22,911
today,
and I'm like,

646
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:24,080
I don't think so.
The courts seem to be working fine.

647
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,920
The congress doesn't do anything but 
it's there.

648
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:31,290
I lived in a fascist state.
Then there wouldn't be an investigation 

649
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,290
against trump.
Right,

650
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,560
exactly.
I'm leading to indictment.

651
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,590
Exactly in which he actually has the 
power to fire the person doing the 

652
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:36,590
investigation.
So it's,

653
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:36,590
it's,
you know,

654
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,550
I'm not saying we're in an ideal 
situation right now,

655
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:43,551
but people throwing around these words 
very loosely need to learn a little bit 

656
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,130
more about why more Republican that 
Nazis coming

657
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,290
to power and 33 and what that actually 
looks like,

658
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,730
what fascism actually looks like in 
Italy,

659
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:52,731
what it looks like in Germany and they 
have no idea or a lot of some people do 

660
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:52,731
but most don't.
And they're.

661
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,270
And they're just throwing these words 
around and they mean something.

662
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,240
Well,
there's a lot of it

663
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:00,310
confusion today in terms of like why 
free speech is important and one of the 

664
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,021
reasons why free speech is important is 
because you don't get to decide what is 

665
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:05,690
correct.
It has to be debated,

666
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,820
you know?
Um,

667
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,430
there was a,
I forget who,

668
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:10,000
it's,
who,

669
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,930
who said that?
It was really recent.

670
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,050
We talked about it yesterday.
Oh,

671
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,140
it was that guy that the Yale professor 
that was on Sam Harris show hit a 

672
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,340
perfect statement about the guy who got 
in trouble for his wife with the,

673
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,840
the Greek fellow.
His wife had defended offensive 

674
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,720
Halloween costumes and the kids went 
crazy and arrested him.

675
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:33,020
Right public.
He said the answer to,

676
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,530
to hate speech is not no speech,
it's better speech.

677
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,500
And that's such a great statement.
That's absolutely true.

678
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,590
It's absolutely true.
So like all these kids that are trying 

679
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,360
to shut down conservative speakers on 
campus and then by shutting down they're

680
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:52,361
calling them white supremacist Nazis and
using these things for guys like Ben 

681
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:54,270
Shapiro,
which I think is patently ridiculous.

682
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,560
The,
the,

683
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,310
the Jewish,
the Jewish Nazi,

684
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,660
and a white supremacist as well,
which is just like,

685
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,510
because he quotes statistics about 
minority crime,

686
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,900
you know,
those statistics I feel like are pretty 

687
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,791
misleading in some ways because there's 
a lot of factors that lead to these 

688
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,211
people being in these situations where 
there's high crime rates and these 

689
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:16,211
communities and it has nothing to do 
with,

690
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,120
you know,
hey,

691
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:19,160
you need to pull yourself up by your 
bootstraps,

692
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,950
which is like a really common way of 
looking at it,

693
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:26,060
right on us to do with the world that 
they were born into.

694
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,500
Socioeconomically.
It's a different,

695
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,610
different world.
Yeah.

696
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:31,220
And they're surrounded by the momentum 
of crime.

697
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,280
They're surrounded by the momentum of 
violence and abuse and to just expect 

698
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:42,011
them to escape that because there are 
examples of people that have done it in 

699
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,160
the past.
You can't apply that,

700
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,810
that sort of logic.
I don't think,

701
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,340
uh,
I think that's disingenuous.

702
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,320
But to call him a Nazi or a white 
supremacists,

703
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,570
I think it was fucking ridiculous.

704
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,210
Well,
that's just such,

705
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,250
it's just such a,
it's just used pejoratively without 

706
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,250
historical context.
I,

707
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,250
I,
it's,

708
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,760
it's exactly what it is because it 
reminds me a little bit,

709
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:02,761
it's different in the context,
but it reminds me a little bit of when 

710
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:02,761
Bernie Sanders was running in the 
primary and people will be like,

711
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,900
this is,
look at what socialism has given you,

712
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
look at the roads and,
and unlike the roads are not,

713
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,420
roads aren't socialists,
the military is not socialist,

714
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,640
streetlights aren't socialists.
The government spending money is not 

715
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,871
what socialism means.
So that's what you think the definition 

716
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:18,871
means.
Then you're wrong.

717
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:19,840
And the same thing with now Nazis and 
fascism,

718
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,050
like look at all the parallels between 
Nazi Germany and the United States.

719
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:23,980
And I'm like,
I couldn't.

720
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,130
I'm a student of history.
I'm not,

721
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,150
I don't know everything,
but I don't see literally one parallel 

722
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,150
between the United States right now and 
Nazi Germany.

723
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,790
Not even one.
So we're not coming off a war

724
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,870
last.
We're not,

725
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,810
you know,
a devastated and humiliated.

726
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,490
Yeah,
the stabbing them back.

727
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,620
Hyperinflation.
Uh,

728
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,210
this charismatic who's in prison for 
awhile

729
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,220
writes this manifesto,
tries to actually throw a coup in the 

730
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,220
mid twenties,
fails all,

731
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,530
like all these,
like,

732
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,370
oh,
I'll make what are the,

733
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,070
what parallel are you talking about 
that,

734
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:56,071
you know?
And so I just feel like people are 

735
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:56,071
playing fast and loose with these words 
that they mean something.

736
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:56,200
They,
these words mean something.

737
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,250
So we're going to call someone a 
fascist,

738
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,280
find the fascias and like you said,
there are Nazis in an American culture 

739
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,880
unfortunately,
but fortunately because of our freedom 

740
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:05,880
of expression,
they have the right to exist.

741
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,830
And I think that by lumping in anyone 
that voted for trump for instance,

742
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,570
as a Nazi,
you're just making them look bigger.

743
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,910
That actually just benefits them there.
There are irrelevant.

744
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,210
The KKK is a relevant 6,000
members maybe in a,

745
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,400
in a country of 300,
$25 million people.

746
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
How many people identify as Neo Nazi?

747
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,140
Really?
Maybe $10,000

748
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:23,260
or less,
you know,

749
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,300
but what are you thinking about?
Three hundred 50 million people.

750
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:28,110
It's a very small number.
It's infant infant infancy.

751
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,010
It's actually irrelevant,
completely irrelevant.

752
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,190
But if you're a black guy and they're 
all coming after you on your facebook 

753
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,550
page,
then it looks good.

754
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,430
It looks real.
And,

755
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,090
and,
and,

756
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:42,091
and,
and it is that kind of badgering and 

757
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:42,091
that kind of harassment is real and it's
terrible.

758
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:42,091
No,
no one justifies that.

759
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,270
But I am so sick of the history,
like the,

760
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,780
the,
like people have suddenly are our 

761
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,581
experts.
It reminds me of on Columbus Day I 

762
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,161
tweeted out and it got tweeted a bunch.
I though it was funny where people are 

763
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,921
tweeting about Columbus and all of a 
sudden sudden suddenly everyone's an 

764
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:55,921
expert now in the age of exploration 
today.

765
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,220
Now everyone knows everything about the 
age of exploration,

766
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:02,430
just like everyone knew everything about
the rise of Nazi-ism and the Weimer 

767
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:02,430
Republic.

768
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:02,480
And just like everyone knew about the,
you know,

769
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,760
socialism and all.
I'm like,

770
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,000
stop,
you know,

771
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,920
I posted this flag behind me,
uh,

772
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,200
and a company called iron mountain 
designs creates it.

773
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,010
And so veteran owned company and they 
make these pretty cool flags,

774
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,700
man.
Very cool.

775
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:23,701
Flags made out of metal.
But it has a George Washington quote on 

776
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:26,311
the back.
And I put it up on instagram with the 

777
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:26,311
photo of the flag photo,
the logo of the company,

778
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:27,850
like three different pictures on 
instagram in a row,

779
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,200
you know,
you do that.

780
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,230
We're one post can have three images and
one of them was a quote from George 

781
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,100
Washington and the number of fucking 
geniuses,

782
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:40,870
George Washington owned slaves.
Would you use an honest man on swerves?

783
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,010
And they just kept rattling on about the
horrors of George Washington as if.

784
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,960
Okay.
Yep,

785
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,230
he did.
Yeah,

786
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:48,850
there's a lot.

787
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,560
But this is a quote by a man who lived 
hundreds and hundreds of years ago,

788
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,260
and this is what he said,
you know,

789
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,270
you want to diminish his entire 
contribution to human culture because he

790
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:05,440
did something horrible back then when 
people were doing horrible things.

791
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,210
You're,
you're right.

792
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:12,270
He did own slaves.
But I think it's a part of a very long 

793
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,490
conversation about what a human being 
was.

794
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,020
You know,
back then.

795
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Yeah.
It goes back to the idea of historical 

796
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,911
relativism that like you can't,
you can judge them based on the 21st 

797
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,120
century model.
But George Washington died in 1799.

798
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,280
So this is a man that didn't even see 
the 19th century.

799
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,450
Nonetheless.
The 20th nonetheless.

800
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:30,451
The 21st has no idea what that was.
He was a southern plant there for the 

801
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,430
first five presidents of the United 
States where southern plant,

802
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:36,430
there's that owned slaves.
It's not a totally uncommon thing.

803
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:40,070
So I'm not justifying it there would 
absolutely among

804
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,070
the founders,
they were absolutely abolitionists 

805
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,070
during the revolution and and black 
people fought for the,

806
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,490
for the continental army.
But yeah,

807
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,530
people judging based on these things,
I'm like that's fine,

808
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,810
but if you want to take that to the to 
its natural conclusion,

809
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:54,410
you're going to find lots of problems 
with lots of people even closer to us in

810
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:57,230
history than than George Washington.
And what's funny about that is now there

811
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:02,231
really are going.
After I was reading it just 

812
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:02,231
tangentially,
I didn't see at all,

813
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:05,470
but people are starting to now go after 
George Washington plaques or George 

814
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,040
Washington statues and I feel kinda bad 
about that in the sense that I was all 

815
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,221
for removing the confederate statues and
putting them in places where they made 

816
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:12,221
sense.
So take the,

817
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:16,520
the Jefferson Davis statue,
put it in Gettysburg or whatever the 

818
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:16,520
case might be,
put in a museum.

819
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,050
I don't think they should be melted down
and destroyed,

820
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,350
but people were like,
the next logical step is they're going 

821
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,511
to go after the founders and I was like,
no way will any like no one's going to 

822
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:25,670
let that happen and I was wrong.
You know,

823
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,500
now they are going after him 
immediately.

824
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,870
So I feel a little bit guilty about that
in a sense that,

825
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,930
you know,
I don't think we should be celebrating 

826
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,091
confederate history,
but we should absolutely be celebrating 

827
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:37,091
American history.
Even even the complicated American.

828
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,230
It's not celebrating it,
it's recognizing it and understanding 

829
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,830
it.
I mean the confederate war,

830
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,240
the civil war rather did happen.
It's,

831
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:50,250
it's a real historical fact and it 
should be studied and if you don't study

832
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:55,251
it,
you don't get a comprehensive 

833
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:55,251
understanding of all the pieces that 
were in place when it did happen.

834
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,400
And you know,
it's just as bad as the people that are 

835
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:00,400
saying,
you know,

836
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,460
civil war was about economics and.
No,

837
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,210
no,
it wasn't.

838
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,990
It was part of what it was about.
It wasn't just about economics,

839
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:08,750
it was also about keeping slaves.
That's a fact.

840
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,290
Yeah,
absolutely.

841
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,910
So like to diminish that,
it does,

842
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,110
like,
that's not good either,

843
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:17,111
but to,
to try to sweep it under the rug and 

844
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:17,510
smash all the statutes,
like know,

845
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,570
have that statue up so people can 
understand what the fuck that is.

846
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,360
And if someone is going to celebrate 
that statue,

847
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,740
you know,
south go and do it again,

848
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:27,170
we're going to rise again.
They can do that,

849
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:27,920
you know,
if that's,

850
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,600
if that's their thing,
they can do that.

851
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,580
I mean we can't stop them from thinking 
stupid.

852
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,450
Yeah.
And I think that I agree with you in the

853
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,240
sense that it's,
it's worth it just,

854
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,700
it,
it happened or we remember it and it has

855
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,160
always the grandma,
the Grandpa who have always been part of

856
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,380
our culture since,
since the civil war ended in 18,

857
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:48,381
65,
and especially since the reconstruction 

858
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:48,381
ended in 18,
77.

859
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:48,381
We've had,
don't even know what you're saying.

860
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:51,840
The gray and blue uniforms of the,
of the different sides.

861
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,130
Um,
you know,

862
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:58,131
when reconstruction ended in 18,
77 in our occupation of the south ended 

863
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:01,820
and then Jim crow came,
became law and there was no 

864
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,790
institutional segregation.
This was something that was always a 

865
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,790
complicated point of celebration.
You know,

866
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,400
I've always been,
I've always been really kind of curious 

867
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,641
and really more militant about why these
people actually got away with what they 

868
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:15,060
did.
And I understand,

869
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,090
um,
you know,

870
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,980
the 10 percent plan,
which we,

871
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,170
do you know,
anything about that,

872
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:21,150
that the idea that Lincoln only made are
actually really,

873
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:24,090
Andrew Johnson only made 10 percent of 
people in the southern states.

874
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:25,410
Basically a pledge allegiance in order 
to,

875
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:27,870
for the states to come back in.
They didn't execute.

876
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:30,390
Anyone that you know or even really try 
them.

877
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,530
You know,
Jefferson Davis,

878
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,500
a stonewall Jackson didn't survive,
but Robert e Dot Lee and all these other

879
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:39,501
guys just got away with it and actually 
lived pretty prosperous lives 

880
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:39,501
afterwards.
So there's always been this really

881
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:43,100
complicated mix of,
of remembrance that these people down 

882
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,100
there were heroes and we don't have to 
support that.

883
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,961
I certainly don't support that,
but it goes way further back than our 

884
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:50,961
contemporary culture and we can't just 
smash it into oblivion and think that 

885
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:54,141
you're going to remove that.
The heritage of the stars and bars and 

886
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:54,141
all of that from,
from what happened.

887
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:58,460
I think that the problem is people think
that you're celebrating the confederate 

888
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,970
army when you have a statue up and in 
some ways you kind of.

889
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It seems like you are right because the 
statutes 15 feet tall and he's got a 

890
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,470
sword in his hand and he's on a horse 
and he's marching forward and you know,

891
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,520
people look at it as if it's celebrating
something that's a horrible part of 

892
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,360
human culture.
It is.

893
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,050
I mean,
I remember going to Richmond,

894
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:17,370
Virginia for the first time.

895
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:17,910
I,
my fam.

896
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:20,670
A lot of my family lives down there now 
and they have this thing called monument

897
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:25,671
row or whatever where it's just a.
it's like Jefferson Davis and Robert e 

898
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:25,920
Dot Lee,
and then they actually put Arthur ash at

899
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,720
the end to make it seem like it's not 
racist anymore.

900
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Which I always thought was weird.
They did that in like the seventies or 

901
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,560
eighties.
Yeah,

902
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,530
exactly.
So there's just like a black guy at the 

903
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:36,530
end of it's like we were,
this isn't racist at all.

904
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,590
Um,
and it's a bonus that he died of aids.

905
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,890
So everyone,
so everyone.

906
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,690
Yeah.
So we have a lot of diversity,

907
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,590
HIV,
HIV culture and all that.

908
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,210
But um,
you know,

909
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,100
I remember being really confused when I 
was a kid being like,

910
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,530
why are these statutes here?
This doesn't make any sense.

911
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:54,531
And I agree that they shouldn't be in 
those places of reverence because 

912
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:56,310
they're beyond the slavery issue.

913
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,500
And I agree with you.
Slavery was the reason the confederacy 

914
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,160
was founded.
It does go back to state's rights and it

915
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:05,370
has inherent economic benefits,
but it is,

916
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:06,330
you know,
Stephen Douglas,

917
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,120
who was the vice president of the 
confederacy,

918
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,200
literally said that they were founded 
because of this,

919
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:15,201
so you can take his word for it,
but I was always confused why we were 

920
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:15,201
celebrating,
um,

921
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,490
these people and why not?
Why not have these pieces of art because

922
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,410
they are pieces of art,
but have them in places that make sense.

923
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,000
That give context,
um,

924
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,130
so I have no problem with that,
but I,

925
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:28,131
I,
I was so tragically wrong about the 

926
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,831
slippery slope that we were finding 
ourselves on because I thought people 

927
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:30,831
would see more of that.
Like,

928
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,360
yes,
Thomas Jefferson was a complicated man 

929
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,360
but also immensely important person to 
our,

930
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,900
our,
you know,

931
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,170
our society,
but people aren't seeing it that way and

932
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:42,171
I will,
I will fight more vociferously to 

933
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:42,171
protect those guys.

934
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:43,470
Then I did the confederate confederate 
officers for sure.

935
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,510
Even though those guys did own slaves 
too,

936
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,180
right?
I mean,

937
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,290
it is all weird when you're talking 
about slave ownership.

938
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,060
You know,
I did this thing this morning,

939
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,700
my kids school,
they have this great pumpkin day and all

940
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:56,790
the kids are onstage and they're,
they have this little plate.

941
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,880
They act out in one of the things that 
we're talking about,

942
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,780
the smell of Apple Bacon and mmm.
And everybody's like,

943
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,060
oh,
the smell of applewood bacon.

944
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,370
And all I could think of,
because yesterday we were talking about 

945
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,161
factory farming and about Glenn 
Greenwald article where I'm this FBI 

946
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,460
investigation to these two people that 
stole these pigs from this factory farm 

947
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,160
revealed this federal coverup of these 
horrific conditions in factory farms.

948
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:31,611
And I was thinking of like one day we're
going to look at like factory farming 

949
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,380
and the horrific nature of what they do 
to these animals,

950
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,370
especially pigs.

951
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,840
These really intelligent animals stuffed
into these boxes and make them live in 

952
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,481
their own shit.
And there's little corpses of piglets 

953
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:48,181
around them really for the article.
And the photos were really hard to look 

954
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:51,391
at.
And I was thinking while I was watching 

955
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:51,391
this little little kids play today,
I was like,

956
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:55,981
one day we're going to look back at this
mention of Bacon and we're going to 

957
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:01,801
think like how fucked up where people 
that they thought it was okay to shove 

958
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:06,061
these little animals into these crates 
and make them live in their own shit 

959
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:11,101
just so you can get bacon off.
But we've just sort of accepted that 

960
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,600
it's a part of our culture and that it's
not a valid comparison to slavery,

961
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,960
but it's also,
it's not an ideal way for a conscious 

962
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,490
and evolving species like the human race
to behave.

963
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:24,010
It's not a good way for us to 
rationalize.

964
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,500
And I was looking at that today and I 
was thinking,

965
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,770
how many more of these things mean?
I think we're seeing that with things 

966
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:38,410
like the Harvey Weinstein allegations 
and this outrageous coming forth.

967
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,710
I think we're seeing a lot of the 
aspects of our society that's getting 

968
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,280
exposed in a way that it never got 
exposed before.

969
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,300
But I think we're also seeing it in my 
mind,

970
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:51,490
we were seeing it with this talk of 
Bacon.

971
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,720
I was like,
you know,

972
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,130
look,
Bacon is delicious.

973
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,610
Absolutely.
But where the fuck's that bacon coming 

974
00:39:59,610 --> 00:39:59,610
from,
you know,

975
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,570
how you making sure you're getting free 
range bacon from,

976
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,440
you know,
very,

977
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,070
uh,
moral and ethical farming practice.

978
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,790
This is,
are you just getting bacon?

979
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Yeah.
It's actually a very thought provoking 

980
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,681
what you're saying,
because I've always found the factory 

981
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,691
farming.
I'm not that I'm an expert in that at 

982
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:15,691
all.
I'm not,

983
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:16,690
but the argument to be really 
interesting because it's like there's an

984
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,720
opportunity cost.
The way we treat these animals means 

985
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:21,720
food is very cheap,
way cheaper.

986
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,041
Meat is incredibly cheap in the United 
States compared to almost anywhere else 

987
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:26,041
in the world.
Um,

988
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:30,120
and produces too because of that,
people use to spend a third of their 

989
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,570
income before World War Two on food and 
now they spend less than a 10th of their

990
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:33,370
money on food.
So there's some amazing.

991
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,920
So there's an interesting.
So we've made food way cheaper,

992
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,560
but you're right,
because you could make the same argument

993
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,160
for slavery in the sense that like,
well look at all the economic benefits 

994
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,160
of it,
you know,

995
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,451
it kind of turned a blind eye to it.
So you actually kind of like not just 

996
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:52,440
kind of changed my mind on a little bit 
because I've always been of the mind 

997
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:52,440
where like free range eggs,
free range animals.

998
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,121
That's great if you can afford that,
but I don't begrudge the poor or middle 

999
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,810
class or working class family from going
and buying their ground beef from vons.

1000
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,740
Yeah,
well if you're poor,

1001
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:02,260
you got to get by right now.
There's that right.

1002
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:02,700
And you're

1003
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,620
system that you didn't design,
you didn't create.

1004
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,650
You're just,
you're in there and you're just trying 

1005
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:10,650
to get by.
I understand that,

1006
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,170
but what I'm just saying that like as a 
whole,

1007
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,350
as a culture to just openly accept 
factory farming and to not think of it 

1008
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:21,010
as a horrific ethical and moral 
injustice.

1009
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,730
I mean it really is.
You know,

1010
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,490
mrs coming from someone who eats meat,
right?

1011
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,850
So obviously you could see the Vegan 
argument would be,

1012
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,880
well you're complicit in it and you are 
also complicit in a bunch of other 

1013
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,211
horrific crimes against animals.
I think that what we're looking at 

1014
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:39,440
though is an under,
on wakening and sort of an understanding

1015
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,740
of our impact,
like physically our impact on this end,

1016
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,200
but mentally the way we think about 
things,

1017
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:50,201
the way we even think about ourselves.
If you know that your bacon is coming 

1018
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:54,941
from an animal that was tortured and 
shoved into a cage and you buy it 

1019
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:55,010
anyway,
like,

1020
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,480
whew.

1021
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,590
You know,
how,

1022
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,140
what does that do to your mind?
Yeah,

1023
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,900
it's interesting.
It's,

1024
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,000
it's sort of a,
it's a conundrum.

1025
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,290
You know,
like what you,

1026
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,390
you obviously hunting stuff like that.
But when you buy meat,

1027
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,000
do you go out of your way to make sure 
that it's a by almost.

1028
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:08,420
No.
Me.

1029
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:13,421
So you.
So you all that you eat is typically so 

1030
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:13,970
now it's taken a few years to do it,
but now,

1031
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:16,880
I mean I shot to elk this year.
An elk is,

1032
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,710
you know,
they're close to a thousand pounds so 

1033
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,611
you're just seeing so many of hundreds 
of pounds of meat and I have to 

1034
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:25,190
commercial freezers here.
I have to have my garage at home.

1035
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,930
I give it out to my friends.
I eat elk four nights a week,

1036
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,150
you know,
and when I go out to dinner though,

1037
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
I do eat steak,
you know,

1038
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,120
if I go out to dinner at some 
restaurant,

1039
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,090
I don't ask where it came from right 
now.

1040
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,900
So in that way,
I'm a hypocrite.

1041
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,310
Oh,
not necessarily.

1042
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:40,700
I mean,
I think,

1043
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:42,710
I think,
I think striving is important,

1044
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:44,200
right?
You can't always be perfect but,

1045
00:42:44,201 --> 00:42:49,201
but being better,
I think if everyone was better as 

1046
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:49,201
opposed to being perfect than the 
situation would be better.

1047
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:54,140
So this,
the reality of there's an economic 

1048
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,140
reality.
Um,

1049
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,230
I can take the time off,
I can take two weeks off out of the year

1050
00:42:57,231 --> 00:43:00,040
because I went to on to Elkanns,
um,

1051
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,620
I've been on for hunt's this year in 
three of them I was successful and one 

1052
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,140
of them I got an access deer which was 
also like 100 pounds of meat.

1053
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,770
And so that's most of what I eat,
but most people don't have time to take 

1054
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:20,771
three weeks off a year and then you also
have to have the time to practice and 

1055
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,810
you have to know people like a lot of 
fortune,

1056
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:26,120
good fortune on my side to be able to do
something like this.

1057
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,120
But it's also a concerted effort and 
becoming obsessed with the idea behind 

1058
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,030
it of doing that,
you know?

1059
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,760
Yeah.
It becomes a different thing.

1060
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,920
It who comes into like food is just a 
different thing.

1061
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,640
I mean,
if you grow tomatoes in your garden,

1062
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:41,240
that food becomes a different thing.
It's like almost spiritual in a way.

1063
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,360
You're like a connection to it.
It's an overused word,

1064
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:46,970
spiritual kind of a word that's sort of 
been hijacked.

1065
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:47,990
Sure.
But yeah,

1066
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,220
like,
yeah,

1067
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,410
like there's a little,
there's a lot of words that have been 

1068
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:54,960
hijacked.
The word spirituality is really hijacked

1069
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,410
by morons,
you know,

1070
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,370
as someone says,
I'm really spiritual eyes.

1071
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,110
I see.
Unfortunately,

1072
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:03,350
tattoos and wouldn't beads and nutty 
talk,

1073
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:05,450
you know,
Reiki healers.

1074
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,130
It was at the Golem Reiki,
I don't know.

1075
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:07,930
Yeah.
You know,

1076
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,940
those people that think they can heal 
you by rubbing their hands above your 

1077
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,840
skin.
Is that Reiki?

1078
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,020
Is that what they call it?
Yeah.

1079
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,630
But yeah,
there's,

1080
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,400
there's,
there's a,

1081
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,220
um,
a completion of the cycle in,

1082
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,020
in,
in,

1083
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,300
in lieu of a better word.
There's a,

1084
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,310
like I grow food in my backyard and I 
grow plants and vegetables.

1085
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,100
I when I

1086
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,100
eat them,
it just feels like some sort of a 

1087
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,100
completion,
like it feels good,

1088
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,680
whereas it just feels like a good salad 
if I get it at a store.

1089
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,990
Right.
Well,

1090
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,320
it's a year.
It's interesting.

1091
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:46,470
You're almost subsistence living in a 
way because you're hunting your own meat

1092
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:48,360
and yeah,
you're growing some of your own produce.

1093
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,650
It's pretty cool.
Yeah,

1094
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,940
but I,
I wonder.

1095
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,420
I'm just need the.
I need the grid for electricity.

1096
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,080
Right.
You know what I mean?

1097
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:57,090
Someone's gotTa build the bows and the 
arrows.

1098
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:01,500
I buy from a manufacturer the yet you're
very strict tolerances.

1099
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,300
It's sort of subsistence,
but it's.

1100
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:08,330
There's all these companies that are 
involved behind creating the materials 

1101
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,350
that are used to.
So it's,

1102
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:12,750
it's like capitalism is a slash sepsis a
subsistence,

1103
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,550
but it's.
It's interesting because it's,

1104
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,140
it's,
it's the point I made earlier.

1105
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:20,670
You're further along in the path of 
sustainability or further along the path

1106
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:25,671
of some sort of righteousness and the 
way animals are treated and all that 

1107
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:25,671
kind of stuff than a lot of people are.

1108
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:26,820
So it's a step in the right direction.
Right.

1109
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:29,850
I just wonder if people,
just to play devil's advocate again,

1110
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,390
the working class family that at the 
median household income of $40,000

1111
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,950
a year,
if they,

1112
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,860
if we got rid of some of these animal 
practices which are important,

1113
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,330
but if we got rid of them,
you know,

1114
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:41,880
are they willing to pay 13 or $14 a 
pound for their beef?

1115
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,610
They probably couldn't afford it.
And that's a real problem.

1116
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,670
I mean,
it's absolutely a real problem and I 

1117
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:49,670
think that,
um,

1118
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,420
there's a lot of people that don't do,
they don't even take it into 

1119
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:53,420
consideration.
I mean,

1120
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:53,610
that's,
that's,

1121
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,650
that's probably the biggest problem that
we've,

1122
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,100
we've made this system and everybody who
was born into this system,

1123
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,960
you know,
obviously we didn't create it,

1124
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,290
but we're,
we're born into a system and it took us 

1125
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,451
until we were probably like,
I didn't even know what a factory farm 

1126
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:08,451
was until I was 30.

1127
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:11,660
I'd never even heard of it.
And then you hear about factory farming,

1128
00:46:11,661 --> 00:46:11,930
you go,
wait,

1129
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:13,620
what does that.
I think all these animals,

1130
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:14,970
they all stuffed together and you're 
like,

1131
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,620
what?
I thought the farms were like,

1132
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,830
animals roamed around like I didn't,
I didn't know what.

1133
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,630
I never even thought about it.
Yeah,

1134
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:23,700
terrific.
I remember in the late nineties on TV,

1135
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:25,360
like on public access or on like I 
don't,

1136
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,380
I think it was just on public access.
You would see these guerrilla filming 

1137
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,741
sessions that these guys would go to 
these farms and like break in and take 

1138
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:37,221
all these pictures and it was like for 
some animal rights activist group or 

1139
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:37,221
whatever.
And I,

1140
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:37,350
I was always familiar with it.
I just never.

1141
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:42,351
I mean I'm guilty of saying like,
I never really thought about it too 

1142
00:46:42,351 --> 00:46:42,600
deeply beyond that sadly because I was 
just.

1143
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,770
I thought about the economic realities 
of it where I'm like,

1144
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,790
this is a terrible thing and we can fix 
it.

1145
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,230
Well,
we just have to have a conversation as a

1146
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:54,231
society of what that's gonna mean for 
food because the exact inverse has 

1147
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:58,641
happened with produce where we figured 
out ways to really dramatically alter 

1148
00:46:58,641 --> 00:46:58,950
seedlings.
And,

1149
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and you know,
I was just reading about Norman Borlaug 

1150
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,020
who won a Nobel peace prize for what he 
did to wheat,

1151
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,640
making wheat and we got,
sorry,

1152
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,460
golden week I think.
I think that's what it is.

1153
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:10,350
Yeah,
like where the protein and yeah,

1154
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:13,410
and like a higher yield but the stock 
wouldn't collapse and all that.

1155
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,650
And he's apparently responsible for,
you know,

1156
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:20,990
like there used to be these doomsday 
prophecies in the sixties and seventies 

1157
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,201
people.
People forget that earth kind of golden 

1158
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:24,201
rice.
I'm talking,

1159
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:24,201
I'm sorry.
Different things.

1160
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:24,201
Sorry.
It's okay.

1161
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:28,480
Uh,
there was this people look back at the 

1162
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,570
original Earth Day,
I think in 1970 when they often talk 

1163
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:31,270
about some of the,
the prognostications of what's happening

1164
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:36,271
to the earth and all of that today.
But a lot of people will lost sight of 

1165
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:39,031
the fact that a lot of what people were 
talking about then was that we were 

1166
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:39,160
going to die of famine.
That the earth,

1167
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,250
Earth's population was growing way too 
quickly and that they would have these 

1168
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:44,440
guesses by the late seventies,
early eighties and go read it.

1169
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:45,910
It's fascinating.
They would be like,

1170
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,940
by 1980 5 billion people are going to 
die of starvation because we can't feed 

1171
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,150
everyone and all these kinds of things.
That's what they were originally talking

1172
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:57,151
about.
So there's been these pioneering heroes 

1173
00:47:57,151 --> 00:47:57,940
and agriculture that have figured it out
that have had these high yield crops and

1174
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:02,941
all of that and we're fine with that 
because obviously crops flora are 

1175
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:02,941
different than Fonda.

1176
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:02,970
They don't,
you know,

1177
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,980
they don't feel they don't have,
they don't have some sort of connection 

1178
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:07,980
with them.
They don't have a brain.

1179
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,230
So I understand the differences or are 
there,

1180
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:13,231
but it's funny how these things have 
totally basically switched sides where 

1181
00:48:13,231 --> 00:48:14,200
now where you have these high yield 
produce,

1182
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,240
that's great.
We have these high yield ways of getting

1183
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,580
animal meat but,
but no good.

1184
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:20,230
And I,
I think that there are different things,

1185
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,800
but does it suggest that we have to be 
more Vegan or vegetarian?

1186
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:24,780
All those kinds of things.
I don't.

1187
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:29,781
I don't know if that's the answer.
I think we have to have a complicated 

1188
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,210
conversation and maybe it comes down to 
this idea of cloning meeting or whatever

1189
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:32,440
they're doing,
like making meat and you know,

1190
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:37,441
process these weird chemical processes 
to make beef that's indistinguishable 

1191
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:37,441
from real beef.
I mean,

1192
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:37,750
that's fine if that.

1193
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:42,750
If it tastes good,
I think that's probably what's going to 

1194
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,091
happen.
I think it's probably going to be like 

1195
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:45,091
these headless cows.
You could just grow in a lab,

1196
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,350
just sliced chunks off of them or 
something.

1197
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:48,760
I mean,
I don't know how they're doing this meat

1198
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:53,761
thing.
I don't really know either and I'm sure 

1199
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:53,761
it brings up a whole new slew of 
bioethical questions too,

1200
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:55,760
but that's just that.
Also probably health issues is probably.

1201
00:48:55,761 --> 00:49:00,761
I mean who's going to be the first 
person to live 10 years off of that bio 

1202
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:02,620
meet before they figure out it causes 
some inoperable colon cancer,

1203
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:07,650
right?
Because your body doesn't know how to 

1204
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,600
process it correctly and it sticks to 
the walls of your colon and starts 

1205
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,411
creating abscesses and they have to 
remove your colon and make a new one 

1206
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:15,460
with stem cells.
Cut you open like a fish and who's going

1207
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:17,980
to ditch this new shitter inside of you?

1208
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,140
Who's going to get,
who's going to be the Guinea pig?

1209
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,950
Someone will be as always,
I don't know.

1210
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,380
And again,
not everybody can go hunt wild animals.

1211
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,480
And if you did,
there would be no more wild animals.

1212
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:32,440
I mean that's really what the great 
market hunting of the um,

1213
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,520
the early 19th century.
That's in the 18th century as well,

1214
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,530
I think.
I think when they started that,

1215
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,960
I think they started in the 17 hundreds,
started hunting buffalo and antelope.

1216
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:48,700
And by the time the early 19 hundreds,
it was almost like completely wiped out.

1217
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:52,540
We had almost no animals left because it
was from market hunting,

1218
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:57,580
wasn't people hunting for their own 
personal use is that they didn't have 

1219
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,011
refrigerators back then remember.
So you had to get meat and it didn't 

1220
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:05,311
last very long and they had to get a new
supply of it constantly and they would 

1221
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:09,421
just go out and they would take these 
guys that were from the war and they 

1222
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:11,830
didn't have jobs.
And so this was their job.

1223
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:16,180
Now they would go out and hunt antelope 
and elk and deer and then sell that meat

1224
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:18,100
at the market.
And what's interesting too about that is

1225
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,500
that it's the human condition.
It's not only like the more modern human

1226
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,600
condition,
I'm reading a book or I just read a book

1227
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:25,270
called 1491,
which is about the condition of the,

1228
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,890
of north and South America and Central 
America before,

1229
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,590
before Columbus.
So there was biking contact and stuff.

1230
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:31,690
But,
um,

1231
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,030
and they were talking about,
you know,

1232
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,950
which is I think,
well known to a lot of people that,

1233
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:41,130
that the native Americans,
the Paleo Indians wiped out tons of 

1234
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,711
animals before,
when there was literally only a few 

1235
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:44,711
hundred thousand of them,
you know,

1236
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,090
because they were over hunting them.
So this,

1237
00:50:46,091 --> 00:50:49,010
this cycle continues know,
regardless,

1238
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,470
and you even hear about that in Iceland 
with a nurse that lived there,

1239
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:54,170
were they like depleted there?
They're very precious woodstock there.

1240
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:59,171
There's no animals.
A lot of it's not just modern humans 

1241
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:00,320
that are,
that are challenged by this.

1242
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:00,920
A lot of,
you know,

1243
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:05,921
the,
the woolly mammoth and all of these 

1244
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:05,921
animals were wiped out by humans,
you know.

1245
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:05,921
So it's very

1246
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:07,450
virtual by the way that,
that is.

1247
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:12,451
Um,
there's a lot of people that believe 

1248
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:14,561
that that had to coincide because the 
dates coincide with the end of the ice 

1249
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:18,510
age.
And there's a guy that I've had on this 

1250
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,521
podcast several times named Randall 
Carlson and he has some very compelling 

1251
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:23,470
evidence that points to the possibility 
that it was asteroidal impact that,

1252
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,500
that wiped out these animals and mass.
And it's one of the reasons why in 

1253
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,761
certain parts of the world you could 
find mass graveyards of animals that 

1254
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:34,060
were killed almost instantly.
And this was 10,000

1255
00:51:34,061 --> 00:51:39,061
years ago,
were saying interesting because I had 

1256
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:39,061
12,000
years ago.

1257
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:40,690
They think there's two possible large 
impacts that happened.

1258
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,130
So they weren't bold lives.
They were,

1259
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:43,540
they were actually,
they actually struck the.

1260
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,880
So they weren't like the Tunguska event 
with an explosion.

1261
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:46,390
They actually hit.

1262
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,600
They think it struck the ice sheet above
North America.

1263
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:50,110
Oh,
interesting.

1264
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:51,550
So there will be no evidence.
Well,

1265
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:56,551
North America will though.
They think that that was the reason why 

1266
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:58,831
there's this,
it's a fascinating podcast to go back 

1267
00:51:58,831 --> 00:51:58,831
and listen to.
And He,

1268
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:03,031
um,
I had him on with another guy named 

1269
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:05,221
Michael Shermer was a famous skeptic and
Graham Hancock who was also a proponent 

1270
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:08,581
of some of his ideas and they showed all
these images of like these deep fissures

1271
00:52:09,911 --> 00:52:14,911
that were cut into the,
into the land that must have been a 

1272
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:15,910
massive amount of water over a very 
short period of time.

1273
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,240
And he thinks it was probably a large 
body that slammed into the polarized 

1274
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,850
caps are slammed into rather the ice 
caps that are above,

1275
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:25,990
you know,
North America,

1276
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,020
somewhere around 10,000
years ago at two miles high of ice,

1277
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,350
over much of the surface of it and all 
sudden boom,

1278
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:32,800
gone.

1279
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:38,070
And that's what caused the Great Lakes.
The Great Lakes are essentially these 

1280
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:43,020
gigantic glaciers that melted and 
there's all sorts of features in these 

1281
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:49,021
various landscapes that he believes 
point to massive amounts of water that 

1282
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:52,000
happened over an incredibly short period
of time and the explanation for that and

1283
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:57,001
the peaks in the rises and the falls in 
temperature during that time when they 

1284
00:52:57,851 --> 00:53:02,851
do like a core samples of the earth,
he thinks that that also points to some 

1285
00:53:02,851 --> 00:53:04,470
sort of an impact.
That's fascinating.

1286
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:09,590
Yeah.
Randall Carlson studying this his whole 

1287
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,560
life,
he had an idea once when he was on acid.

1288
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:16,590
He went and looked at this,
a gigantic canyon when he was on acid 

1289
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,600
and he had this idea that this all 
happened because of water.

1290
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:24,870
It was trying to piece it together and 
then it became fascinating and started 

1291
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,010
studying it and then

1292
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,840
got really into asteroidal impacts and 
he's a wealth of knowledge but really,

1293
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,200
really fast and you've got to talk to 
you.

1294
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:33,360
That's fascinating.
I love that stuff,

1295
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:38,361
man.
That's what's so frustrating and why I 

1296
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,341
didn't study in college are really super
interested in ancient history or even,

1297
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:45,530
you know,
Paleo history in prehuman history and 

1298
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:45,530
stuff because it's also hypothetical.
You'll never really know.

1299
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:50,510
You know,
you have to just kind of trust people 

1300
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:50,510
much smarter than you that they have 
these,

1301
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,810
these,
these good ideas that sometimes conflict

1302
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,370
and.
But you'll never really know the answer.

1303
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,690
It's,
it's so frustrating to me.

1304
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:59,930
Those ideas definitely do conflict here.
This is the area that he looked over 

1305
00:53:59,930 --> 00:53:59,930
here,
place them in,

1306
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:00,570
so you get some volume on this.

1307
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,670
Probably Brian,
based upon the president flood,

1308
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:37,990
he had the flood that a few days a week 
whenever they would not have been washed

1309
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:42,940
away,

1310
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,710
a long,
long detailed thing.

1311
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:52,010
I mean he's talked about on the podcast 
for hours and hours.

1312
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:53,960
I've had them on several times and it's 
still.

1313
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,110
There's still a lot of information to 
cover because this guy has been studying

1314
00:54:57,111 --> 00:54:58,700
this as whole life.
I'm going to look into that.

1315
00:54:58,701 --> 00:55:03,701
That sounds interesting to me.
Absolutely positive that humans had an 

1316
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,990
impact on wooly mammoths and a lot of 
other animals,

1317
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,920
but there's a lot of people that are 
very,

1318
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,980
very hesitant to blame the entire 
radication of these animals on people.

1319
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,090
Yeah,
I don't.

1320
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:19,580
I don't know enough about it.
I do recommend the book though.

1321
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,680
Digit.
Just an interesting insight into a 1491.

1322
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:23,300
It's called just an interesting insight 
into,

1323
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:28,870
into agriculture and so just some ideas 
that kind of cobbled together some sort 

1324
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,460
of like vision of this place before,
you know,

1325
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,340
mainstream European contact because 
obviously a few places that I would.

1326
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,920
I mean if you had a time machine and 
we've always thought about this,

1327
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:41,921
like if you could go in some sort of an 
invisible bubble and experience the 

1328
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,400
earth at various stages.
There's two,

1329
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:48,450
two things I would love to see.
I would love to see during the great 

1330
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:48,450
pyramids,
like when,

1331
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,370
when they were in their prime,
I would love to see what it,

1332
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:54,390
what was Egypt actually like before they
burned the library of Alexandria and I 

1333
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,601
would have loved to have seen a native 
tribe in North America.

1334
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,790
Pre colonization.
Right.

1335
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,280
It'd be fascinating and that's the 
frustrating thing is we'll never really 

1336
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:06,380
quite know the answer,
but it's.

1337
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:09,420
It's fun to speculate about and I was 
reading it.

1338
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,320
I think you'd find interesting.
I was reading about the Easter islanders

1339
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,100
and how they have.
They have sweet potatoes on the island 

1340
00:56:18,651 --> 00:56:23,651
which are not indigenous to the island 
and the sweet potato to kind of spread 

1341
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:24,370
around Polynesia,
presumably from South America

1342
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:27,460
and there's this interesting thing that 
the name,

1343
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,900
the word,
I don't remember the exact word,

1344
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:33,901
but the word that many Polynesians are.
Many Polynesian societies that were 

1345
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,560
separated from each other.
Use for the sweet potato is identical to

1346
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:40,080
what they were using on the South 
American mainland indicating that the,

1347
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,190
the.
The islands might've been populated from

1348
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:47,191
the other direction that they assume 
that people came down from like what is 

1349
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:50,641
I guess like Indonesia and to Australia 
and then kind of hopped over to those 

1350
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:53,731
islands.
But people are suggesting that there 

1351
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:55,021
must've been contact from Paleo 
Americans on those islands because they 

1352
00:56:55,021 --> 00:56:59,311
eat sweet potatoes which are indigenous 
to South America and they call them the 

1353
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:02,101
same exact thing.
That the societies that we're thousands 

1354
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:02,260
of miles apart,
um,

1355
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,550
had,
had experienced,

1356
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,660
and you hear a lot about a lot of this 
was there cross transatlantic contact,

1357
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:13,710
could that,
and then it gets into crazy like 

1358
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:13,710
conspiracy theories about the pyramids 
and stuff,

1359
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:14,440
but were there with the phoenicians come
over where,

1360
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,920
where the Egyptian contact to the 
Chinese come here that the Romans,

1361
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,330
I remember that there was this,
uh,

1362
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:24,690
this theory that Romans might've been on
the Pacific coast of North America 

1363
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:24,690
because they found,
um,

1364
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,590
I guess they apparently found some 
coins,

1365
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Roman coins and they found these jars 
that I guess were ancient Roman are or 

1366
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,490
supposedly ancient Roman anchors for 
sure.

1367
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,260
I've seen that.
That was,

1368
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,740
these are recent discoveries.

1369
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,680
I think so over the last 10 years maybe.
Yeah.

1370
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,400
Yeah.
I mean the human history is,

1371
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,540
it's,
you know,

1372
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,640
kind of pieced together by what we find 
and every now and then they find 

1373
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:50,640
something,
they go,

1374
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,390
oh,
okay.

1375
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,230
You know,
I mean,

1376
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:55,710
what's really crazy is that the native 
Americans,

1377
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,110
when the settlers got here,
when Europeans got here,

1378
00:57:58,111 --> 00:58:03,111
they didn't have horses,
but horses actually evolved in North 

1379
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:05,160
America.
Horses evolved in North America and then

1380
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,220
by crossing the bering land mass made 
their way into Asia and all throughout 

1381
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:12,300
the rest of the world.
Even zebras,

1382
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,850
they originally started in North America
wild,

1383
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:20,060
but then somehow or another,
so for some reason they went extinct in 

1384
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:24,531
North America and you know,
they survived and thrived in Europe and 

1385
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:28,020
then they were reintroduced and Dan 
Flores,

1386
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:33,021
he's a wildlife historian.
He maintains that the native Americans 

1387
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:36,780
once,
once they had firearms and the horse,

1388
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,570
that they would have wiped out the 
buffalo on their own.

1389
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:44,810
That it had nothing to do with like 
market hunting and all the things that 

1390
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,430
the Europeans did was terrible and it 
happened quite rapidly,

1391
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:51,150
but he maintains that it was,
it was gonna happen anyway.

1392
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Just just the nature of what kind of an 
animal it was and that humans were 

1393
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,970
eventually going to get to them anyway.

1394
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,460
Yeah,
I mean that's what we were talking 

1395
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:02,460
about,
the human condition and how things don't

1396
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:02,830
seem to change regardless of who you're 
talking about.

1397
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,460
And I'm always fascinated by these 
gentle kind of connections between these

1398
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:11,461
different societies that we're learning 
more and more about that the world is 

1399
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:12,160
way smaller than I think we thought it 
was in antiquity.

1400
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,660
And even before that,
um,

1401
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,500
they were talking about how some 
greenland and Newfoundland and New 

1402
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,020
Brunswick and all of these kind of had 
these Indian tribes that definitely 

1403
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,150
probably had extended contact with the 
vikings for a long period of time.

1404
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:31,151
And,
and these words kind of find their way 

1405
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:31,151
to like the St Lawrence Valley that 
describe the same things.

1406
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,260
And then when the French fur traders 
come,

1407
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:35,840
they find that they're using words that 
they shouldn't know.

1408
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,180
And yeah,
it's,

1409
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,760
it's super fascinating.
Like the,

1410
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,810
these,
these brilliant scholars that kind of 

1411
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:43,810
put these things together for us to 
write about.

1412
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:43,810
It is amazing,
you know,

1413
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,260
and just think of how much we don't 
know.

1414
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,600
I mean God to be able to go back 60,000
years ago and just be a fly on the wall 

1415
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:57,130
and some ancient civilization and see 
how they interact with each other.

1416
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,190
Oh,
awesome.

1417
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,350
That will be honest with you even read 
about.

1418
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,450
There were these great,
there's outside of St Louis,

1419
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:04,100
I think it's like Cahokia or something 
like that.

1420
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,880
It was this massive native American 
metropolis in North America.

1421
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:10,070
We often think about central and South 
America is having these may,

1422
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,030
Aztec,
Inca,

1423
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:16,300
all these major cities,
but there were major mountain cities in 

1424
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,970
North America that were populated by 
maybe 25,

1425
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:19,280
30,000
people and they were wiped out before we

1426
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:22,010
even got here or before our European 
ancestors got here.

1427
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,560
Um,
and it's so god,

1428
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:29,650
you're right,
because it would just be so interesting 

1429
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:29,650
to see how,
how do they live,

1430
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:29,650
how do they farm,
how,

1431
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,780
what was their commerce lake,
um,

1432
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,970
you know,
what was their languages like,

1433
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,630
did they,
did they,

1434
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,490
did they have written records that 
didn't survive?

1435
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:36,170
And I don't know.
But again,

1436
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:41,171
that ties back into a venn diagram of 
frustration because you'll never really 

1437
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:41,171
know.

1438
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:45,100
There's a ranch up in central California
that I go to sometimes called to hone 

1439
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,650
ranch.
And there's these stone circles that are

1440
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:51,980
carved in rocks.
So they have these massive rocks.

1441
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,981
And then there's like these concave,
like dug outs where they would make 

1442
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:58,940
bread.
So you're,

1443
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:03,941
you're looking at places where they 
would grind grain into these rocks and 

1444
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,030
these holes are,
you know,

1445
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:10,090
who knows how long they existed,
who knows how long ago these subsistence

1446
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,900
farmers or subsistence,
uh,

1447
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,150
people lived there and did this.
And so you're,

1448
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:19,850
you're stepping over these rocks and 
staring down on.

1449
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,880
There's some getty images of him.
Those holes were carved by the native 

1450
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:31,451
Americans and they were done over 
fucking years and years of grinding 

1451
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:35,411
stones into the stone.
And know what's interesting is a lot of 

1452
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:40,091
the ancient Egyptians I went to see the 
mummy exhibit at the Natural National 

1453
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,040
Natural History Museum or the Science 
Museum.

1454
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,350
Which one is it in California?
Anyway,

1455
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:50,770
they had a museum exhibit on mummies and
they said all their teeth were ground 

1456
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:54,971
down and it's because when they would 
make their bread and they would grind 

1457
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:57,770
stone and the stone,
it would create sand and that sand would

1458
01:01:57,771 --> 01:02:02,480
be in the bread interested to be eating 
this gritty sandy bread.

1459
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,400
And that's,
that's what they ate.

1460
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,130
And they would just chew their fucking 
teeth away to nothing.

1461
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,310
That's fascinating.
Yeah,

1462
01:02:08,311 --> 01:02:08,580
it's,
it's,

1463
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:12,200
it's this marriage of archeology and 
anthropology and sociology.

1464
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:15,710
Even that gives.
I'm always disconcerted that more people

1465
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:18,740
don't find this fascinating.
You're a real student of history.

1466
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,040
I mean,
you really love history.

1467
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,730
I do.
I love it.

1468
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:26,030
I mean,
I thought that was a really interesting 

1469
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:26,030
subject when you and I were talking the 
first time you,

1470
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,750
you and you were a young guy,
but you embrace it,

1471
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,920
you know,
I think it's fascinating.

1472
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:30,150
Someone has to do it.
It's not,

1473
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,930
it's not practical.
I always tell people people have gone,

1474
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,830
you know,
over the years,

1475
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:39,831
fans of mine have gone to school for 
history and asked me should I study 

1476
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:40,050
history and politics and I'm like,
you can,

1477
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,280
I think you should do what makes you 
happy.

1478
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:46,281
I think it would be much wiser for you 
to study pharmacy or chemistry or 

1479
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:50,061
something.
And there's not a lot of money in 

1480
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:50,061
history.
Yeah,

1481
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:50,061
there's nothing.
I mean,

1482
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:50,700
I remember when I was about to start 
Grad school when I,

1483
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:52,830
um,
when I got my job in the gaming industry

1484
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,700
and I left and um,
I remember,

1485
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:59,701
uh,
professors being like 50 percent of all 

1486
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,821
history phd is,
will never find a job in the field 50 

1487
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,150
percent because there's no,
it's the same thing with archeology.

1488
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:07,500
Like I played around with the idea of 
doing like a American archeology,

1489
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:09,780
which is a growing movement.
They're digging up Jamestown there,

1490
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,310
the,
you know,

1491
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,570
all those kinds of things and there's 
just no money in it,

1492
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,500
you know.
Um,

1493
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,880
and so I,
I try to just,

1494
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,240
I want people to just love history,
like the way I love it and understand 

1495
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,061
it.
And I think a lot of it is because it's 

1496
01:03:23,061 --> 01:03:24,471
not told well it's not.
The stories dates and times are 

1497
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:28,041
interesting.
I remember them and I think I have that 

1498
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:28,041
kind of brain,
that right,

1499
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:28,260
that kind of right centered brain where 
like,

1500
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:33,261
I remember facts and dates,
but that's not really what's important 

1501
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:35,721
about it.
And if people taught history Morris 

1502
01:03:35,721 --> 01:03:36,510
stories than which I think is what I'm 
trying to do with my show,

1503
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:38,610
then I think that people will enjoy it 
more.

1504
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,250
So I think that's like the greatest 
pleasure of what I do with people saying

1505
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,240
like,
I hate history.

1506
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,040
I hated history of God.
I thought it was so boring,

1507
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,360
but this is such,
this is so interesting.

1508
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:47,760
Thank you for bringing this to my 
attention.

1509
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:48,420
And I was like,
well,

1510
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:53,710
you know,
more power to you and now we can 

1511
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:53,710
remember what happened in these stories 
are interesting and they're important.

1512
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,570
They are important in how many people 
are taking advantage of that?

1513
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,720
How many people are passing these 
stories around?

1514
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:05,721
I mean,
how many Dan Carlin's are there in the 

1515
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:05,721
world?
Yeah.

1516
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:05,721
Not many.
Not many.

1517
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:05,721
And pretty much.
No.

1518
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:06,200
One of his skill.
Yeah.

1519
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,520
Hey Jamie can be one of them.
Caveman's please.

1520
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,880
And another one of these jammies.
You want to caveman coffee?

1521
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,060
Want to get jazzed up?
I'm okay.

1522
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:12,900
Thank you.
I don't drink coffee.

1523
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,710
You don't drink coffee?

1524
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,420
I just don't know.
Not.

1525
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:15,750
I have no problem with.
I just don't drink it.

1526
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,750
You just don't like the taste.
It's not getting jacked.

1527
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:19,440
Oh No,
I don't mind.

1528
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,310
I don't mind getting.
Yeah,

1529
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,480
I could do some energy,
but.

1530
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,140
No,
I'm good.

1531
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:27,141
Thank you.
I always feel like I'm missing out on 

1532
01:04:27,141 --> 01:04:27,750
something because people really love it.
Like my girlfriend's the same way.

1533
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:30,960
My Dad Super Coffee Connoisseur.
Yeah,

1534
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:35,961
he loves it.
He loves coffee and like feel like that 

1535
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:38,511
would cigarette sometimes.
I know cigarettes are terrible for you 

1536
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:41,450
and I think they smell gross,
but I see people taking a big drag of 

1537
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,900
the cigarette and he seems so satisfied 
and excited by it.

1538
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:43,550
I'm like,
hmm,

1539
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,020
maybe I'm missing something.
Yeah,

1540
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:50,030
I always see.
I always see people outside of work in 

1541
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:51,741
my neighborhood.
You kind of get to know the characters 

1542
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:51,741
in your neighborhood.
Right.

1543
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:51,741
And they're always standing outside 
smoking,

1544
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:51,960
you know,
having a little more time.

1545
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,610
I'll tell you what though.
I,

1546
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:57,140
I smoked one of Tony Hinchcliffe 
cigarettes before a show once a,

1547
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:59,190
I think I've done it twice now.
And uh,

1548
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:00,170
you,
your,

1549
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,270
it's a real cognitive booster.
I mean,

1550
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:05,550
it really does stimulate you in a very 
strange way.

1551
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:06,210
Thank you,
sir.

1552
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,890
Do you think you were better when you 
after,

1553
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,260
after having what's better?
I don't know.

1554
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,680
Sometimes you're not bitter stimulated.
Especially doing standup.

1555
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,970
Sometimes you're better balanced and 
calm you,

1556
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,070
but it's

1557
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,910
mentally,
it's,

1558
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,280
it definitely stimulates you in some 
sort of a weird way.

1559
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,260
I was like,
whew.

1560
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:25,570
So like a different sort of feeling.
It's like if you ever smoked a cigar.

1561
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,470
Yeah,
yeah.

1562
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:27,530
You get high off cigar.
Yeah.

1563
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,370
I can only smoke half of it or actually 
start to get like almost nauseous.

1564
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,870
So yeah,
you get high,

1565
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:36,880
like the nicotine and a fat stokey 
definitely gets you high.

1566
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,860
There's something to it.
It makes me think about these old,

1567
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,500
these old timers are people still do it,
but my friend growing up,

1568
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:46,501
his GRANDPA would always.
That smell reminds me of him because 

1569
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:46,501
he'd always just sit on the porch and 
smoke,

1570
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:49,930
but it just chain smoke like cigars.
And how are you not animals people.

1571
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,790
It's incredible.
I uh,

1572
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:52,770
but yeah,
I.

1573
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:57,900
How is uh,
you were doing the sober thing for the 

1574
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:57,900
sober October.
So today's the last day.

1575
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,820
How do you feel about saying I'm nervous
devers smoke pot again?

1576
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:06,100
Tell you that God,
I haven't gotten more than two days 

1577
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:06,100
without smoking pot in 15 years,
so I don't even know.

1578
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,330
It's weird.
I'll tell you the big,

1579
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,650
the big change is your sleep.
You have radical dreams.

1580
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,210
Really?
Yeah.

1581
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:15,520
Radical.
Really realistic.

1582
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:19,240
I'm confusing.
Dreams were in the middle of the dream.

1583
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:24,241
You don't realize that it's a dream.
Like I had a dream that I was lying on 

1584
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:27,601
this couch,
a couch that actually exists a couch in 

1585
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:30,571
my house and that I was cold so I 
grabbed this blanket and I was pulling 

1586
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,410
the blanket over me,
but the blanket was kind of stuck in the

1587
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:37,411
pillows so you know,
like kind of struggled with it and get 

1588
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:41,641
the blanket over you.
And then I woke up and there's no 

1589
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:41,641
fucking blanket.
I was like,

1590
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:41,641
oh my God.

1591
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,370
Like I dreamt that I was pulling a 
blanket.

1592
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:50,371
I mean,
it was so realistic that I would have 

1593
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:53,881
sworn if I woke up that I had struggled 
to get that blanket over me while I was 

1594
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:59,041
taking a nap on the couch,
but there was no fucking blanket I was 

1595
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,461
reading and as I was reading I decided I
was going to lie down right here and 

1596
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:05,971
sleep and I must have passed out and 
decided that I was cold and went through

1597
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:11,410
this elaborate dream sequence where I 
pulled a blanket over me,

1598
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:16,770
but I was convinced that I had woken up 
cold and had to adjust and pull the 

1599
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,090
blanket over me and went back to sleep.
It's mainly very vivid,

1600
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:24,600
fucking super vivid,
but there was no blanket anywhere near 

1601
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,481
me when I woke up.
I mean there's just fucking couch 

1602
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:27,481
pillow.
That's it.

1603
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:27,610
No blanket on the ground.

1604
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,940
Not to like I could have gotten up and 
put it over there and sleep walk.

1605
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,960
There's no fucking blanket.
But in my mind if you had asked me like,

1606
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,700
did you wake up and pull a blanket over 
it?

1607
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:37,030
Yeah.
Yeah,

1608
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:37,720
I did.
Yeah,

1609
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,650
I remember.
No,

1610
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,570
I don't remember.
Shit.

1611
01:07:39,571 --> 01:07:40,600
It was fake.
Are you,

1612
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:44,200
so are you looking forward to not doing 
this anymore or are you kind of like,

1613
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:46,030
or do you want to keep,
keep doing it?

1614
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,520
Like are the benefits or the pros 
outweigh the cons?

1615
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,940
I think there are real creative benefits
to marijuana.

1616
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,720
I do too.
There's um,

1617
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,880
there's states that I think you achieve 
when you smoke pot that are unattainable

1618
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,860
without pot.
I think pot makes me more introspective.

1619
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,890
It makes me nicer.
It makes me calmer.

1620
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:11,310
It makes me a,
I have a better sense and understanding 

1621
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,630
of like the importance and value of 
community.

1622
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,190
It makes me more sensitive to the things

1623
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,080
that I'm saying,
you know?

1624
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,970
Um,
I don't,

1625
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:24,971
I don't think pods bad not.
I think it's always good to take time 

1626
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:29,861
away from anything just to get a better 
baseline to bring yourself back down to 

1627
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:30,370
neutral.
Yeah.

1628
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:35,390
I feel like I,
it's something that maybe I should 

1629
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:35,390
challenge myself to do as well because I
remember,

1630
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,770
I mean I've been,
I've smoked marijuana regularly my whole

1631
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,860
adult life and it becomes the,
some people dip in and out of it.

1632
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:47,291
Like,
it's something that you do 

1633
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:47,291
recreationally or you want to get stoned
before a concert or whatever.

1634
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:47,480
But I always found that it was,
uh,

1635
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,120
it was,
uh,

1636
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:49,320
as,
as sad as it sounds.

1637
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:54,350
Some people,
I think that it was almost part of my 

1638
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,190
process in a way where even in college I
was writing a paper or as working or,

1639
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:56,390
or whatever the case might be.

1640
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,980
You know,
I feel like,

1641
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:02,981
yeah,
let's take a take a smoke a joint or 

1642
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:02,981
something like that.
And,

1643
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:03,040
and I agree.
Like I,

1644
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:07,360
I get most creative to this day,
late at night when I,

1645
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:09,490
if I smoke or do something like that,
um,

1646
01:09:09,491 --> 01:09:11,090
I'm writing good stuff,
I'm having good ideas.

1647
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:16,091
I'm writing ideas down and then 
sometimes they come back to them later 

1648
01:09:16,091 --> 01:09:16,940
when I'm not stone and I can flesh them 
out more or whatever.

1649
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,870
But I agree that there's great.
Um,

1650
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:24,210
there's great creative benefit to it.
And I also feel like I'm really happy 

1651
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,120
that in a very short amount of time,
uh,

1652
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,860
American society has come around to the 
benefits of marijuana,

1653
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:29,990
not only medicinally,
but just recreationally.

1654
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:34,991
And the number is the polling numbers 
from the early two thousands to today 

1655
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:34,991
are radically different.
We're talking about ships,

1656
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:37,430
I'm like 30,
35 points and how people feel about them

1657
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,060
and I'm like,
any,

1658
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,110
like you're saying like with anything in
moderation is probably key.

1659
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:45,950
I often in my life don't because it can 
make me lazy too.

1660
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:50,951
We can get me very interested in music 
or something like that and I get 

1661
01:09:50,951 --> 01:09:54,251
distracted.
So in my general day to day I don't 

1662
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:54,650
smoke until I'm done with what I like 
the administrative shit I need to do.

1663
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:55,280
I'm done.
I,

1664
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,110
I've gone to the grocery store,
I've done all of these things.

1665
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:58,610
Okay.
Now it's time for me to relax.

1666
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,960
You know,
your grunt work.

1667
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,580
Exactly.
And so,

1668
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:02,330
uh,
so.

1669
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,580
But do you have like a,
do you have a,

1670
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,490
like a specific joint or something 
strand ready that you want to smoke when

1671
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,240
to get back into it?
Are you gonna ease back into it?

1672
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,090
Are you gonna?
Are you gonna pull?

1673
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,800
It just says Jamie just pulled something
up.

1674
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:18,090
Holes of PSA.
Find supportive legal weed and an all 

1675
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,090
time high.
That's great.

1676
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,090
Yeah,
no,

1677
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,700
I just,
I'm just going to smoke some pot.

1678
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,770
I'm gonna do it tomorrow with Owen 
Benjamin or doing a podcast together,

1679
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,360
so I'm going to get high for the first 
time on air.

1680
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:28,450
Nice.
So that'll be interesting for the 

1681
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:28,450
audience.
Yeah.

1682
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:28,450
Should be interesting for me to um,
yeah.

1683
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,840
I'm,
I'm a little nervous because I know it's

1684
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:34,160
going to hit me like a damn a bet.
My tolerance is down to zero,

1685
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,990
but that's gonna be fun for you because 
now you'll,

1686
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:36,530
you'll,
yeah,

1687
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,390
because I do feel like there's a plateau
obviously.

1688
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,290
Oh,
for sure.

1689
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,730
Yeah.
Like heavy duty,

1690
01:10:40,731 --> 01:10:42,950
hardcore daytime stoners,
you know,

1691
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,660
they don't,
they don't feel anything.

1692
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,400
Yeah.
It's almost like a,

1693
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,020
it's almost like sustaining some sort of
feeling but you're not,

1694
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,940
you can never reach that.
That feeling again,

1695
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:51,740
which is again,
why moderation is important and it's the

1696
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:56,741
same thing.
Alcoholics frankly feeling other 

1697
01:10:56,741 --> 01:10:56,741
people's views,
things so,

1698
01:10:56,741 --> 01:11:00,430
but marijuana,
we have a very infant style sort of 

1699
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:00,430
approach to what marijuana is because 
of,

1700
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:05,470
I think because of the all the 
prohibition bullshit that people went 

1701
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,790
through from the 19 thirties on.
There's this,

1702
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:10,160
you know,
this weird propaganda that,

1703
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:13,160
that marijuana is the devil's weed and 
it's terrible for you.

1704
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,980
There's a lot of like cultural and 
societal benefits to achieving those 

1705
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,541
states of mind.
I think they really do make people 

1706
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:23,541
nicer.
You know,

1707
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,330
I think it,
it calms you down.

1708
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,560
It May.
Here's the big one that everybody's 

1709
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:29,560
worried about.
Paranoia.

1710
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,230
It makes you paranoid.
I don't think that that's.

1711
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:33,690
I don't think that that's a bad thing 
necessarily.

1712
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:37,380
I think that paranoia,
that feeling of vulnerability,

1713
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:42,090
it probably makes you more honestly 
assess how you interface with the world.

1714
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:47,120
You know,
there's a lot of real danger in the 

1715
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:47,120
world,
you know,

1716
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,421
and I think that marijuana probably 
makes you really think about that real 

1717
01:11:50,421 --> 01:11:53,010
danger in a way that you perhaps ignore 
or put in the back of your head,

1718
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:58,310
but it's always there.
It's always there in your subconscious 

1719
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,951
to sorta grinding away.
Whereas marijuana brings it to the 

1720
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:04,791
front,
has a light shines that light on it 

1721
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:04,791
goes,
hey,

1722
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:06,660
maybe she'll look at this.
How about the fact that your lungs don't

1723
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:07,860
work so good anymore,
man?

1724
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:13,250
How many more years you got?
Many more summers you think you'd have 

1725
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:13,250
on this planet,
you know you've got 40,

1726
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,040
you got 15,
you got 60.

1727
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,420
That's it.
If you're lucky,

1728
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,710
if you're lucky you got 60,

1729
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,640
but you're right.
It's fascinating because if it.

1730
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:25,670
If it opens up these places in our brain
that are creative that let us write 

1731
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,471
better,
that make us funnier and with your 

1732
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:28,471
comedy for instance,
or whatever the case might be,

1733
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:30,070
then you know it makes you kinder,
which I agree.

1734
01:12:30,071 --> 01:12:35,071
It makes me a people out.
Then of course it would make sense that 

1735
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,861
it opens up these dark recesses in your 
brain that hide or shield these things 

1736
01:12:38,081 --> 01:12:43,081
that you don't want to think about and I
agree that confronting those things is 

1737
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:45,661
normal.
I think a paranoia I think is a is a 

1738
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,630
side effect of marijuana for sure,
but it's about how you harness it and if

1739
01:12:46,631 --> 01:12:51,631
you think about it within the terms that
in the parameters that you're talking 

1740
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:51,631
about it,
which is that these things exist.

1741
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:52,780
So you're just thinking about.
It's not like you're.

1742
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,090
It's not a manifestation of something 
that doesn't exist.

1743
01:12:55,140 --> 01:13:00,140
No.
And it makes you aware of some things 

1744
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,421
that are very easy to ignore but are 
pretty fucking huge like space.

1745
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:09,110
Like my.
One of my favorite things to do is a 

1746
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,180
smoke a joint and go out and sit in my 
backyard,

1747
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,600
has pull up a lawn chair,
put my feet up and just stare up at 

1748
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,901
space and just think of how fucking 
insane it is that there is this in 

1749
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,880
immeasurable view of infinity and it's 
above our head and we sort of take it 

1750
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:29,130
for granted and we barely stare at it.
We barely look at it.

1751
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:31,240
We barely taken into consideration.
It's just,

1752
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:34,020
it's just a thing that we completely 
take for granted.

1753
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,010
But when I'm high I can really freak out
about it.

1754
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:42,050
It can get to.
One of the things I like to do when I 

1755
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,530
smoke a little pot is get to the base of
a hill.

1756
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:48,740
There's something about being in the 
base of a hill and lying down where 

1757
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:52,011
you're looking up and you see the hill 
and then you see the clouds moving over 

1758
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:55,620
the hill in the background,
the blue sky and the clouds.

1759
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:01,010
There's something about that that gives 
me a more accurate understanding of 

1760
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:06,561
atmosphere of this thin layer of 
protective air that keeps us shielded 

1761
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:11,830
from radiation,
the magnetosphere above all this

1762
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,160
stuff that that's above us.
That's just sort of like slowly moving 

1763
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:22,261
around this just this giant globe is 
that there's that view where you're 

1764
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:27,301
laying back and you're looking up at the
clouds rolling over the top of the 

1765
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:31,351
mountain.
It gives you like a more of an 

1766
01:14:31,351 --> 01:14:32,521
understanding of the spiritual nature of
the planet and the fact that it is 

1767
01:14:32,521 --> 01:14:34,870
draped in this atmosphere.
There's just a real weird,

1768
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:38,380
trippy reset sort of a feeling that I 
get from that.

1769
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,250
Like we're on like a convertible 
spaceship.

1770
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:42,720
Yeah.
It's,

1771
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:47,300
it is remarkable that it brings,
it brings memories forward of like that,

1772
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,320
that rare earth hypothesis.
The idea that we might not necessarily 

1773
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,441
be alone,
but this is so unique that maybe it's 

1774
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:55,441
worth,
you know,

1775
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:55,650
the um,
the,

1776
01:14:55,690 --> 01:15:00,690
what was it that Harvard professor that 
did the mathematical equation of how if 

1777
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:00,690
we're alone or not army parents.

1778
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:05,620
Yeah.
Like where he gives us kind of numbers 

1779
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:05,620
to various things and,
and uh,

1780
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:10,170
the suggestion there is that we probably
life based on the confines of a,

1781
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:15,301
of a 13 point 5 billion year old 
universe that is expanding at the speed 

1782
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:15,700
of light is probably that we're not very
alone,

1783
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:21,420
but the idea that light this planet with
just this and just the right place with 

1784
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:25,711
a moon that protects it from a lot of 
ancient astroid and comic collisions 

1785
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:29,581
that I'm with oxygen and it's just so 
fascinating and I think that we often 

1786
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:32,800
don't think like in a weird way 
galactically about are universally about

1787
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:37,801
like how everything that we experience 
is based on our experience on this 

1788
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:41,650
little globe hurdling through space as 
temporary life forms.

1789
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:42,580
It's.
Yeah.

1790
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,120
And I,
I like it because it,

1791
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:47,530
it removes this to me.
I'm an atheist.

1792
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:49,090
I don't believe in God.

1793
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:54,090
And I,
I feel like that's liberating in a 

1794
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,090
sense.
I don't mind if people of faith,

1795
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,090
I come from a family that,
you know,

1796
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,920
Catholics and they don't agree with me,
but that,

1797
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:58,690
that you almost let go and just be like,
we're here.

1798
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,840
We have a finite amount of time.
It's probably a mistake that were here 

1799
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,300
are some sort of just random occurrence 
and it,

1800
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,360
it's liberating because you used the 
time you have to do what you want to do 

1801
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:09,640
and then you're gone.
Ashes to ashes and I and a lot of people

1802
01:16:09,641 --> 01:16:12,390
look at the ashes to ashes as like this 
dark thing and I'm like,

1803
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,130
it's kind of Nice.
It's kind of interesting,

1804
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:15,700
you know,
like,

1805
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:18,670
like what's here is gone.
What will be,

1806
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:21,010
is made from what you are,
you know?

1807
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:26,011
Well,
people absolutely terrified of the idea 

1808
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:26,011
that they're not going to be around to 
experience something.

1809
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:28,480
You know?
It's weird because everybody's afraid to

1810
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,920
die,
but no one's afraid to sleep.

1811
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,290
That's,
that's deep.

1812
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:33,160
And it's true.
I mean,

1813
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,720
I,
I hope that I get to see things.

1814
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,270
I feel like one of the things that I'm,
I'm bummed about for our,

1815
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,420
for the time in which we live,
you and I,

1816
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,660
is that I feel like we're in this middle
space where some crazy shit's going to 

1817
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,970
happen in probably 2100 and beyond.
When we really start exploring space and

1818
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:54,170
what's happening right now,
I think we're at the embryonic state of 

1819
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:54,170
crazy things happening and I,
I,

1820
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:54,510
we might,
you know,

1821
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,740
think about how far we've come even in 
the last 15 years,

1822
01:16:56,741 --> 01:17:01,741
so who knows,
but the idea of traveling to other star 

1823
01:17:01,741 --> 01:17:01,741
systems,
the idea of meeting life,

1824
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:05,170
man,
imagine how frustrated you would be if a

1825
01:17:05,171 --> 01:17:09,070
contact like situation Jodie foster,
Carl Sagan like situation happened while

1826
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,220
you're on your deathbed.
Yeah.

1827
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,950
Or even if you have 20 years left and 
they don't give you this,

1828
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:15,470
this radical mathematical equation of 
build a spaceship,

1829
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:16,010
but they're just like,
hey,

1830
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:19,380
we're here and we're 150 light years 
away and,

1831
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,730
and you have to literally take 150 years
to send that message.

1832
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:27,950
It will take that long to send the 
message back and then another 150 years 

1833
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:27,950
to get the message back and so on and so
forth.

1834
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,990
What if they're all like Putin's Russian
mob,

1835
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,000
but in space.
You know what I mean?

1836
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:35,210
He's this idea that they're going to be 
some sort of altruistic,

1837
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:38,330
beautiful alien race that's gotten past 
war.

1838
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:41,960
And what if it's like a race of Harvey 
Weinstein's out.

1839
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:45,050
The university's creditable.
They come here a mouth fuck us off.

1840
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,940
I mean,
who knows what,

1841
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,060
why they would care about us.
I mean,

1842
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:57,580
I'm also,
there's this assumption that they would 

1843
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,801
treat us better than the way we treat 
monkeys that we find in the Congo 

1844
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:00,890
because we don't treat primates very 
well.

1845
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,600
Well,
it is funny how that's true.

1846
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:05,240
We don't treat almost anything very well
except for our dogs and our cats.

1847
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,850
But the,
the um,

1848
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:12,100
it is funny to think about this kind of,
these kinds of thought experiments that 

1849
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,500
people do and [inaudible] and whatever 
about what,

1850
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,640
what would be the,
why would they come and what would be 

1851
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,020
the nature of them and what is their,
you know,

1852
01:18:20,021 --> 01:18:21,640
why are they taking the initiative to 
contact us?

1853
01:18:21,641 --> 01:18:23,300
And it,
it's interesting that a lot of people do

1854
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:24,210
settle on the.
They,

1855
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:26,420
if they're going through this trouble,
they're not coming here to,

1856
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,230
to fuck with you.

1857
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,120
Like silly.
But I think like,

1858
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:29,710
why not,
you know,

1859
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:34,780
I don't know.
Why would you make an assumption based 

1860
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,611
on human understanding of anything,
what they're gonna do you know if this 

1861
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:37,550
is a very.
In terms of like resources,

1862
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,530
this,
this planet.

1863
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:40,010
It's very rich,
you know?

1864
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:45,011
I mean think about it.
What if there are from a planet that's 

1865
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:45,110
low in water,
we're three quarters water.

1866
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:47,360
The surface of our planet is mostly 
water,

1867
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,780
right?
We have all sorts of weird minerals and 

1868
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:53,150
who knows how,
I mean,

1869
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:57,770
they're rare in our solar system.
So what we find on earth in terms of the

1870
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:00,220
biological life is insane,
right?

1871
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:03,170
We haven't even found biological life 
anywhere else in the solar system.

1872
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,210
So it could be that this is just the 
ultimate fucking sweet spot.

1873
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,370
I mean we are in what we call the 
goldilocks zone,

1874
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,440
right?
But then there's also,

1875
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,500
my thought is always why just like it's 
such a limited thing to think that 

1876
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:22,451
biological life as we know at carbon 
based life on the planet earth that 

1877
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:24,170
exists between the temperatures of x and
y,

1878
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:29,550
you know,
and it has a lifespan of whatever the 

1879
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:29,550
fuck it is.

1880
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:29,960
Like there's the only way life can be 
like,

1881
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,700
why?
Yeah.

1882
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:32,590
No,
I never bought that.

1883
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:36,110
I always was confused by that.
Why can a species breathe ammonia?

1884
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,080
Yeah.
And you know,

1885
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,920
like I,
and that's why they use the term,

1886
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:41,710
I guess a life as we know it.
Uh,

1887
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,310
but I'm,
I'm of the same mind as you,

1888
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:47,150
I think with just the mathematical 
permutations,

1889
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:53,220
you know,
multiplied by the amount of space 

1890
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:53,220
covered.
Even the exoplanets we're finding now,

1891
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:57,460
I know a lot of them are gas giants and 
stuff like that and the really close to 

1892
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,681
the star system,
but they indicate that maybe we're not 

1893
01:19:59,681 --> 01:20:02,021
all so unique.
And I was reading a thing about Jupiter 

1894
01:20:02,021 --> 01:20:03,761
and Saturn even in relation to 
exoplanets being found that are similar 

1895
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:07,040
to them that they might have been far 
closer to the sun when they formed.

1896
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,830
Then we're pushed out.

1897
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,520
So maybe we're seeing solar systems 
earlier on in their,

1898
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,170
in their lifecycle.
And,

1899
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:14,670
and there's a lot of.
I love space,

1900
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:18,510
do I?
I think it's a super fascinating study.

1901
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:23,511
I wish that I was smarter with math,
with physics and all those kinds of 

1902
01:20:23,511 --> 01:20:26,991
things so they have a very,
very limited understanding of that 

1903
01:20:26,991 --> 01:20:26,991
stuff,
you know,

1904
01:20:26,991 --> 01:20:26,991
like the,
um,

1905
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,680
that maybe I would have explored that 
instead,

1906
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:30,390
but I don't have that,
but my brain doesn't work like that,

1907
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,350
you know,
I can't do calculus.

1908
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,180
Are you a fan of science fiction?
Yes.

1909
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:38,390
Do you like,
did you like the Battlestar Galactica 

1910
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,390
series?
Loved it.

1911
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,390
Loved it.
Great.

1912
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,240
It's awesome.
One of the most underrated series ever.

1913
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:41,070
It was awesome.
I knew one.

1914
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:41,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

1915
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,800
The one from 2004.
Yeah.

1916
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:43,240
Yeah.
I,

1917
01:20:43,241 --> 01:20:43,830
I,
uh,

1918
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,640
I loved it because,
uh,

1919
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:49,290
I think it married really well.
Saifai believable Saifai with,

1920
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:54,350
um,
the problems we're encountering maybe 

1921
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:54,780
with ai now with the cylons and then a 
religious aspect,

1922
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,450
a monotheistic polytheistic cultures 
kind of clashing,

1923
01:20:57,451 --> 01:21:02,451
a lot of,
there's a lot of depth to that that I 

1924
01:21:02,451 --> 01:21:04,311
think people don't see because they're 
turned off by the setting.

1925
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:08,280
But I think a lot of people just missed 
it because it was a retake of a.

1926
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:11,220
was in 1977 or [inaudible] 79,
1987 with that.

1927
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,260
Yeah.
It was a retake of that show.

1928
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:16,140
That seemed to be at the time to be a 
star wars rip off,

1929
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,940
you know,
it was like,

1930
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,430
there was like,
you're luke skywalker character that was

1931
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:21,720
starbuck,
you know,

1932
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:26,721
there's all this,
there was all this stuff to it that 

1933
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:26,721
people like,
ah,

1934
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:29,010
that's a fake storm trooper.
This show sucks.

1935
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,500
I know it was a movie.
Yeah,

1936
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:32,970
it was the show rather.
Yeah,

1937
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:33,580
it was.
Yeah,

1938
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:34,570
it started as a,
uh,

1939
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,440
like a mini series,
which is about the cylons turning on the

1940
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:42,441
humans and then,
or I guess the end result of them 

1941
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:42,441
turning on the humans.
And then,

1942
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:46,041
uh,
and then they expanded into four 

1943
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:46,041
seasons,
I think.

1944
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:46,041
I think the show is amazing and show.

1945
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,280
Was it only four seasons?
Yeah,

1946
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,740
I think it was 2000.
Yeah,

1947
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,670
I think it was 2000.
Four to 2009 or something like that.

1948
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:52,320
Bringing it back.
Come on fuckers.

1949
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:53,370
Netflix,
get on it.

1950
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,410
Come on.
I know it's canceled on house of cards.

1951
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,170
Give us some Battlestar Galactica.
Battlestar was great.

1952
01:21:58,171 --> 01:21:59,970
I thought that they,
they told the arc really well.

1953
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,680
Fascinating.
I thought the acting was pretty good.

1954
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,790
Um,
and uh,

1955
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:08,150
I liked the idea of the,
because we're dealing with it 

1956
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:08,150
tangentially now.
The uh,

1957
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:08,880
the idea of,
not that it's unique to that story,

1958
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:11,440
but of ai and robots turning on,
you know,

1959
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:16,460
like it's very smart.
People were telling us that that's very 

1960
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:19,310
possible.
And so we should probably start 

1961
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,310
listening to them.
Well,

1962
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,310
it is possible.
Of course it's possible.

1963
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,810
I think we could be a new life form.
I mean,

1964
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,900
I really do believe that.

1965
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:26,930
I think we're either probably going to 
be augmented by these creations and you 

1966
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:31,521
know,
we're gonna choose to take on new body 

1967
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:33,120
parts that function much better than the
body parts we have now,

1968
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,070
or we're,
you know,

1969
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:40,130
essentially laboring to create some 
thing that's going to surpass us that,

1970
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:44,470
that absolutely could be at this idea 
that it's artificial to say,

1971
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,660
well,
it's right there.

1972
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:48,030
It's real.
Like if it's a life form,

1973
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,260
oh,
it's artificial life.

1974
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,450
No,
it's electronic life.

1975
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,370
You know,
it's something that humans have created,

1976
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:56,160
but it's still life.
It doesn't like if you take a plant,

1977
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,000
right.
You know,

1978
01:22:57,001 --> 01:23:01,740
I was looking at these plants and they 
splice different plants together.

1979
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,530
Like they splice pistachios into 
Avocados.

1980
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:09,700
They have like the base of anodic,
avocado tree and pistachios are grown on

1981
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:10,420
the outside.
I'm like,

1982
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:12,360
what the fuck?
That's wild.

1983
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,560
I didn't know you could do that.
Yeah.

1984
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,850
Well is that artificial?
What is that?

1985
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,220
It seems like it's artificial life.
I mean,

1986
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:22,690
it seems like they've figured out some 
way to engineer things in a crude sense,

1987
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:28,100
you know,
by splicing and grafting and doing all 

1988
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:28,830
these different weird things to plants.
Well,

1989
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:31,090
that's it still life though,
right?

1990
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,500
It's still alive.
It's functional.

1991
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:35,150
And we,
we think of life as a boy,

1992
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:40,170
he has to have bones or blood or scales 
or fins says who zou says us and our 

1993
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:46,830
limited sort of vocabulary and are very,
very limited encyclopedia of variables 

1994
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,280
that we allow to,
to consider life.

1995
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:52,160
Yeah.
I think.

1996
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:57,161
I think you're right because we have to 
judge maybe life based on consciousness 

1997
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:59,830
instead of.
I'm not that a plant would have 

1998
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,811
consciousness,
but I think that's the kind of the 

1999
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:01,811
ethical questions we're going to start 
coming up with,

2000
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:03,170
with machines in the next 20 or 30 years
is,

2001
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,090
are you developing something?
It,

2002
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:06,980
there's actually a great.
I don't want to ruin it for you.

2003
01:24:06,981 --> 01:24:10,040
There's an amazing black mirror that 
kind of touches on this.

2004
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,570
It's called a,
I think it's called White Christmas.

2005
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,920
You should check it out if you have 
time.

2006
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:18,670
And uh,
Hamm is actually the main character in 

2007
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,471
it from admin and it,
the idea that like if something is 

2008
01:24:20,631 --> 01:24:25,631
conscious,
even if it's not real or even if it's 

2009
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:25,631
only in a computer,
um,

2010
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:27,110
what does that mean?
And what if the,

2011
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:32,170
what if it was trapped there,
what if it didn't have agency over its 

2012
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:35,351
life,
but it was still conscious and stuff 

2013
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:36,971
like that,
like you were messing with things that 

2014
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:38,531
we don't understand in this regard 
because even the word consciousness 

2015
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,110
doesn't really have a concrete 
definition.

2016
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,220
We could,
we don't even know what it is.

2017
01:24:40,221 --> 01:24:42,440
We are conscious,
my dogs conscious,

2018
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:47,530
but are they self conscious and,
and at what level of consciousness and 

2019
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:50,801
that's what makes us human.
So if we're going to implant that into 

2020
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:51,770
other machines,
even if they're just computers,

2021
01:24:51,771 --> 01:24:53,870
even if they're literally just running 
on an operating system,

2022
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:58,871
then then there are,
there are definitely gonna be ethical 

2023
01:24:58,871 --> 01:24:58,871
questions to ask,
I think.

2024
01:24:58,871 --> 01:25:02,030
Do you,
did you see that Google situation they 

2025
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:02,810
had were the two computers were 
communicating each other into a,

2026
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,350
with a language that they invent?

2027
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,300
I read about that.
Yeah.

2028
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:07,020
I saw,
I read a little bit about that,

2029
01:25:07,021 --> 01:25:07,340
but I don't know

2030
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,030
about it.
Yeah,

2031
01:25:08,031 --> 01:25:09,920
they shut it down.
Like what?

2032
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,650
Yeah,
it's horrifying,

2033
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,080
right?
It's happening so much quicker than.

2034
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:14,810
Yeah,
talk.

2035
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,200
I mean we,
we,

2036
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:21,201
we've envisioned these things is like 
skynet or the cylons or something like 

2037
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:24,271
that,
but I think it's gonna be much more 

2038
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:24,271
quaint.
Yeah,

2039
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:24,271
that's

2040
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:24,560
what they were very stunned by this and 
you know,

2041
01:25:24,561 --> 01:25:27,530
I saw somebody trying to diminishing it,
trying to diminish it,

2042
01:25:27,531 --> 01:25:28,380
and he was like,
well,

2043
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,200
it's just ones and Zeros.
It's just like,

2044
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:31,550
what they're doing the communicating 
once a year.

2045
01:25:31,551 --> 01:25:32,390
I was like,
yeah,

2046
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:36,230
but they are talking,
exchanging information back and forth in

2047
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:39,680
a method that we don't understand and 
they do.

2048
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:43,520
How the fuck do they and why have they 
chosen talk to each other.

2049
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,600
And is this like one,
you know,

2050
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:48,890
you have like a science fiction movie at
the beginning of the movie.

2051
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:53,460
You have these engineers sitting around 
and the engineer's going on,

2052
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:54,560
Mike,
Mike,

2053
01:25:54,561 --> 01:25:57,620
come here and look at this real quick.
They're talking to each other.

2054
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,590
What do you mean the target to each 
other that?

2055
01:25:59,591 --> 01:25:59,890
Well,
there's,

2056
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,430
there's a language,
this is,

2057
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,360
see this,
see,

2058
01:26:02,361 --> 01:26:07,361
this is an here and here's the answer 
and here's the response to the answer 

2059
01:26:07,361 --> 01:26:09,650
and here they have agreed upon this and 
now they've expanded their sentences,

2060
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:10,460
like,
shut it down.

2061
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,540
Just shut it down.
Just what,

2062
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:13,700
what do,
what do we do about this?

2063
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,780
Let's let it play out.
No,

2064
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,220
no,
let's shut it down.

2065
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:21,330
Let's talk about this.
And then they shut it down and it fades 

2066
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:21,330
to black.
Cut to smash.

2067
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:22,970
Cut.
Like you see a new time to 20,

2068
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:26,480
34.
And it's some Dystopian Mad Max plucking

2069
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:31,481
world and robot.
People are running down the street 

2070
01:26:31,481 --> 01:26:33,140
chasing after biological people wanting 
to use them for fuel.

2071
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:34,410
Well,
it's interesting.

2072
01:26:34,411 --> 01:26:35,940
It's interesting because there are 
different,

2073
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:41,150
um,
there are different reasons why a robot 

2074
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:41,150
or a machine might turn on you,
right?

2075
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:45,151
Like I,
I think the cylons were interesting 

2076
01:26:45,151 --> 01:26:45,151
because they turned because they were 
enslaved,

2077
01:26:45,151 --> 01:26:45,410
right?
So that was,

2078
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,790
there was vengeance,
which is a human quality by the way.

2079
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:51,060
An animal doesn't really understand 
vengeance,

2080
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,130
but a robots do do.
Yeah.

2081
01:26:53,131 --> 01:26:58,131
Well,
I guess about higher primates or 

2082
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:58,131
whatever,
I might understand a retaliatory kind of

2083
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,430
thing,
but generally this is a human quality,

2084
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,550
right?
And um,

2085
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:02,580
what's a primate primary?
Primary quality.

2086
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:04,920
And uh,
so there's that,

2087
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:08,490
but so there's like this enslavement,
retaliation kind of thing going on.

2088
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,920
But then there's the very like,
um,

2089
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:13,470
what I always find fascinating,
and I think this is more what skynet was

2090
01:27:13,471 --> 01:27:15,090
all about in terminator,
although I don't really remember,

2091
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:20,330
is the idea that if you look at,
if you look at the landscape of what's 

2092
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:23,070
happening and you and you just remove 
the most inefficient part of it,

2093
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:23,820
it's the human.

2094
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:29,180
Like in other words,
I'm acting as they are machines like 

2095
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:29,180
this.
This doesn't make any sense.

2096
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:33,351
This makes our processing slower.
This particular component needs to be 

2097
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:36,441
removed.
So there's a very logical reason why 

2098
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:36,441
they would go after you to.
I think it's,

2099
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:39,980
it is the stuff of Scifi,
but like so many things that start in 

2100
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:39,980
Saifai,
it ends up bleeding into,

2101
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:40,740
into real life.
And I think it's a.

2102
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,620
When I see people like Stephen Hawking,
Bill Gates,

2103
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:45,840
Elon Musk all talking about this,
I'm like,

2104
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:50,841
these are some of the smartest people 
that society has ever given us and I 

2105
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:50,841
think we might want to pay attention and
have some.

2106
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:52,500
I think what they want is some sort of 
congress,

2107
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:53,850
not,
not American Congress,

2108
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:58,851
but some sort of international coalition
that agrees this is what we're going to 

2109
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:02,631
do and this is how far will push the 
boundaries because I'm and I just don't 

2110
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:05,721
know that we'll get there before it's,
I don't want to say before it's too 

2111
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:05,721
late,
but before we have a,

2112
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:05,721
a scary situation.

2113
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:07,980
I mean and even from a mechanical 
situation,

2114
01:28:07,981 --> 01:28:10,970
what they're doing at Boston dynamics is
fucking horrifying.

2115
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,620
Crazy.
I look at the videos and I'm like,

2116
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,630
what the.
And there.

2117
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,840
It's so funny because some people had 
said in the past like if you see them 

2118
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,421
like they're,
they're using hockey sticks a lot to 

2119
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:23,421
like beat them or like take like knock 
something out of their hands and stuff.

2120
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:27,981
And I'm like,
these are the videos they're going to 

2121
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:29,151
show.
They're going to show them in their and 

2122
01:28:29,151 --> 01:28:29,151
their military camps when they're 
turning on humanity.

2123
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,880
There's so many different verses of them
they haven't looked at.

2124
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,330
They looked like cheetahs.
They have them that looked like dogs.

2125
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,340
I mean,
here's look like people consistently.

2126
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,720
Yeah.
And these guys are just constantly 

2127
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:44,720
working on these things too and 
constantly improve.

2128
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,010
Where is Boston dynamics?
Is it.

2129
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:51,020
I think it's,
I think it's in Cambridge because I 

2130
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,020
think a lot of people,
I think a lot of people at,

2131
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:54,981
uh,
mit might migrate there and I think 

2132
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:54,981
Google owned them,
but I think they've divested,

2133
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,390
if I remember correctly.
That is so wild.

2134
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:02,780
Yeah.
And the ones where they like knock them 

2135
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:02,780
over and they get up.
Yeah.

2136
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:02,780
The kid.

2137
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:02,780
That's what.
Yeah.

2138
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,650
Like because the gyroscope is going I 
guess.

2139
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:05,090
And it's.

2140
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,920
Yeah.
Gyroscopes are fascinating,

2141
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:13,980
you know,
just something that can sort of self 

2142
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:17,101
balance this.
They're going to show them in like the 

2143
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:17,710
hype them up in their propaganda.
Yeah.

2144
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,280
It's fucking amazing.
It is,

2145
01:29:21,281 --> 01:29:22,180
it is amazing.
I mean these are,

2146
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,420
these are so smart,
these people that do that.

2147
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:31,500
I managed to do this.
Don't you want to pull them aside and 

2148
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:31,500
go,
hey man,

2149
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:31,500
what's the fucking end game?
Yeah,

2150
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,710
like they're all want to play with 
robot.

2151
01:29:32,711 --> 01:29:36,340
You can't kick over.
Come on dude.

2152
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,680
It brings up,
um,

2153
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:43,420
it,
it brings up how will we fight wars in 

2154
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:43,420
the future we'll be doing with this 100 
percent.

2155
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:48,420
Yeah.
Especially for fight some war with some 

2156
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,090
sort of a primitive culture.
I like how they have unbalanced with all

2157
01:29:49,091 --> 01:29:54,091
these packs and creates incredible,
like highlight clip of all the times 

2158
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:55,490
they've abused the robot.
Is that what this is?

2159
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:57,280
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2160
01:29:57,281 --> 01:30:00,580
The robot general right now has this 
plane behind him and as he's talking and

2161
01:30:00,581 --> 01:30:05,581
he's like,
remember what they've done to your 

2162
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:05,581
ancestors will,
they're saying abuse,

2163
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:08,440
but they're checking tolerances.
You know the scene to relax.

2164
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:13,220
This is how we made you so awesome.
You've dumb fuck you.

2165
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,040
Stupid perks.
He can't even walk on ice.

2166
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,570
Now.
The interesting thing,

2167
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,660
the interesting thing to me about this 
is,

2168
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:21,510
and I don't know if you feel,
but I kind of do it,

2169
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:26,530
like when they're tripping and falling,
I have this feeling of like I have this 

2170
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:26,530
feeling of like,
yeah,

2171
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:26,530
we're like,
oh,

2172
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,350
you know what I mean?
Look at this poor guy.

2173
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,570
Yeah,
you feel bad for him.

2174
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,730
He can't even kick this one over.
Wow.

2175
01:30:33,731 --> 01:30:36,400
That thing is stout.
Yeah.

2176
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:39,760
I mean,
so they have multiple different models.

2177
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:42,430
The video name is funny,
by the way,

2178
01:30:42,431 --> 01:30:42,700
Jamie.

2179
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,060
That's literally to every time Boston 
dynamics has abused the robot.

2180
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:52,380
It's not abuse you dummies.
It's fucking tested because how they 

2181
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:52,660
find out of that nerd that's kicking it 
over.

2182
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,560
Go back to that guy.
Oh,

2183
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:56,890
that thing sucks.
Go back to that one guy that was kicking

2184
01:30:56,891 --> 01:30:57,370
it.
Look at him.

2185
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,560
He's like,
looks like he just came back and 

2186
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,401
everybody don't feel back.
Go back to him so he could see him do 

2187
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:06,340
it.
Watching fucking piece of shit.

2188
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:08,730
He's like,
look like.

2189
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:13,860
He always wanted to kick some butt 
projecting like even with this little 

2190
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,860
tiny short steps like you seemed awkward
before.

2191
01:31:14,861 --> 01:31:17,410
He kicks it.
I'm going to kick it nano.

2192
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:19,330
Look at this one.
Oh,

2193
01:31:19,331 --> 01:31:24,331
it's balancing on one leg and then 
hitting it with a 20 pound medicine 

2194
01:31:24,331 --> 01:31:24,331
ball.

2195
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,250
Wow.
Yeah.

2196
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,670
We're,
we're in for a weird hundred years.

2197
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:29,630
Yes.
And that's what I'm saying.

2198
01:31:29,631 --> 01:31:32,360
I hope that we get to see some because I
think it's going to get fucking crazy.

2199
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:32,870
Yeah,
no,

2200
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,110
there's no doubt.
It is.

2201
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:39,160
No doubt it is.
It's just like how crazy and what's 

2202
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,060
going to be the issues that were in the 
have to confront sentient life and,

2203
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,830
and,
and also the real question is,

2204
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:48,670
will it have any motivation to advance 
the idea is that the real fear is that 

2205
01:31:49,491 --> 01:31:54,491
these things are going to be so hyper 
intelligent that they're going to be 

2206
01:31:54,491 --> 01:31:55,970
able to create a much better version of 
themselves fairly quickly.

2207
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:59,950
Like as soon as you give them autonomy 
and as soon as they're sentient,

2208
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:00,170
you're,

2209
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,250
you're going to say,
oh,

2210
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,980
okay,
make a better one.

2211
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:06,160
Make it better with the new.
And this is you guys fucked up here.

2212
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:10,420
Like why have all these shitty 
connections and let's do it this way and

2213
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:15,421
let's do it that way and let's connect 
to each other through you guys use in 

2214
01:32:15,421 --> 01:32:18,841
Wifi version six this week,
like what we need is this new form of 

2215
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:24,301
Wifi that it uses the particles in the 
atmosphere as transistors and and sends 

2216
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:29,530
back and forth to each other through a 
highly charged signal and like what?

2217
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:31,810
Yeah,
it's how'd you figure that out?

2218
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,310
And then next thing you know,
but they,

2219
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:38,430
they're not going to have ego.
They're not going to have this desire 

2220
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:41,881
for and this is.
This is a real underlying aspect.

2221
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:47,220
The motivation of the human race,
the desire to recreate and to reproduce 

2222
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:50,140
like this desire for sex and this desire
to.

2223
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:52,600
It's one of the reasons why people 
accomplish things.

2224
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:57,630
They don't just accomplish things 
because they have this desire to see 

2225
01:32:57,630 --> 01:33:02,250
what happens when they put these two 
things together and what's the result 

2226
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:02,650
they want.
They want fame,

2227
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,800
they want status,
they want power,

2228
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:11,010
they want money,
and they want all these things because 

2229
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:11,470
they want to be more sexually 
attractive.

2230
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:13,690
That's a big part of the motivation of 
men,

2231
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,610
you know,
so it's a weird thing.

2232
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:19,000
I mean,
that's one of the reasons why Jeff Bezos

2233
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:24,001
doesn't just retire.
Why doesn't Jeff Bezos when he just 

2234
01:33:24,001 --> 01:33:24,850
became the richest man in the world,
how the fuck you going to spend $90,

2235
01:33:24,851 --> 01:33:29,650
million dollars homes to cash out,
cash out and just chillax forever.

2236
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:34,980
You know,
just walk around with a big red wig on 

2237
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:34,980
so nobody knows who you are and just 
live like a king,

2238
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:40,340
like go wherever you want,
fuck all this work and you're waking up 

2239
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,861
in the morning freaking out about Amazon
and making sure everything gets 

2240
01:33:43,861 --> 01:33:47,581
delivered in 30 minutes or less like a 
fucking pizza instead just live.

2241
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:48,790
But no,
no way.

2242
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:51,550
Jeff Bezos has a fucking supermodel 
girlfriend now.

2243
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:56,551
He's bawling.
Every good jumped from one gold 

2244
01:33:56,551 --> 01:33:56,551
Lamborghini to the next one.
I mean,

2245
01:33:56,551 --> 01:33:57,670
you start thinking,
I want more.

2246
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:58,830
I want this,
I want that whole.

2247
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,700
What is the motivation to do something 
like that?

2248
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:05,701
Where's it coming from in men?
I think a lot of it comes from this 

2249
01:34:05,701 --> 01:34:06,110
need.
I mean,

2250
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:08,230
I think if you brought it down to the 
base level,

2251
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:13,231
it's this weird biological need to 
reproduce or to spread your genes or to 

2252
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:17,551
be to stand out as something 
particularly impressive your peacocking 

2253
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:21,760
for,
for females and a lot of ways,

2254
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:22,050
right?

2255
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:22,720
Yeah.
It's,

2256
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:23,730
it's,
there is,

2257
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:26,090
there has been a stud.
I know.

2258
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:29,880
It is amazing to me where I'm like,
I dream every day about how I can retire

2259
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:34,230
as quickly as possible and then these 
guys that have the means to do it don't.

2260
01:34:34,231 --> 01:34:35,910
But there isn't an internal drive with 
guys.

2261
01:34:35,911 --> 01:34:40,911
I mean you don't found a company like 
Amazon unless there's something special 

2262
01:34:40,911 --> 01:34:40,911
about you and I don't mean that as a 
derogatory thing either.

2263
01:34:40,911 --> 01:34:42,750
Like there's something about a person.

2264
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,480
Ironic is it's,
it was originally founded to sell books.

2265
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:50,670
It just was a very simple site.
Have you ever seen the original Amazon?

2266
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:56,060
Yeah.
You can go to the wayback machine and 

2267
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:56,060
look at all that.
Yeah.

2268
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:56,060
To

2269
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,100
really simple site to sell books and I 
remember when Amazon starts

2270
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,240
selling other things,
I was like,

2271
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,070
what are they doing that they sell 
books?

2272
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:04,220
Why are you selling like fucking kids 
toys?

2273
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:09,670
Yeah.
They moved into music and then I think 

2274
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:09,670
they'd been to,
they started expanding from there.

2275
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:09,670
It's funny though.
You brought up the,

2276
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:09,860
uh,
you know,

2277
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:12,080
the robots making better versions of 
themselves.

2278
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:12,440
I mean,
that's,

2279
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:13,430
that's,
you know,

2280
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:18,460
not to be nerdy about,
but that's exactly what happens in 

2281
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:18,460
Battlestar.
Like what comes,

2282
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:18,650
what comes back,
the fight the humans is not what left,

2283
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:20,000
right.
And uh,

2284
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,680
because they just were like,
we're not good enough.

2285
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:26,681
We can make ourselves better and made 
those killer ones that looked like 

2286
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:26,681
people,
right?

2287
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:29,800
Yeah.
The number that number's wherever they 

2288
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:29,800
call them.
And then even like,

2289
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,081
um,
and even the centurions look better or 

2290
01:35:32,081 --> 01:35:33,970
more effective in their soldiers.
And there's that one episode about the 

2291
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:33,970
raiders,
which is their ships.

2292
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,330
They have these autonomous ships that 
are alive,

2293
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,510
that are fighter ships and uh,
and uh,

2294
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:42,530
how they,
one of them is named scar and he keeps 

2295
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:43,940
having these experiences.
Like he's really a good fighter pilot or

2296
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:45,500
whatever,
but he's alive.

2297
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:48,350
And then it's like,
it's really good fucking show.

2298
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:50,810
Goddamn.
Bring it back.

2299
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,840
If you guys out there,
you have such a great audience that 

2300
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:55,840
would,
oh my God,

2301
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,240
you go check it out the numbers or spike
on that Netflix,

2302
01:35:56,241 --> 01:35:57,860
they'll see it and then they'll be like,
oh,

2303
01:35:57,861 --> 01:35:59,930
maybe will be if,
if folks,

2304
01:35:59,931 --> 01:36:02,050
if you haven't seen it,
I'm telling you it is a.

2305
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:05,470
and I think it was psi Phi that made it.
It was like a [inaudible],

2306
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:10,480
like coming to kind of like that.
It was a legitimate thing that they did 

2307
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:10,760
and it was very overlooked because 
people are like,

2308
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:12,970
wow,
it's on scifinder battle's car,

2309
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:16,160
battlestar Galactica,
but it was really well done.

2310
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,420
Science fiction drama and then yeah,
Edward James almost was in it too.

2311
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,390
And that woman that played starbuck.
What is her name?

2312
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:24,930
Katie.
Katie sackhoff.

2313
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:26,930
Yeah,
she was fucking great.

2314
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,470
Yeah,
she was great.

2315
01:36:27,471 --> 01:36:28,730
There were,
there was a lot of great actors,

2316
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:30,650
a lot of great,
interesting characters in there.

2317
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:32,300
Um,
you know,

2318
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,010
uh,
even characters that really made you not

2319
01:36:34,011 --> 01:36:34,460
like them.
Like,

2320
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:36,080
um,
uh,

2321
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:38,150
what's Nakita?
He's the guy,

2322
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:40,490
the guy to the guy to the,
to the right next to her.

2323
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:43,250
Uh,
the professor really hate him.

2324
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,630
Um,
yeah,

2325
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:46,310
you hit skies,
tar.

2326
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,760
Yeah,
there was a lot of people that you hate 

2327
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:51,760
it,
but God damn was a good show.

2328
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:51,760
Yeah,
it was great.

2329
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:51,760
Yeah.
And a lot of these,

2330
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,060
I don't see many of these people in 
anything today.

2331
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:54,020
I mean obviously,
uh,

2332
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,670
James Edward almost as a famous actor,
but otherwise I don't,

2333
01:36:56,671 --> 01:36:57,870
I don't see them sprinkling anyone.

2334
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:59,660
Not that I watch a lot of things.
Yeah,

2335
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,520
I know man.
I always wonder about that.

2336
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:05,540
When you see someone's in some gigantic 
hit show and then they kind of vanish,

2337
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:06,850
you know,
like where,

2338
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,520
where did you go?
Yeah,

2339
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:13,870
maybe,
maybe they wanted to go do something 

2340
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:13,870
else or maybe they can't get,
you know,

2341
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:13,910
I would assume that they all could kind 
of write their own their own way.

2342
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:18,970
You think that.
But I think that also people get 

2343
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:18,970
pigeonholed into a character.
You know,

2344
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:23,201
there's certain characters where you see
someone and they're on the Sopranos and 

2345
01:37:23,201 --> 01:37:26,090
from then on there,
Christopher moltisanti forever.

2346
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:29,840
I mean that's who he is,
right forever.

2347
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:33,200
And it's hard to break out of that for a
lot of people.

2348
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,280
The one person that managed to get out 
of there was a um,

2349
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:37,070
uh,
the,

2350
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:38,410
the wife,
I can't think of her name.

2351
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,180
Can you talk?
Go?

2352
01:37:39,181 --> 01:37:40,790
Yeah.
She was obviously big before that too in

2353
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:45,791
some things,
but she didn't nurse Jackie and all 

2354
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:47,321
those kinds of things.
Some people get managed to break out of 

2355
01:37:47,321 --> 01:37:47,321
that,
but you're right.

2356
01:37:47,321 --> 01:37:47,321
Did when you were on news radio and 
stuff,

2357
01:37:47,321 --> 01:37:48,180
did you find when you,
when you went to,

2358
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:51,140
to casting or anything like that?
I never really acted again.

2359
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,910
So yeah,
I guess you found your way into fear,

2360
01:37:52,911 --> 01:37:54,410
fear factor and stuff like that so.
Well.

2361
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:56,010
But you never even to do anything after 
that.

2362
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,950
I was offered some stuff that was 
terrible.

2363
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:03,650
Like there some sitcoms that just came 
my way and you know,

2364
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,790
you read the scripts and they were just 
there.

2365
01:38:05,950 --> 01:38:10,950
The real problem was that news radio was
so good that the curse of being with 

2366
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:17,020
that talented cast and amazing writing 
and amazing production and,

2367
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:20,850
and also nobody knew about us.
Like when we were on the air,

2368
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:24,840
like people that hear about news radio,
most of what people heard about was from

2369
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:28,140
news radio's reruns.
Like when we went into syndication,

2370
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:33,141
then we started playing.
That's when people start really getting 

2371
01:38:33,141 --> 01:38:35,550
into news radio news radio really found 
a big audience after it was canceled,

2372
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,230
which is ironic.
Yeah,

2373
01:38:37,231 --> 01:38:42,231
it's unfortunate,
but it was good because the show didn't 

2374
01:38:42,231 --> 01:38:44,440
have anybody fucking with it very much 
like we didn't we.

2375
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
It was a weird show in that regard.
It was not a hit like that show was not 

2376
01:38:50,221 --> 01:38:51,550
a hit show.
While I was on the arrows.

2377
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:54,030
My friend Lou Martin,
who is one of the writers,

2378
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:57,930
he would wear a different t shirt.
He would come down to the table,

2379
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:02,931
reads in a different t shirt with a 
number on it based on what our rankings 

2380
01:39:02,931 --> 01:39:04,020
was and the ratings,
and he came down once and it said,

2381
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,220
number 88.
I go,

2382
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:06,930
fuck dude,
we're number 88.

2383
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,880
And he was like,
oh my God,

2384
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:14,070
we're getting canceled.
And they start thinking,

2385
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:19,100
fuck,
why did I get that lease in that 

2386
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:19,100
apartment?
I'm doomed now.

2387
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:19,100
My sister Dana was a big fan of the 
show.

2388
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:23,691
I remember when it was on because I'm 
the youngest by far of all my siblings 

2389
01:39:23,691 --> 01:39:24,150
and um,
so she,

2390
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:29,151
I think it,
I think it's a little surreal that I'm 

2391
01:39:29,151 --> 01:39:29,151
on the show actually for her,
but I,

2392
01:39:29,151 --> 01:39:29,151
I,
yeah,

2393
01:39:29,151 --> 01:39:33,230
I think it's still on syndication.
I feel like I've seen it or maybe maybe 

2394
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,030
maybe like those deep channels maybe 
like maybe I'm trying to think some

2395
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:40,030
things.
What does that one down there or the 

2396
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:40,030
space one,
like see that's.

2397
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:40,160
See the woman meet with a white jumpsuit
on Jamie.

2398
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:45,490
See,
that's a perfect example of how fucking 

2399
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:47,471
weird they were.
They did these weird ones where we were 

2400
01:39:47,471 --> 01:39:47,900
on.
That's not it.

2401
01:39:47,901 --> 01:39:49,910
That's not the same one.
That's not the space one.

2402
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,820
We did one where we were in space for 
some reason,

2403
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,510
but it was the same.
Was the same fucking newsroom,

2404
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:59,030
but the newsroom was taking place in 
space.

2405
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:04,780
They did a lot of weird shit.
They did one where we were completely 

2406
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:04,780
underwater.
Um,

2407
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:08,831
we did like a titanic episode where we,
we literally filmed the show in waist 

2408
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:13,931
high water and we're on a ship and we 
more like old school Lee close like from

2409
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:15,970
people that,
you know,

2410
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:21,060
from the titanic days,
it's just an extremely go to that 

2411
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,210
picture down there,
go back to that,

2412
01:40:22,211 --> 01:40:27,211
that scroll up,
scroll up with a picture of the cast 

2413
01:40:27,211 --> 01:40:27,860
when I'm wearing sunglasses over there 
were at some.

2414
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:31,280
That's uh,
that was when we went to the,

2415
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,490
um,
the emmy's after Phil was murdered.

2416
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:40,390
And uh,
he still lost in the emmys and day for 

2417
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:43,160
parents to me right after they gave it 
to the guy from frazier.

2418
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:46,470
He goes,
what the fuck does he have to do to win?

2419
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:55,200
Know,
it was such a hilarious moment where me 

2420
01:40:55,891 --> 01:40:58,630
and me and Dave were just laughing to 
each other.

2421
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:01,000
It's just strange times,
man.

2422
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,520
It's weird to go back and look at 
yourself to from,

2423
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:06,700
you know,
whatever it was 20 years ago.

2424
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,710
It's a strange.
Would you ever,

2425
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:14,100
do you have any interest in ever doing 
something like this again or you never 

2426
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:14,100
know?
I have no desire.

2427
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,190
It's a lot of work.
It's,

2428
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:17,170
this is so easy.
I'm so fucking spoiled.

2429
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,970
Come down,
sit down with people like you.

2430
01:41:18,971 --> 01:41:20,650
Have a nice conversation,
talk,

2431
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:23,290
talk about interesting things that are 
happening right now.

2432
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,910
It's fun,
you know.

2433
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:25,720
Um,
and not that,

2434
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:27,550
that wasn't fun.
It was really fun,

2435
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:29,800
but it's somebody else's thing and it's 
a lot of work,

2436
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:34,050
you know,
like it took a lot away from my standup.

2437
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,460
It took a lot away from doing other 
things.

2438
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:38,170
You know,
when I started doing,

2439
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:43,830
I started doing UFC commentary back then
too in [inaudible] 97 is when news radio

2440
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:47,510
was on the air.
I was actually the interviewer,

2441
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:52,530
the post-fight interviewer and um,
they would say they would treat me 

2442
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:55,450
literally like I was going off to do 
porn.

2443
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,580
They were like,
why are you doing this?

2444
01:41:57,581 --> 01:42:02,581
Like you're going to fly to Alabama to 
work for a cage fighting organs and 

2445
01:42:02,581 --> 01:42:03,310
you're a fucked up person.
And I was like,

2446
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:05,650
this is the sport of the future.
I know you're crazy.

2447
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:07,150
You saw something.
A lot of people didn't.

2448
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:08,080
I think so.
Good.

2449
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,010
I don't know why man.
Well,

2450
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:13,780
honestly,
I probably didn't really see something.

2451
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:18,250
I just saw what I liked and I,
for whatever reason,

2452
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,740
good or bad,
there's me 19,

2453
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:23,710
97 for whatever reason,
good or bad.

2454
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:27,310
I've always a hundred percent trusted my
instincts.

2455
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,080
Like I,
when I,

2456
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:30,400
when I like something,
I go,

2457
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:32,230
well,
I've got to go do that because it's what

2458
01:42:32,231 --> 01:42:35,530
I've always done.
So that's what's led me through my life.

2459
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:39,130
Like if I went back and I've looked at 
my,

2460
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:43,990
my decision to get obsessed with martial
arts or my decision to quit all that and

2461
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:48,991
get obsessed with standup comedy,
my decision for they made all the 

2462
01:42:48,991 --> 01:42:50,590
decisions that I've made have all been 
insanely impulsive,

2463
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:52,360
passionate,
driven,

2464
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,320
um,
derided by everyone around me.

2465
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:57,130
Like,
what?

2466
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,120
You're going to do,
what?

2467
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:00,280
But they ultimately,
it all worked well.

2468
01:43:00,281 --> 01:43:05,281
It's how your,
your story so interesting to me because 

2469
01:43:05,281 --> 01:43:07,441
you have legitimately large pieces of 
your audience that know you for totally 

2470
01:43:07,441 --> 01:43:09,190
different things.
The guys that watch UFC and see you kind

2471
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:09,880
of do,
you know,

2472
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:14,910
in that sphere.
And then you have the guys that watch 

2473
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:17,041
the show and or listen to the show and 
you have obviously people that love you 

2474
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:17,041
as a standup comic.

2475
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:17,860
And then obviously the crossover between
all of those.

2476
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:22,861
So you've managed to create,
you've managed to create like three 

2477
01:43:22,861 --> 01:43:23,530
different viable lives that all 
intermix.

2478
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,670
It's pretty cool.
Well,

2479
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:29,140
the UFC thing,
it's very strange because whether or not

2480
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:34,090
anybody a agrees with my opinions on 
life outside of it,

2481
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:39,660
they know that when I'm doing commentary
I am doing my absolute best to honor 

2482
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:45,750
what's happening inside the octagon and 
I have a deep knowledge and 

2483
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,250
understanding of what's going on.
Like this isn't like.

2484
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,290
Do you remember when,
I don't know if you remember this,

2485
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:52,010
but Dennis Miller used to do

2486
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,330
Monday night football.
I do remember that.

2487
01:43:53,331 --> 01:43:54,360
Yeah.
People fucking hate.

2488
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:54,860
Yeah,
it was,

2489
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:55,340
it was.
Yeah,

2490
01:43:55,341 --> 01:43:56,070
I remember.
Yeah,

2491
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:58,250
it was so mad.
There was so mad at him.

2492
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:02,300
And this was before I think I was doing 
fear fat or before I was doing,

2493
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:07,350
um,
the UFC or maybe I was doing the post 

2494
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:11,141
fight interviews,
but I hadn't done the commentary yet 

2495
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:11,141
either one.
But I was like,

2496
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:16,060
you can't force funny into something 
where people want to watch the thing,

2497
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:21,970
you know,
like you can't force funny into like 

2498
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:22,050
alien the movie alien,
right?

2499
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,540
Like,
it's not supposed to be funny.

2500
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:28,570
The thing is this is a dramatic,
horrifying science fiction movie.

2501
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,560
You don't force funny into something 
like that.

2502
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,860
And that's what I felt like Dennis 
Miller is like,

2503
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:36,310
this is just like backwards sharp had,
you know,

2504
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:38,330
he's like one liner,
one liner,

2505
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:40,230
like that's his thing,
you know,

2506
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:40,970
that's what he did.

2507
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:44,780
But I never did that.
I always just did commentary.

2508
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:47,780
Like if you heard me do commentary,
unless something happens,

2509
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,540
it's fucked up in,
in,

2510
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:53,000
inside the octagon and I have to go,
what the fuck is this?

2511
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:58,150
And then I go on a rant about something.
People would have no idea that I was 

2512
01:44:58,150 --> 01:44:58,150
funny at all.
Right,

2513
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:02,111
well,
and that's the kind of nurturing those 

2514
01:45:02,111 --> 01:45:02,111
different audiences.
Right.

2515
01:45:02,111 --> 01:45:02,111
And,
and,

2516
01:45:02,111 --> 01:45:02,270
but I wasn't,
I never thought about that way.

2517
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:05,150
It's not like a concerted effort to 
nurture anything.

2518
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:10,540
It's just the UFC in specific is it's 
about,

2519
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:13,880
first of all,
it's about getting out of my own way and

2520
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:16,850
honoring what's happening.
It's like you have to kind of honor.

2521
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:20,120
You've got to think when a guy like 
there's a big fight this weekend,

2522
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:21,620
right?
Tj dillashaw is gonna fight.

2523
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:26,621
Cody Garbrandt.
It's probably the biggest bantamweight 

2524
01:45:26,621 --> 01:45:26,621
fight of all time.

2525
01:45:26,621 --> 01:45:27,440
When those two guys get into the 
octagon,

2526
01:45:27,441 --> 01:45:32,150
you're dealing with the consequences of 
the history of an entire division.

2527
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:37,160
The probably the two best champions in 
that division going at it.

2528
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:42,190
The two of the three best champions,
dominick Cruz being the other one going 

2529
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:43,490
at it in this historical match up like 
there's a lot.

2530
01:45:43,491 --> 01:45:46,780
You have a lot of responsibility and 
they have to think about it that way.

2531
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,890
It's not about you at all,
right?

2532
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:49,210
No,
I think.

2533
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:51,230
I think it's A.
I think it's,

2534
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:56,280
it's,
it's interesting because I feel like 

2535
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:56,480
I've actually been challenged in that 
same way.

2536
01:45:56,481 --> 01:46:01,481
You know,
because I came up as a gaming 

2537
01:46:01,481 --> 01:46:03,341
commentator and Dennis Miller.
I think a lot of the reason people were 

2538
01:46:03,341 --> 01:46:07,031
kind of concerned about him too is that 
he would tell political jokes or bring 

2539
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:10,540
political things in,
which was unheard of at the time on 

2540
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:10,540
Monday night football around football 
and the NFL generally,

2541
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:11,900
and now it's part,
part and parcel with the NFL.

2542
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,140
I'm a huge football fan,
so I'm,

2543
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:14,750
I'm bearing witness to it every,
every week.

2544
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:16,130
Um,
but I,

2545
01:46:16,131 --> 01:46:20,960
as a gaming commentator I've often found
some difficulty in keeping out shades of

2546
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:25,430
that shades of politics and kind of 
social commentary and what I did as well

2547
01:46:25,431 --> 01:46:27,320
and that all that's certainly alienated 
some people,

2548
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,690
but I also think it engendered.
I'm like,

2549
01:46:29,691 --> 01:46:34,691
wow,
this guy's honest and just tells you 

2550
01:46:34,691 --> 01:46:34,691
exactly what he thinks as well.
So I was,

2551
01:46:34,691 --> 01:46:34,720
I was able to benefit from that,
but I also don't have the audience that,

2552
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:39,850
that you have as well.
And I think keeping it structured and 

2553
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:39,850
separated,
this is wise,

2554
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:39,850
you know what I mean?
It is sometimes,

2555
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:44,651
but it's also sometimes wise to just be 
yourself and that way you never have to 

2556
01:46:44,651 --> 01:46:45,620
worry if people like you for who you 
are.

2557
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:48,470
If you pretend to be someone else,
like that's like,

2558
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:50,220
okay,
I hate to bring

2559
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:55,250
him up again,
but cosby is one of the grossest parts 

2560
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:58,581
about it.
We had it in our head that this guy was 

2561
01:46:58,581 --> 01:47:00,170
this squeaky clean,
you know,

2562
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:05,550
Middle America,
perfect example of this ethical,

2563
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,530
moral guy.
Meanwhile I was a fucking rapist.

2564
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,310
You know,
when you're around something like that,

2565
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,700
you appreciate someone who's just 
themselves,

2566
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,110
you know,
I mean,

2567
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,900
obviously you don't appreciate him if he
himself is a rapist.

2568
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:21,120
Right.
That's maybe a bad example,

2569
01:47:21,121 --> 01:47:22,440
but,
but what,

2570
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:23,940
like,
what do you define yourself as?

2571
01:47:23,941 --> 01:47:26,040
Do you think of yourself as a 
libertarian?

2572
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,510
Are you a Republican?

2573
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,410
No,
I was a republican.

2574
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:30,840
I left the party after trump won the 
nomination.

2575
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:31,990
You like enough?
Well,

2576
01:47:31,991 --> 01:47:32,670
because I can't,
I can't,

2577
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:37,671
I couldn't stand them.
I consider myself a moderate republican 

2578
01:47:37,671 --> 01:47:40,720
or a moderate conservative.
Don't you think it's interesting that 

2579
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,070
trump was a democrat his whole life?
Yes.

2580
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,350
I think he's just an opportunist and,
and,

2581
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:45,420
and I think the Republicans wanted to 
just win.

2582
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:50,800
Um,
but I also think he had 17 people in 

2583
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,151
that field or 16 other people in that 
field and he was winning primaries and 

2584
01:47:53,151 --> 01:47:53,700
caucuses with 35 percent of the vote.
So,

2585
01:47:54,090 --> 01:47:59,090
um,
and then he obviously I have no problem 

2586
01:47:59,090 --> 01:47:59,090
with the electoral college,
but he didn't win the popular vote.

2587
01:47:59,090 --> 01:47:59,120
And so I,
I,

2588
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,690
so to me I was like,
I,

2589
01:48:00,691 --> 01:48:02,130
I,
I identify as conservative.

2590
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:04,710
I feel like the word libertarian has 
been totally bastardized.

2591
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:07,650
Like we were talking about words that 
don't mean anything anymore where people

2592
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:09,420
almost look at libertarianism is like 
anarchy.

2593
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,490
And,
and to me,

2594
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:13,170
I'm like,
I'm a social libertarian.

2595
01:48:13,171 --> 01:48:14,430
I always call myself a social 
libertarian.

2596
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:16,620
I believe that drugs should be 
decriminalized.

2597
01:48:16,621 --> 01:48:17,820
I think that,
um,

2598
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:22,880
you know,
obviously this stage and be really 

2599
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:22,880
involved in litigating who isn't getting
married.

2600
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:27,411
I think if you want to have a polygamous
relationship and everyone's cool with 

2601
01:48:27,411 --> 01:48:27,411
that,
that's fine.

2602
01:48:27,411 --> 01:48:28,530
All of that kind of stuff.
A prostitution should be legal.

2603
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:31,410
I think all of that is true.
But from a governmental standpoint,

2604
01:48:31,411 --> 01:48:33,160
I think that the government has a place,
um,

2605
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:36,990
I think that the government can do 
positive things that only the government

2606
01:48:36,991 --> 01:48:37,960
can do.
Um,

2607
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:38,880
and so I,
I'm,

2608
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,460
I'm also a protectionist and stuff.
So I also don't,

2609
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:44,160
I also don't believe in a lot of 
libertarian mantra.

2610
01:48:44,161 --> 01:48:45,860
A lot of people call me a libertarian,
but I,

2611
01:48:45,861 --> 01:48:46,770
I don't,
I don't,

2612
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,180
I haven't called myself that in a long 
time.

2613
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:50,490
What makes you lean towards 
conservatism?

2614
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:53,070
A conservatism to me is simply,
um,

2615
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:58,370
uh,
the idea that government shouldn't be 

2616
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:01,161
involved where it doesn't need to be 
involved if there is no justification 

2617
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:01,161
for it.
So,

2618
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:01,520
so if someone

2619
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,270
to you,
they wouldn't think conservative.

2620
01:49:03,271 --> 01:49:06,000
You've got an earring,
you got tattoos and a young guy.

2621
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:09,690
You're not a hipster.
I wouldn't say a hipster,

2622
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:11,620
but your millennial less.
Yeah,

2623
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,370
I am.
It was funny,

2624
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:15,050
I was listening to some guy talking 
about me,

2625
01:49:15,051 --> 01:49:16,370
I want of his political shows and he's 
like,

2626
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:19,010
and he presents his hip and I'm like,
I know what number.

2627
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:20,970
Yeah,
I present this hip anytime.

2628
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:22,480
That's not a bad idea too.
But,

2629
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:23,270
but the,
uh,

2630
01:49:23,271 --> 01:49:23,750
I was like,
I've never,

2631
01:49:23,751 --> 01:49:26,570
no one's ever called me hit before,
but yeah,

2632
01:49:26,571 --> 01:49:28,430
I didn't even a thing anymore.
Hipster,

2633
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:29,080
hipster.
Yeah.

2634
01:49:29,081 --> 01:49:29,960
I don't want this.
Your hip,

2635
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,010
I guess.
I mean,

2636
01:49:31,011 --> 01:49:36,011
I guess I don't,
I don't even really understand exactly 

2637
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:38,440
know a hipster when you see one,
but I still can't really tell you what 

2638
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:38,440
it,
what it means.

2639
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:38,440
You can see some of them,
man,

2640
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:38,600
for sure.
You see them coming.

2641
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:39,530
Yeah.
But the big,

2642
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:44,560
you know,
sometimes the big ads glasses and the 

2643
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:44,810
crazy out of a teaches on,
uh,

2644
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,850
but I,
I consider myself a conservative simply.

2645
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,030
I believe that the government is too 
big.

2646
01:49:49,130 --> 01:49:50,920
Um,
I think that the government doesn't need

2647
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:52,570
to be involved in everything that's 
involved in.

2648
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:57,870
Um,
and I think that the idea of 

2649
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:57,870
conservatism is simply inconsistent.
Um,

2650
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,810
I think the conservative position on,
on the web,

2651
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:04,860
a women's right to choose is pro choice.
I don't think it's prolife I think that 

2652
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:08,491
the conservative,
because it means that the government's 

2653
01:50:08,491 --> 01:50:08,491
not telling you what to do,
just as if it just,

2654
01:50:08,491 --> 01:50:10,660
as the government doesn't have the right
to have confiscatory taxes,

2655
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:12,550
just like the government doesn't have 
the right to take your guns.

2656
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,960
The government doesn't have the right to
tell you.

2657
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:18,961
You can't marry a man if you're a man 
and the government doesn't have a right 

2658
01:50:18,961 --> 01:50:18,961
to tell you,
um,

2659
01:50:18,961 --> 01:50:18,961
you know,
all,

2660
01:50:18,961 --> 01:50:19,270
you know,
that you can't have an abortion.

2661
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:24,271
So the true classic sense of 
conservative ideals versus what we see 

2662
01:50:24,271 --> 01:50:27,580
today where it's sort of a mixture of 
conservative philosophy,

2663
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:29,330
but the religious influence,
right?

2664
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:32,020
There's a tremendous amount of religious
influence because,

2665
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:33,310
well,
from the Reagan days,

2666
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:33,790
right?
When,

2667
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,580
when Reagan sort of courted the 
religious,

2668
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:37,150
right?
Yeah,

2669
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:41,980
it actually started with like even even 
Nixon and it's the southern strategy and

2670
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:43,330
all those kinds of things.
And the idea that,

2671
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:44,860
um,
that,

2672
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:47,230
you know,
the map has changed like we in,

2673
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:52,650
in American politics until really the 
civil war parties were coming and going 

2674
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:53,970
constantly like that parties where,
you know,

2675
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:56,710
the federalist in anti-federalists by 
the Times James Madison had James Monroe

2676
01:50:56,711 --> 01:50:59,080
or president,
those are really antiquated terms.

2677
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,960
Those were only five presidents in 
between Madison and you know,

2678
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:03,910
or Montereau and Washington.
So,

2679
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:06,010
you know,
we had this churn,

2680
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:08,880
the know nothings free soil,
all these kinds of things.

2681
01:51:08,881 --> 01:51:11,860
And suddenly the Democrats come out 
during antebellum America.

2682
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:16,861
Republicanism begins in 18,
56 and you have this idea of these 

2683
01:51:16,871 --> 01:51:21,871
parties that just exists still to this 
day and simply morph constantly into 

2684
01:51:21,871 --> 01:51:22,090
these different things.

2685
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:24,670
Making me wonder why we don't just have 
new parties constantly.

2686
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:29,671
But to your point,
the reason that conservatism and 

2687
01:51:29,671 --> 01:51:32,101
liberalism aren't,
these aren't in these neat buckets 

2688
01:51:32,101 --> 01:51:34,141
anymore is because they're tied to these
parties and they have to constantly 

2689
01:51:34,141 --> 01:51:37,321
justify themselves.
The Republicans under ulysses s grant 

2690
01:51:37,321 --> 01:51:37,321
and Teddy Roosevelt were the original 
progressives.

2691
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,660
They were the ones that wanted land to 
be set aside for national parks.

2692
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:42,580
They were the ones that freed obviously 
the slaves,

2693
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:47,700
you know,
not so much Teddy Roosevelt as much as 

2694
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,541
the ulysses s grant and all of these 
kinds of things and suddenly everything 

2695
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:49,960
changes and then suddenly everything 
changes again and so on and so forth.

2696
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:52,780
And so none of these words have any 
definitions anymore,

2697
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:57,990
which is why I didn't identify with 
republicanism anymore because I was 

2698
01:51:57,990 --> 01:52:01,021
like,
I consider myself a moderate 

2699
01:52:01,021 --> 01:52:02,641
conservative.
But what's conservative about 

2700
01:52:02,641 --> 01:52:02,641
evangelicalism,
what's conservative,

2701
01:52:02,641 --> 01:52:02,890
um,
about,

2702
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:08,030
uh,
even even ideas like free trade and 

2703
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:08,030
stuff like that,
like the idea of just having these,

2704
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:13,170
these open markets that destroy your,
your ability to manufacture things that 

2705
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:13,570
drive wages down,
that do all these kinds of things.

2706
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:15,190
Nothing conservative about that at all,
you know?

2707
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:17,620
And,
and so to me I was like,

2708
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:20,350
I just had to find my own way forward.
So I just consider myself independent,

2709
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,550
you know?
And,

2710
01:52:21,551 --> 01:52:24,430
and,
and I feel like I'm consistent in what I

2711
01:52:24,431 --> 01:52:29,431
say because I think you can match them 
all up and I don't think there's any 

2712
01:52:29,431 --> 01:52:29,860
consistency in saying you can't marry 
this man.

2713
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:31,810
Uh,
but don't take my gun.

2714
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:34,780
You can't have this polygamous 
relationship,

2715
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:36,280
um,
you know,

2716
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:38,170
but uh,
we should have prayer in school.

2717
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:39,040
It's like,
it doesn't,

2718
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,690
these things will make sense to me,
you know,

2719
01:52:40,691 --> 01:52:42,100
like the,
you have to be consistent.

2720
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,930
Well,
the religious things always seemed to me

2721
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:45,950
to be compromised as to get the support

2722
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,980
of the religious right.
It seems like they moved towards those 

2723
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:54,431
directions because it sort of reinforces
the power that they have behind them 

2724
01:52:54,431 --> 01:52:55,010
because they're the only candidates that
are willing to do that.

2725
01:52:55,011 --> 01:52:56,990
Right.
Whereas the left is not willing to.

2726
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:02,020
They're,
they're not willing to go down that 

2727
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:04,241
religious road in the sense of a woman's
right to choose and the sense of a lot 

2728
01:53:04,241 --> 01:53:06,440
of things that they get liberals to 
support them.

2729
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:09,410
It would be antithetical.
They would lose that support.

2730
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:14,650
But do you think that a guy like having 
a guy like trump in office that one of 

2731
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:18,011
the good things about having a guy 
that's obviously fairly unhinged and 

2732
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:23,980
ridiculous is that we need to reconsider
like what it is to be a president and 

2733
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:30,640
this idea that this guy could get into 
this position by just sort of calling 

2734
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:35,591
everybody and doing a lot of make 
America great again speeches and saying 

2735
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:41,351
a lot of crazy shit about we're going to
build that wall 10 feet higher and all 

2736
01:53:41,351 --> 01:53:44,981
that.
The other nutty rhetoric that went on 

2737
01:53:44,981 --> 01:53:47,261
during the campaign and then seeing him 
in office and seeing who knows if he's 

2738
01:53:47,261 --> 01:53:48,470
going to get out of these four years 
without going to jail.

2739
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,180
Right.
I mean,

2740
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:50,050
I don't know.
I mean I,

2741
01:53:50,051 --> 01:53:51,800
I,
I think that there is,

2742
01:53:51,801 --> 01:53:55,310
I think you can glean positive and 
obviously negative things out of trump's

2743
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:56,300
administration so far.
Right?

2744
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:01,360
What do you glean positive?
I think what's positive is what we were 

2745
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,881
talking about earlier,
that the system works that like nothing 

2746
01:54:03,881 --> 01:54:03,881
has broken,
broken down at all.

2747
01:54:03,881 --> 01:54:08,290
In fact,
like we've seen from the circuit courts 

2748
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:09,050
all the way to the Supreme Court and 
with Congress that there actually are,

2749
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:14,200
these are legitimately viable and 
independent bodies and the and the 

2750
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:14,980
checks and balance system.
Right?

2751
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:17,900
And this is why I think it's so deeply 
offensive to,

2752
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:18,650
to,
to,

2753
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:19,850
you know,
in a way it'd be like,

2754
01:54:19,851 --> 01:54:21,520
well,
fascism alive in America and,

2755
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,490
and I'm like,
it's not,

2756
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:27,520
it's not what fascism would've looked 
like from a governmental standpoint is 

2757
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,941
trump's coming in,
suspending the supreme court dismissing 

2758
01:54:30,941 --> 01:54:31,680
Congress and trying all these crazy 
things that would have happened.

2759
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,610
And that's what fascism looks like.
What fascism does it look like?

2760
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,430
Is you passing a travel ban and the 
supreme court saying no,

2761
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:39,620
and then you're trying to pass it again.
And then the circuit courts say,

2762
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:40,810
no,
you know,

2763
01:54:40,811 --> 01:54:43,880
and that's not what fascism,
that's what republicanism,

2764
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:48,940
small r republicanism looks like.
And so I think we can glean positive 

2765
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:52,390
things out of this that people got mad 
at me after the election because I was 

2766
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:52,390
like,
the world's not ending.

2767
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:54,440
I actually tweeted it that night.
People were losing their minds.

2768
01:54:54,441 --> 01:54:55,780
I'm like,
it's gonna,

2769
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:58,010
be fine.
People are super emotional.

2770
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,470
They were,
but understand what we've survived.

2771
01:55:00,471 --> 01:55:02,510
We understand when we've had elections,
like what has happened,

2772
01:55:02,511 --> 01:55:05,690
right?
We had an election in 18,

2773
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,040
60,
and really,

2774
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:12,041
and even in 18,
56 and 1952 when things started to 

2775
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:12,041
really start to fall apart and we had 
one in 18,

2776
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:16,301
64 during the civil war,
we had an election in 1932 during the 

2777
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:16,301
depression.

2778
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:20,650
We had an election in 1944 when we were 
fighting the Nazis and the Japanese at 

2779
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:21,410
the same time.
We can survive this way.

2780
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:23,170
We didn't.
No one came in and said like,

2781
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,820
we don't need an election now or on 
toward.

2782
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:30,821
Things were happening.
We still went through the rigors of our 

2783
01:55:30,821 --> 01:55:30,860
system every four years.
Everything stood up.

2784
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:35,050
Everything was fine and that the 
suggestion that Donald Trump is going to

2785
01:55:35,051 --> 01:55:37,130
be the guy that the,
the confederates didn't do it,

2786
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:38,830
the Nazis didn't do it.
The Japanese didn't do it.

2787
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:43,840
Nothing to Donald Trump's going to be 
the one that destroys the American 

2788
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:43,840
republic.
It's absurd.

2789
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:43,840
And so I and I,
I take,

2790
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,900
I take that as a positive,
but what I take is a negative is it?

2791
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:49,710
We're just wasting time.
It's just time wasted.

2792
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,600
It's good theater.
It's entertaining,

2793
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:55,680
but it's not funny because nothing,
they've not gotten anything done.

2794
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:58,350
And I want tax cuts.
I think that's great.

2795
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:03,470
I,
I want some reasonable things happening 

2796
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:03,470
that the congress can pass with trump 
the sign,

2797
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:04,980
but I think these are just wasted four 
years,

2798
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,360
you know?
And so that's not funny at all.

2799
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:07,270
It's just,
it's,

2800
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,420
it's making the problems worse.
Lot of wheel spinning.

2801
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:11,610
Exactly.
We have deep problems,

2802
01:56:11,611 --> 01:56:12,780
$20,000,000,000,000
in debt,

2803
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,710
a massive deficit.
Uh,

2804
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,890
we're spending $600,
billion on our military,

2805
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:20,280
$600,000,000,000
on our military.

2806
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:22,140
It's nuts.
It's insane.

2807
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,540
We have to start asking ourselves 
questions of geopolitics.

2808
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:29,750
Do we need to be in Japan anymore?
Do we need to have these bases and 

2809
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:29,750
Poland?
Do we need to,

2810
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:29,930
you know,
we have a lot of weight,

2811
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:34,970
but we,
we can't get past this buffoon that's 

2812
01:56:34,970 --> 01:56:34,970
our president in order to start asking 
ourselves the questions.

2813
01:56:34,970 --> 01:56:39,610
So we just have to punt until a normal 
person's in there again and I think 

2814
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:39,810
we'll get a normal pr.
I think he'll survive his turn,

2815
01:56:39,811 --> 01:56:41,340
but I think,
I don't think he'll run again.

2816
01:56:41,341 --> 01:56:42,960
I'm,
I'm of the mind that he won't run again.

2817
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:45,300
Specifically specifically already ran 
for reelection.

2818
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:46,290
He's already filed.
Well he,

2819
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:46,920
yeah,
he's filing it.

2820
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:48,060
He's raising money.
But I specific,

2821
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:53,120
I think that one's Kellyanne Conway and 
these other people that are engineered 

2822
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:53,910
the election for them to begin with 
after the midterms,

2823
01:56:53,911 --> 01:56:55,140
which I think are going to be 
interesting.

2824
01:56:55,230 --> 01:56:57,810
I think the midterms actually benefit in
some ways the Republicans because of the

2825
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:02,811
map in the Senate.
But I think that when it becomes clear 

2826
01:57:02,811 --> 01:57:06,951
that he can not.
When you were thinking you were going 

2827
01:57:06,951 --> 01:57:06,951
again?
I,

2828
01:57:06,951 --> 01:57:10,111
I don't.
So it's interesting because I'm friends 

2829
01:57:10,111 --> 01:57:10,111
with.
I'm good friends.

2830
01:57:10,111 --> 01:57:10,950
I went to college with this girl who's a
lobbyist in Washington.

2831
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:15,970
She is a Democrat and she's pretty well 
connected and I had dinner with her a 

2832
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:19,730
couple weeks ago and she was like,
not only will trump running and he'll 

2833
01:57:19,730 --> 01:57:21,800
win and,
and this was when everything was going 

2834
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:23,931
on and all this and I'm like,
I just don't see him subjecting himself 

2835
01:57:23,931 --> 01:57:24,540
to the possibility of losing.
He won once,

2836
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:29,660
you know,
and it reminds me of 2004 when Bush won 

2837
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:29,660
again,
but he also won the popular vote,

2838
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:34,120
you know,
he'd be carry and it kinda legitimize 

2839
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:34,800
himself.
I think that trump is gonna risk further

2840
01:57:34,801 --> 01:57:37,140
illegitimized himself by subjecting 
himself to,

2841
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:42,160
you know,
not only a primary which is going to 

2842
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,120
happen,
which is the death knell for an 

2843
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:44,120
incumbent.
Think Gerald,

2844
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:44,670
Gerald Ford,
Jimmy Carter,

2845
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:47,430
how that went for them when they were 
primary because they were so unpopular.

2846
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,100
And then he goes in and there's going to
be the dumb.

2847
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:51,000
If the Democrats are smart,
they put someone up that's really good.

2848
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,360
Um,
and uh,

2849
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:57,380
but,
and I also think there's gonna be an 

2850
01:57:57,380 --> 01:57:57,380
independent candidate that's gonna screw
everything up as well.

2851
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:00,620
So I think he has a very,
very high likelihood of running again 

2852
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,760
and I think he could absolutely could 
win again.

2853
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:07,850
Do you think you'll win the primary?
Because I'm not even sure he would get 

2854
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:07,850
through the primary.
I don't know.

2855
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:08,940
I mean it all depends on what happens 
over the next three years.

2856
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:12,870
Obviously I'm in no way shape or form a 
political expert,

2857
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:19,040
but I think that we got a lot of dummies
in this country and all we need is 

2858
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,090
momentum.
All you need is one event,

2859
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:24,690
some big thing to happen where Donald 
Trump solves a problem.

2860
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:29,720
Do you remember how happy people were 
with George Bush directly after World 

2861
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:30,510
War war?
More war after September 11th,

2862
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:36,300
after September 11th and he made a bunch
of speeches and set a bunch of things 

2863
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:40,251
and his approval rating shot 90 percent 
or something like that shot up and 

2864
01:58:40,251 --> 01:58:41,440
people were very excited and they were 
like,

2865
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:42,130
this is.
This

2866
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,950
is the reason why we need sort of a good
old boy president,

2867
01:58:45,150 --> 01:58:50,150
just because when push comes to shove,
they know how to get the men in uniform 

2868
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:54,540
behind it and just take care of this 
problem with military might and make 

2869
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:55,090
America great again and all that kind of
horseshit.

2870
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,530
If something like that happens with 
trump and trump,

2871
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:03,580
you remember he had that one speech.
Jamie can give me another one of these 

2872
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:07,141
things.
Please let me handle that one speech 

2873
01:59:07,141 --> 01:59:08,620
where I'm everybody's like,
oh,

2874
01:59:08,621 --> 01:59:09,910
that was.
That was presidential.

2875
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:14,940
Like he had won presidential speech.
He spoke in front of Congress and 

2876
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:16,720
everyone was clapping and he said a 
bunch of things like all you need.

2877
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:21,750
All he needs is one event,
something that happens where he steps up

2878
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:26,820
and manages it with a reasonable 
vocabulary and and does things that 

2879
01:59:29,351 --> 01:59:34,351
people approve of especially some sort 
of a catastrophic situation or any sort 

2880
01:59:34,351 --> 01:59:37,810
of a military situation.
If we have to deal with North Korea,

2881
01:59:37,811 --> 01:59:42,490
if we have to deal with something where 
there's a real legitimate concerns,

2882
01:59:42,491 --> 01:59:46,270
thanks pat.
If that happens and he manages it,

2883
01:59:46,271 --> 01:59:48,280
people get scared and they don't want 
change.

2884
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:53,490
I think if that happens,
it's entirely likely if we have to deal 

2885
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:55,530
with some sort of a catastrophe,
some sort of a tragedy,

2886
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:59,710
some sort of an attack or an event,
and Donald trump manages it well,

2887
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:01,630
it's entirely likely that he could be 
president.

2888
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:01,800
Sure.

2889
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,640
There could be a.
There could be a moment like that.

2890
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:08,760
I wouldn't throw.
I mean I went through anything past him 

2891
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,771
specifically because I and many other 
people were so wrong about his ability 

2892
02:00:10,771 --> 02:00:11,290
to win to begin with.
I thought I just didn't.

2893
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:16,530
I thought he would do,
but I kept saying he's going to do 

2894
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:16,530
better and get more votes than people 
thought,

2895
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,650
but I didn't think he had a prayer of 
winning,

2896
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:19,720
but there are certain things you can 
look at where it's like,

2897
02:00:19,721 --> 02:00:19,970
well,
it's.

2898
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
It's about 50,000
votes along three states that he even 

2899
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:25,330
wanted all the vote was suppressed 
priest and I'm not saying he was at.

2900
02:00:25,331 --> 02:00:30,331
It was actively suppress.
People just weren't enthusiastic about 

2901
02:00:30,331 --> 02:00:30,331
this,
so people weren't out there to vote.

2902
02:00:30,331 --> 02:00:30,550
Now people see the consequences of not 
voting.

2903
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:32,590
Um,
I don't think that.

2904
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,390
I don't think that it's like the.

2905
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:39,720
I guess what I'm saying is that the 
prognostication that like this is the 

2906
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:39,720
end of the world,
right?

2907
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:41,590
Like that Donald trump being president,
that we've had terrible presence,

2908
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:43,510
you know,
like we've had really bad presidents.

2909
02:00:43,511 --> 02:00:45,210
He's the worst.
Yeah,

2910
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:49,960
in some sense he's,
I'll say that he's the most incompetent.

2911
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:51,790
We've had some.
We've had some presidents that were just

2912
02:00:51,791 --> 02:00:54,400
in shitty situations that they couldn't 
manage long time ago.

2913
02:00:54,401 --> 02:00:59,401
Yeah,
I would say hoover's probably the last 

2914
02:00:59,401 --> 02:00:59,401
one.
And then Puke James Buchanan.

2915
02:00:59,401 --> 02:00:59,401
Obviously it's an awful precedent.
The in,

2916
02:00:59,401 --> 02:01:00,190
in 18,
57,

2917
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:02,500
the state starts to secede when he was 
president,

2918
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:04,150
so,
and he couldn't do anything about it.

2919
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:09,340
Um,
so we've had to really die or serious 

2920
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:09,340
situations under presidents that were 
not,

2921
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,080
that were in over their heads,
but there also is no footage of them.

2922
02:01:11,081 --> 02:01:16,081
There's no film.
You have to really go back and read 

2923
02:01:16,081 --> 02:01:16,081
history to understand the

2924
02:01:16,081 --> 02:01:18,840
sequences of their actions where we're 
seeing all this play out in real time.

2925
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,720
We're seeing the poverty of his 
vocabulary,

2926
02:01:21,721 --> 02:01:25,770
the way he communicates in the press,
the way he pats himself on the back.

2927
02:01:25,771 --> 02:01:27,930
Like the other day,
he said he has one of the great memories

2928
02:01:27,931 --> 02:01:31,290
of all time and like he says,
things that are just preposterous.

2929
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:33,620
The one about him being an Ivy Lee.
I went to an Ivy League school.

2930
02:01:33,621 --> 02:01:35,090
I'm an intelligent mind.
I don't.

2931
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:37,280
I'm one of the guys that says like,
I don't think he's dumb at all.

2932
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:38,660
I don't.
I don't think he's stupid.

2933
02:01:38,661 --> 02:01:39,050
I just think

2934
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,500
in over his head.
I don't ever see him in the nineties.

2935
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:45,170
Talk about running for president.
You ever see that video footage?

2936
02:01:45,171 --> 02:01:46,920
I think it was on Charlie rose or 
something like that.

2937
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:48,600
Starting an 88.
He started talking about it either.

2938
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,340
Yeah,
all the way there.

2939
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:54,640
And when you go back and listen to that,
like first of all did something happen 

2940
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:57,710
to his brain.
Like why is he so clunky now?

2941
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:01,770
Like wire his sentence is so poorly 
formed and speech pattern.

2942
02:02:01,771 --> 02:02:06,771
So shitty.
Now maybe that's what you gotta wonder 

2943
02:02:06,771 --> 02:02:06,771
about.
Like old dudes.

2944
02:02:06,771 --> 02:02:11,380
They get to a certain age.
Especially guys like him who don't 

2945
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:11,380
exercise,
don't eat well,

2946
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:15,400
yes,
KFC bucket and it's got a big fat gut 

2947
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,120
and just like how well or is neurons 
firing,

2948
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:18,260
you know,
he's,

2949
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,640
he's see if we can find that video of 
him back from you.

2950
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:23,230
Got It.
Like,

2951
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:25,670
watch this,
listen to this.

2952
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:29,360
I think that if you had to do it again,
I'm not sure you could.

2953
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:33,170
I went through a period of two years 
that was truly tough.

2954
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,920
Well,
you know,

2955
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:41,980
you have parents and you have people 
that adore you and you have people that 

2956
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:45,420
for 15 years nothing went wrong and then
all of a sudden the world seems to be 

2957
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:47,420
coming to an end.
I mean it just seems to become.

2958
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:53,110
And it's just a,
it was just sort of an incredible 

2959
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:53,110
experience for me.
This is him.

2960
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:53,840
Good,
humbled.

2961
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:59,140
Talking about going bankrupt.
I'd like to hear him talking about 

2962
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:03,490
running for president.
My father wouldn't have been in mission 

2963
02:03:03,490 --> 02:03:03,740
to bail me out,
but he certainly helped and you know,

2964
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:07,490
morally and as the whole interview with 
my mother was great.

2965
02:03:07,491 --> 02:03:12,491
I have a sister,
she's very just listen to listen to a 

2966
02:03:12,881 --> 02:03:17,881
speech pattern,
never knew as to loyalty whether or not 

2967
02:03:17,881 --> 02:03:18,020
should be there or wouldn't be there and
she was there in spades,

2968
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,420
other people with them.

2969
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:20,010
But you know,
the,

2970
02:03:20,011 --> 02:03:22,430
the incredible thing is you can't really
tell.

2971
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:24,350
You can't really tell who's going to be 
there,

2972
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:25,840
who's not.
Um,

2973
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:28,910
I would have bet my life on certain 
people.

2974
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,080
I would have said a politically speaking
that somebody that,

2975
02:03:33,081 --> 02:03:38,081
you know,
Andrew Stein would have been there and 

2976
02:03:38,081 --> 02:03:38,081
it wasn't.
I would have said that other people,

2977
02:03:38,081 --> 02:03:41,750
what he wasn't there in terms of for 15 
years I supported Andrew Stein,

2978
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:46,870
supported them.
I never asked him for a thing when I 

2979
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:49,871
needed a vote.
One Riverside South until the very end 

2980
02:03:49,871 --> 02:03:51,620
when everybody else was on board.
Andrew was not there and I was,

2981
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:55,040
I was really surprised at that.
Now ultimately he was there,

2982
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,610
but it shouldn't have been so difficult.
It really shouldn't have been.

2983
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:03,780
Here comes,
one of the things they say about you is 

2984
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:06,341
that their ticks within you,
a vindictiveness about that and you're 

2985
02:04:06,341 --> 02:04:09,590
not gonna forget that.
And part of the trump style,

2986
02:04:10,310 --> 02:04:12,920
at some point you're going to try to get
Stein back.

2987
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:18,070
Well,
I don't think I'm going to try and get 

2988
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:18,070
stuff back.
I'm just disappointed.

2989
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:20,350
I'm disappointed in other people and I'm
not disappointed in some the.

2990
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:25,540
Okay.
Then people point is he seems like a 

2991
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,550
much more reasonable person cogent like,
yeah,

2992
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:30,110
maybe he's going to maybe see a little.
See now I have no idea.

2993
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:31,550
Also,
I think,

2994
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:34,460
and this is something I've been really,
I'm battling,

2995
02:04:34,490 --> 02:04:37,560
not battling but bouncing around in my 
head a lot lately,

2996
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:42,810
is that I think this,
this hate of him,

2997
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:44,550
the,
the constant insults,

2998
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,800
the attacks on him,
the constant.

2999
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,140
I mean he blogs people on twitter all 
the time because people.

3000
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:52,110
And now people are suing him to say that
he can't block them on twitter anymore.

3001
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:53,670
We're being very petulant about that 
stuff.

3002
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:57,540
But this,
all of this like the center live satires

3003
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,200
of um,
all the,

3004
02:04:58,201 --> 02:05:03,201
all the shit that they do is ramping up 
his mania.

3005
02:05:04,230 --> 02:05:06,960
And it's,
it's actually bad for all of us,

3006
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,930
you know,
and that you don't get someone to change

3007
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:10,560
by going,
hey,

3008
02:05:10,561 --> 02:05:12,240
fucking change.
You know,

3009
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:14,670
you're a piece of shit.
Like that doesn't make people change.

3010
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:19,880
It makes people aware that you hate them
and it depending entirely upon their 

3011
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:23,061
personality,
whether or not they're reflective or 

3012
02:05:23,061 --> 02:05:23,061
introspective,
how they,

3013
02:05:23,061 --> 02:05:25,530
how they react to that.
He seems to react to it by,

3014
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:31,010
by like doubling down and by getting 
more aggressively defensive and more 

3015
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:36,280
self aggrandizing and more self 
congratulatory,

3016
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:38,550
you know,
he seems to get more trump.

3017
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:39,750
Yeah.
You know,

3018
02:05:39,751 --> 02:05:41,550
it's almost like he's the hulk like you 
ever received.

3019
02:05:41,551 --> 02:05:43,080
When they shoot,
the hockey gets bigger.

3020
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:43,550
Right?
Right.

3021
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:44,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

3022
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:46,820
He definitely,
he doesn't deal with.

3023
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:51,560
He's in a situation where someone needs 
to lower their rifles.

3024
02:05:51,561 --> 02:05:52,330
Right.
And point.

3025
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:57,540
And after he was elected,
I thought for sure that smart people are

3026
02:05:58,251 --> 02:06:03,251
in his,
in his transition team and he's not 

3027
02:06:03,251 --> 02:06:03,770
surrounded by dumb people.
He surrounded by inexperienced political

3028
02:06:03,771 --> 02:06:08,771
operatives,
but he's not surrounded by dumb people 

3029
02:06:08,771 --> 02:06:10,271
that someone at some point what it said 
like we can now get down to the act of 

3030
02:06:10,271 --> 02:06:12,290
governing and I'm of the mind that if he
just started acting more normal,

3031
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:17,590
if you stopped tweeting so much,
if he just spoke at a more normal in a 

3032
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:17,590
more normal way,
did normal things.

3033
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:20,510
People would have forgotten a lot of 
what happened during the campaign and he

3034
02:06:20,511 --> 02:06:25,511
would have been in much better shape to 
get legislative goals through and stuff 

3035
02:06:25,511 --> 02:06:25,511
like that.
But he,

3036
02:06:25,511 --> 02:06:26,740
he can't help himself.
Like he,

3037
02:06:26,741 --> 02:06:31,741
he,
and that's why I think like this 

3038
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:31,741
destructive.
I don't,

3039
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:32,300
I just don't know that the American 
people are going to want this again.

3040
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:36,290
Like I think that I think that he has a 
base of 30,

3041
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:39,200
35 percent that will be there,
but isn't that what Obama had?

3042
02:06:39,201 --> 02:06:42,190
It is lowest for approval ratings.
Yeah.

3043
02:06:42,191 --> 02:06:44,120
And the second term I think he was down 
down to that

3044
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:47,520
I can think is lowest approval ratings 
were,

3045
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:51,330
were higher than trump's lowest,
but he's in the neighborhood.

3046
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:52,050
Yeah.
I,

3047
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:53,920
I'm,
I'm not even saying [inaudible] approval

3048
02:06:53,921 --> 02:06:58,921
ratings are fickle.
You can do all sorts of shifts to 

3049
02:06:58,921 --> 02:06:58,921
manipulate those numbers and,
and trump would,

3050
02:06:58,921 --> 02:07:03,870
you know,
interestingly and rightfully maybe say 

3051
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:03,870
like,
look at the economy,

3052
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:03,870
it's doing great.
Look at the stock market.

3053
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:05,020
It's doing great.
I think we're economy was on the sort of

3054
02:07:05,021 --> 02:07:05,920
deceptive,
right?

3055
02:07:05,921 --> 02:07:07,870
Because the economy was on an upward 
trend,

3056
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:08,580
right?
And again,

3057
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:09,540
it's caught

3058
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:14,580
that wave right there is a real belief 
by business people that Donald trump is 

3059
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:16,980
going to make things easier for them 
because of his nature.

3060
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:19,360
The Fuck Jamie,
what happened?

3061
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:23,910
Motherfuckers with their ads,
um,

3062
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:29,040
that we,
we have this sense that the business 

3063
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,810
people think that he's going to 
alleviate restrictions.

3064
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:35,990
He's going to make things easier because
you had to open up doors and he's going 

3065
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:39,741
to do that.
Some people would think are very 

3066
02:07:39,741 --> 02:07:41,761
unpopular.
Like one of the things he's done is he 

3067
02:07:41,761 --> 02:07:43,870
made it so you can bring back lion 
trophies now again from Africa.

3068
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,360
So if people want to go to Africa and 
shoot lions,

3069
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:48,910
you could bring them over,
which is bizarre.

3070
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:50,980
It doesn't make any what?
What is a digital?

3071
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,050
No other president.
What does this.

3072
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:57,610
Trump's approval rating is bad day one 
97 of his presidency,

3073
02:07:58,870 --> 02:07:59,950
5:30
pegged.

3074
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:04,960
That is 37 percent.
No other president in history of modern 

3075
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,400
polling had an approval rate.
So dismal on day one.

3076
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:09,940
One 97.
According to 5:38

3077
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:14,970
tracker,
a former president Gerald Ford came 

3078
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:16,981
close to matching trump,
but could a have boasted and approval 

3079
02:08:16,981 --> 02:08:18,790
rate of nearly two point five percent 
points higher.

3080
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:23,920
It wouldn't be super surprised.
And Have Obama Fall into that high 

3081
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,081
thirties,
low forties and his second term because 

3082
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:26,081
that's when they don't care anymore.
Yeah.

3083
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:29,410
Um,
and that's when they really start to 

3084
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:29,410
take initiative and do certain things.
So I was approved.

3085
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:31,880
I didn't see it below like 47 percent.
Obama.

3086
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:33,850
Yeah.
He must have been a with.

3087
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:34,850
Oh,
is this,

3088
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:38,130
this approval is a little different than
a approval or disapproval.

3089
02:08:38,150 --> 02:08:38,820
That's true,
yeah.

3090
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:40,460
Okay.
There's a disapproval rating.

3091
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:42,620
Disapprove,
or do you approve it?

3092
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:44,120
You can be neutral on that.
Right.

3093
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:46,670
So if like there's a disapproval rating 
of 50 percent,

3094
02:08:46,671 --> 02:08:48,290
it doesn't mean is that approval rating 
of fifth year?

3095
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:49,090
Correct.
Right.

3096
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:50,330
Okay.
I think,

3097
02:08:50,331 --> 02:08:52,580
you know,
it's funny because I think with,

3098
02:08:53,030 --> 02:08:58,030
with there are certain things that I 
think people don't understand that are 

3099
02:08:58,581 --> 02:09:00,560
unpopular,
that do need to be done specifically for

3100
02:09:00,561 --> 02:09:01,130
businesses.

3101
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:03,020
I own a business,
I've owned two of them.

3102
02:09:03,021 --> 02:09:08,021
You have run your own business,
it seems like with all of your 

3103
02:09:08,021 --> 02:09:08,420
adventures as well and it's very hard 
and,

3104
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:13,470
and a lot of people look at,
I'm just from an administrative 

3105
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:13,470
paperwork standpoint,
taxes,

3106
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:14,230
all those kinds of things.
It's,

3107
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:19,270
it's awful.
And I think a lot of people pointed 

3108
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:21,130
business big and small and they look at 
them as like these ways you can kind of 

3109
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:22,010
like get blood out of a stone and take 
it and extract as much money out of them

3110
02:09:22,011 --> 02:09:23,300
as possible and all these kinds of 
things.

3111
02:09:23,301 --> 02:09:25,460
A lot of people are not sympathetic to 
it because no offense,

3112
02:09:25,461 --> 02:09:26,690
they have no idea what they're talking 
about.

3113
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:29,300
And I've been watching the west wing 
again,

3114
02:09:29,301 --> 02:09:30,260
which I love.
I love that show.

3115
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:31,250
I never watched it.
Oh,

3116
02:09:31,251 --> 02:09:32,270
it's fantastic.
You probably love it.

3117
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:33,260
You should,
you should check it out.

3118
02:09:33,261 --> 02:09:38,261
So it's just a great show.
And one of the things they say in there 

3119
02:09:38,261 --> 02:09:38,930
is that the major difference we are,
people call us a democracy,

3120
02:09:38,931 --> 02:09:43,931
but we're not a democracy.
We're a public and the idea is that you 

3121
02:09:43,931 --> 02:09:46,751
send,
you vote for people that go make 

3122
02:09:46,751 --> 02:09:48,431
decisions on your behalf and sometimes 
those decisions are going to be 

3123
02:09:48,431 --> 02:09:51,221
unpopular,
but some people do know better than 

3124
02:09:51,221 --> 02:09:51,221
others.
And so there are certain things,

3125
02:09:51,221 --> 02:09:54,500
I don't necessarily judge a move based 
only on popularity because what does,

3126
02:09:54,530 --> 02:09:56,870
what does society at large know about 
running a business?

3127
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,960
Nothing.
So you have to ask people that 

3128
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:01,960
understand what it is to run a business 
and how you can make that easier.

3129
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:05,300
So we can't judge things based on that.
Only my major concern with him though is

3130
02:10:05,301 --> 02:10:10,301
that he's so unpopular even in his own 
party and even specifically with the 

3131
02:10:10,301 --> 02:10:13,880
House that because they are constantly 
up for reelection that you know,

3132
02:10:14,030 --> 02:10:19,030
it,
they haven't had one legislative like 

3133
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:19,030
when uh,
in,

3134
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:22,841
in,
in the entire time he's been president 

3135
02:10:22,841 --> 02:10:22,841
does not have all the positions fully 
staffed as well.

3136
02:10:22,841 --> 02:10:23,000
Yeah.
There,

3137
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:28,010
there are things and that's not uncommon
either that sometimes things go for 

3138
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:30,200
years without being staffed or whatever.
I think part of the problem is so crazy.

3139
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:35,220
Like how the fuck do you take office 
without all the pieces in place because 

3140
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:38,270
they,
I who knows the conspiracy theories run 

3141
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:40,991
deep on this one,
but I don't think he thought he was 

3142
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:40,991
going to win and I'm not even sure he 
wanted to win.

3143
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:40,991
And I,
and,

3144
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:44,550
and I don't think that they had a real 
transition like a.

3145
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:46,310
I Read Hillary Clinton's book,
what happened,

3146
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,080
which is an interesting book.
You read the whole thing?

3147
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:49,040
Yep.
You okay?

3148
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:49,580
Yeah,
I'm okay.

3149
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:50,320
I'm okay.
What is this?

3150
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:55,330
What happened?
Because I'd be interested in high part 

3151
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:55,330
of the time.
Yeah.

3152
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:57,010
Out laying in the bed,
in the bathtub reading.

3153
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:58,620
Um,
but uh,

3154
02:10:58,621 --> 02:11:01,370
as I said the you'd have to be high to 
read but I wanted to perspective,

3155
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:01,680
right?

3156
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:06,680
Like I think it's interesting and,
and well there's a lot of things in 

3157
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,340
there but one of the things she was 
talking about was that she had,

3158
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,560
they were fully prepared for their 
transition.

3159
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:10,220
So you're,
you're dealing,

3160
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:15,250
which is not surprised.
She was actually talking about in 

3161
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:17,800
October she started taking regular 
meetings because they assumed that she 

3162
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:18,340
was gonna win about how she was going to
stack things and the decisions they were

3163
02:11:18,341 --> 02:11:23,341
going to make in the first 100 days.
And I think you just have something 

3164
02:11:23,341 --> 02:11:23,341
that's like over the top bravado.
Right.

3165
02:11:23,341 --> 02:11:28,180
And on the other end,
ironically for someone with so much 

3166
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:31,031
bravado,
you have someone that just was totally 

3167
02:11:31,031 --> 02:11:32,831
not prepared to win because I don't 
think anyone inside except for maybe 

3168
02:11:32,831 --> 02:11:33,860
Kellyanne Conway was telling think 
that's the case.

3169
02:11:33,861 --> 02:11:38,861
Or do you think it was just 
concentrating entirely on winning and 

3170
02:11:38,861 --> 02:11:38,861
then figure it out once it gets in 
there?

3171
02:11:38,861 --> 02:11:38,861
Maybe,
but you're,

3172
02:11:38,861 --> 02:11:39,360
you should.
I mean,

3173
02:11:39,390 --> 02:11:42,110
it could be anything we,
the definitive book on this has not been

3174
02:11:42,111 --> 02:11:47,111
written yet unfortunately.
And actually mark Halperin who was 

3175
02:11:47,111 --> 02:11:47,111
writing that book and now he's,
he's finished with that.

3176
02:11:47,111 --> 02:11:51,430
You realized that he has such a limited 
understanding of what even his powers 

3177
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:54,110
are and what you like.
What was the guy he spoke to?

3178
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:57,590
We said I had a conversation with the 
president of the US Virgin Islands.

3179
02:11:57,591 --> 02:11:57,890
Like,
Hey,

3180
02:11:58,050 --> 02:12:00,180
you're the president of the US Virgin 
Islands.

3181
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:00,740
Yeah,
he makes,

3182
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:02,690
he makes them stupid.
He makes some stupid mistakes.

3183
02:12:02,691 --> 02:12:03,680
He,
he doesn't.

3184
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:06,510
I mean I remember.
Yeah,

3185
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,960
that was there some moments like that 
where I'm like,

3186
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:10,130
you're funny,
you're funny,

3187
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:15,230
but,
but unfortunately the situation doesn't 

3188
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:15,230
call for being funny,
but it's not,

3189
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:17,810
it's not humorous humorous situation.
And I feel like specifically with,

3190
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:20,150
um,
in terms of governance,

3191
02:12:20,151 --> 02:12:25,151
I think he just like,
I remember the debates where he didn't 

3192
02:12:25,151 --> 02:12:25,990
know what the nuclear triad was,
which is like the fuck.

3193
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:30,110
You not know what the nuclear triad is 
and where he speaking around issues that

3194
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:31,910
are,
are somewhat basic,

3195
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,000
right?
That someone that's running for 

3196
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:37,000
president,
you know,

3197
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:37,280
and when you multiply that by not being 
a candidate,

3198
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:40,280
but by being the man in the office and 
then being inundated by the realities of

3199
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:42,530
the office,
he was just ill prepared for it and he,

3200
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:48,040
part of the reason he wanted because he 
was an outsider and part of being an 

3201
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:48,050
outsider is alienating everyone around 
you.

3202
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:50,540
That is an insider.
So he has no one,

3203
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:53,210
very few people that are willing to work
for him that are capable.

3204
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:54,860
Which is why I think that,
um,

3205
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:57,770
you know,
there's this idea,

3206
02:12:57,771 --> 02:12:59,600
I don't know if you've read about it,
there's this idea that there's basically

3207
02:12:59,601 --> 02:13:01,970
a soft coup going on in the American 
government right now.

3208
02:13:01,971 --> 02:13:03,470
Have you talked about,
have you heard about this at all?

3209
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:08,830
That general Maddis who's secretary of 
defense and then General Kelly who is 

3210
02:13:08,830 --> 02:13:12,521
the chief of staff,
are basically running things and that 

3211
02:13:12,521 --> 02:13:15,820
we.
And it's kind of a scary idea because 

3212
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:15,820
military coups,
or even if they're soft,

3213
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:20,341
they're not constitutional,
but that people take kind of solace in 

3214
02:13:20,571 --> 02:13:21,320
this because they're like,
well,

3215
02:13:21,321 --> 02:13:25,940
people that are men of honor are kind of
making sure nothing crazy happens.

3216
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:27,210
And I'm like,
well,

3217
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:28,760
again,
this is such a waste of time.

3218
02:13:28,761 --> 02:13:30,320
We want something soft.
Cool.

3219
02:13:30,321 --> 02:13:32,100
Or is that just he

3220
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:37,100
has given over the reins to the military
for the first time ever because most of 

3221
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:40,551
the time the president is in charge and 
the military has to come to the 

3222
02:13:40,551 --> 02:13:44,730
president for direction and for guidance
and for approval.

3223
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,860
Whereas Donald Trump has kind of said,
look,

3224
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,870
you people know what to do better than 
anybody.

3225
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:50,880
Do what you gotta do.
It could be that.

3226
02:13:50,881 --> 02:13:51,180
I mean,
yeah,

3227
02:13:51,181 --> 02:13:56,181
it could be voluntary,
but it's still its own sort of cool 

3228
02:13:56,181 --> 02:13:56,250
because that's not what you're supposed 
to do.

3229
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:58,250
It's not what you're supposed to do.
Now I trust the military,

3230
02:13:58,290 --> 02:14:00,000
the American.
I'm better than him.

3231
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:05,030
That's absolutely loves.
I was going to say was that typically a 

3232
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:06,140
military coup in history is a super 
negative connotation than rejections.

3233
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,050
Libyans,
whatever the case might be,

3234
02:14:07,051 --> 02:14:09,680
it always turns out bad,
but we have a honor,

3235
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:14,870
like an honor driven military,
I think in the United States above all 

3236
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:17,340
others that will take care of things and
handed over if necessary,

3237
02:14:17,341 --> 02:14:22,341
but,
but the interesting thing that people 

3238
02:14:22,341 --> 02:14:22,341
have been writing and talking about is 
like what happens if he does?

3239
02:14:22,341 --> 02:14:23,880
If you want something crazy done and 
they just don't do it.

3240
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:25,740
We've never.
We've never had a situation like that.

3241
02:14:25,741 --> 02:14:27,500
Like what if,
what if you know what,

3242
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:28,400
what,
what's going on in,

3243
02:14:28,430 --> 02:14:29,670
on the Korean Peninsula,
for instance,

3244
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,950
very dangerous situation,
very dangerous situation.

3245
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:34,110
What if he goes to escalate and they're 
like,

3246
02:14:34,111 --> 02:14:35,300
we're not doing that.
Right.

3247
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:38,370
That's actually the first time that we 
know in recorded history where,

3248
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:41,880
where the military is not responding to 
the,

3249
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:44,310
to the civilian government.
So there's,

3250
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:47,250
it opens all these hypothetical 
interesting things to think about.

3251
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:50,280
Things that we haven't come to that 
haven't come to pass yet.

3252
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:51,150
Yeah.
I mean,

3253
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:53,970
he hasn't requested anything completely 
bizarre yet,

3254
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:57,150
but he said some completely bizarre shit
about,

3255
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:01,020
you know,
he needs essentially violated the United

3256
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:04,800
Nations code or how you communicate with
other governments.

3257
02:15:04,801 --> 02:15:07,020
Right.
I mean he said he threatened them.

3258
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:07,980
What was the,
what?

3259
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:09,660
The terrible,
horrible things.

3260
02:15:09,661 --> 02:15:11,490
Fire and fury.
Fire and fury,

3261
02:15:11,491 --> 02:15:12,140
which is funny.
It's,

3262
02:15:12,141 --> 02:15:13,290
it's a,
it's A.

3263
02:15:13,620 --> 02:15:15,630
Well,
a lot of people didn't glean out of that

3264
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:18,780
was that he was clearly watching truman,
Harry Truman videos.

3265
02:15:18,990 --> 02:15:23,990
Harry Truman said this pretty much the 
same thing before he dropped a nuclear 

3266
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:26,100
bomb on Japan and there's videos of it 
where he was like a rain of fury,

3267
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:28,380
the likes of which the world has never 
seen or something like that.

3268
02:15:28,381 --> 02:15:29,100
He says,
and I'm like,

3269
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:29,360
well,
what?

3270
02:15:29,361 --> 02:15:34,361
You've been someone who's been tripping 
truman quotes in the area because this 

3271
02:15:34,361 --> 02:15:35,550
sounds awfully familiar to me.
It wasn't watching TV,

3272
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:37,920
but uh,
to me it's like we,

3273
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:43,130
it's especially precarious because yes,
a nuclear armed North Korea is not 

3274
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:43,230
ideal,
but there's no.

3275
02:15:43,231 --> 02:15:45,150
If you read any foreign policy papers or
any,

3276
02:15:45,210 --> 02:15:46,350
any,
anything other think tanks,

3277
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:51,351
there's no good solution out of this and
for him to be so flippant about it when 

3278
02:15:51,351 --> 02:15:54,030
you're actually assured destruction is 
the one policy that's kept everyone safe

3279
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:55,320
for a very long time.

3280
02:15:55,590 --> 02:16:00,590
The idea that we will destroy you if you
do anything else and for strike 

3281
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:04,020
capabilities and all that kind of stuff.
The fact that he's playing with that 

3282
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:05,940
balance has major geopolitical 
consequences in Asia,

3283
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:10,300
which in turn can bring the Russians and
obviously the Chinese situation,

3284
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:14,310
comic book sensibility to it that you 
know,

3285
02:16:14,311 --> 02:16:18,270
you go and drop some nukes on North 
Korea and everything saw problem solved.

3286
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:23,790
That's no,
you just started a gigantic chain of 

3287
02:16:23,790 --> 02:16:27,081
events that could lead to a bomb of 
blowing off in a major American city or 

3288
02:16:27,081 --> 02:16:27,090
more.
Yeah,

3289
02:16:27,091 --> 02:16:30,010
I mean at the very least you're talking 
even if you.

3290
02:16:30,011 --> 02:16:32,260
Even if you disabled North Korea's 
nuclear capabilities,

3291
02:16:32,261 --> 02:16:34,030
we don't really understand how their 
icbm is work.

3292
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:39,450
I was reading something today where they
actually had a major collapse of their 

3293
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:39,450
nuclear site of 200 people dead,
like tunnels,

3294
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:40,090
collapse and stuff like that.

3295
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:45,090
Like they're actually blowing up so many
bombs that they're actually weakening 

3296
02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:45,090
their own structures and stuff like 
that.

3297
02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:49,850
Um,
you have this situation where at the 

3298
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:49,850
very least,
even if you disabled everything and they

3299
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:50,920
couldn't retaliate,
retaliate,

3300
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:56,130
soul is 35 miles away from the border.
You're going to talk about tens of 

3301
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:56,950
thousands of people probably dead in a 
few minutes.

3302
02:16:57,790 --> 02:17:02,790
And then you're getting us involved in.
There's a refugee crisis on the 

3303
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:03,610
northwest border of North Korea that's 
funneling in the China.

3304
02:17:03,611 --> 02:17:08,611
China gets involved.
Russia also shares borders and has 

3305
02:17:08,611 --> 02:17:08,890
insurance interests in,
in Asia and East Asia.

3306
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:14,760
This isn't something that a man who 
doesn't understand things needs to be 

3307
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:14,760
trifling with,
you know,

3308
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:15,670
and uh,
it's,

3309
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:20,700
you know,
I would love nothing more than to have 

3310
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:20,700
North Korea taken down a peg.
Like,

3311
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:24,140
yeah,
but think he communicates with the 

3312
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:24,140
military.
I mean,

3313
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:27,210
first of all,
how does he have the time to do 

3314
02:17:27,210 --> 02:17:27,210
everything he's doing because he 
doesn't.

3315
02:17:27,210 --> 02:17:27,820
I mean,
I'll answer it

3316
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:29,680
before I even asked her.
He does.

3317
02:17:29,681 --> 02:17:34,681
No,
no human has the time to be the 

3318
02:17:34,681 --> 02:17:36,841
president.
It's one of the problems with being 

3319
02:17:36,841 --> 02:17:38,701
president.
I mean what you were talking about 

3320
02:17:38,701 --> 02:17:40,741
earlier,
how you have businesses and you run 

3321
02:17:40,741 --> 02:17:41,610
things and how complicated and difficult
it is and those things are not.

3322
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:46,940
No nothing compared to being the 
president of thing and he's got to deal 

3323
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:48,550
with the economic situation.
He's got to deal with the military.

3324
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:53,730
He's got to deal with immigration.
He's trying to build a fucking wall to 

3325
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:56,881
Mexico.
He's trying to bring jobs back to 

3326
02:17:56,881 --> 02:17:57,220
America and he's playing golf 150 times.
Oh,

3327
02:17:57,221 --> 02:18:00,070
he's played golf 72 times.
Cost the taxpayer.

3328
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:03,020
Seventy 6 million,
236,000,

3329
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,060
$13 at least.
What is this website?

3330
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:12,330
Trump golf count God.
Seventy two visits to golf clubs since 

3331
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:17,071
inauguration,
which confirmed golfing on at least 33 

3332
02:18:17,071 --> 02:18:17,071
visits.

3333
02:18:17,071 --> 02:18:21,850
God Damn car frequently asked questions 
for answers to frequently asked 

3334
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:25,170
questions and our complete data table 
for the list of trump's outings.

3335
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:27,040
He's hilarious.
No,

3336
02:18:27,050 --> 02:18:27,410
it's.
I mean,

3337
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:32,420
it's the most complicated and all 
encompassing jobs imaginable and he's 

3338
02:18:32,941 --> 02:18:33,780
out golfing.
Yeah,

3339
02:18:33,781 --> 02:18:34,140
he's,
I mean,

3340
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:35,640
once you got to have rest and 
relaxation,

3341
02:18:35,641 --> 02:18:37,800
I don't begrudge you that,
but I wonder like again,

3342
02:18:37,801 --> 02:18:42,801
because of the alienation that went on 
through the primaries and into the 

3343
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:42,801
campaign,
when you have people that are simply not

3344
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:43,740
willing to work for you,
that are very capable.

3345
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,510
Um,
what do you do?

3346
02:18:45,511 --> 02:18:47,160
I don't know.
I think that's why nothing's happening.

3347
02:18:47,310 --> 02:18:49,200
That's why when they had the healthcare 
thing,

3348
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:51,420
you know,
kind of crop up at early in the,

3349
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:53,310
in the administration,
they weren't prepared.

3350
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:58,480
When they don't have it,
they still have not really released all 

3351
02:18:58,480 --> 02:18:58,480
the details of their tax plan.
It's like,

3352
02:18:58,480 --> 02:18:58,480
what are you guys like?

3353
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:01,380
Nothing has really happened.
It's just that I'm telling you,

3354
02:19:01,381 --> 02:19:06,381
Joe,
that's the major thing that's a bummer 

3355
02:19:06,381 --> 02:19:06,381
to me is it's just wasted time.
It's just wasted time.

3356
02:19:06,381 --> 02:19:10,371
We do not have time and again,
I don't think anybody has enough time to

3357
02:19:10,411 --> 02:19:15,411
actually be the president,
but I wonder like what conversations 

3358
02:19:15,411 --> 02:19:16,020
he's having with the military and what,
how those decisions get made.

3359
02:19:16,021 --> 02:19:18,390
I don't really understand the process 
enough to know,

3360
02:19:18,391 --> 02:19:20,970
like say if North Korea does something 
stupid,

3361
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,020
what,
what,

3362
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:27,200
what are the decisions and who,
who brings those decisions to the 

3363
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,441
president who brings us suggestions,
who lays out the possibilities and how 

3364
02:19:30,621 --> 02:19:33,350
does that go?
So I think from what I understand,

3365
02:19:33,351 --> 02:19:38,351
the way it works is that there's a 
situation room in the White House that 

3366
02:19:38,351 --> 02:19:41,491
joint chiefs of Staff and the national 
security advisor meet there to discuss 

3367
02:19:41,491 --> 02:19:44,921
things.
A president comes in when they're ready 

3368
02:19:44,921 --> 02:19:44,921
to,
to present them with things.

3369
02:19:44,921 --> 02:19:45,260
They present him based on the branch 
that's dealing with it,

3370
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:47,400
what's happening and then they give him,
you know,

3371
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:49,870
what are reasonable responses or you 
know,

3372
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:53,960
wait and see kind of things or whatever.
And I think that's how it goes down.

3373
02:19:53,961 --> 02:19:54,940
And then he tells,
you know,

3374
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:56,900
the joint chiefs to,
to act on his,

3375
02:19:56,990 --> 02:20:01,990
on his direction.
That's a great name for a room to the 

3376
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:05,300
situation room with Wolf Blitzer.
Your Situation Room?

3377
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:07,670
Yeah.
How has he called him his own show?

3378
02:20:07,671 --> 02:20:08,530
That situation?
I don't know.

3379
02:20:08,550 --> 02:20:09,660
He got away.
He's getting away with it.

3380
02:20:09,661 --> 02:20:11,840
The fucking rude.
I know he's getting away with a wolf.

3381
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:15,160
Blitzer is an interesting character and 
a lot of these guys on cable news or are

3382
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:17,080
interesting people to me,
especially now so.

3383
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,200
Well,
because they're the,

3384
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:20,560
the,
there's always been partisans.

3385
02:20:20,570 --> 02:20:22,580
We were talking about William F Buckley 
and corporate al before.

3386
02:20:22,581 --> 02:20:27,581
Right.
But there's no pretenses now about 

3387
02:20:27,581 --> 02:20:28,160
anything like,
like no matter who you're watching,

3388
02:20:28,161 --> 02:20:33,161
I don't,
I couldn't even tell you what a person 

3389
02:20:33,161 --> 02:20:35,171
who doesn't have an ideal and open 
ideological bent anymore and had had 

3390
02:20:35,171 --> 02:20:35,540
some sort of,
um,

3391
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:41,020
some sort of,
it's kind of like a means to an end for 

3392
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:41,020
them to get their information out there 
the way they want it.

3393
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:41,990
There's no like Walter cronkite's 
anymore.

3394
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:44,720
No completely objective journalist,
which I would love.

3395
02:20:44,721 --> 02:20:45,620
I would love that,
but I don't try.

3396
02:20:45,621 --> 02:20:47,060
I don't really.
That's why I don't really trust anything

3397
02:20:47,061 --> 02:20:48,440
the media says anymore.
It's not only trump,

3398
02:20:48,441 --> 02:20:50,340
it's just like there's always an agenda.
Yeah.

3399
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:53,510
There's no one who's delivering it all 
with a straight face.

3400
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,180
Everyone has an editorial bent to it and
that's fine,

3401
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:01,240
but I wish that it when the only place 
that you can really go to get straight 

3402
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:02,900
up news now or the wires,
it's kind of like a little lonely,

3403
02:21:02,930 --> 02:21:07,930
you know,
go to ap and Reuters and then that's 

3404
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:07,930
pretty much it.
What about the Internet?

3405
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:12,160
Is Anybody doing a good job of 
disseminating objective news on the 

3406
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:12,610
Internet?
I don't think so.

3407
02:21:12,650 --> 02:21:16,070
Not that anyone that I've seen,
I think there's an opening for that.

3408
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:17,180
If someone could figure it out.

3409
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:17,960
There is,
but I don't.

3410
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:20,090
The thing is,
is that the sad thing is I don't know if

3411
02:21:20,091 --> 02:21:21,470
there's even an audience for it,
you know,

3412
02:21:21,471 --> 02:21:26,471
like I think that people like you and I 
that might want a more objective stance 

3413
02:21:26,471 --> 02:21:26,471
to make up your own.
You know,

3414
02:21:26,471 --> 02:21:30,880
I remember I used to watch BBC World 
News on pbs in college because it was 

3415
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:32,510
like this very outsider kind of like,
you know,

3416
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:38,650
40,000
foot view of what was going on and I 

3417
02:21:38,650 --> 02:21:41,051
feel like we don't even really have that
anymore and I feel like there's the 

3418
02:21:41,051 --> 02:21:41,051
reason that those people don't exist is 
because there is no,

3419
02:21:41,051 --> 02:21:41,470
there's no money there.
Yeah.

3420
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:43,910
It seems like the big monies in 
preaching to the choir.

3421
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:44,920
Absolutely.
And that's,

3422
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:46,940
that's why with what I was trying to do 
is like,

3423
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:48,740
uh,
I get,

3424
02:21:48,741 --> 02:21:51,230
I take a lot of honor that I get fired 
from every angle,

3425
02:21:51,231 --> 02:21:52,370
which means that I'm doing something 
right.

3426
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:54,410
It's not like only the left wing people 
that don't like me.

3427
02:21:54,411 --> 02:21:55,850
It's not only the people that don't like
me,

3428
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:58,670
it's like everybody has some problem 
with me,

3429
02:21:58,671 --> 02:22:00,860
which makes me feel like maybe I'm 
somewhere in the middle,

3430
02:22:00,861 --> 02:22:01,680
but I haven't,
I haven't,

3431
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:03,140
I don't have.
I don't know if I have an agenda.

3432
02:22:03,141 --> 02:22:04,730
I guess I do,
but I have a point of view.

3433
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:09,140
The news to me is the most fascinating,
well the news networks because CNN seems

3434
02:22:09,141 --> 02:22:14,141
almost like it's just,
they're weighted down by rules and 

3435
02:22:14,541 --> 02:22:16,820
restrictions in a certain sense where 
it's Fox News.

3436
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:20,270
He got Hannity who's just fucking 
completely unhinged.

3437
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:25,390
You had bill o'reilly.
He's trying to fuck everything that 

3438
02:22:25,390 --> 02:22:25,390
moves.
I mean,

3439
02:22:25,390 --> 02:22:26,160
didn't that guy have like nine different

3440
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,170
sexual harassment lawsuits that he 
settled?

3441
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:31,950
One of them for 35,
$35,000,000.

3442
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:35,040
What the fuck did he do?
I can't imagine how much money he really

3443
02:22:35,041 --> 02:22:37,290
has from his books and stuff.
If he can even fork that much money over

3444
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:38,220
because I was him.
Right.

3445
02:22:38,221 --> 02:22:39,150
That was even Fox.
I don't think.

3446
02:22:39,151 --> 02:22:41,250
I don't even think it was highly files.
$5,

3447
02:22:41,251 --> 02:22:43,890
million dollar defamation.
Suit over harassment claims.

3448
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:50,970
Trying to get back.
Go back to that.

3449
02:22:50,971 --> 02:22:53,190
Let me read the text underneath it 
please.

3450
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:56,640
Former Fox News host,
Bill O'reilly on Friday,

3451
02:22:56,641 --> 02:22:59,640
filed a defamation suit against former 
New Jersey state legislator,

3452
02:22:59,641 --> 02:23:04,641
Michael Panter.
Following a facebook post on Tuesday in 

3453
02:23:04,641 --> 02:23:07,761
which panter detailed,
alleged sexual harassment by O'reilly 

3454
02:23:08,310 --> 02:23:09,590
against an unnamed ex partner of 
panthers.

3455
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:10,770
Huh?
Wow.

3456
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:15,980
Painters claims based on the 
conversations with his ex and incidents 

3457
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:15,980
he said that he witnessed.
We're chilling.

3458
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:20,970
Panter says that his then girlfriend's 
enclosed career was largely dependent on

3459
02:23:20,971 --> 02:23:24,010
staying on a Riley's good graces,
uh,

3460
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:29,310
and that'll riley repeatedly asked her 
out and made sexually charged late night

3461
02:23:29,311 --> 02:23:30,180
phone calls to her.

3462
02:23:30,990 --> 02:23:35,990
That's his move.
He calls you up and says fucked up shit 

3463
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:36,540
on the phone.
What a freak.

3464
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:37,440
It's crazy,
man.

3465
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:42,500
He must've been like,
sort of the Harvey Weinstein sort of 

3466
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:45,530
thing.
Like he must have been doing that 

3467
02:23:45,530 --> 02:23:45,530
forever.
That was his thing.

3468
02:23:45,530 --> 02:23:45,540
He would call chicks up.
Yeah.

3469
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:48,450
What are you wearing?
I was about to call Reagan.

3470
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:52,050
Got Him on speed dial.
It's from watching me jerk off.

3471
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:52,710
It's,
it's,

3472
02:23:52,770 --> 02:23:55,110
it's totally bizarre.
Like the power of money.

3473
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:57,840
It gives you some sort of presumed Valle
against.

3474
02:23:57,841 --> 02:24:00,240
Thinks he does,
but it's also the Fox News thing.

3475
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:05,270
It's so sexually charged,
like I have a whole bit about the way 

3476
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:08,271
the men and the women dress on Fox News 
because those women dress like they're 

3477
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:11,770
going out on a hot date and they're 
talking about like important issues.

3478
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:12,150
Right?
Yeah.

3479
02:24:12,151 --> 02:24:17,151
That little dresses and there always 
seem to be sitting at the edges of the 

3480
02:24:17,151 --> 02:24:17,230
table so you can see their legs,
right?

3481
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:19,530
Yeah.
It was always very transparent to me.

3482
02:24:19,531 --> 02:24:20,010
I my,
my,

3483
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,030
my thought was always like,
well,

3484
02:24:21,031 --> 02:24:23,520
these are old conservative men that are 
watching this,

3485
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:28,521
and you grabbed them.
Any way you can boil newt Gingrich's 

3486
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:31,290
feeling it.
Just holding onto a 70 year old.

3487
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:36,291
Would our wish I had enough power to 
stick it in any of these gals?

3488
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:38,910
Do you think Newt Gingrich gets some hot
tail?

3489
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:41,190
He's got probably did fairly well.
He wasn't,

3490
02:24:41,191 --> 02:24:43,410
he wasn't.
He wasn't a hill above and underwear.

3491
02:24:43,470 --> 02:24:46,560
A known philanderer.
A little of this little.

3492
02:24:46,561 --> 02:24:49,290
That sexiest ladies of Fox News as it 
is.

3493
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:51,210
Yeah.
It's interesting.

3494
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:56,450
Well,
it's interesting too that somebody 

3495
02:24:56,450 --> 02:24:56,450
needed to talk to Megan Kelly.
Like,

3496
02:24:56,450 --> 02:24:57,920
what the fuck was she thinking?
Jumping ship and going over to NBC.

3497
02:24:57,970 --> 02:24:59,580
She's dying over there apparently.
Well,

3498
02:24:59,581 --> 02:25:01,860
of course she's dying.
You the Ice Queen.

3499
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:07,040
You're supposed to be shouting down.
The liberals mock and everybody and 

3500
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:07,040
telling everybody that Santa Claus is 
white.

3501
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:08,640
That's your.
That's your thing.

3502
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:09,150
Yeah.
She.

3503
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:11,520
She's apparently like,
I keep reading about her,

3504
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:14,070
about how people won't book on her show.
No,

3505
02:25:14,370 --> 02:25:16,560
well she's.
And she's bringing everyone down.

3506
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:21,620
She's not stupid,
but she's pressured and when people are 

3507
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:25,251
under pressure they falter.
Especially people are not used to kind 

3508
02:25:25,251 --> 02:25:25,251
of pressure

3509
02:25:25,251 --> 02:25:26,260
like she's used to people liking her.
Well,

3510
02:25:26,261 --> 02:25:28,270
I always thought she was brilliant on 
Fox,

3511
02:25:28,271 --> 02:25:30,370
like the way she would communicate with 
people.

3512
02:25:30,371 --> 02:25:34,150
She's very sharp,
but she just seemed so uncomfortable and

3513
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:38,830
under pressure and nervous and awkward.
Like did you see the thing with will and

3514
02:25:38,831 --> 02:25:40,180
grace?
Oh yeah.

3515
02:25:40,181 --> 02:25:45,181
Where they had that exchange with 
messing with a guy if he became gay 

3516
02:25:45,181 --> 02:25:47,320
because he liked the character.
That was like what?

3517
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:48,340
Oh,
that's right.

3518
02:25:48,341 --> 02:25:48,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

3519
02:25:49,030 --> 02:25:50,890
She had some other awkward.
Who was there was,

3520
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:56,010
there was a couple early on where there 
was a pretty awkward like exchanges 

3521
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:57,640
between her Jane Fonda,
Jane Fonda.

3522
02:25:57,641 --> 02:25:58,570
That's right.
That's what it was.

3523
02:25:58,571 --> 02:26:02,500
She asked about getting plastic surgery 
and Jane Fonda just said,

3524
02:26:02,501 --> 02:26:07,501
are we really going to go there?
And then she went and I like to talk 

3525
02:26:07,501 --> 02:26:07,501
about this movie.
This is what I like about this movie.

3526
02:26:07,501 --> 02:26:09,200
She'd basically just steam rolled her.
I,

3527
02:26:09,201 --> 02:26:11,190
I,
I feel we were talking about typecasting

3528
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:11,560
before,
right?

3529
02:26:11,561 --> 02:26:13,330
About how people didn't feel like she's 
just,

3530
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:16,000
she can't get away from what she was 
also like,

3531
02:26:16,030 --> 02:26:21,030
that's a clunky,
stupid thing to do to try to talk about 

3532
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,160
plastic surgery when someone's promoting
a movie.

3533
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:22,960
Sure.
She's just trying to get soundbites.

3534
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:28,260
She's like,
he's calculated effort to get sound 

3535
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:28,260
bites of the people will put up youtube 
clips.

3536
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:33,120
Do you,
do you give a lot of interviews or ever 

3537
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:34,921
given interviews like a.
or have you ever had a bad experiences 

3538
02:26:34,921 --> 02:26:35,130
with that?
Talking to me.

3539
02:26:35,810 --> 02:26:38,630
I'm saying you being the on your own 
show anymore,

3540
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:39,780
man.
I don't do them.

3541
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:42,700
I feel like that's an incredibly 
ineffective way to communicate.

3542
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:48,060
I feel like you're doing yourself a 
massive disservice to talk for five 

3543
02:26:48,060 --> 02:26:48,070
minutes to someone that you don't even 
know.

3544
02:26:48,330 --> 02:26:50,010
I mean,
if I wanted to talk to somebody,

3545
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:55,020
I want to talk to them for hours and 
let's do it live so that you can't edit 

3546
02:26:55,020 --> 02:26:55,020
it.

3547
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:58,270
You know?
I think that,

3548
02:26:58,271 --> 02:27:00,520
uh,
if you really want to communicate ideas,

3549
02:27:00,521 --> 02:27:05,521
that's not the way to do it is the way 
to jump off a little sound clips and 

3550
02:27:05,521 --> 02:27:06,250
sound bites and then we'll be right 
back.

3551
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:09,760
You know,
and you go to commercial and it's like,

3552
02:27:10,550 --> 02:27:12,220
well,
what are we living in the fifties?

3553
02:27:12,450 --> 02:27:12,910
Why?
Well,

3554
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:17,970
this is a stupid way to do.
You guys need to revamp your whole 

3555
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:17,970
system.
The system sucks.

3556
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:19,570
This is a shitty way to communicate with
people.

3557
02:27:19,690 --> 02:27:22,540
Why are we even talking like this?
You're sitting over there,

3558
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:25,540
I'm sitting over here and we're looking 
at each other sideways.

3559
02:27:25,541 --> 02:27:27,400
How come you're at a desk and I'm on a 
couch.

3560
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:29,530
Why do you have a desk where you write 
in books?

3561
02:27:29,930 --> 02:27:31,690
Fuck,
are you doing over there in that desk?

3562
02:27:31,691 --> 02:27:34,890
This is the whole thing is just,
it's Jack Paar.

3563
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:40,090
It's Johnny Carson.
It's just like this old school dumb way 

3564
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:41,710
of conducting these interviews.
What?

3565
02:27:41,870 --> 02:27:43,240
You have a band here?
Well,

3566
02:27:43,241 --> 02:27:44,860
let's let the band play us out.

3567
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:51,610
It's like capital s show.
It's fucking dumb.

3568
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I don't like it.
I think the guy who does it the best is 

3569
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,431
Jimmy Kimmel.
I think Jimmy Fallon does a pretty good 

3570
02:27:59,431 --> 02:27:59,431
too,
you know,

3571
02:27:59,431 --> 02:27:59,440
he's got.
He makes it fun.

3572
02:27:59,450 --> 02:28:01,360
He's got a lot of like fun things that 
he does on it.

3573
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:06,810
You know,
Seth Meyers is a good job making it fun 

3574
02:28:06,810 --> 02:28:07,000
as well and he has some really good 
points.

3575
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:07,840
You know,
I show,

3576
02:28:07,841 --> 02:28:12,841
but I just think ultimately I can't.
I can barely express myself in five 

3577
02:28:12,841 --> 02:28:12,841
minutes,
seven minutes,

3578
02:28:13,180 --> 02:28:15,070
you know,
and especially in front of a crowd,

3579
02:28:15,430 --> 02:28:20,430
you're sitting there in front of a crowd
and you want to talk about important 

3580
02:28:20,430 --> 02:28:20,980
things or funny things are right tab.
Joe,

3581
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:22,430
I understand that.
You don't like the zoo.

3582
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:26,240
Tell us why you don't like the zoo.
It's a fucking animal prison and I think

3583
02:28:26,241 --> 02:28:30,080
it's fucked up.
I can even say those words.

3584
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:30,890
Yeah,
it's.

3585
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:35,220
I feel like there's A.
I think that people,

3586
02:28:35,250 --> 02:28:37,860
some people have a short attention span.
They don't want long things or whatever,

3587
02:28:37,861 --> 02:28:41,080
but I think that like a show like yours,
I think fills a niche assignment.

3588
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:46,200
Interesting.
You'd show but fills this need that I 

3589
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:47,640
think is underrated that people like 
long form things that they like depth,

3590
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:52,880
that they have lots of time to burn when
they're driving around or at work in 

3591
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:53,100
their board or they're just cooking food
or whatever it is they're doing.

3592
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:54,690
I used to have that argument in my old 
company.

3593
02:28:54,691 --> 02:28:56,880
Where are we?
I was like,

3594
02:28:56,881 --> 02:29:01,881
you guys are just wrong when you make 
the show three or four or five minutes 

3595
02:29:01,881 --> 02:29:01,881
for them,
like,

3596
02:29:01,881 --> 02:29:05,091
no,
it'll be as long as I want it to be for 

3597
02:29:05,091 --> 02:29:07,431
me to get my word out.
And I was right about that and I feel 

3598
02:29:07,431 --> 02:29:07,431
like.
So I like the long form stuff.

3599
02:29:07,431 --> 02:29:11,570
I like for things to be as long as they 
need to be and flush things out into not

3600
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:14,640
corner people to let them express them,
explain themselves and stuff like that.

3601
02:29:14,641 --> 02:29:16,470
I think it's good.
That's why it show so popular,

3602
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:17,070
you know?
And um,

3603
02:29:18,340 --> 02:29:20,580
you know,
I'm surprised that people aren't kind of

3604
02:29:20,581 --> 02:29:22,890
more,
more and more and more aping the idea of

3605
02:29:22,891 --> 02:29:23,670
doing,
going three,

3606
02:29:23,671 --> 02:29:25,460
four or five hours if necessary with 
people.

3607
02:29:25,650 --> 02:29:27,340
Some people don't want to do it,
you know,

3608
02:29:27,341 --> 02:29:32,341
I'm,
I'm a uniquely blabber mouth type 

3609
02:29:32,341 --> 02:29:34,820
person.
I can just keep talking about things 

3610
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:36,741
forever and also I'm not connected to 
something else where I have to worry 

3611
02:29:36,741 --> 02:29:36,950
about what I say,
you know,

3612
02:29:36,951 --> 02:29:40,260
like I can't get fired if I'm the boss.
I'm my own boss,

3613
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,300
you know,
so a lot of people don't.

3614
02:29:42,330 --> 02:29:43,800
They're not in that position,
you know,

3615
02:29:43,801 --> 02:29:48,801
and they,
they really worry about putting their 

3616
02:29:48,801 --> 02:29:51,681
foot in their mouth,
which I've definitely done a ton of 

3617
02:29:51,681 --> 02:29:53,811
times and that,
that being the end of their career 

3618
02:29:53,811 --> 02:29:53,811
instead of being what it is,
just a mistake,

3619
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:59,020
you know,
and I think for people to really get a 

3620
02:29:59,020 --> 02:29:59,670
sense of who you truly are,
you know,

3621
02:30:00,030 --> 02:30:02,250
you get a sense of who someone is over 
three hours,

3622
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:04,890
you really get a sense of who someone is
over three hours,

3623
02:30:04,891 --> 02:30:07,440
over a thousand,
200 podcasts,

3624
02:30:07,441 --> 02:30:12,441
where the fuck we've done,
what are we on thousand 20 or something 

3625
02:30:12,441 --> 02:30:12,441
like that.

3626
02:30:12,441 --> 02:30:15,980
One thousand 32 plus fight companions.
A lot of fucking shows.

3627
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:18,750
People get a sense of who you are.
You know,

3628
02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:20,670
it's um,
it's just different.

3629
02:30:20,671 --> 02:30:22,850
It's a different kind of thing,
you know,

3630
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:26,730
uh,
a television show is a more polished,

3631
02:30:26,850 --> 02:30:31,850
edited.
It might be better for your attention 

3632
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:31,980
span me if this was on TV,
just regular TV,

3633
02:30:32,010 --> 02:30:33,810
maybe it would be a bomb,
you know,

3634
02:30:33,811 --> 02:30:37,920
maybe like uniquely fits into the 
weirdness that is the internet.

3635
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:43,020
That's why it's been successful.
And also I think it's probably been 

3636
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:46,431
successful because it was never,
there was never any attempt at being 

3637
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:46,431
successful.
It was,

3638
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:48,120
it was never like something where I sat 
out and go,

3639
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:53,510
if I just do this a certain way,
it will be financially viable.

3640
02:30:53,821 --> 02:30:57,570
It will be received well and will,
I'll use this as a vehicle to further my

3641
02:30:57,571 --> 02:31:00,120
other endeavors.
There's never any thought process,

3642
02:31:00,121 --> 02:31:01,170
right that it's like,
hey,

3643
02:31:01,171 --> 02:31:02,740
be cool to just talk to people.
Hey,

3644
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,450
think I can get Anthony Bordain come 
over my house sitting right there,

3645
02:31:06,451 --> 02:31:08,070
let's give them some beers,
let's have talks,

3646
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:08,990
you know.
And,

3647
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:10,610
and that's where it all came from,
you know,

3648
02:31:10,660 --> 02:31:11,690
just came organically.

3649
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:12,390
Yeah.
That's,

3650
02:31:12,391 --> 02:31:13,740
that's the beauty of it.
And I think that,

3651
02:31:13,810 --> 02:31:18,810
I think that shines through with your 
showing up in some other people that 

3652
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:18,810
like you can tell when someone's putting
it on.

3653
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:20,150
Someone mean I of.
I'm sure

3654
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:22,350
you can.
What do you think you'd like to hope you

3655
02:31:22,351 --> 02:31:23,190
can?
Yeah,

3656
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:24,810
sure.
Well Bill Cosby.

3657
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,440
Yeah.
Who?

3658
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:25,930
Yeah,
he bought it.

3659
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:27,400
Probably would have failed both of us.
Maybe.

3660
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:28,170
Maybe not though.

3661
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:29,570
Me.
No.

3662
02:31:29,571 --> 02:31:31,430
And he never had.
That's part of the thing.

3663
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,980
Like he might've fooled both of us if he
was on the tonight show,

3664
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:39,340
but if he was sitting across the room 
for us for three hours just talking 

3665
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:39,340
shit,
you know,

3666
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:41,260
maybe not.
You know,

3667
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:42,140
we never really gotten to.

3668
02:31:42,370 --> 02:31:42,980
Yeah,
right.

3669
02:31:43,430 --> 02:31:45,560
You must have been overdoing thousand 
episodes,

3670
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:47,300
many hundreds of guests.
You must,

3671
02:31:47,810 --> 02:31:52,810
you must learn a lot.
Like you were saying a lot about a 

3672
02:31:52,810 --> 02:31:52,810
person,
but that.

3673
02:31:52,810 --> 02:31:57,360
Does your opinion of the person change 
when you have some interesting 

3674
02:31:57,360 --> 02:31:57,360
interviews with,
with bigger people,

3675
02:31:57,360 --> 02:31:58,820
for instance,
that come on your show better or worse?

3676
02:31:58,821 --> 02:32:01,220
Like after kind of poking and prodding 
them for a little while?

3677
02:32:01,250 --> 02:32:01,660
Yeah.
But you,

3678
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:03,650
I think you did data chunk right?

3679
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,900
Whenever you're talking to people and 
you,

3680
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:10,910
you see sort of some sort of patterns in
deflection and communication and 

3681
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:13,850
openness and some people really impress 
you with their honesty,

3682
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:17,930
their thoughtfulness or objectivity.
Objectivity is a rare one.

3683
02:32:17,931 --> 02:32:22,931
Man,
that's a particularly rare thing where 

3684
02:32:22,931 --> 02:32:25,580
so many people are so married to their 
ideas and I try very hard not to be.

3685
02:32:25,581 --> 02:32:29,750
I'm certainly not perfect at it,
but I try very hard to not be married to

3686
02:32:29,751 --> 02:32:33,230
my ideas and if I'm wrong,
I really go out of my way to say,

3687
02:32:33,530 --> 02:32:35,090
wow,
I was definitely wrong about that.

3688
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:37,160
Like I thought that was this,
but it's not.

3689
02:32:37,161 --> 02:32:40,160
It's that and this is,
this is how we know and here's the proof

3690
02:32:40,161 --> 02:32:41,990
now and here's the studies that have 
come out.

3691
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:43,580
Wow,
fucking that threw me for a loop.

3692
02:32:43,850 --> 02:32:45,890
But you have to.
You have to do that.

3693
02:32:46,150 --> 02:32:49,640
Absolutely.
But there are so many people that do not

3694
02:32:49,641 --> 02:32:53,180
want to ever admit fault and because of 
that,

3695
02:32:53,810 --> 02:32:57,950
because you don't want to admit fault 
because you don't want to admit that you

3696
02:32:57,951 --> 02:33:02,951
might've communicated in error or you 
might've been misled by certain 

3697
02:33:02,951 --> 02:33:04,040
information that you thought was true,
but turned out to not be.

3698
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:09,790
It ruins the way people appreciate your 
words because you could tell me that you

3699
02:33:10,491 --> 02:33:15,491
believe something happened in the past 
because you read it because you learned 

3700
02:33:15,831 --> 02:33:18,380
it in school because it's always been 
taught that way,

3701
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:21,440
but then new information comes out that 
clearly refutes that.

3702
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:24,290
You've got to come in here and say,
well now I know different,

3703
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:27,620
but I thought this because I know that 
you really did think that.

3704
02:33:27,621 --> 02:33:32,621
I know.
I know you were really being honest and 

3705
02:33:32,621 --> 02:33:34,901
now I know you're being even more honest
because you're saying now we know 

3706
02:33:34,901 --> 02:33:37,080
differently that now we know differently
is fucking giant map.

3707
02:33:37,130 --> 02:33:41,510
It's huge and you see it resisted.
You see a dissident academia.

3708
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:46,900
You see it because people have been 
teaching certain things for a certain 

3709
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:49,541
amount of time and then new evidence 
comes to light and they don't want to 

3710
02:33:49,541 --> 02:33:49,930
consider it.
He resisted at all.

3711
02:33:50,210 --> 02:33:55,210
Like I had a conversation once on the 
radio with this lady who called up and 

3712
02:33:55,210 --> 02:33:58,421
she was uh,
she was telling me that she was a 

3713
02:33:58,421 --> 02:34:00,230
paleontologist.
Would who's studying monkeys?

3714
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:04,190
The biologist would.
Would it be a biologist?

3715
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:05,690
Yeah,
like some sort of,

3716
02:34:06,230 --> 02:34:08,870
some sort of a biologist.
And she said,

3717
02:34:09,130 --> 02:34:13,220
I have my phd because I was talking 
about the Bondo ape,

3718
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:17,090
which is a very particularly large 
species.

3719
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:22,200
The Congo and I was going over all these
different things about this app and it 

3720
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:25,000
was on the open anthony show and this 
lady called up and she goes,

3721
02:34:25,001 --> 02:34:29,350
you are just talking about pseudo 
science and cryptozoology you don't know

3722
02:34:29,351 --> 02:34:30,130
where you're talking about.

3723
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:31,000
And I go,
no,

3724
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:34,000
I'm reciting an article.
There was a national geographic.

3725
02:34:34,001 --> 02:34:36,160
This is all new information.
And I go,

3726
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:40,690
she said she was a professor and I go,
when did you study?

3727
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:42,070
When did you learn?
I go,

3728
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:42,590
how,
how,

3729
02:34:42,591 --> 02:34:45,820
how much time do you spend paying 
attention to the newest,

3730
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:48,790
latest information because clearly 
you're wrong.

3731
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:50,890
They have,
they have skulls,

3732
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:53,800
they have videos of these animals.
They have photographs of them,

3733
02:34:53,801 --> 02:34:55,840
they have camera trap photos,
they have DNA on them.

3734
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:57,730
They have a crest in their head like a 
gorilla,

3735
02:34:57,940 --> 02:35:00,790
and I,
when I get obsessed with things,

3736
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:04,510
I have an ability to rattle off 
information or rattle off information.

3737
02:35:04,511 --> 02:35:06,820
This lady and she never says,
no,

3738
02:35:06,821 --> 02:35:07,990
you're wrong.
I mean,

3739
02:35:07,991 --> 02:35:09,160
she never says,
well,

3740
02:35:09,161 --> 02:35:12,460
I guess I was wrong.
I am going on old information.

3741
02:35:12,461 --> 02:35:14,560
She starts laughing and mocking me.
I go,

3742
02:35:14,710 --> 02:35:19,710
are you better than these scientists 
that are in national geographic that are

3743
02:35:20,441 --> 02:35:23,770
putting out these photographs that are 
spending years in the Congo?

3744
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:28,920
Carl Jung,
the Swiss wildlife photographer that 

3745
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:29,680
spent years in the Congo photographing 
these creatures.

3746
02:35:29,681 --> 02:35:34,681
They nest on the ground like gorillas.
There are particularly large species of 

3747
02:35:34,681 --> 02:35:38,221
chimpanzees there.
So I started rattling off inflammation 

3748
02:35:38,221 --> 02:35:38,221
and the lady's like,
you know,

3749
02:35:38,221 --> 02:35:38,860
like you don't know what you're talking 
about.

3750
02:35:38,861 --> 02:35:41,050
I go,
you're not fucking saying anything.

3751
02:35:41,230 --> 02:35:46,230
You're not saying anything because you 
know you don't have the latest 

3752
02:35:46,230 --> 02:35:49,381
information.
That kinda shit drives me nuts when 

3753
02:35:49,381 --> 02:35:52,921
someone doesn't really know but pretends
they know is presented with information 

3754
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:56,520
and isn't willing to accept it.
You know,

3755
02:35:56,570 --> 02:35:58,270
you got to be willing to accept 
information.

3756
02:35:58,271 --> 02:36:01,780
Like this lady called up to try to like 
to puff out her chest.

3757
02:36:01,781 --> 02:36:03,460
Like she has the information.
Like she's a,

3758
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:05,770
she's a professor.
She knows,

3759
02:36:05,771 --> 02:36:08,560
but I'm not saying I'm not in the woods 
studying.

3760
02:36:08,770 --> 02:36:11,750
I'm reading all these fucking biologists
who were there there.

3761
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:16,750
This is amazing new discovery.
I mean there's a fucking giant champ 

3762
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:21,061
that lives in the Congo.
There's photos of this thing walking 

3763
02:36:21,061 --> 02:36:21,700
around on two legs.
It's six feet tall.

3764
02:36:21,850 --> 02:36:25,480
I mean there's a huge chimpanzee.
It's far bigger than the other chimps.

3765
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:28,610
They have two different types of champs.
They have treat the,

3766
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:33,370
they call them tree beaters and and 
ground something.

3767
02:36:33,371 --> 02:36:38,371
I forget the term they use,
but these larger chimps literally sleep 

3768
02:36:38,981 --> 02:36:40,600
on the ground.
They don't give a fuck.

3769
02:36:40,930 --> 02:36:42,730
Nothing comes near them.
And the,

3770
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:45,940
Oh the,
what they call them leopardy eaters,

3771
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:48,640
but they've,
they have video of them,

3772
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:53,320
one of them literally eating a leopard 
and they don't know if it killed it.

3773
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:57,790
They don't know if it found a dead,
but like if these motherfuckers can kill

3774
02:36:57,791 --> 02:37:02,791
leopards.
But if you think about how strong a 

3775
02:37:02,791 --> 02:37:02,791
regular chimpanzee is,
you know,

3776
02:37:02,791 --> 02:37:06,280
a regular hundred and 50,
150 pound chimpanzee,

3777
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:09,400
it's supposed to be as strong as a 500 
pound man.

3778
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:11,470
A lion killers.
That's what they call them.

3779
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:14,290
These,
these are huge chimpanzees.

3780
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,940
See if a pull up a photograph,
some of these fuckers,

3781
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:19,820
but they have these,
one of these two guys shot at a,

3782
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:23,540
at an airport and a small airport in the
Congo.

3783
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:26,600
And there's these two guys standing 
holding this carcass.

3784
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:30,290
The righthand side,
third down far right hand side,

3785
02:37:30,291 --> 02:37:32,540
third down far right hand side,
third down,

3786
02:37:32,541 --> 02:37:33,710
third down.
That's it.

3787
02:37:33,711 --> 02:37:34,400
Bam.
That's it.

3788
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:38,120
Go large on that.
Look at a size of that fucking thing.

3789
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:43,240
That's a chimp.
It looks like a goddamn because the size

3790
02:37:43,250 --> 02:37:48,250
of his balls,
I mean that is a fucking huge 

3791
02:37:48,250 --> 02:37:50,820
chimpanzee.
That's one that they found that,

3792
02:37:50,821 --> 02:37:52,820
that they had shot,
they took photographs of,

3793
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:54,770
but if you go above that photo,
Jamie,

3794
02:37:55,070 --> 02:37:58,310
go above that photo to the,
to the upper right hand corner.

3795
02:37:59,210 --> 02:38:01,460
That's one that they caught walking 
around on a,

3796
02:38:01,461 --> 02:38:03,650
on a camera trap.
They're just much,

3797
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:06,230
much bigger than regular chimpanzees as 
wild.

3798
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:07,460
Yeah.
No Pun intended,

3799
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:10,010
but the point was,
this is just,

3800
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:15,400
it was an incidence of someone just 
deciding that they had all the 

3801
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:19,361
information and that they wanted to just
call bullshit on something that they're 

3802
02:38:19,361 --> 02:38:21,320
really.
They really weren't up to date on it.

3803
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:22,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

3804
02:38:22,011 --> 02:38:27,011
I think pride gets in the way.
A lot of that I try my hardest and I 

3805
02:38:27,011 --> 02:38:28,610
actually kind of gets to me when my 
audience are people that watch my stuff,

3806
02:38:28,611 --> 02:38:29,060
say like,
Oh,

3807
02:38:29,090 --> 02:38:30,920
Colin didn't admit he was wrong about 
this,

3808
02:38:30,921 --> 02:38:31,520
this or this.
I'm like,

3809
02:38:31,521 --> 02:38:36,521
I don't know that you're paying very 
close attention because I actually take 

3810
02:38:36,521 --> 02:38:38,471
a lot of pride in being wrong about 
things sometimes and telling you that 

3811
02:38:38,471 --> 02:38:38,780
I'm wrong,
so you know,

3812
02:38:38,930 --> 02:38:41,630
so you're not going out into the world 
with misinformation.

3813
02:38:41,631 --> 02:38:42,980
Whether it was about video games back in
the day,

3814
02:38:42,981 --> 02:38:44,330
whether it's about politics or history.
I got,

3815
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,860
I got,
when you're rattling things off,

3816
02:38:45,861 --> 02:38:47,330
like you were saying,
like when you're rattling things off,

3817
02:38:47,331 --> 02:38:50,160
sometimes you get things mixed up and 
confused and things of like,

3818
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:55,360
I don't even realize it while I'm saying
that I'm saying the wrong word or 

3819
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:55,360
someone's name wrong.

3820
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:55,360
It happens.
And,

3821
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:56,630
and I,
I think that it's,

3822
02:38:56,720 --> 02:38:58,760
I think it's essential to do those kinds
of things.

3823
02:38:58,761 --> 02:39:00,130
And it,
it,

3824
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:00,630
it's,
it,

3825
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:03,200
it represents an academic stagnance when
you don't want to do that.

3826
02:39:03,201 --> 02:39:04,850
I certainly,
um,

3827
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:06,920
even though I consider myself again a 
moderate conservative,

3828
02:39:06,921 --> 02:39:11,921
I certainly have been playing around 
intentionally with really challenging 

3829
02:39:11,921 --> 02:39:11,921
ideas lately to try to,
um,

3830
02:39:12,010 --> 02:39:13,790
you know,
specifically with universal basic income

3831
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:15,620
and,
and Medicare for all where I'm like,

3832
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:18,260
I'm fundamentally principally probably 
against these things.

3833
02:39:18,261 --> 02:39:21,620
But if you can show me how they work,
if I can read some data,

3834
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:26,830
we can get some test cases.
I know they're testing ubi in places 

3835
02:39:26,830 --> 02:39:29,591
like Sweden.
Then I want to see what it's all about 

3836
02:39:29,591 --> 02:39:29,591
because this is so uncomfortable.
This is so out of,

3837
02:39:29,591 --> 02:39:31,970
out of whack for me that I want to know,
you know,

3838
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:34,310
how it works and I think with you on 
that one,

3839
02:39:34,311 --> 02:39:34,880
by the way.
Yeah.

3840
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:35,440
Yeah.
That's a,

3841
02:39:35,441 --> 02:39:37,780
that's an interesting one.
And I believe they're testing it in some

3842
02:39:37,930 --> 02:39:39,790
someplace in the United States.
Are they?

3843
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:45,030
Yeah.
I think somewhere in the United States 

3844
02:39:45,030 --> 02:39:47,041
going to test universal basic income.
So you have a good find that this like 

3845
02:39:47,041 --> 02:39:47,980
fairly recently over the last few days.

3846
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:48,540
It's,
it's,

3847
02:39:48,541 --> 02:39:50,060
uh,
it's just fascinating to kind of get out

3848
02:39:50,061 --> 02:39:50,830
of your head,
you know,

3849
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:55,100
I've been dealing with this idea of this
idea of rights versus privileges and how

3850
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:57,600
were we call a lot of things rights,
but they're not right.

3851
02:39:57,640 --> 02:39:59,900
There's no right to medical the medical 
care that they'll write to that.

3852
02:40:00,210 --> 02:40:02,090
But the idea of A.
I hate when people.

3853
02:40:02,091 --> 02:40:03,540
I guess it's a right to,
to.

3854
02:40:03,710 --> 02:40:05,330
It's human,
right?

3855
02:40:05,350 --> 02:40:05,960
Yeah.
It's not.

3856
02:40:06,350 --> 02:40:07,850
You have a right to,
you're an alien.

3857
02:40:07,890 --> 02:40:12,890
All right.
So the whole life and liberty and stuff 

3858
02:40:12,890 --> 02:40:12,890
like that,
those are rights.

3859
02:40:12,890 --> 02:40:13,440
You don't have a right to force someone 
to do something for you,

3860
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:14,460
is essentially

3861
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:19,460
what you're forcing a doctor to work on 
you if you don't have the money to pay 

3862
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:19,460
for it.
Exactly,

3863
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:23,330
but I think as a culture we should 
probably put that in terms of like what 

3864
02:40:23,330 --> 02:40:27,801
are we going to do for our citizens?
What we would definitely going have 

3865
02:40:27,801 --> 02:40:29,780
provide fire protection.
We're definitely going to provide 

3866
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:33,081
police.
We should definitely provide medical 

3867
02:40:33,081 --> 02:40:33,081
too.
I'm just think it's.

3868
02:40:33,081 --> 02:40:36,140
It should be.
There should be a safety net to keep 

3869
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:36,140
people healthy if they don't have money.
Sure.

3870
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:39,390
I think that it's a,
it's a totally valid thing to say,

3871
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:40,980
uh Oh,
what do we have it is.

3872
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:46,190
Whereas this,
they randomly selected 3000 individuals 

3873
02:40:46,190 --> 02:40:47,280
across two US states participate in this
study.

3874
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:52,460
1,000
received a thousand dollars per month 

3875
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:54,690
for up to five years in 2000 will 
receive $50 per month.

3876
02:40:55,410 --> 02:40:57,560
What does that,
and it's the control for the,

3877
02:40:57,640 --> 02:41:02,640
for the express serve as a control group
for comparison with the $50 for is not 

3878
02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:06,201
going to help shit,
but the thousand dollars per month that 

3879
02:41:06,201 --> 02:41:06,201
that's.

3880
02:41:06,201 --> 02:41:10,160
That gets interesting because then 
you're not giving anybody enough where 

3881
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:13,161
they can fuck off because 250 bucks is 
really not going to pay for rent and 

3882
02:41:13,161 --> 02:41:14,070
food,
but it's a.

3883
02:41:14,071 --> 02:41:16,230
it'll help you give you like a little 
bit of a boost.

3884
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:17,460
Yeah.
It could be good for the economy.

3885
02:41:17,461 --> 02:41:22,461
I think that there's.
There's a lot of worry about inflation 

3886
02:41:22,461 --> 02:41:25,730
because you're basically freeing up a 
ton of money that would otherwise be in 

3887
02:41:25,730 --> 02:41:28,371
banks are not circulating on the market,
so it's gonna make your dollar less 

3888
02:41:28,371 --> 02:41:31,431
valuable.
I think there's a lot of like 

3889
02:41:31,431 --> 02:41:31,431
complicated things economically that 
people have to deal with with that,

3890
02:41:31,431 --> 02:41:36,080
but I feel like you know,
with what you were talking about with 

3891
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:38,571
healthcare,
I think it's an interesting point 

3892
02:41:38,571 --> 02:41:39,681
because we don't.
We talk too much about rights and we 

3893
02:41:39,681 --> 02:41:43,221
have these rights.
You have a right to not be searched 

3894
02:41:43,221 --> 02:41:43,221
without a warrant.

3895
02:41:43,221 --> 02:41:43,221
You have a right to due process,
his free speech rights,

3896
02:41:43,221 --> 02:41:44,070
right,
um,

3897
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,230
that are written in the bill of rights 
and the constitution,

3898
02:41:46,231 --> 02:41:51,000
but,
but privileges a 21st century modern,

3899
02:41:51,570 --> 02:41:53,310
progressive,
wealthy society.

3900
02:41:53,311 --> 02:41:55,500
What can your privileges of being part 
of that society?

3901
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:57,210
And I,
I like when people talk about it in that

3902
02:41:57,211 --> 02:42:02,211
sense and be like medical care as a part
of it is the privilege of being part of 

3903
02:42:02,211 --> 02:42:02,211
a like this.
I'm like,

3904
02:42:02,211 --> 02:42:03,240
okay,
so let's frame the art.

3905
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:08,241
Let's frame the arguments differently 
because I think it's a more compelling 

3906
02:42:08,241 --> 02:42:08,820
way to say we've achieved so much.
We're not in the dark ages anymore.

3907
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:11,190
We're not even in the 18th or 19th 
centuries anymore.

3908
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:13,260
Now we have roads,
we have police and fire,

3909
02:42:13,261 --> 02:42:18,261
we have all these things.
What's to stop us from having the 

3910
02:42:18,261 --> 02:42:20,661
privilege of having this as well.
And I think it's just frame it that way 

3911
02:42:20,661 --> 02:42:24,681
and you'll have way more people on board
and it's a very compelling argument for 

3912
02:42:24,681 --> 02:42:26,040
why we shouldn't spend $800 billion on 
the military.

3913
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:28,680
Like maybe if you had some of that money
freed up,

3914
02:42:28,681 --> 02:42:30,480
you could take care of a lot of things 
at home.

3915
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:31,610
You could,
uh,

3916
02:42:31,710 --> 02:42:33,690
medical care of Medicare for all is 
expensive.

3917
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:35,040
It's extremely expensive.
Streamline.

3918
02:42:35,070 --> 02:42:36,120
You could,
you could actually,

3919
02:42:36,390 --> 02:42:38,160
as far as I understand,
you could,

3920
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:41,430
I think tax,
I'm sorry,

3921
02:42:41,431 --> 02:42:46,431
you could remove military spending 
completely and pay for only like a 

3922
02:42:46,431 --> 02:42:46,431
fourth of it.
So it's,

3923
02:42:46,431 --> 02:42:46,431
it's,
it's,

3924
02:42:46,431 --> 02:42:47,220
it's a,
it's a really radically.

3925
02:42:47,250 --> 02:42:47,880
Really?
Yeah,

3926
02:42:47,881 --> 02:42:49,390
I think so.
$800,

3927
02:42:49,391 --> 02:42:51,390
billion dollars a year would only pay 
for a fourth.

3928
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:53,910
I think it's 600 billion a year of 
spending military spending right now.

3929
02:42:53,911 --> 02:42:55,650
But I think it's,
it's uh,

3930
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:56,340
Jamie,
do you mind,

3931
02:42:56,400 --> 02:43:01,400
I hate to ask you to do something,
but do you mind looking to see how much 

3932
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:04,011
the Medicare for all thing?
Cause I think it's something like one 

3933
02:43:04,011 --> 02:43:06,201
point 5 trillion a year,
so like 2 trillion a year or something 

3934
02:43:06,201 --> 02:43:06,201
like that.
Shit.

3935
02:43:06,201 --> 02:43:10,010
And so like these are the things,
but you have to have rational 

3936
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:11,931
conversations with why I have no respect
for Bernie Sanders because you can just 

3937
02:43:11,931 --> 02:43:11,931
throw things out there.
Yeah.

3938
02:43:11,931 --> 02:43:12,070
One

3939
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:17,070
point $4,000,000,000,000,
so you get Medicare for all plan cost 

3940
02:43:17,070 --> 02:43:18,310
nearly one point 4 trillion.
So a little off.

3941
02:43:18,311 --> 02:43:20,120
So it's a little less than half.
You actually you could.

3942
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,140
He's,
he's a character.

3943
02:43:23,470 --> 02:43:24,010
Well,
it's easy to.

3944
02:43:24,011 --> 02:43:25,600
It's easy to go around promising things 
to people.

3945
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:28,120
Like the funny thing is like Free 
College,

3946
02:43:28,121 --> 02:43:28,870
right?
Like free,

3947
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,370
nothing's free,
but free college.

3948
02:43:30,371 --> 02:43:35,371
It's like,
well you're 401k is going to tax for 

3949
02:43:35,371 --> 02:43:35,371
that.
If you're,

3950
02:43:35,371 --> 02:43:38,611
if you're a middle class family and 
you're making transaction walter 

3951
02:43:38,611 --> 02:43:39,160
transactions,
broker transactions with your forum,

3952
02:43:39,161 --> 02:43:40,360
okay,
you're going to pay that tax.

3953
02:43:40,450 --> 02:43:45,450
You know,
it's easy to say Medicare for all by 

3954
02:43:45,450 --> 02:43:45,450
raising taxes.
But everyone's taxes go up two point two

3955
02:43:45,450 --> 02:43:45,580
percent,
you know,

3956
02:43:45,610 --> 02:43:47,200
not.
I think there's also a real

3957
02:43:47,230 --> 02:43:50,260
concern with kids fucking off with that 
education.

3958
02:43:50,261 --> 02:43:53,200
Like if a,
if an education costs like what is um,

3959
02:43:53,560 --> 02:43:58,560
uh,
per year cost of a very good university 

3960
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:58,560
today.
Oh,

3961
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:58,560
not even like an Ivy League University,
but

3962
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:59,540
probably 20,
$25,000

3963
02:43:59,541 --> 02:44:00,830
a year.
That's a lot of money

3964
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:06,680
if you're just giving that to some kid 
and they half ass their education and 

3965
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:08,010
they don't get kicked out of school and 
it's free like,

3966
02:44:08,011 --> 02:44:11,820
well,
maybe that's not the best use of money,

3967
02:44:11,821 --> 02:44:15,030
but if someone can demonstrate a real 
desire to learn,

3968
02:44:15,690 --> 02:44:20,690
you know,
and a real desire to achieve and to 

3969
02:44:20,690 --> 02:44:23,631
discipline themselves into following 
through with the courses and doing the 

3970
02:44:23,631 --> 02:44:27,051
work,
you maybe then maybe give someone a 

3971
02:44:27,051 --> 02:44:30,711
semester for free and proved by their 
performance in that semester by their 

3972
02:44:31,831 --> 02:44:32,820
effort,
their performance,

3973
02:44:32,821 --> 02:44:34,680
how much work they've done that you 
know,

3974
02:44:34,681 --> 02:44:35,520
okay,
you,

3975
02:44:36,150 --> 02:44:41,150
it's very likely that you can get 
through four years of this university 

3976
02:44:41,150 --> 02:44:45,260
and get out with a bachelor's degree.
Maybe even move on and continue your 

3977
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:49,311
education or become a really valuable 
member of our society and benefit our 

3978
02:44:49,311 --> 02:44:51,570
economy and benefit our.
So our civilization,

3979
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:56,840
because of what you're learning here.
So making an investment in you mean 

3980
02:44:56,840 --> 02:45:00,731
that?
I think that's a valuable thing for our 

3981
02:45:00,731 --> 02:45:00,731
country,
right?

3982
02:45:00,731 --> 02:45:04,160
Have more educated,
less ignorant people have less losers,

3983
02:45:04,230 --> 02:45:04,530
right?

3984
02:45:05,050 --> 02:45:07,400
Yeah.
I think to me,

3985
02:45:07,580 --> 02:45:12,580
I say this,
I guess we're a pace of place of some 

3986
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:12,580
privileges.
I went to college,

3987
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:13,480
I went to a great college and I'm proud 
of that,

3988
02:45:13,481 --> 02:45:15,770
but at the same time I feel like it's 
too.

3989
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:18,880
Why don't we emphasize trade schools 
anymore?

3990
02:45:18,910 --> 02:45:21,310
Why don't we emphasize that you don't 
have to go to college,

3991
02:45:21,311 --> 02:45:22,870
you can be an entrepreneur,
you can start a business.

3992
02:45:23,270 --> 02:45:25,030
I feel like it's all.
It's often too,

3993
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:28,690
it's too much focused on like an 
academic path and I'm like,

3994
02:45:28,691 --> 02:45:33,691
that's good for some people,
but I would argue that there's probably 

3995
02:45:33,691 --> 02:45:36,660
too many people going to college,
especially for things that we were 

3996
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:37,420
talking about earlier on that don't 
really do anything for you.

3997
02:45:37,421 --> 02:45:39,550
If you have a chemistry degree or a 
physics degree or a math degree,

3998
02:45:39,551 --> 02:45:41,950
you're going to be great.
If you have a history degree like I did,

3999
02:45:41,951 --> 02:45:43,730
you have to be very lucky like I was or 
your.

4000
02:45:43,730 --> 02:45:45,150
You might have some hard times,
you know,

4001
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:47,440
or you find something else to do.
Exactly.

4002
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:52,500
Every benefit.
Just from the discipline that you 

4003
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:52,500
learned while you were in school.
Right?

4004
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:52,500
Exactly.
It's,

4005
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:55,991
it's,
it's proof that you can accomplish 

4006
02:45:55,991 --> 02:45:57,571
something,
but I wish that there was more drive to 

4007
02:45:57,571 --> 02:45:57,571
say like we need plumbers,
we need electricians,

4008
02:45:57,571 --> 02:45:58,670
we need.
And you know what?

4009
02:45:59,190 --> 02:46:04,190
Two things,
some of the stupidest people I've ever 

4010
02:46:04,190 --> 02:46:06,391
met went to college.
Some of the smartest people I've ever 

4011
02:46:06,391 --> 02:46:08,941
met,
he didn't go to college and some of the 

4012
02:46:08,941 --> 02:46:09,070
people that I know that are doing the 
best economically are in trades,

4013
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:10,520
not,
they don't have a degree.

4014
02:46:10,521 --> 02:46:11,790
They're electricians,
they,

4015
02:46:11,791 --> 02:46:13,290
they build houses,
they do those kinds of things.

4016
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:14,150
Repair.
Exactly.

4017
02:46:14,151 --> 02:46:16,820
These are essential and these things 
aren't going away either.

4018
02:46:16,970 --> 02:46:18,450
So it's,
I feel like,

4019
02:46:18,830 --> 02:46:20,510
you know,
I look at someone like a mechanic,

4020
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:21,800
I look at it,
a plumber or something like that.

4021
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:22,250
I'm like,
man,

4022
02:46:22,251 --> 02:46:25,220
that's really impressive because I don't
know what the hell you're doing,

4023
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:26,210
you know,
but you,

4024
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:28,370
you know how to wire this house,
you know,

4025
02:46:28,371 --> 02:46:29,780
how to,
to lay the plumbing,

4026
02:46:29,781 --> 02:46:30,890
you know,
how to do all these kinds of things.

4027
02:46:30,891 --> 02:46:33,680
That's a vital service.
And so.

4028
02:46:33,681 --> 02:46:38,681
Exactly.
So I feel like there's almost this like 

4029
02:46:38,681 --> 02:46:38,681
got to go to college,
got to go to college.

4030
02:46:38,681 --> 02:46:38,870
I'm like,
no you don't,

4031
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:43,920
and and the other thing that I think is 
really relevant is that I paid for my 

4032
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:48,101
college and now suddenly and I'm paying 
loans out the ass for my college degree 

4033
02:46:48,101 --> 02:46:51,860
still and I have to now pay for someone 
else's college like and that I,

4034
02:46:51,861 --> 02:46:54,470
I did what I had to do and I don't 
really feel like it's fair that I had to

4035
02:46:54,471 --> 02:46:57,890
owe 60 or $70,000
in loans that I've paid back,

4036
02:46:58,220 --> 02:46:59,840
but someone and then I have to pay 
taxes,

4037
02:46:59,870 --> 02:47:02,240
extra taxes for someone else to go to 
college as well.

4038
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:07,240
It kind of frustrates me in specifically
because the only reason college is so 

4039
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:07,880
expensive is because the government is 
involved in the loans,

4040
02:47:09,750 --> 02:47:11,270
subsidized loans.
Anyone can get a loan.

4041
02:47:11,470 --> 02:47:16,470
If you,
if you in a college and you knew that 

4042
02:47:16,470 --> 02:47:16,470
anyone that came to you could just go 
get a stafford loan,

4043
02:47:16,470 --> 02:47:17,660
right?
You would jack prices up in two seconds.

4044
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:22,690
Of course he would make the loans more,
a more rare and even raise interest 

4045
02:47:23,061 --> 02:47:25,310
rates on those loans and watch what 
happens to the cost of college.

4046
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:28,190
It will plummet because they can't 
justify the cost anymore.

4047
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:30,680
The government made this problem.
Now the government's trying to,

4048
02:47:30,890 --> 02:47:35,890
and this is what I'm talking about,
the government's not trying to solve a 

4049
02:47:35,890 --> 02:47:35,890
problem.
It Matt,

4050
02:47:35,890 --> 02:47:36,050
it totally manufactured on its own.
When did that all begin?

4051
02:47:36,470 --> 02:47:37,220
I don't know.
I think I,

4052
02:47:37,221 --> 02:47:42,221
I don't know for sure.
I think in the seventies it began and 

4053
02:47:42,221 --> 02:47:42,221
then I think it really got out of 
control in the nineties,

4054
02:47:42,221 --> 02:47:46,960
you know,
because I went to northeastern and my 

4055
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:47,300
mom actually worked there,
so I didn't even pay tuition.

4056
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:50,840
I only paid room and board tuition in 
northeastern is like $45,000

4057
02:47:50,841 --> 02:47:55,841
or something a year now.
I know people that went to college that 

4058
02:47:55,841 --> 02:47:55,841
had to pay out,
have those loans strapped to.

4059
02:47:55,841 --> 02:47:57,540
They have two kids in college.
Holy Shit.

4060
02:47:57,541 --> 02:47:58,410
That's incredible.
Like,

4061
02:47:58,750 --> 02:47:59,830
Holy Shit.
And Dude,

4062
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:00,980
I don't,
I don't know what I was,

4063
02:48:00,981 --> 02:48:02,900
you know,
when you're 17 or 18 years old,

4064
02:48:02,901 --> 02:48:04,870
I remember my dad,
my dad's,

4065
02:48:05,220 --> 02:48:06,380
my dad's in New York City,
firefighter.

4066
02:48:06,381 --> 02:48:07,790
Very serious guy.
Right?

4067
02:48:07,970 --> 02:48:09,230
And I remember him sitting down and 
being like,

4068
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:11,800
I'm taking these loans out for you,
I'm coast signing on them and,

4069
02:48:11,801 --> 02:48:13,340
and him kind of looking at me in the eye
and be like,

4070
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:16,670
you will not default on these loans.
You know,

4071
02:48:16,671 --> 02:48:18,760
like he's like,
I know you don't understand it.

4072
02:48:19,370 --> 02:48:20,160
Yeah.
Like being like,

4073
02:48:20,330 --> 02:48:21,750
because you're 17 or 18 years old being 
like,

4074
02:48:21,751 --> 02:48:23,720
yeah,
I don't remember what the fuck is going,

4075
02:48:23,721 --> 02:48:24,740
I'm going to college,
I'm going to,

4076
02:48:24,741 --> 02:48:25,470
you know,
I'm going,

4077
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:26,410
you know,
do whatever I'm going to do.

4078
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:31,450
Look at that.
We really got to control what is the 

4079
02:48:31,450 --> 02:48:32,090
ADC.
So like in the mid,

4080
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:33,710
early to mid eighties is when it got out
of control.

4081
02:48:33,890 --> 02:48:38,390
And then in the nineties the separation,
now look it goes to 2009,

4082
02:48:38,391 --> 02:48:41,080
but in 2009 it's just through the 
fucking roof.

4083
02:48:41,150 --> 02:48:46,150
It's just so the government,
the government did this and now they're 

4084
02:48:46,150 --> 02:48:48,821
trying to solve.
Now Bernie Sanders is running around 

4085
02:48:48,821 --> 02:48:48,821
trying to solve the problem.
It's like,

4086
02:48:48,821 --> 02:48:50,510
and speaking of age and stuff like the 
Democrat,

4087
02:48:50,550 --> 02:48:52,010
he's absolutely going to try to run 
again.

4088
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:53,060
And we're going to.
I think so,

4089
02:48:53,061 --> 02:48:55,250
so old and he'll be 80.
His,

4090
02:48:55,280 --> 02:48:57,140
his head is leaning forward.
Look,

4091
02:48:57,141 --> 02:48:58,760
someone's got to teach them to stand up 
straight.

4092
02:48:59,000 --> 02:48:59,510
Yeah,
he's got,

4093
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:01,840
he's just got that bookish Kinda,
you know,

4094
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:06,850
he's got this thing going on where his 
head is like slowly making its way down 

4095
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:07,590
to his sternum.
You know,

4096
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:07,970
he's

4097
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,680
collapsing like,
like Bernie.

4098
02:49:10,681 --> 02:49:13,140
This is really bad for you though.
That's the thing.

4099
02:49:13,141 --> 02:49:16,190
That's my look.
He would have one.

4100
02:49:16,450 --> 02:49:19,440
Um,
I think if he went up against trump,

4101
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:21,150
I think he would have done much better 
than Hillary.

4102
02:49:21,180 --> 02:49:23,160
It's a brand of populism that would have
been.

4103
02:49:23,161 --> 02:49:25,810
So I think something like 10 percent of 
people that voted for him in the primary

4104
02:49:25,811 --> 02:49:30,811
voted for trump.
So that's a compelling number that 

4105
02:49:30,811 --> 02:49:30,811
suggests what you say is right.
But my whole,

4106
02:49:30,811 --> 02:49:34,370
the x factor in this is the oppo 
research and you got a little bit of 

4107
02:49:34,370 --> 02:49:34,370
taste of what research is.
Oppo,

4108
02:49:34,370 --> 02:49:39,111
oppo opposition research that they never
used on Bernie Sanders because they 

4109
02:49:39,111 --> 02:49:41,811
didn't have to.
And the Republicans have all sorts of 

4110
02:49:41,811 --> 02:49:41,811
stuff on him and it's not even he went,
you know,

4111
02:49:41,811 --> 02:49:43,620
like little things that resonate with 
older people.

4112
02:49:43,621 --> 02:49:44,700
Right.
So like they went,

4113
02:49:44,701 --> 02:49:47,670
him and Jane Sanders went on their 
honeymoon to the Soviet Union.

4114
02:49:48,300 --> 02:49:49,070
That's really weird,
right?

4115
02:49:49,130 --> 02:49:54,130
Fucking Russians.
People that are 20 or 25 don't care 

4116
02:49:54,130 --> 02:49:54,130
about that.
People that are 40,

4117
02:49:54,130 --> 02:49:54,130
45,
50 care a lot about that,

4118
02:49:54,130 --> 02:49:54,130
right?
Yeah.

4119
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:59,220
Um,
went to a communist country to explore 

4120
02:49:59,220 --> 02:49:59,370
the great benefits of the fucking red 
flag,

4121
02:49:59,650 --> 02:50:04,650
which of which there are none,
just like Lee Harvey Oswald cool domes 

4122
02:50:04,741 --> 02:50:06,360
in their building.
Very unique building.

4123
02:50:06,361 --> 02:50:07,450
Good architecture.
Yeah.

4124
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:09,090
I keep asking people though,
because everyone,

4125
02:50:09,091 --> 02:50:14,091
you know,
that you have these crazy people on 

4126
02:50:14,091 --> 02:50:15,500
twitter and stuff that have the hammer 
and sickle and their names and stuff 

4127
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:15,500
like that.
And I'm like,

4128
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:16,060
can anyone tell me one thing that the 
Soviet Union gave us?

4129
02:50:16,070 --> 02:50:19,730
Like gave the world one thing that 
anyone that anyone cares about.

4130
02:50:20,070 --> 02:50:21,540
Yeah.
But that's Russian.

4131
02:50:21,541 --> 02:50:22,390
That's not even Soviet.
Right?

4132
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:25,350
Like tetris came from the Soviet Union 
in the game.

4133
02:50:25,351 --> 02:50:26,940
Yeah.
That might be the most important thing.

4134
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:31,960
Good.
God Damn game communism is so morally 

4135
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:31,960
and intellectually bankrupt.

4136
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:34,140
It's incredible to me that anyone would 
even argue it.

4137
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:37,020
It's just as morally and intellectually 
bankrupt as the far right,

4138
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:42,070
you know,
that seems to be the thing that people 

4139
02:50:42,070 --> 02:50:43,971
go to when they look at some sort of a 
viable alternative without looking into 

4140
02:50:43,971 --> 02:50:44,730
a deeply Marxism,
you know,

4141
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:50,060
and that this idea of socialism is going
to be a good thing because everybody's 

4142
02:50:50,060 --> 02:50:51,180
going to contribute and capitalism is 
what's wrong with the world.

4143
02:50:51,181 --> 02:50:52,830
And like,
Ooh,

4144
02:50:52,890 --> 02:50:54,330
and whenever people,
they,

4145
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:56,640
they always like to hit up this fucking 
thing of,

4146
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:57,490
you know,
uh,

4147
02:50:58,540 --> 02:51:00,810
the,
the economic inequality,

4148
02:51:00,930 --> 02:51:04,140
economic inequality and inequality of 
income,

4149
02:51:04,141 --> 02:51:09,141
inequality of money.
But what people don't seem to get is 

4150
02:51:09,301 --> 02:51:14,301
that when you have true freedom,
you're absolutely going to have 

4151
02:51:14,301 --> 02:51:17,511
inequality.
Because if you have the true freedom to 

4152
02:51:17,511 --> 02:51:19,851
do whatever you want,
some people aren't going to do much and 

4153
02:51:19,851 --> 02:51:23,841
some people are going to do a lot is 
going to be some Jeff Bezos types 

4154
02:51:23,841 --> 02:51:27,111
characters out there who just want to 
fucking go gangbusters and own half the 

4155
02:51:27,111 --> 02:51:27,111
country.

4156
02:51:27,111 --> 02:51:31,760
And then there's going to be people that
would really rather just work a little 

4157
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,141
bit and then go play fucking disc golf 
and smoke pot and listen to records and 

4158
02:51:36,391 --> 02:51:41,391
hang out with their friends.
And they'd be very happy if they just 

4159
02:51:41,391 --> 02:51:42,270
made an income that was sustainable.
There's,

4160
02:51:42,310 --> 02:51:45,570
there's a host of different 
personalities.

4161
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:49,290
There's some people that really enjoy 
doing art and they liked to go down to a

4162
02:51:49,291 --> 02:51:52,620
fucking farmer's market and set up shop 
and sell their artwork.

4163
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:54,340
And that's fine for them.
They,

4164
02:51:54,341 --> 02:51:57,180
that's what they want to do.
That's how they want to live their life.

4165
02:51:57,181 --> 02:52:00,750
And maybe their dad was a fucking doctor
who died at 55 of a heart attack because

4166
02:52:00,751 --> 02:52:02,670
he was working too hard.
Or you know,

4167
02:52:02,790 --> 02:52:05,980
who knows what it is that causes someone
have the ambition or

4168
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:09,610
the desires that they have.
But when you have true freedom to pursue

4169
02:52:09,611 --> 02:52:12,670
whatever you want,
that literally breeds inequality.

4170
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:15,850
Because there are going to be people 
that decide to do more.

4171
02:52:16,390 --> 02:52:18,700
And there's going to be people in,
whether it's a,

4172
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:23,760
an egalitarian version of this,
whether these people are altruistic in 

4173
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:25,030
their approach,
whether they're,

4174
02:52:25,031 --> 02:52:25,530
uh,
the,

4175
02:52:25,531 --> 02:52:25,890
the,
the,

4176
02:52:25,891 --> 02:52:30,891
they donate an incredible amount to 
charity or whether or not they keep it 

4177
02:52:30,891 --> 02:52:34,471
all to themselves.
If you have real freedom like that 

4178
02:52:34,471 --> 02:52:38,161
doesn't say you have to donate x amount 
of your money to this and y amount of 

4179
02:52:38,161 --> 02:52:40,390
your money to that.
If you just give people freedom,

4180
02:52:40,990 --> 02:52:45,430
you're going to have any quality because
people are in equal in their efforts.

4181
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:48,280
They're equal in their desires,
their equal in their focus.

4182
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:53,420
They're equal in their discipline.
You are and there are equal in their 

4183
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:53,420
capabilities.

4184
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:53,420
Yup.
No,

4185
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:58,230
that's the major thing.
That's a big one that people don't want 

4186
02:52:58,230 --> 02:52:58,230
to talk about anymore.
I often,

4187
02:52:58,230 --> 02:52:58,230
yes,
I asked.

4188
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:03,540
It's kind of a rough thing to say,
but I've had conversations with people 

4189
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:03,540
where I'm like,
when did people stop saying like,

4190
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:03,730
wow,
that kid is just dumb.

4191
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Like like,
like I remember even growing up in the 

4192
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:10,000
eighties and early nineties where like,
it's like some dms guild,

4193
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,660
there's nothing wrong with them,
you know,

4194
02:53:11,870 --> 02:53:13,330
they don't have a disability or anything
like that,

4195
02:53:13,331 --> 02:53:15,700
but it's just like this kid doesn't 
really have the capability of going,

4196
02:53:15,750 --> 02:53:20,750
he's going to do something else with his
life now it's like everyone can do 

4197
02:53:20,750 --> 02:53:20,750
anything at any given time.
And I'm like,

4198
02:53:20,750 --> 02:53:20,750
no,
you work,

4199
02:53:20,750 --> 02:53:22,960
you have some innate quality to you but 
your work,

4200
02:53:22,961 --> 02:53:23,810
you study,
you,

4201
02:53:23,870 --> 02:53:25,570
you toil,
you do those kinds of things.

4202
02:53:25,571 --> 02:53:28,630
Not Everything is,
is delivered on a platter to everyone.

4203
02:53:28,660 --> 02:53:30,400
And I re,
I almost resent that,

4204
02:53:30,460 --> 02:53:35,460
you know,
because some people really work very 

4205
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:35,460
hard and some people don't work hard at 
all.

4206
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:36,280
And then like you're saying the outcome 
should be equal.

4207
02:53:36,430 --> 02:53:38,620
I don't think so.
It is some people that are tall,

4208
02:53:38,621 --> 02:53:43,621
there's some people that are short and 
there's some people that have brains 

4209
02:53:43,621 --> 02:53:44,740
that are made at a dog shit and there's 
not much you can do about that.

4210
02:53:44,770 --> 02:53:47,800
There is absolutely a broad spectrum of 
human intelligence,

4211
02:53:47,950 --> 02:53:52,330
of awareness and you know how much of 
that is the environment they grew up in,

4212
02:53:52,331 --> 02:53:55,020
how much of that is their education,
how much of that is there a Bra?

4213
02:53:55,021 --> 02:53:56,530
Genetics,
who knows,

4214
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:58,750
and there's environmental factors that 
fuck people up,

4215
02:53:58,751 --> 02:53:59,340
right?
Like this.

4216
02:53:59,341 --> 02:54:04,341
This is real arguments that are living 
around toxic waste is very damaging to 

4217
02:54:04,341 --> 02:54:04,341
your Iq.
You know there's,

4218
02:54:04,341 --> 02:54:08,080
there's a lot going on with human beings
and it's not fair,

4219
02:54:08,081 --> 02:54:10,300
but here when you play cards,
okay,

4220
02:54:10,301 --> 02:54:14,140
if you hit four aces and I get one too 
and a bunch of fucking random numbers,

4221
02:54:14,141 --> 02:54:19,141
that's not fair either,
but I have to figure out a way to win 

4222
02:54:19,141 --> 02:54:19,141
with this hand.

4223
02:54:19,141 --> 02:54:23,070
You know,
or get by and if it truly is a 

4224
02:54:23,070 --> 02:54:25,930
competition and you got a shitty hand,
you got to do your best,

4225
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:28,000
do your best with the hand you got.
You know,

4226
02:54:28,001 --> 02:54:30,880
if you are a dwarf and you want to be a 
basketball player,

4227
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:33,370
you're going to have to let that go.
You can't do that.

4228
02:54:33,490 --> 02:54:35,500
You know what else you can't do?
You can't fly.

4229
02:54:35,560 --> 02:54:38,230
You can't breathe under water,
you can't see through walls,

4230
02:54:38,410 --> 02:54:39,970
you know,
you can't run a million miles an hour.

4231
02:54:39,971 --> 02:54:41,770
Okay.
Those were the things you can't do,

4232
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:47,280
so let's,
let's figure out what you can do and 

4233
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:47,380
find something that you can be 
passionate about.

4234
02:54:47,850 --> 02:54:50,080
And I think capitalism as an economic 
system,

4235
02:54:50,081 --> 02:54:52,240
the only one that I ca that accommodates
all right.

4236
02:54:52,241 --> 02:54:54,050
And I exactly it it,
it's,

4237
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:59,080
it's such a trite thing,
but it's like it's the least imperfect 

4238
02:54:59,080 --> 02:54:59,080
of all the systems,
right?

4239
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:01,330
Like there's nothing positive about 
something like communism.

4240
02:55:01,331 --> 02:55:06,331
To me,
I think like whenever I see that hammer 

4241
02:55:06,331 --> 02:55:06,331
and sickle

4242
02:55:06,331 --> 02:55:06,470
and I don't mean to be mean,
whenever I see that hammer and sickle on

4243
02:55:06,471 --> 02:55:07,130
a person's name,
I'm like,

4244
02:55:07,131 --> 02:55:08,630
I'm not really dealing with someone with
a full deck.

4245
02:55:08,631 --> 02:55:09,170
I don't think.
Like,

4246
02:55:09,171 --> 02:55:14,171
I don't know how you can possibly like 
read Marx and do all these kinds of 

4247
02:55:14,171 --> 02:55:14,171
things.
Jumped deep into history.

4248
02:55:14,171 --> 02:55:15,020
Look at the Soviet Union,
look at North Korea,

4249
02:55:15,021 --> 02:55:20,021
look at Cuba,
look at all of the failure that's 

4250
02:55:20,021 --> 02:55:22,391
happening all around you.
Then look at the fact that everyone is 

4251
02:55:22,391 --> 02:55:22,550
benefiting from capitalism in some way.
They're just doing it wrong,

4252
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:25,190
yet it's not real communism.
It's not real socialism.

4253
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:26,480
That's always this.
It was the answer.

4254
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:31,870
I mean real capitalism.
The worst aspects of capitalism are 

4255
02:55:31,870 --> 02:55:35,960
diminishing appreciation for the human 
being and the fact that money is power 

4256
02:55:36,711 --> 02:55:41,711
over everything and that people just 
acquire material goods and all those 

4257
02:55:41,711 --> 02:55:45,791
things are true,
but they're true at the farthest end of 

4258
02:55:45,791 --> 02:55:47,630
the spectrum of good to bad,
right?

4259
02:55:47,810 --> 02:55:52,810
The furthest end of like,
what is the damage that capitalism can 

4260
02:55:52,810 --> 02:55:55,391
do well can you can devalue human life 
to the point where money becomes more 

4261
02:55:55,391 --> 02:56:00,151
and more powerful than anything and 
people can consolidate this money and 

4262
02:56:00,151 --> 02:56:04,181
build these all girl family structures 
and you know there's a lot of issues 

4263
02:56:04,220 --> 02:56:09,220
that can happen,
but that can happen with anything where 

4264
02:56:09,220 --> 02:56:09,770
people have leverage and power over 
other people.

4265
02:56:09,820 --> 02:56:12,050
It doesn't necessarily mean they have to
happen that way.

4266
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:15,080
There's,
there's got to be some evidence and some

4267
02:56:15,110 --> 02:56:17,360
instances,
instances of altruistic.

4268
02:56:17,430 --> 02:56:18,530
I'm a capitalist.

4269
02:56:18,530 --> 02:56:20,390
I'm like,
Bill Gates for instance.

4270
02:56:20,660 --> 02:56:23,120
That guy does a lot of really good 
things,

4271
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:24,020
you know,
and his,

4272
02:56:24,050 --> 02:56:27,620
the Bill Gates Foundation and that he.
He has started up,

4273
02:56:27,950 --> 02:56:28,760
I mean,
God damn,

4274
02:56:28,761 --> 02:56:32,240
he's donated.
A shitload of money will go to charity.

4275
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:34,400
I mean,
that's a good example.

4276
02:56:34,401 --> 02:56:36,740
Another good example is Warren Buffet.
Warren Buffet has,

4277
02:56:36,830 --> 02:56:41,830
I believe,
donating almost all of his money to 

4278
02:56:41,830 --> 02:56:41,830
charities.
I mean,

4279
02:56:41,830 --> 02:56:44,000
and these are guys that are wildly 
successful.

4280
02:56:44,150 --> 02:56:49,150
I mean you're talking billions and 
billions of dollars in wealth attained 

4281
02:56:49,150 --> 02:56:50,600
entirely through capitalism.
It like,

4282
02:56:50,601 --> 02:56:54,830
so you have your bad examples,
but you also have good examples.

4283
02:56:55,010 --> 02:56:56,900
I mean,
what Bill Gates has done,

4284
02:56:56,901 --> 02:57:00,290
I mean really incredibly impressive when
you stop and think about it,

4285
02:57:00,330 --> 02:57:01,810
get the bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation,

4286
02:57:01,811 --> 02:57:03,820
wherever they call it,
is like super influential.

4287
02:57:04,030 --> 02:57:05,180
Uh,
I,

4288
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:10,300
I look at it in the sense of yes,
there are negatives about all of these 

4289
02:57:10,300 --> 02:57:11,260
things like you were saying,
but I also feel like,

4290
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:14,980
are you eating today in half the world?
Because that's because of capitalism.

4291
02:57:14,981 --> 02:57:15,690
Are you,
you know,

4292
02:57:15,691 --> 02:57:17,780
like capitalism,
the industrial revolution that,

4293
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:22,800
that got,
that got everything going in the last 

4294
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:22,800
150 years is all because of the 
necessity of,

4295
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:25,240
of the chase of the dollar or the pound 
or whatever the case might be.

4296
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:29,410
Like the chase for money is not in 
itself a negative thing.

4297
02:57:29,530 --> 02:57:31,150
It's what you're saying,
what you do with it.

4298
02:57:31,360 --> 02:57:33,940
And the ramifications of what we get 
because of money,

4299
02:57:33,970 --> 02:57:35,110
you know,
is an amazing thing.

4300
02:57:35,111 --> 02:57:37,850
I often talk about whether it's good or 
bad is,

4301
02:57:37,890 --> 02:57:39,280
you know,
when apple one,

4302
02:57:39,281 --> 02:57:42,340
the apple one computer was being made in
the mid seventies,

4303
02:57:42,830 --> 02:57:47,830
you know,
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs used to go 

4304
02:57:47,830 --> 02:57:47,830
to this thing called homebrew Computer 
Club in Berkeley.

4305
02:57:47,830 --> 02:57:52,230
And people would go there.
There was this real spirit in the 

4306
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,240
seventies amongst tinkerers that they 
would share their stuff with each other,

4307
02:57:52,241 --> 02:57:53,710
that they would be like,
this is how I did this.

4308
02:57:53,711 --> 02:57:56,200
This is how I programmed this very 
rudimentary punch card machine.

4309
02:57:56,201 --> 02:58:01,201
This is.
And they were going with apple one to 

4310
02:58:01,201 --> 02:58:02,040
this thing and uh,
Wazniak had really

4311
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:07,040
wanted to give it away to be like this 
revolutionary computer that we are 

4312
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:11,091
sitting on here.
We're just going to give you the tools 

4313
02:58:11,091 --> 02:58:11,091
to make your own.
Steve jobs was the one that said like,

4314
02:58:11,091 --> 02:58:15,830
we have something here that can become 
more ubiquitous if we make it into a 

4315
02:58:15,830 --> 02:58:18,450
product that we sell as opposed to 
something that stays within the confines

4316
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:21,540
of the Berkeley homebrew computer club 
were at 15.

4317
02:58:21,541 --> 02:58:23,640
People will enjoy it.
We can mark it this bad boy.

4318
02:58:24,030 --> 02:58:27,870
And so it takes sometimes a person who 
has the most number,

4319
02:58:27,871 --> 02:58:32,871
it costs $766 and 66,
four K of Ram ram rather.

4320
02:58:33,691 --> 02:58:35,640
That's amazing.
That's amazing.

4321
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:41,000
So you know what I'm saying?
Like it takes some times for things to 

4322
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:41,000
proliferate.
Sometimes for things to do good,

4323
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:45,230
there has to be a profit motive and 
sometimes you need a steve jobs who 

4324
02:58:45,230 --> 02:58:45,230
didn't have the intellect.

4325
02:58:45,230 --> 02:58:46,380
That was me.
I had on a programming perspective,

4326
02:58:46,530 --> 02:58:48,990
but saw products for what they were.
Went into Xerox,

4327
02:58:49,050 --> 02:58:50,700
saw the guy,
saw the mouse,

4328
02:58:50,850 --> 02:58:55,850
saw the ethernet cable,
knew what to do with these different 

4329
02:58:55,850 --> 02:58:55,850
things.
That's the beauty of capitalism to me.

4330
02:58:55,850 --> 02:59:00,410
You know,
that's one incentive for him to pursue 

4331
02:59:00,410 --> 02:59:00,410
these goals.
Exactly,

4332
02:59:00,410 --> 02:59:00,410
and we all benefit.
Look at,

4333
02:59:00,410 --> 02:59:02,940
look at our smart phones.
Ten years ago that we'd had no idea what

4334
02:59:02,941 --> 02:59:04,800
these things are going to become and 
look at the economy.

4335
02:59:04,801 --> 02:59:09,801
They opened up 10 years ago.
You were psyched if your phone flipped 

4336
02:59:09,801 --> 02:59:09,801
open.
Yeah,

4337
02:59:09,801 --> 02:59:10,650
it was all he could do that thing with 
the risk where had opened without you.

4338
02:59:10,730 --> 02:59:12,600
Yeah.
Kirk out slap it shut.

4339
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,250
Do you remember the matrix phone when it
came out?

4340
02:59:14,251 --> 02:59:18,000
Like it shot open and they're like,
no one could ever get one and now I feel

4341
02:59:18,001 --> 02:59:19,920
like a lot of people one on one.
Do you remember that at all?

4342
02:59:19,950 --> 02:59:21,960
What's the major phone that when the 
matrix came out,

4343
02:59:21,961 --> 02:59:23,250
the first,
the first one,

4344
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:27,070
they all had a cell phone.
It was made by Sony and the bottom of it

4345
02:59:27,071 --> 02:59:28,520
shot out.
Instead of flipping open,

4346
02:59:28,530 --> 02:59:33,530
you like hit a little button and it's 
like he jumped down and it never was 

4347
02:59:33,530 --> 02:59:34,020
released for like a consumer.

4348
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:37,010
Why not?
Capitalism wasn't already late.

4349
02:59:37,011 --> 02:59:42,011
Capitalism wasn't ready for that phone.
Bernie Sanders were released for free 

4350
02:59:42,011 --> 02:59:45,680
for him.
I think he's in unique character because

4351
02:59:45,681 --> 02:59:47,720
he's an antiestablishment character.
He's interesting.

4352
02:59:47,750 --> 02:59:52,750
Well,
that goes back to the point you were 

4353
02:59:52,750 --> 02:59:53,771
making.
That's why he came up is because you 

4354
02:59:53,771 --> 02:59:53,780
said he could maybe be trump.
I think the shared populous message here

4355
02:59:53,781 --> 02:59:53,960
it is

4356
02:59:55,030 --> 02:59:57,160
version of it might've finally came out 
I guess,

4357
02:59:57,190 --> 02:59:57,610
but um,

4358
02:59:57,710 --> 03:00:01,730
how does it work?
I'm confused that this shot out and it's

4359
03:00:01,731 --> 03:00:03,670
just covered up the thing instead of 
flipping open.

4360
03:00:03,790 --> 03:00:08,790
Oh,
it's like you press a button and it 

4361
03:00:08,790 --> 03:00:08,790
slides down.

4362
03:00:08,790 --> 03:00:08,790
Yeah.
I mean that's when they were running and

4363
03:00:08,790 --> 03:00:09,820
like trinity was running shoe,
just do it.

4364
03:00:09,821 --> 03:00:10,890
And they were like,
we need an operator.

4365
03:00:11,070 --> 03:00:12,150
Oh,
that's hilarious.

4366
03:00:12,300 --> 03:00:14,820
Isn't it crazy that we thought that was 
the shit?

4367
03:00:15,270 --> 03:00:17,280
It's not even that long ago.
That's what's so funny about it,

4368
03:00:17,310 --> 03:00:18,400
you know?
Well,

4369
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:23,420
I had a blackberry.
I thought it was a wizard for super 

4370
03:00:23,491 --> 03:00:25,500
technological too.
I had a blackberry.

4371
03:00:25,650 --> 03:00:28,020
Is that it?
It slides open spiral.

4372
03:00:28,021 --> 03:00:30,180
It has a screen and the bottom.
Isn't that funny?

4373
03:00:30,181 --> 03:00:32,130
They never thought you would ever be 
able to type on a screen.

4374
03:00:32,131 --> 03:00:34,650
Like that's just ridiculous.
Get the fuck out of here with that.

4375
03:00:34,651 --> 03:00:35,640
You need buttons,
man.

4376
03:00:36,390 --> 03:00:39,060
Remember that?
One of them bitches.

4377
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:41,970
I had one of those with the keyboard.
I love that thing.

4378
03:00:42,270 --> 03:00:44,850
It's great and send emails.
I never did,

4379
03:00:44,851 --> 03:00:45,780
but you could,
but you could.

4380
03:00:46,210 --> 03:00:46,780
Yeah,
you could.

4381
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:49,050
If you wanted to send half my emails on 
my phone.

4382
03:00:49,051 --> 03:00:54,051
Now I think about like I love thinking 
about the iphone and the smartphone 

4383
03:00:54,601 --> 03:00:59,601
revolution and then all of the 
businesses that are totally based on 

4384
03:00:59,601 --> 03:00:59,880
that thing,
that uber or

4385
03:01:00,170 --> 03:01:05,170
a Lyft,
all of these companies that only exist 

4386
03:01:05,170 --> 03:01:07,471
because that product existed only 
because someone saw the capital 

4387
03:01:07,471 --> 03:01:10,291
investment necessary to proliferate this
thing and I think it's amazing as it is 

4388
03:01:10,291 --> 03:01:13,060
and communism doesn't give you that 
exactly as you're saying.

4389
03:01:13,070 --> 03:01:18,070
Them in capitalism is responsible for 
this intense competition and these cats 

4390
03:01:18,400 --> 03:01:22,630
and these smartphones now where they are
legitimate contenders to apple.

4391
03:01:22,631 --> 03:01:25,630
Now like apple just released the iphone 
10 or the x,

4392
03:01:25,631 --> 03:01:26,680
whatever the fuck they're going to call 
it,

4393
03:01:27,010 --> 03:01:30,970
but you have legitimate contenders in 
the Samsung Galaxy.

4394
03:01:30,971 --> 03:01:35,971
Note eight,
the Galaxy s eight and the Google Pixel 

4395
03:01:35,971 --> 03:01:39,511
two xl.
You have these three phones that a lot 

4396
03:01:39,511 --> 03:01:41,110
of people compare favorably to the 
iphone.

4397
03:01:41,111 --> 03:01:44,680
They're going back and forth with this 
and it's like it's a neck and neck race.

4398
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:49,880
Now.
It's a matter of whether or not the 

4399
03:01:49,880 --> 03:01:50,080
integration with the operating system is
important to you because a lot of people

4400
03:01:50,081 --> 03:01:53,780
enjoy using a Mac and an apple computer 
and you know,

4401
03:01:53,800 --> 03:01:58,800
they want to have the phone seamlessly 
integrated with the computer and then a 

4402
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:03,181
lot of other people use windows and they
prefer to use an android phone because 

4403
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:03,181
of that.

4404
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:03,181
So it's,
you're,

4405
03:02:03,181 --> 03:02:06,010
you're dealing with massive competition 
now,

4406
03:02:06,011 --> 03:02:09,850
which is fueling apple to innovate,
fueling samsung to innovate and me,

4407
03:02:09,851 --> 03:02:14,851
right now it's just phones and you know,
who knows whether or not it's really 

4408
03:02:14,851 --> 03:02:16,810
important to us,
but that could lead to bigger and better

4409
03:02:16,811 --> 03:02:21,811
things.
No one saw the smartphone coming and 

4410
03:02:21,811 --> 03:02:22,240
that's really revolutionized the way we 
exchange information,

4411
03:02:22,241 --> 03:02:25,750
the way we gather information,
Google's new pixel xl,

4412
03:02:26,050 --> 03:02:28,390
you squeeze the side and ask you a 
question,

4413
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:31,090
like that's how quick the assistant 
comes in as well.

4414
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:35,680
So you squeeze the side and you say,
tell me who Collin Moriarty is.

4415
03:02:35,770 --> 03:02:37,920
Bam.
It shows you instantaneous,

4416
03:02:37,921 --> 03:02:40,830
a sexist pig,
a joke,

4417
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:45,840
and he should die.
What does that Jamie foldable screens 

4418
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:46,360
that are headed out the next couple of 
years.

4419
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:47,290
Excellent.
The next thing,

4420
03:02:47,350 --> 03:02:48,670
what the fuck,
man,

4421
03:02:48,730 --> 03:02:53,730
it's crazy.
This slap wrist thing where you're 

4422
03:02:53,730 --> 03:02:54,940
talking about with the fucking tape 
measures and as you know Korean company,

4423
03:02:54,941 --> 03:02:58,150
lg is doing this for altruistic reasons.
They're not going to make any money.

4424
03:02:58,151 --> 03:02:59,660
They don't see any money in the foldable
skirt.

4425
03:03:00,100 --> 03:03:01,680
Pull it.
Bernie Sanders.

4426
03:03:04,530 --> 03:03:09,530
Yeah.
He's going to support his neck with one 

4427
03:03:09,530 --> 03:03:11,281
of those phones.
Get when them bitches just shoot under 

4428
03:03:11,281 --> 03:03:12,010
to keep his head above water.
I get a phone call.

4429
03:03:12,011 --> 03:03:13,610
I looked down.
He,

4430
03:03:13,720 --> 03:03:17,920
I think we're in an incredible time when
it comes to this competition though,

4431
03:03:17,921 --> 03:03:20,740
and you're right,
that only exists if people have profit.

4432
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:24,100
You only exist that people have some 
sort of A.

4433
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:26,830
There's competition and there's an 
incentive and you know,

4434
03:03:26,831 --> 03:03:31,831
it was.
There's a battle going on between these 

4435
03:03:31,831 --> 03:03:32,350
and I think that's the forefront of it 
because with laptops,

4436
03:03:32,370 --> 03:03:34,960
I mean there's competition but boys 
kinda stagnant,

4437
03:03:35,020 --> 03:03:35,650
you know,
it's like,

4438
03:03:35,651 --> 03:03:40,651
okay,
well how much processing power do you 

4439
03:03:40,651 --> 03:03:40,651
need?
If you're not rendering video games,

4440
03:03:40,651 --> 03:03:42,250
if you're not making things,
if you're not making movies,

4441
03:03:42,370 --> 03:03:45,910
if you're a person that's making CGI or 
filmed or something like that,

4442
03:03:45,911 --> 03:03:50,911
well then it makes sense.
You could probably use the faster 

4443
03:03:50,911 --> 03:03:51,070
processors and all the power and stuff 
like that,

4444
03:03:51,071 --> 03:03:56,071
but really the competition is in video 
games and in or in a video and apps and 

4445
03:03:57,050 --> 03:04:02,050
phones and the images these phones can 
create and all of them now have the 

4446
03:04:02,050 --> 03:04:05,681
ability to do portrait mode where they 
blur the background and bring you into 

4447
03:04:05,681 --> 03:04:10,661
the foreground and then the Google Pixel
xl has some incredible ai for altering 

4448
03:04:11,361 --> 03:04:14,870
images and making them look cooler and 
it's really amazing stuff,

4449
03:04:14,871 --> 03:04:15,170
man.

4450
03:04:15,290 --> 03:04:16,270
Yeah,
it's awesome and I.

4451
03:04:16,271 --> 03:04:19,490
I feel like a lot of the cool stuff that
we even dwell on from back in the day,

4452
03:04:19,491 --> 03:04:24,491
everything had a profit motive back in.
Especially like we were talking about 

4453
03:04:24,491 --> 03:04:24,491
the age of exploration,
like they weren't looking.

4454
03:04:24,491 --> 03:04:29,441
They didn't want to come here.
The Europeans were just looking for a 

4455
03:04:29,441 --> 03:04:31,811
way to shorten their trade with Asia.
They didn't care about what was in 

4456
03:04:31,811 --> 03:04:31,811
between.
It was actually,

4457
03:04:31,811 --> 03:04:31,811
it's super inconvenient that we were 
here,

4458
03:04:31,811 --> 03:04:36,670
you know,
like there was always money at the end 

4459
03:04:36,670 --> 03:04:36,670
of the tunnel for like good things.
So that's why.

4460
03:04:36,670 --> 03:04:40,510
That's what the space race,
that's why the space race is so unique 

4461
03:04:40,510 --> 03:04:40,510
because it had no,
you know,

4462
03:04:40,510 --> 03:04:41,900
like everything from like mercury and 
Gemini.

4463
03:04:42,170 --> 03:04:44,300
Apollo missions had like no real reason 
to exist.

4464
03:04:44,301 --> 03:04:45,830
Other than that we wanted the best,
the communist,

4465
03:04:45,831 --> 03:04:49,040
there was no financial reason to do it,
which is why it's so unique.

4466
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:49,600
And,
and I,

4467
03:04:49,630 --> 03:04:54,630
I would even argue to this day like 
there's technology that NASA is created 

4468
03:04:54,630 --> 03:04:56,600
that we find in our everyday lives,
but it's like one of those unique places

4469
03:04:56,601 --> 03:04:58,380
where that's not really true,
but there's also

4470
03:04:58,950 --> 03:05:02,410
right that subsistence living probably 
makes healthier,

4471
03:05:02,411 --> 03:05:07,411
happier people.
And then all this chasing money and 

4472
03:05:07,411 --> 03:05:08,360
chasing innovation and chasing,
you know,

4473
03:05:08,590 --> 03:05:13,590
technological superiority just leaves us
with this hollow feeling or it doesn't 

4474
03:05:13,590 --> 03:05:14,890
do you any good.
Like you're seeing a lot of these people

4475
03:05:14,891 --> 03:05:19,891
that.
There was this guy that we were talking 

4476
03:05:19,891 --> 03:05:22,231
about recently,
the guy who he coded facebook likes and 

4477
03:05:22,231 --> 03:05:27,121
now he,
your computer is trying to hijack your 

4478
03:05:27,121 --> 03:05:27,121
brain,
I think is the name of the article.

4479
03:05:27,121 --> 03:05:28,480
Your smartphone is trying to hijack your
brain.

4480
03:05:28,810 --> 03:05:33,810
And what it was essentially saying is 
that your brain is not designed to deal 

4481
03:05:34,361 --> 03:05:39,361
with the reward system that's involved 
in checking likes on facebook or 

4482
03:05:39,361 --> 03:05:40,360
instagram or stuff like that.
And that,

4483
03:05:40,361 --> 03:05:41,160
these things,
these,

4484
03:05:41,310 --> 03:05:43,080
this constant like,
um.

4485
03:05:43,810 --> 03:05:44,480
Um,
I,

4486
03:05:44,750 --> 03:05:45,240
I,
uh,

4487
03:05:45,310 --> 03:05:48,100
yesterday we were talking about this.
We were talking about,

4488
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:50,280
uh,
I had Jamie Kilstein,

4489
03:05:50,320 --> 03:05:55,320
he was talking about checking his phone,
like constantly checking twitter on his 

4490
03:05:55,320 --> 03:05:55,320
phone and arguing back and forth with 
people.

4491
03:05:55,320 --> 03:06:00,090
Seeing who supporting him,
who's not in that it becomes this 

4492
03:06:00,090 --> 03:06:01,630
massive addictive thing and that how 
unhealthy that is.

4493
03:06:01,750 --> 03:06:06,750
You know,
it's like there's a lot of things about 

4494
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:09,211
this technological world that we live in
that maybe aren't sustainable or aren't 

4495
03:06:09,211 --> 03:06:11,860
compatible with being a biological human
being.

4496
03:06:11,970 --> 03:06:14,040
I agree.
It's hated,

4497
03:06:14,130 --> 03:06:19,130
mentioned again,
but there's an episode of Black Mirror 

4498
03:06:19,130 --> 03:06:19,260
where there's this one person in this 
cast where they refuse to get this,

4499
03:06:19,530 --> 03:06:21,960
this augment that everyone else has.
I want to read it for you anymore.

4500
03:06:22,080 --> 03:06:27,080
And it makes them this unique thing 
because they refuse to partake in the 

4501
03:06:27,080 --> 03:06:28,470
new normal of interconnectivity.
And uh,

4502
03:06:28,520 --> 03:06:29,000
it's,
it's,

4503
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:30,540
it's,
again,

4504
03:06:30,541 --> 03:06:32,280
it goes back to the beauty of the system
that there is choice.

4505
03:06:32,281 --> 03:06:37,281
Like you were saying,
the Bohemian painter that just wants to 

4506
03:06:37,281 --> 03:06:37,281
make $15,000
a year selling some art.

4507
03:06:37,281 --> 03:06:37,320
That's the beauty of choice.
Yeah,

4508
03:06:37,321 --> 03:06:39,330
exactly.
And as long as the system gives you that

4509
03:06:39,331 --> 03:06:42,060
choice to succeed or fail and no one 
else is responsible for you,

4510
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:42,850
like in,
in,

4511
03:06:43,140 --> 03:06:45,480
in base ways.
And I'm not saying we're not responsible

4512
03:06:45,720 --> 03:06:47,130
to bring you to the hospital if you're 
sick.

4513
03:06:47,131 --> 03:06:52,131
I'm not saying any of that,
but we're not responsible to make 

4514
03:06:52,131 --> 03:06:53,961
decisions for you.
We're not responsible to line your 

4515
03:06:53,961 --> 03:06:53,961
pockets with money.
You did not.

4516
03:06:53,961 --> 03:06:53,961
All right.
And then that's,

4517
03:06:53,961 --> 03:06:54,600
that's,
that's fine with me.

4518
03:06:54,630 --> 03:06:56,010
That's one of the awful things

4519
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:58,080
about communism that people very rarely 
discussed.

4520
03:06:58,081 --> 03:06:59,760
You're assigned,
signed a job,

4521
03:07:00,030 --> 03:07:02,190
you're assigned what you do if you live 
in Cuba.

4522
03:07:02,490 --> 03:07:07,490
I mean there's very little wiggle room 
as to what you can and can't do if you 

4523
03:07:07,490 --> 03:07:09,600
were living in the Communist.
Soviet Union is very little.

4524
03:07:09,601 --> 03:07:14,601
You don't.
You don't have a whole lot of decision 

4525
03:07:14,601 --> 03:07:15,270
making capabilities and that's just not 
how human beings operate at their best.

4526
03:07:15,540 --> 03:07:19,180
We operate at our best when we're free.
When you are uniquely you,

4527
03:07:19,181 --> 03:07:20,580
you're not me.
I'm not you.

4528
03:07:20,581 --> 03:07:25,581
I don't.
I don't know how your brain works and 

4529
03:07:25,581 --> 03:07:25,581
there's people out there like,
I dunno,

4530
03:07:25,581 --> 03:07:29,490
here's an example back that are so weird
and so different from me,

4531
03:07:29,730 --> 03:07:34,730
but he's capable of creating weird 
fucking funky music because he's so 

4532
03:07:36,061 --> 03:07:38,200
different because he's so interesting,
right?

4533
03:07:38,460 --> 03:07:43,460
Like his form of Marilyn Manson,
his form of creativity just doesn't 

4534
03:07:43,590 --> 03:07:43,950
work.

4535
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:45,820
My brain doesn't make that.
You know,

4536
03:07:45,821 --> 03:07:49,140
like a tomato tree doesn't make mangoes.
You know,

4537
03:07:49,320 --> 03:07:54,320
and we're,
we're are the freedom to express 

4538
03:07:54,320 --> 03:07:58,971
yourself in your own unique way and the 
freedom to live your life with your own 

4539
03:07:58,971 --> 03:08:03,681
unique direction.
That's just one of the greatest things 

4540
03:08:03,681 --> 03:08:07,131
about being an American is that we have 
more freedom in that regard than anyone 

4541
03:08:07,741 --> 03:08:11,490
that's ever lived because we have more 
access to things,

4542
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:16,670
we have more access to information and 
we have more freedom to choose to 

4543
03:08:16,670 --> 03:08:18,120
express yourself,
to speak out,

4544
03:08:18,270 --> 03:08:20,310
and anything that gets in the way from 
that,

4545
03:08:20,311 --> 03:08:25,311
including the limiting free speech on 
campuses is fucking dangerous in that 

4546
03:08:26,131 --> 03:08:27,810
regard because it,
you don't,

4547
03:08:27,811 --> 03:08:29,610
you think you're helping,
but you're,

4548
03:08:29,611 --> 03:08:34,611
you're limiting freedom.
You're limiting freedom because it 

4549
03:08:34,611 --> 03:08:37,881
doesn't jive with what's going on in 
your head and that's just not the way 

4550
03:08:37,881 --> 03:08:37,881
it's supposed to work.

4551
03:08:37,881 --> 03:08:38,440
Yeah,
absolutely.

4552
03:08:38,441 --> 03:08:43,441
I agree with you.
I find what's happening on college 

4553
03:08:43,441 --> 03:08:43,441
campuses.
I find the stymieing of free speech,

4554
03:08:43,441 --> 03:08:47,311
this idea,
this very primitive idea that we are 

4555
03:08:47,311 --> 03:08:47,311
this primitive notion of almost thought 
policing,

4556
03:08:47,311 --> 03:08:49,750
um,
as being super unsavory because you have

4557
03:08:49,751 --> 03:08:51,690
to protect,
you have to.

4558
03:08:52,030 --> 03:08:57,030
A society needs to be dedicated to 
protecting its bad elements as long as 

4559
03:08:57,030 --> 03:08:57,030
those elements aren't illegal.
Right?

4560
03:08:57,030 --> 03:08:59,050
So like you don't want to protect the 
person who is murdering someone,

4561
03:08:59,230 --> 03:09:01,720
but you might want to protect someone 
who you might want to protect the rights

4562
03:09:01,721 --> 03:09:04,980
of someone who is espousing really 
racist shit because you you.

4563
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:10,020
That's why these protections exist is 
for their freedom to express those bad 

4564
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:10,020
ideas.
As long as they don't play out,

4565
03:09:10,060 --> 03:09:12,100
you don't have to agree with them.
You and I don't agree with those ideas,

4566
03:09:12,400 --> 03:09:14,980
but you give them oxygen and power.

4567
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:16,530
When you try to limit them,
I,

4568
03:09:16,531 --> 03:09:19,200
I guarantee you that because of the,
the,

4569
03:09:19,210 --> 03:09:24,210
the,
the throwing around at the majority of 

4570
03:09:24,210 --> 03:09:25,720
not ism and as a pejorative Nazis and 
fascism and kind of giving these people 

4571
03:09:25,720 --> 03:09:27,160
screentime,
Richard Spencer and all these guys,

4572
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:29,320
I guarantee you that they've gained in 
adherence,

4573
03:09:29,321 --> 03:09:33,130
not lost because they're gaining more 
and more oxygen because you're giving it

4574
03:09:33,131 --> 03:09:35,720
to them by trying to stymie them.
You're bringing attention to them.

4575
03:09:35,721 --> 03:09:40,721
I said over and over again with Milo 
Yiannopoulos going to Berkeley earlier 

4576
03:09:40,721 --> 03:09:41,770
this year and then not being allowed to 
speak and everyone losing their minds.

4577
03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:46,920
You just gained Milo Yiannopoulos,
a bunch of people that had no idea who 

4578
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:49,441
he was.
The thing that would have hurt him the 

4579
03:09:49,441 --> 03:09:49,441
most is going to a room that was empty,
that would.

4580
03:09:49,441 --> 03:09:53,341
No one was there to speak,
but he has the right to go to that room 

4581
03:09:53,341 --> 03:09:53,341
and speaking on the less well.

4582
03:09:53,341 --> 03:09:54,250
What's interesting is what's kind of 
like silenced

4583
03:09:54,250 --> 03:09:58,210
him is his own words.
I mean his own,

4584
03:09:58,270 --> 03:10:00,110
what fucked him up.
His,

4585
03:10:00,130 --> 03:10:02,740
his own conversations,
his,

4586
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:05,770
his ability to freely speak about 
pedophilia,

4587
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:06,510
right?
Give them,

4588
03:10:06,730 --> 03:10:11,730
it goes back to the give the person 
enough rope and they'll do the job for 

4589
03:10:11,730 --> 03:10:11,730
you.
You know,

4590
03:10:11,730 --> 03:10:11,730
like you don't have to,
you know,

4591
03:10:11,730 --> 03:10:16,530
you don't have to do it.
You don't have to force a square peg 

4592
03:10:16,530 --> 03:10:16,530
into a round hole.
When I think of a lot of ways,

4593
03:10:16,530 --> 03:10:21,361
Milo is a provocateur and what he's 
trying to do is trying to push buttons 

4594
03:10:21,361 --> 03:10:22,420
and get attention and doing all those 
things.

4595
03:10:22,421 --> 03:10:26,380
But in literally doing that and just 
ranting and raving,

4596
03:10:26,410 --> 03:10:28,900
he tripped over his own dick.
You know,

4597
03:10:28,901 --> 03:10:31,950
the publishing company removes the book.
I mean,

4598
03:10:31,960 --> 03:10:33,760
that's a leaves.
Breitbart.

4599
03:10:33,761 --> 03:10:38,761
I mean,
this is essentially where all this came 

4600
03:10:38,761 --> 03:10:38,761
from.
Yeah,

4601
03:10:38,761 --> 03:10:40,891
there's no.
I think what people kind of conflate is 

4602
03:10:40,891 --> 03:10:42,880
there's room and necessity for 
consequences for your actions.

4603
03:10:43,140 --> 03:10:48,140
There's no.
There's no one's saying that there's no 

4604
03:10:48,140 --> 03:10:50,101
consequences.
Consequences seem to be taking place in 

4605
03:10:50,101 --> 03:10:50,101
the marketplace of free ideas.
Right?

4606
03:10:50,101 --> 03:10:51,430
It's,
you can't.

4607
03:10:51,730 --> 03:10:53,800
I feel like people have tried to force 
consequences on me,

4608
03:10:53,801 --> 03:10:54,340
for instance,
right.

4609
03:10:54,341 --> 03:10:59,341
They tried to.
They tried to force a consequence that 

4610
03:10:59,341 --> 03:10:59,341
didn't work out the way that they wanted
it to,

4611
03:10:59,341 --> 03:11:00,010
but to try to make a point.
Right.

4612
03:11:00,011 --> 03:11:02,470
To try to illustrate a point,
but you have to let these things,

4613
03:11:02,471 --> 03:11:07,471
like you said,
the marketplace will correct for 

4614
03:11:07,471 --> 03:11:09,601
anything that is on toward Kevin Spacey 
is going to be hurting for the rest of 

4615
03:11:09,601 --> 03:11:12,721
his life compared to where he was just 
five days ago because the consequences 

4616
03:11:12,721 --> 03:11:12,721
of his actions.
Right,

4617
03:11:12,721 --> 03:11:17,550
exactly.
So I'm not saying that there shouldn't 

4618
03:11:17,550 --> 03:11:17,550
be consequences.
I don't think a lot of people are saying

4619
03:11:17,550 --> 03:11:17,550
that at all,
but I feel like it's almost,

4620
03:11:17,550 --> 03:11:19,180
it's not policing like there are 
preemptive consequences,

4621
03:11:19,240 --> 03:11:21,250
but these consequences should be like,
hey,

4622
03:11:21,310 --> 03:11:26,310
we don't want to do business with you 
because you and your values don't align 

4623
03:11:26,310 --> 03:11:27,080
with how we look at the world.

4624
03:11:27,270 --> 03:11:29,230
You,
but you're free to do your own thing.

4625
03:11:29,560 --> 03:11:30,280
Yeah,
absolutely.

4626
03:11:30,281 --> 03:11:30,700
I.
Yeah,

4627
03:11:30,730 --> 03:11:33,520
and that's why I'm saying like you just 
were giving,

4628
03:11:33,550 --> 03:11:36,130
were giving unsavory far right and far 
left elements,

4629
03:11:36,131 --> 03:11:38,800
way too much oxygen and way too much 
power in our society.

4630
03:11:38,801 --> 03:11:40,810
They don't represent anyone.
Like when you really,

4631
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:46,320
when you walk through your life,
how many people do you know that a 

4632
03:11:46,320 --> 03:11:49,311
scribe to Marxism?
How many people do you know that a 

4633
03:11:49,311 --> 03:11:51,881
scribe to white nationalism.
I have never met in my own 33 years on 

4634
03:11:51,881 --> 03:11:53,770
this planet in interacting with a ton of
different people.

4635
03:11:53,771 --> 03:11:55,720
I'm not sure I've ever actually met a 
white nationalist,

4636
03:11:55,960 --> 03:12:00,190
so why are we acting like this is a like
a massive component of American politics

4637
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:04,530
when it's not.
It's probably $2,350

4638
03:12:04,531 --> 03:12:08,320
million that live here,
just lob off the ends of the spectrum.

4639
03:12:08,321 --> 03:12:09,700
The far end of the spectrum is lob them 
off.

4640
03:12:09,700 --> 03:12:12,070
They're not welcome in polite society.
They can do whatever they want.

4641
03:12:12,340 --> 03:12:17,340
Everyone else I bet has 90 percent 
agreement on most issues and I think 

4642
03:12:17,340 --> 03:12:18,700
that this intense heated,
screaming and yelling at each other that

4643
03:12:18,701 --> 03:12:23,701
you see like on Berkeley and Antifa 
showing up with fucking Ninja masks on 

4644
03:12:23,701 --> 03:12:25,630
throwing Molotov cocktails.
This ain't helping anybody know.

4645
03:12:25,631 --> 03:12:29,650
Anthony's just ramps up the other side.
Antifa like these guys are losers,

4646
03:12:29,651 --> 03:12:30,040
right?
Like,

4647
03:12:30,041 --> 03:12:31,330
like how dare you.
They,

4648
03:12:31,430 --> 03:12:32,710
they,
they,

4649
03:12:32,790 --> 03:12:35,200
they supported by the mayor of Berkeley.
Yeah.

4650
03:12:35,950 --> 03:12:38,110
I'm sure a lot of weird things are 
supported by the mayor of Berkeley.

4651
03:12:38,450 --> 03:12:40,030
Uh,
but yeah,

4652
03:12:40,090 --> 03:12:43,920
it doesn't help any situations they look
like they're like Cobra officers from Gi

4653
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:47,440
Gel running around doing their thing,
destroying private property.

4654
03:12:47,560 --> 03:12:52,560
It doesn't make any sense.
Like why you would do this hero own 

4655
03:12:52,560 --> 03:12:52,560
society to your own what,
what

4656
03:12:52,560 --> 03:12:53,660
books,
what it is anxious to like,

4657
03:12:53,661 --> 03:12:58,661
what point are you trying to prove and 
and you're seeing this replicate itself 

4658
03:12:58,661 --> 03:12:58,661
a lot.
I know it's an unpopular thing to say,

4659
03:12:58,661 --> 03:13:00,980
but you can draw this.
A lot of this back of the Ferguson even,

4660
03:13:01,010 --> 03:13:03,000
you know,
like Ferguson.

4661
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:06,110
See in some ways ferguson is a travesty 
of justice,

4662
03:13:06,111 --> 03:13:08,240
right?
But it seemed way worse than it actually

4663
03:13:08,241 --> 03:13:11,240
was once everything came out once,
once Loretta Lynch,

4664
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:14,930
not a very well known racist,
refused to try the person at the federal

4665
03:13:14,931 --> 03:13:16,280
level,
local and state authorities,

4666
03:13:16,850 --> 03:13:20,280
grand juries refuse to try Darren Wilson
for what he did to the,

4667
03:13:20,350 --> 03:13:25,350
to the gentleman there or whatever and 
you and you get the full story and yet 

4668
03:13:25,350 --> 03:13:27,881
you still have this society or the 
community in ruins based on some hands 

4669
03:13:27,881 --> 03:13:27,881
up.
Don't shoot,

4670
03:13:27,881 --> 03:13:28,360
never happened,
right?

4671
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:31,580
But literally never happened.
But this is the rallying cry.

4672
03:13:31,580 --> 03:13:32,810
This,
this destroyed city.

4673
03:13:32,811 --> 03:13:36,320
The rallying cry from as it sounds good 
to people that want to believe a certain

4674
03:13:36,321 --> 03:13:41,321
narrative.
And so they repeated and then 

4675
03:13:41,321 --> 03:13:43,481
everybody's repeating it.
And then you have people doing it on 

4676
03:13:43,481 --> 03:13:45,611
television and then everybody decides 
that this is the thing that we're going 

4677
03:13:45,611 --> 03:13:46,010
to say over and over again,
regardless of whether or not it's true.

4678
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:51,640
The real travesty of that too is that 
you can literally throw a dart at a map 

4679
03:13:51,640 --> 03:13:53,720
of the United States and find a civil 
rights thing that's truly a civil rights

4680
03:13:53,721 --> 03:13:58,721
infraction that's truly horrible.
That probably deserves the oxygen and 

4681
03:13:58,721 --> 03:13:59,840
the attention and could be a legitimate 
rallying cry,

4682
03:13:59,990 --> 03:14:01,760
but it goes back to the point you were 
making before too.

4683
03:14:01,910 --> 03:14:03,050
People don't want to admit they're 
wrong.

4684
03:14:03,170 --> 03:14:08,170
No one wants to admit that.
Like a year out from Ferguson were much 

4685
03:14:08,170 --> 03:14:11,021
further than that,
but even six months out from when it 

4686
03:14:11,021 --> 03:14:11,021
happened,
people look back,

4687
03:14:11,021 --> 03:14:11,900
read through the grand jury stuff,
the federal government's take on it,

4688
03:14:11,901 --> 03:14:13,130
all that kind of stuff and realize,
oh,

4689
03:14:13,970 --> 03:14:18,970
maybe this wasn't the best idea that to 
to to act like this when we didn't have 

4690
03:14:18,970 --> 03:14:18,970
all the information.

4691
03:14:18,970 --> 03:14:22,760
So you think that the information is 
flowing freer and people have more of an

4692
03:14:22,761 --> 03:14:27,761
understanding than ever before.
I think people are really doubling down 

4693
03:14:27,761 --> 03:14:31,700
on the far right and the far left and 
the extremism is sort of elevated in the

4694
03:14:31,701 --> 03:14:34,430
in that regard,
but I think overall,

4695
03:14:34,490 --> 03:14:35,330
I think,
you know,

4696
03:14:35,580 --> 03:14:40,580
people don't like the word Centrus,
but the people in the center of the 

4697
03:14:40,580 --> 03:14:42,950
people that are more reasonable are more
informed and more.

4698
03:14:43,280 --> 03:14:46,550
There's more communication going on than
ever before and in that sense,

4699
03:14:46,551 --> 03:14:48,170
I'm very hopeful.
I am hopeful to.

4700
03:14:48,171 --> 03:14:53,171
I,
I like how centrism has become this 

4701
03:14:53,171 --> 03:14:53,171
dirty,
like unspoken word.

4702
03:14:53,171 --> 03:14:53,171
It's,
it's,

4703
03:14:53,171 --> 03:14:57,520
but that's only again from the far 
fringes that feel like they're losing 

4704
03:14:57,520 --> 03:15:00,170
because they are losing.
If your idea is predicated on a race,

4705
03:15:00,350 --> 03:15:03,290
if like your idea of supremacy or 
superiority as a predicate on that,

4706
03:15:03,320 --> 03:15:04,550
you're a moron,
right?

4707
03:15:04,900 --> 03:15:07,160
And no one does.
No one has to talk to you about that.

4708
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:10,880
You don't deserve to be part of the 
rational adult conversation.

4709
03:15:10,970 --> 03:15:15,970
Foolish notion.
If your idea on the left is that you 

4710
03:15:15,970 --> 03:15:18,521
have to stymie free speech,
that free speech is this antiquated 

4711
03:15:18,521 --> 03:15:18,521
thing.
I tweeted out a video last week,

4712
03:15:18,610 --> 03:15:20,530
have a kid at the University of Utah 
saying that the.

4713
03:15:20,540 --> 03:15:21,260
I retweeted it.
Oh,

4714
03:15:21,261 --> 03:15:22,520
thank you.
Of saying the.

4715
03:15:22,521 --> 03:15:23,000
The.
Yeah,

4716
03:15:23,001 --> 03:15:24,620
like the tickets,
like a valid document.

4717
03:15:24,621 --> 03:15:25,240
Yeah.
I don't think it's about.

4718
03:15:25,430 --> 03:15:25,700
Yeah,
no,

4719
03:15:25,780 --> 03:15:27,020
there's nothing valid about the bill of 
rights.

4720
03:15:27,021 --> 03:15:28,160
You Moron,
you know,

4721
03:15:28,310 --> 03:15:33,310
there's nothing like if your idea is is 
Marxism and this weird economic 

4722
03:15:33,310 --> 03:15:35,680
engineering and all this kind of stuff,
you are also a moron and,

4723
03:15:35,760 --> 03:15:38,240
and I'm not afraid to tell you that,
you know,

4724
03:15:38,450 --> 03:15:43,450
you have to have,
you have to be academically limited to 

4725
03:15:43,450 --> 03:15:43,450
look at either of those ideas on this,
on this,

4726
03:15:43,450 --> 03:15:45,290
on these spectrums and think that you 
have a good idea.

4727
03:15:45,530 --> 03:15:50,530
You know,
usually a collection of ideas not from 

4728
03:15:50,530 --> 03:15:50,530
the but a collection of left,

4729
03:15:50,530 --> 03:15:50,700
right.
Liberal,

4730
03:15:50,701 --> 03:15:52,770
conservative usually is probably what's 
right.

4731
03:15:52,980 --> 03:15:57,980
No one in the mainstream of American 
politics or mainstream of Western 

4732
03:15:57,980 --> 03:16:00,090
politics has a monopoly on right or a 
monopoly on good ideas.

4733
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:05,360
There are,
there are great things that Republicans 

4734
03:16:05,360 --> 03:16:07,701
believe in.
There are great things that Democrats 

4735
03:16:07,701 --> 03:16:07,701
believe.
There are terrible ideas on both sides.

4736
03:16:07,701 --> 03:16:10,500
The only thing I see on the extremes is 
just a complete dearth of good ideas.

4737
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:12,900
It's just all bad ideas,
just all terrible ideas.

4738
03:16:13,350 --> 03:16:15,210
And so why are we even paying attention 
to them?

4739
03:16:15,360 --> 03:16:17,700
They can kick and scream and shout all 
they want,

4740
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:21,120
but we're giving them too much time on,
on,

4741
03:16:21,170 --> 03:16:21,730
uh,
you know,

4742
03:16:21,930 --> 03:16:23,190
the news,
we're giving them too much time.

4743
03:16:23,191 --> 03:16:26,010
Even even I do it even I fall prey to 
that because it's fun.

4744
03:16:26,070 --> 03:16:31,070
It is just that little fucker on TV 
saying that I don't think that the bill 

4745
03:16:31,070 --> 03:16:31,170
of rights is like a valid document.

4746
03:16:31,930 --> 03:16:33,330
Yes.
That's very radical,

4747
03:16:33,331 --> 03:16:34,350
man.
The reason,

4748
03:16:34,351 --> 03:16:35,820
by the way,
you're allowed to speak at all right.

4749
03:16:35,821 --> 03:16:40,821
I know.
He probably also thinks this is a 

4750
03:16:40,821 --> 03:16:40,821
fascist country.
I know.

4751
03:16:40,821 --> 03:16:41,450
I know that when the Nazis took over at 
night in early 1933,

4752
03:16:41,470 --> 03:16:46,470
the first thing they did was let 
everyone say whatever they want so you 

4753
03:16:46,470 --> 03:16:49,131
could see,
you could see the mirror images of the 

4754
03:16:49,131 --> 03:16:49,131
United States and fascist Germany and I 
mean it's everywhere.

4755
03:16:49,131 --> 03:16:50,610
If you listen to them,
you know,

4756
03:16:50,630 --> 03:16:51,810
it was a little kid.
Yeah.

4757
03:16:51,811 --> 03:16:55,080
He has a lot of learning to do and I,
I looked back and I look back one day at

4758
03:16:55,081 --> 03:16:56,160
that video and go,
oh my God,

4759
03:16:56,161 --> 03:16:58,000
I was fucking stupid.
Yeah,

4760
03:16:58,200 --> 03:16:59,040
I'm sure he died.
Like,

4761
03:16:59,250 --> 03:17:01,020
you look so pompous and proud of 
himself.

4762
03:17:01,021 --> 03:17:06,021
The state got nobody put a fucking 
camera on me when I was 18 and asked me 

4763
03:17:06,021 --> 03:17:06,021
how the world should work.

4764
03:17:06,021 --> 03:17:06,400
Absolutely.
I,

4765
03:17:06,480 --> 03:17:11,480
we've all said and done stupid things 
and he's too young to realize what's 

4766
03:17:11,480 --> 03:17:15,771
happening,
but colleges are breeding this sort of 

4767
03:17:15,771 --> 03:17:15,771
thing and I,
and it's.

4768
03:17:15,771 --> 03:17:16,800
I know that people say like it's,
it's overdrawn and it's not as bad as it

4769
03:17:16,801 --> 03:17:17,280
is.
And I'm like,

4770
03:17:17,281 --> 03:17:19,800
I think it is specifically because when 
I was in college,

4771
03:17:19,801 --> 03:17:24,801
I only graduated 10 years ago in May.
This wasn't happening and I went to 

4772
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:26,970
evergreen state,
Bret Weinstein.

4773
03:17:27,030 --> 03:17:28,540
I never saw anything like this in my 
life and I,

4774
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:33,560
I never saw.
I never heard about this and other 

4775
03:17:33,560 --> 03:17:33,560
colleges in Boston,
pretty liberal place.

4776
03:17:33,560 --> 03:17:36,720
So this is a newer phenomenon and it's 
destructive.

4777
03:17:36,721 --> 03:17:38,400
It's core,
it's corrosive,

4778
03:17:38,550 --> 03:17:42,690
and it's very damaging to people's 
confidence in universities and you know,

4779
03:17:42,691 --> 03:17:47,691
like look what's happening to evergreen 
state financially that college getting 

4780
03:17:47,691 --> 03:17:51,651
devastated.
People are voting to defund it and it's 

4781
03:17:51,651 --> 03:17:51,651
got,
they've,

4782
03:17:51,651 --> 03:17:53,720
they have real issues with enrollment 
now the,

4783
03:17:53,721 --> 03:17:54,660
uh,
the guy that is running,

4784
03:17:54,661 --> 03:17:59,661
there was a real interesting article 
that I just read yesterday where the 

4785
03:17:59,661 --> 03:18:03,471
president was talking about what an 
impact it's taken on his health and his 

4786
03:18:03,471 --> 03:18:07,791
mental health and he's unable to think 
correctly now and he's unable to like 

4787
03:18:07,791 --> 03:18:10,140
the guy is like literally shell shocked.

4788
03:18:10,520 --> 03:18:15,520
I mean he is.
His decision making skills are very 

4789
03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:15,610
foggy.
He saying these,

4790
03:18:15,710 --> 03:18:17,430
this is what happens when you let 
petulant,

4791
03:18:17,640 --> 03:18:19,940
ignorant children think that they run up
a,

4792
03:18:19,950 --> 03:18:21,050
a,
a,

4793
03:18:21,110 --> 03:18:23,310
an establishment of higher learning when
they're there to,

4794
03:18:23,311 --> 03:18:25,620
under when you go.
When I entered college,

4795
03:18:25,770 --> 03:18:27,660
I went under the knowledge that I didn't
know anything.

4796
03:18:27,720 --> 03:18:29,240
How do you turn this around though?
I,

4797
03:18:29,241 --> 03:18:30,390
I,
I don't know.

4798
03:18:30,391 --> 03:18:31,510
Like I,
I really feel like it,

4799
03:18:31,511 --> 03:18:34,110
it comes down in a lot of ways.
It comes down to the people that pay the

4800
03:18:34,111 --> 03:18:35,010
bills,
in my opinion.

4801
03:18:35,050 --> 03:18:40,050
Feel like the parents need to not be 
happy with the product they're getting 

4802
03:18:40,050 --> 03:18:41,280
when they find that their child is now 
an antifa member when he went,

4803
03:18:41,330 --> 03:18:46,330
when he,
when he comes back for Thanksgiving or 

4804
03:18:46,330 --> 03:18:46,330
for Christmas,
you have to ask yourself like,

4805
03:18:46,330 --> 03:18:46,600
what is happening?
You know,

4806
03:18:46,630 --> 03:18:48,190
like this isn't because

4807
03:18:48,190 --> 03:18:53,190
people point back to the sixties when 
there was a very righteous wave of anti 

4808
03:18:53,190 --> 03:18:58,130
authority and anthro 
anti-authoritarianism that was born in 

4809
03:18:58,130 --> 03:18:58,130
this,
in this,

4810
03:18:58,130 --> 03:18:59,470
this,
this very specific climate.

4811
03:18:59,550 --> 03:19:04,550
You know,
and I think it's going to take a long 

4812
03:19:04,550 --> 03:19:04,770
time to fix.
I think a lot of it is because of a,

4813
03:19:04,810 --> 03:19:07,120
it's a very incestuous.
Academia is very incestuous.

4814
03:19:07,360 --> 03:19:09,760
You hire people that agree with you,
you hire people that believe in you.

4815
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:13,540
That's why you find,
what is it like 19 out of 20 people that

4816
03:19:13,541 --> 03:19:15,730
teach it at a,
at universities or liberal?

4817
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:21,300
I'm sorry,
like that's insane that that's not 

4818
03:19:21,300 --> 03:19:21,980
right.
That like even if I,

4819
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,830
if I were a liberal or a Democrat,
I'd look at that and be like,

4820
03:19:23,831 --> 03:19:28,831
that's not,
that's like it's own form of social 

4821
03:19:28,831 --> 03:19:28,831
engineering that we,
we've cooperative.

4822
03:19:28,831 --> 03:19:31,660
Not only have we call it a lot of media,
which is why the media hates youtube and

4823
03:19:31,661 --> 03:19:33,130
they had all these things because they 
can't control that,

4824
03:19:33,280 --> 03:19:34,510
but now we've co opted academia.

4825
03:19:34,510 --> 03:19:39,510
Your ability to get a degree is going to
have to go through these people that 

4826
03:19:39,510 --> 03:19:40,240
are,
you might be diametrically opposed to or

4827
03:19:40,241 --> 03:19:45,241
at the very least aligned to you about a
lot of things and I'm just 10 years ago 

4828
03:19:45,241 --> 03:19:47,810
that was certainly not my experience.
So I fear for know,

4829
03:19:47,950 --> 03:19:52,950
which is another reason why I'm like,
I don't know if college is the best 

4830
03:19:52,950 --> 03:19:53,140
solution for a lot of even able minded 
people,

4831
03:19:53,320 --> 03:19:58,320
you know,
like where it's like I don't know what 

4832
03:19:58,320 --> 03:19:58,320
you get from going there.
Now,

4833
03:19:58,320 --> 03:19:58,320
um,
if you,

4834
03:19:58,320 --> 03:19:59,680
if you study a discipline,
you'll probably get out.

4835
03:19:59,681 --> 03:20:00,670
Okay,
okay.

4836
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:01,660
We're talking about chemistry,
physics,

4837
03:20:01,661 --> 03:20:02,170
math,
whatever.

4838
03:20:02,530 --> 03:20:04,300
If you're studying humanity,
right?

4839
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:05,410
I don't know,
man.

4840
03:20:05,411 --> 03:20:10,411
I don't.
I don't know what you're getting out of 

4841
03:20:10,411 --> 03:20:10,411
that now.
And I studied the humanity.

4842
03:20:10,411 --> 03:20:10,411
I had a lot of liberal professors.
I had a lot of conservative professors.

4843
03:20:10,411 --> 03:20:15,390
I wonder what that mix is like now.
And you get different history based on 

4844
03:20:15,390 --> 03:20:15,390
that.
Yeah.

4845
03:20:15,390 --> 03:20:16,920
I get kids send me tweets all the time 
of,

4846
03:20:16,930 --> 03:20:19,240
uh,
photos of something that their professor

4847
03:20:19,241 --> 03:20:24,241
is a showing in class.
Like someone just sent me something the 

4848
03:20:24,241 --> 03:20:27,061
other day.
It was a photograph of a overhead 

4849
03:20:27,061 --> 03:20:30,121
projection and it said something about 
science being a social construct and 

4850
03:20:31,301 --> 03:20:32,710
he's like,
this is the kind of shit I'm learning in

4851
03:20:32,711 --> 03:20:33,230
school.
Oh,

4852
03:20:33,310 --> 03:20:34,270
I think I saw that.
I think I.

4853
03:20:34,330 --> 03:20:35,580
Did you retweet it?
You retweeted that?

4854
03:20:35,581 --> 03:20:36,730
Yeah,
I saw that pop up on my feet.

4855
03:20:37,420 --> 03:20:39,230
Like,
what in the fuck is,

4856
03:20:39,340 --> 03:20:41,500
how is this guy a goddamn professor?
Well,

4857
03:20:41,501 --> 03:20:42,990
this is the whole thing with like,
you know,

4858
03:20:43,060 --> 03:20:43,960
even the,
I mean,

4859
03:20:43,961 --> 03:20:46,270
the way this is manifesting itself,
Moses with transgender,

4860
03:20:46,480 --> 03:20:51,480
the transgender issue,
which I made a video about this where 

4861
03:20:51,480 --> 03:20:51,480
I'm like,
I don't know that the science has really

4862
03:20:51,480 --> 03:20:51,550
been important.

4863
03:20:51,550 --> 03:20:54,310
If a person wants to say that they're a 
woman and they were born a man,

4864
03:20:54,311 --> 03:20:56,170
I don't really care.
It doesn't matter.

4865
03:20:56,171 --> 03:20:57,640
I don't think you need to site typical 
justify it.

4866
03:20:57,641 --> 03:21:02,641
But I think the scientific justification
for this whole gender normative kind of 

4867
03:21:02,641 --> 03:21:06,450
thing is actually going to backfire on 
them pretty badly because they've 

4868
03:21:06,450 --> 03:21:06,450
decided to make something that,
you know,

4869
03:21:06,450 --> 03:21:08,770
if you get a blood test right and they 
can study,

4870
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:11,470
study it,
you're going to come out as a male,

4871
03:21:11,560 --> 03:21:13,060
right?
Even if you identify something else,

4872
03:21:13,061 --> 03:21:14,470
that doesn't mean you can't identify 
like that.

4873
03:21:14,620 --> 03:21:16,450
But if you're going to predicate your 
whole notion on that,

4874
03:21:16,451 --> 03:21:19,450
this is science and it doesn't seem like
that might be the case,

4875
03:21:19,570 --> 03:21:24,570
then you're actually injuring the social
movement of people just being accepted 

4876
03:21:24,570 --> 03:21:25,960
for who they are.
And I feel like this is,

4877
03:21:25,990 --> 03:21:28,150
this is where you start engineering 
science to,

4878
03:21:28,180 --> 03:21:30,970
to fit your narrative.
And I think it's a very,

4879
03:21:30,971 --> 03:21:32,710
very dangerous thing.
People,

4880
03:21:32,890 --> 03:21:34,300
people do the same thing with global 
warming.

4881
03:21:34,310 --> 03:21:39,310
I'm a,
I think global warming is obviously 

4882
03:21:39,310 --> 03:21:39,310
real,
you know,

4883
03:21:39,310 --> 03:21:39,310
um,
I think the science says that.

4884
03:21:39,310 --> 03:21:40,190
I think that is maybe not as bad,
but it's bad.

4885
03:21:40,191 --> 03:21:40,840
It's bad.
It's,

4886
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:42,580
it's effecting things,
making storms worse.

4887
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:44,980
Sea levels are rising.
But people manipulate that to say like,

4888
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,680
no,
everything's fine.

4889
03:21:45,710 --> 03:21:46,100
Just hand

4890
03:21:46,100 --> 03:21:47,900
wave it away,
but it's not true,

4891
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:49,130
you know,
and I feel like,

4892
03:21:49,510 --> 03:21:54,510
so I feel like we have to predicate 
everything on scientific truth when we 

4893
03:21:54,510 --> 03:21:57,461
can and then give leeway to say like I 
use the example I used was homosexuality

4894
03:21:57,710 --> 03:22:00,340
where there was a theory for a long time
that homosexuality wasn't something that

4895
03:22:00,341 --> 03:22:01,550
was born in new,
that it was a choice.

4896
03:22:01,580 --> 03:22:06,580
Now we know that that's not true,
that it's actually something that's in 

4897
03:22:06,580 --> 03:22:06,580
you.
But even if it was a choice,

4898
03:22:06,580 --> 03:22:09,530
who cares why predicated on that if you 
believe in freedom.

4899
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:11,180
Right?
Exactly.

4900
03:22:11,300 --> 03:22:12,830
Exactly.
So with the transgender thing,

4901
03:22:12,831 --> 03:22:17,831
it's like,
I don't know that you're even attacking 

4902
03:22:17,831 --> 03:22:17,831
this from the right angle.
You should be attacking it from a social

4903
03:22:17,831 --> 03:22:22,661
acceptance angle,
which again goes back to the idea of 

4904
03:22:22,661 --> 03:22:22,661
like,
I think that's actually the conservative

4905
03:22:22,661 --> 03:22:23,730
stance,
you know,

4906
03:22:23,930 --> 03:22:26,350
but people would argue with me on that 
column.

4907
03:22:26,360 --> 03:22:28,400
We're going to do this more often.
Enjoyed this man.

4908
03:22:28,430 --> 03:22:28,970
Thank you.
I did too.

4909
03:22:28,971 --> 03:22:30,170
Thank you for having me back.
It's a great honor.

4910
03:22:30,171 --> 03:22:31,550
Two hours and 20 minutes,
man.

4911
03:22:31,700 --> 03:22:32,990
Three hours and 20 minutes,
right?

4912
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:34,370
Three hours and 20 minutes.
Great.

4913
03:22:34,371 --> 03:22:35,600
Well I thank you.
Thank you so much.

4914
03:22:35,630 --> 03:22:36,830
It was a great honor for you to ask me 
back.

4915
03:22:36,831 --> 03:22:37,940
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

4916
03:22:38,320 --> 03:22:40,170
Congratulations on this space.
Thanks body.

4917
03:22:41,510 --> 03:22:42,650
Tell people where they could watch your 
show.

4918
03:22:42,830 --> 03:22:44,300
Oh,
a youtube.com/

4919
03:22:44,301 --> 03:22:47,300
Colin's last stand and I'm often on 
twitter at no taxation.

4920
03:22:47,690 --> 03:22:49,340
Bam.
See Tomorrow fuckers.

4921
03:22:49,341 --> 03:22:49,790
Thanks guys.

4922
03:22:52,390 --> 03:22:52,900
Cool.
That was fun.

4923
03:22:54,520 --> 03:22:54,890
Thank you.
