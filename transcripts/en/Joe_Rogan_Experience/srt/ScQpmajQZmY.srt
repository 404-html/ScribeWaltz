1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,630
Herbs and they moved shit around and put
things in weird places and when you read

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:05,490
the translation like what the fuck does 
this mean?

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,650
Well they're figuring out how to 
translate it.

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:12,651
Not just both word for word,
but figuring out how you would say that 

5
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:13,950
same sentence in English structure as 
well.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,230
Yeah.
So it's clear what you know,

7
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:19,110
what you're translating.
It's fucking fascinating shit man.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,870
It's fascinating.
And I also

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,280
wonder after,
you know,

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,210
50 or so years of everybody using 
English on the Internet,

11
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:28,840
how many kids are gonna grow up just as 
English as their,

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,930
you know,
their new language and the original 

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,661
languages,
like the old fashioned thing their 

14
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:36,661
parents did.

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:36,661
Could you imagine if there was only one 
language,

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,190
could you imagine how much shit would 
get done?

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,570
Can you,
you know what's interesting though,

18
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:44,571
when you say that,
like imagine languages are going to go 

19
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:44,571
away by technology.
Very,

20
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:44,571
very,
very fast.

21
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:45,240
Old Languages.
Well,

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,150
so what's going to happen?
Like translate on motto,

23
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,180
like you have to sit there and have 
something translated to you in pr in 

24
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,001
real time.
You know it's going to be voice 

25
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:56,030
detection and everything like that,
so it's going to make language.

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,680
Languages though people are still gonna 
want a traditionalist,

27
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,630
so we'll still be there playing with 
their whole thing.

28
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,130
But what if a few generations go by,
right?

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,500
I think things are going to change.
Well,

30
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,810
you're a proponent of the isolation 
tank.

31
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:11,811
You actually have.
John Lilly's tank don't do actually is 

32
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:11,811
pretty cool.
I met John.

33
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:11,811
He gave me his tanks.

34
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,340
You and my only other friend that ever 
had one that's having Willie mays is 

35
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,070
fucking baseball bat,
you know,

36
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,260
it's cool.
I've got to shower shoes to go with it.

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,070
Oh,
I actually get out and walk and issues.

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Every time I go from my high heels are 
pretty boring.

39
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:36,111
Brown shower shoes.
But imagine when they figure out how to 

40
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,591
stimulate the mind to create certain 
states and they do it in conjunction 

41
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:42,360
with the tank,
which is really the way to do it because

42
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,090
it eliminates all the sensory input from
this world.

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,050
If they could figure out how to do that,
put some electrodes on your head and set

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,370
you and that fucking tank and light you 
up like a Christmas tree and you just go

45
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,560
into some other world,
then maybe people will stop.

46
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,220
I think Dr Lilly did that to me with one
CC ketamine injected,

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,990
you know?
Yeah.

48
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,860
You told me about that.
What a rush.

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,960
What did he do exactly?

50
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,060
Well,
when I got there,

51
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:11,061
actually they,
I was going to go into the tank just 

52
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:14,780
straight and um,
when I got to rinse off and everything 

53
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:14,780
before you go in the tank and the guy 
was prepping me and he says,

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,900
you know,
usually when we do it,

55
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:19,720
we go in with one CC,
injected in a muscularly,

56
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:20,870
you know,
ketamine,

57
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:21,750
you know,
would you like some?

58
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,450
And I hear part of my brain go,
no,

59
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,260
no drugs.
Thanks.

60
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,990
And then I hear my mouth go,
oh,

61
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,310
absolutely.
I'd love some.

62
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
And then I,
I felt like a complete third person in 

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,430
my own reality because he said,
no problem,

64
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,940
you know,
it's injected into muscularly.

65
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Is that a problem in my side of my brain
went needles?

66
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,040
No,
my mouth,

67
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,870
however went,
no problem.

68
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,020
That'd be great.
You want to friend them and,

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,990
and you know,
and I,

70
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,850
and he walked away to go get me this 
stuff.

71
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,840
And I stood there for a minute and my 
brain was saying no way.

72
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,340
And my other side of my brain went,
look,

73
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,600
you're a doctor.
Lily's house,

74
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,740
man,
you've come all this way.

75
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,960
There's no way you're saying no.
And uh,

76
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:02,961
he walked back in and I felt a little 
alcohol swab and my muscle and I heard 

77
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,200
my brand go no.
And then I heard my mouth go.

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,030
Thank you very much.
And uh,

79
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,810
and then,
uh,

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,180
I made the most naive.
Sorry,

81
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,520
sorry.
How long does it take to kick in?

82
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,770
And I will never forget his face when he
went,

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,690
oh,
you haven't done it before.

84
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,440
Oh,
you should lay down about 45 seconds a,

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,170
any like put me in the deck.
And uh,

86
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,220
when you do it,
what if you do something like that?

87
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,270
You have sleep apnea.
Do you run the risk of like choking and 

88
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,270
not.

89
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,240
And not breathing,
uh,

90
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,320
I don't know,
I didn't have slept sleep apnea,

91
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:40,321
but the last thing I was thinking about 
was sleeping when he slipped me into 

92
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,571
that tank.
I thought I was there to watch the 

93
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:42,571
entire world coming to an end.
And um,

94
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:43,600
I had a ringside seat was pretty 
interesting.

95
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,070
So they shot you up with is ketamine,
you lie down on the tank and into the 

96
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,091
tank and you float.
And for me it was the first experience 

97
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,341
ever float.
And then when you first experienced 

98
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:56,850
floating was with ketamine,
you know,

99
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,290
how do you say no to Dr Lilly?
You know,

100
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,660
I'd watched the movie altered states 
dozens of times.

101
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:04,060
I'd own the laser disc.
That's how it happened.

102
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,620
What happened after you?
After you,

103
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,820
it kicks in 45 seconds.
I thought I was freaking out and I'm,

104
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,280
the funnier side of this was my good 
friend was in the,

105
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,030
in the other room and I was background 
noise while all this was going on.

106
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,910
And he didn't know about the ketamine 
entering into the equation.

107
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,950
And he was sitting there with Dr 
Lillian,

108
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,300
his assistant at the time,
Craig.

109
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,510
And um,
they had no concern of me like sounding 

110
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,290
like I'm drowning.
And finally he asked,

111
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:29,980
you know,
did,

112
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,900
is he on Ketamine?
And uh,

113
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:33,790
and Craig said yes.
And he said,

114
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,120
would you go get me some?
And my friend was totally blown away.

115
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,820
I didn't think that was going to be the 
answer to the,

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
to the problem.
And John put some ketamine into his leg 

117
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,151
and told my friend to have a nice night.
And he went into his bedroom and my 

118
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,290
friend could see into the bedroom where 
the tank was next to a bed and he didn't

119
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:55,291
touch the tank.
He just went in and laid down next to 

120
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:55,291
the bed.
And I actually stopped screaming at that

121
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,950
point.
And my friend was looking in,

122
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,360
the bedroom was screaming.

123
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,740
I was freaking out,
man,

124
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,700
I'm losing my mind.
So you're in the tank,

125
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,000
you pan it,
you start screaming,

126
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,970
John Lilly says,
I'll send me some of what he's having.

127
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,470
Yeah.
And honestly for me,

128
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,590
I felt like a,
well when I stopped screaming,

129
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,240
I remembered it was conscious.
I,

130
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,250
I,
it felt like somebody came into my trip 

131
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,250
and just said,
Yo,

132
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,250
take a deep breath,
calm down,

133
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,250
and,
and I was like,

134
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,920
okay,
and uh,

135
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,930
and you know what?
I just channeled the energy and it 

136
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:27,930
actually was a really positive 
experience.

137
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,460
John Lilly joined you and your trip.
What if he joined you in the actual 

138
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,991
isolated did it?
Me and my girlfriend later on tried to 

139
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:36,991
get it.
It's like that dentist,

140
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:40,900
not a cool place for to have a friend 
Sasha here.

141
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,640
Let's cuddle.
It didn't work,

142
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,200
but you know what?
In a sense,

143
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,220
yes.
I feel like he did.

144
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:50,221
I felt like there was a telepathic 
communication as much as this is going 

145
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,190
to blow all of the credibility I just 
had about talking about pot.

146
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah.
I actually felt like Dr.

147
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,980
Liliana communicated on a level that was
more telepathic during

148
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
the time I was under the drug.
Do you think like the tank even horror 

149
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,020
story?
Don't want to believe it.

150
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I don't even work though.
If he took the same amount of pills and 

151
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,560
just lay down or something.
The tank that no,

152
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,880
no pill or I wouldn't think that your 
involvement with the tanks,

153
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,720
you know,
here's how Mckenna described ketamine.

154
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,870
He said that it was like you.
He believed that when you did 

155
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,051
psychedelics,
you somehow or another connected to the 

156
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,590
experience that everybody had had doing 
those psychedelics before you.

157
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,740
That's one of the reasons why the 
mushroom experience so rich and diverse.

158
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,741
It says some thousands and millions of 
people over the years have done 

159
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,400
mushrooms and you're connected to this 
one big gigantic growing experience.

160
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,930
He said,
doing ketamine.

161
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,440
He said Ketamine is so much more rare.
That really it gave him the feeling like

162
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,490
he was in an abandoned warehouse or an 
office building with no furniture in it.

163
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,630
That's interesting.
Yeah.

164
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:52,631
You said was very alone in my trip 
initially and then when I felt like 

165
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,180
there was another energy around me,
I,

166
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,000
I.
It did feel different and it was weird.

167
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,090
I had a long conversation with John 
Lilly after and he really,

168
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,240
he was.
I really liked the old guy who was 

169
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,240
really a nice guy and then afterwards 
when I left,

170
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,420
whatever,
the next day his assistant showed them,

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
said,
you made a real impression on John.

172
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,580
He'd like you to have his tank.
He just gave it to you.

173
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,350
Yeah,
that's crazy.

174
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:17,351
You probably felt bad.
He probably didn't want you to sue them 

175
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,391
for fucking whacking them with ketamine 
and throwing them into a fucking 

176
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:19,391
bathtub.
He's like,

177
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:21,860
this dude might sue me.
It was going to work this.

178
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:25,320
I'm going to work this on the stroke it.
I'm going to call them up until Yo,

179
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:25,660
man,
you,

180
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,690
you are the shit.

181
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,970
I don't want to give you my take.
You know?

182
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,130
Oliver Stone went the night before me 
and his tank and a 400 vps in the shit 

183
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,880
over stones.
A big pooper.

184
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,050
Never really thought about that until 
just this minute.

185
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,770
I would have definitely ended up into 
those.

186
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,670
Yeah,
we both did it.

187
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,690
Yeah.
We got to talk about it.

188
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:49,691
Years later,
him and I sit down and chat about a 

189
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:49,691
weekend at John's.
Wow.

190
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:54,400
What a fucking freaky dude.
John blow out with her with a special k 

191
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,300
and throw him into a fucking pink of 
water.

192
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,310
Do No,
this is the guy that the day of the 

193
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,751
Dolphin was made about.
He's the guy that did all of the 

194
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:01,751
research books.
All of them.

195
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,620
He's a bad motherfucker.
He was awesome.

196
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,880
He's got a great book where he actually 
shows it's got the deep self,

197
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,770
has directions on how to make a tank.

198
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,860
Shows you how to make that precursor.
The son of Mario Tech.

199
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,090
I got,
isn't it Santa Maria is somebody's son.

200
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,200
Somebody's.
Yeah.

201
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,020
That's what I had to.
I had one of those as well.

202
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,090
Now I got a float lab one.
The new.

203
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:23,970
A crazy version of or showed you that?
Not yet in the basement.

204
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,440
The trip.
Fucking.

205
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,440
It's the craziest thing.
I think they're awesome.

206
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:32,441
You know,
and I think a lot of people have never 

207
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:32,441
really been able to meditate within 
themselves.

208
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,891
And when you get into this tank and 
there's no resistance on your body and 

209
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,831
you can actually get really here and you
don't really see and you feel the same 

210
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:39,950
temperature as the surroundings around 
you,

211
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,730
you really field so boundless and it's,
it's truly flying through space.

212
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,430
You flying a spaceship,
man,

213
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,390
that is a portal to another world.
It really is.

214
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,580
It really is how to relax.

215
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,710
Once you learn how to relax and it takes
a few times.

216
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:57,090
You have to do it a bunch of times and 
depending on your personality,

217
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,440
how good you are truly letting go.
But if you really learn how to let go,

218
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,980
man,
you go on trips in that thing.

219
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,880
I used to,
I used to set an alarm at like 4:00

220
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,230
AM.
If I went to sleep before midnight and I

221
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,970
just walk because I had mine in my 
bedroom.

222
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,300
I've walked right into my tank,
back in it and like go back to sleep and

223
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,860
like four or five,
6:00,

224
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,380
I would always wake up before seven,
feeling like,

225
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:21,381
man,
I had just slept for so long and I felt 

226
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:21,690
great.
And night dreams would be so lucid,

227
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,290
so incredibly real and tangible in a 
holy shit.

228
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,240
I want to go write them down loose.
That's intense.

229
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,180
So you only walk a couple steps.

230
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,940
Barely woke up.
I barely up right back.

231
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,210
Right back out.
Got It.

232
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,000
It's awesome minds too far from our 
fucking bird and the walking.

233
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:39,770
I'd wake up going,
oh,

234
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:42,690
what the fuck you doing with your life 
Rogan kit number 4:00

235
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,610
in the morning.
You fucking were to go meditate.

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,360
And then I'll go on the internet and 
check my twitter follows the congress is

237
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,510
what's going on here.
It will be an hour later.

238
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,740
I'd be like,
I'm going to get some breakfast,

239
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,460
man.
I'm fucking hungry.

240
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,270
Except in coffee.
Did you see that shit that was on CNN?

241
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,170
But are these,
these uh,

242
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:05,220
all these former US air force and 
penalties are coming out about Ufo shows

243
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,020
around nuclear on nuclear facilities.
That's fucking trippy shit man.

244
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,390
I wonder if these guys are all just 
nuts.

245
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,570
I wonder if these guys are all kooks or 
if feel like disinformation guys that 

246
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:17,570
work for the government.

247
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,090
The government wants us to think there's
fucking really ufos thing,

248
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,490
just distracted.
Meanwhile,

249
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:27,650
Obama's passing on his legislation,
making it any easier for people to wire,

250
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:30,570
tap your emails and get into your 
fucking twitter account,

251
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,080
your facebook pages,
and they're passing all this legislation

252
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,570
right under everybody's nose.
I wonder if that's what it is.

253
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,350
I wonder if it's still so distraction 
tactic.

254
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,890
I truly believe it is.
I mean they appointed the UN,

255
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,950
appointed some chick to be the 
ambassador when the aliens come.

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,550
Listen Bitch.
You don't speak from.

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,320
Is that real?
Okay?

258
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,500
Yes.
The you can just at points.

259
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,030
Just sit around and wait.
She is a,

260
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,060
I believe she's an astrophysicist and 
her job is to communicate with the 

261
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,100
aliens.
You don't talk for me.

262
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,420
Hooker.
Can I just say something?

263
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,540
I got a dog.
We have been on this planet evolving 

264
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,480
with dogs for thousands of years and we 
don't speak Doberman.

265
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,660
We don't speak German shepherd and how 
do we think that they're going to show 

266
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,090
up and suddenly we're going to be like 
sit good alien up,

267
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,840
up your idea and they want a snack.
Is that they're going to be so much more

268
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:23,841
intelligent than us.
They're going to be able to understand 

269
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,181
what our language is.
They'll be able to decipher our 

270
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:26,181
language.
That's the hope and the dream.

271
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,110
I think they're going to show up and 
think,

272
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:28,780
food,
man.

273
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,710
You look soft and juicy.
Well,

274
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:35,630
what we do is if you look these people,
if you look at what you look at,

275
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,770
what do they appreciate us?
We'd be like cows.

276
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:42,771
You know?
If you look at what every single 

277
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:43,320
intelligent life form on this planet 
does,

278
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,620
they're gonna.
Make sure that they explored everything 

279
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:48,870
weaker than that.
That's the ethic of space.

280
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,090
It seems like there's the ethic of life 
on this earth,

281
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,440
on this planet is survival of the 
fittest.

282
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:53,940
It's

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and when you're the fitness,
you get to fuck the ones who are not as 

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
fit.
That's just the way it is.

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,660
Why human beings do to dolphins and sea 
world and what we do to killer whales.

286
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,110
We know the killer whales rescue human 
beings that fall off boats.

287
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,470
We know that there's never been a case 
in the wild of a killer whale documented

288
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:09,430
case.
Killing a human,

289
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,050
the only time they've ever done it then 
see,

290
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:16,051
well,
that's the only time I've ever done it 

291
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:16,051
is in capital.
And we know what dolphins do.

292
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:17,970
Dolphins killed baby dolphin so that 
they can force the female dolphins.

293
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,670
Dolphins are ruthless.
Is that true as fuck as true,

294
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,280
that they killed the baby hill?
The babies,

295
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,110
how do they kill them?
Kill Them.

296
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,490
Their face.
Are they kill them?

297
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,920
Yeah.
And that's one of the reasons.

298
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Yeah,
the dolphins raped the fuck out of each 

299
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,200
other too.

300
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,980
And one of the reasons why female 
dolphins are horace is female dolphins 

301
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,041
are super slutty and the reason being is
because they have to fuck as many male 

302
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:41,650
dolphins as possible so that when they 
have babies,

303
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,420
those male dolphins won't kill the 
babies.

304
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,680
So the male dolphin will go,
I could be mindset,

305
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,340
might be mine.
Damn the liker because they,

306
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,380
they get the Fucker,
this documentary.

307
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,980
And so the,
um,

308
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,880
the,
uh,

309
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,430
the idea being that the mother does not 
breed while she's with the baby.

310
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:02,431
So it takes like six years or something 
like that before she's going to breed 

311
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:02,431
again.
Oh,

312
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:02,640
before she breeds,
because before she breeds again,

313
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,610
because she has to take care of the 
baby.

314
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,540
How old?
How long does it

315
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,310
and lift?
That's a good question.

316
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,720
I don't know.
I don't know,

317
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,920
but you need to know a lot about sex 
life,

318
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,530
dolphins.
The thing about fucking one of those for

319
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,250
awhile,
if it only had a sheep's pussy,

320
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:22,180
but it was a dolphin,
put those two together.

321
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,450
You get pocket and if you drag you 
through the water at the same time,

322
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,050
take you on trips,
you going 40 miles an hour,

323
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,030
it'd be able to hold your breath.
Goddamn.

324
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,110
There'll be going to need to design some
new dolphin.

325
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,800
They can.
Fuck.

326
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,950
That's right.
Or maybe you could just climb on the 

327
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,100
back of a dolphin and just get a 
flashlight attached to the dolphin.

328
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,130
That could be.
I heard it already feels good.

329
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,960
There's videos on the Internet.
People fucking dolphins.

330
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:44,780
Have you seen this?
No.

331
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,150
No.
That can't be right.

332
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,940
That's totally real.
No one's fucking dolphins do it.

333
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,240
Possible.
Huh?

334
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,950
The penis comes out and the woman gets 
underneath it.

335
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,960
Or remember it was you making the shop.
Now I'm not,

336
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,360
now there's videos,
kinds of videos that people fucking dog 

337
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,360
therapy time,
actual sex.

338
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,640
Brian,
I need.

339
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,750
I need some clarification on.
Okay.

340
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,830
We need to.
We need to go deep on this one story.

341
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,090
We can't just leave people out there 
thinking that there's not many people 

342
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,090
are right now going,
this is bullshit.

343
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,780
I was looking at myself.
A lot of people.

344
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:15,070
That's the beautiful thing about the 
Internet.

345
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:20,071
Now instantly you could find out.
You can google and at least get the 

346
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:20,800
general consensus.
I mean,

347
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:25,801
you can't find out who killed Kennedy.
There's some shit that you can't find 

348
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:25,801
out,
but you can google.

349
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:25,870
Yes.
On 19.

350
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,840
Yeah.
Help us win in California.

351
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,840
Thirty short days away.
Prop.

352
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,380
Yeah,
it's.

353
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:33,610
Yes.
On [inaudible] dot com.

354
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,090
Thirty four days away.
And what are the most recent polls?

355
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,370
Recent polls show us winning.
Oh,

356
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,010
it depends on who's pulling.
You look at Fox or what have you.

357
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,510
And a while they make very human sounds.
And Brian,

358
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,780
he's looking at.

359
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,110
Don't tell them it's not real.
It's not real apple.

360
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,360
Dolphin uniform.
Apple.

361
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,880
Is it good to let you look at porn?
Yeah,

362
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:03,881
man.
How you think you're going to look at 

363
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:03,881
that on that?
They're going to take no dolphin porn.

364
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:03,881
No good.
Yeah,

365
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:04,460
but they can't stop you from going all 
those,

366
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,510
uh,
those websites.

367
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,730
Now they will go to html fire because of
the IPAD.

368
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,510
All the porn websites,
they,

369
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,480
none of them were flat base anymore 
until like,

370
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,130
oh really?
You can't get on the IPAD.

371
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,460
Oh,
let's just change this shit up.

372
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:17,240
So on,
change everything in html five.

373
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,120
And then that works on your ipad and 
then you can watch porn on your ipad.

374
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,550
Who would have known innovation leading 
the way?

375
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,810
Again,
it's porn leading the way.

376
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:26,000
There are a lot of Christians who need 
their porn.

377
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,070
They do you know.
How about that new dude?

378
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,150
The guy busted.
What's his name?

379
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,470
Eddie Long.
So his name,

380
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,830
the new big bangs.
Preacher boy.

381
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,110
What is his name?
Dude,

382
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:43,111
that's double bad because you know,
brothers and is supposed to be even 

383
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:43,880
thinking like brothers did not get no 
homo man.

384
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,120
That's the proposition.
Eight passed in California.

385
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,420
A lot of gay people were really pissed 
off at black folks.

386
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,090
Black folks voted some ridiculous 
number.

387
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,650
Hey,
this percentage,

388
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,820
white folks should be mad at that 
Christian siblings who brought 

389
00:15:59,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Christianity to all these poor people,
you know,

390
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,250
because that's really the problem.
Okay,

391
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:06,251
well you're going fake with moral a 
little bit far with your blame there 

392
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:06,251
fella.
Whoa.

393
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:06,980
What is this guy's name?
Ed Long.

394
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,230
What was the guy's name?
Busted.

395
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,840
I want to read this online due to be 
added long.

396
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:15,380
That's like as right to to this size of 
the dolphins.

397
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:20,381
Dick,
the best way you can have sex with a 

398
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:20,381
male doctor in this.

399
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:24,060
The masturbator Brian male to his name 
is Eddie Long.

400
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,670
It's true.
Eddie long right?

401
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,830
This fiction,
you really couldn't man.

402
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:38,831
It's like you remember when that was a 
long name.

403
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,980
You know it,
right?

404
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,830
Here's the best part.
Homies got a pink tie.

405
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,360
Oh,
how about that?

406
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,610
So he's the one taking it.
Yeah.

407
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,140
We're watching it.
Not necessarily with the pink.

408
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,770
Tie this off.
Yeah,

409
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:52,670
I'm right here.
Everything else is black outfits.

410
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,500
Dark and strong.
Powerful.

411
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,450
He just said,
you know,

412
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,650
I'm into that boy pussy.
Well,

413
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,210
bringing the flashlight.
This is.

414
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,270
This is a big ad.
Yeah,

415
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,130
they're good at it.
Kept it ads.

416
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,330
They saying,
fuck your Tivo.

417
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,240
I know that's like the only time I ever 
watch as now or what?

418
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,270
I'm trying to watch a youtube clip or 
CNN.com.

419
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,980
Hey,
you know what man,

420
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:16,220
it's only 30 seconds whenever.
Well of my life added up.

421
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,740
So this guy,
this Ed,

422
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,810
Eddie Long,
another Christian man in a position of 

423
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,170
power that it turns out was actually 
banging boys.

424
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,940
Shocking.
What if,

425
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,970
what if?
What if like the Catholic church has 

426
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,360
been run by gays who were angry at the 
straight people this whole time,

427
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,320
right?
And they get to wear their dresses and 

428
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,361
have their fabulous cars and they drink 
out of the cold chalices and be covered 

429
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:41,630
and all these colors and live in total 
secrecy.

430
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,620
And then pick out the little gay kid 
right out of the straight audience.

431
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,020
Is that dating kate?
Madonna.

432
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,350
Whoa.
What do you mean the church hate 

433
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,350
Madonna?
You know,

434
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,350
gay people love Mcdonald's.
Mcdonald's.

435
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,810
So that's for your analysis does not 
hold it.

436
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,820
I think it's true.
That's what you think it is.

437
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,350
It's an ancient gay cult salts pope 
wearing the dress.

438
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,070
Yeah,
of course.

439
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,380
Cow.
What's up with that crazy fish head?

440
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,990
All of them at the Vatican at.
Let me think.

441
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,170
I don't want to fuck women.
I want to go live with men for the rest 

442
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,170
of my life.
Pretty much.

443
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,480
You get and you're not even allowed to 
masturbate.

444
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,390
Why don't just,
Oh,

445
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,720
nocturnal admissions.
Well,

446
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,040
you can't even dream about getting off,
but how about Saul?

447
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:25,041
Peter?
That's shit they give them to keep them 

448
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,041
from getting horny.
That's not true.

449
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,041
It's not real.
It's an urban myth.

450
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,320
Pretty much.
It's an urban myth,

451
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,530
but they still didn't actually give it 
to them and stuff.

452
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:29,100
I think.
No,

453
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,140
I don't think it might be in jail all 
the time.

454
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:31,820
There's always this.
Well,

455
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:34,800
Peter in the food really?
I don't know.

456
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:35,650
Whatever.
Uh,

457
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:40,651
I can't say I still dream of my 
girlfriends and wake up feeling a 

458
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:44,191
failure.
Rousy they're really assault Peter in 

459
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,031
jail.
That's one of those urban legends type 

460
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:47,031
things.

461
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:47,031
But urban legend,
the whole idea is ridiculous.

462
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:49,080
The whole idea that anybody would ask 
you to not have sex.

463
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,420
Like why would God give me a deck if I 
didn't want to use it?

464
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,520
God don't procreate,
go,

465
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,090
God does.
Not only does he not want you to 

466
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,090
procreate,
doesn't want you to feel affection,

467
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,660
doesn't want you to love someone that 
talks about,

468
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,010
you know,
there's no evolution.

469
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:07,011
There's just creationism.
They don't want to talk about incestual 

470
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:07,020
relations between Adam and eve and all 
your kids.

471
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,910
Yeah.
What the fuck that come from God.

472
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,530
Show up and get with the new boat.
Hey,

473
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:11,370
I got new.
Fresh,

474
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,590
fresh.
There you go,

475
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,720
brother.
Sisters fucking like crazy.

476
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,460
That would be what it had to be,
wouldn't it?

477
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,190
If you go with the Christians and then 
they did all this in 6,000

478
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,210
years.
So what's up?

479
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,870
You're my brother.

480
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,950
What's a Christian brothers?
Don't eat that apple watch is bad.

481
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,040
You know,
and you know,

482
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:32,050
don't listen to a union.
That was the first prohibition 

483
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,570
prohibition of Thou shall not eat from 
the tree of knowledge.

484
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,190
And,
and who was the big cop,

485
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,120
right?
God.

486
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,440
How many people to two people he had to 
police and God,

487
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,160
according to Christian mythology 
couldn't handle prohibition.

488
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,530
Yeah.
How alertness is a god would make some 

489
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:49,530
shit that he didn't want you to eat.
You don't eat it.

490
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,930
I'm telling you I will fuck your world 
up.

491
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,900
Oh,
you ate the apple that I told you not to

492
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:55,410
eat.
Well,

493
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,480
guess what?
You don't ever get a second chance.

494
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,660
You're fucked forever.
Your whole species is fucked.

495
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,040
Joe.
Do you ever wonder if that's.

496
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,100
Do you wonder if that snake,
that one snake,

497
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,980
the original snake ever made it?
If he made it on Noah's Ark,

498
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,060
do you ever think about that?

499
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,350
Like no one does.
That snake was.

500
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,330
The devil wasn't really that much.
I know.

501
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,830
I was just like,
I was hoping that snake made it.

502
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,540
Maybe that snake is all around us all 
the time.

503
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,460
Yeah,
pretty much.

504
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,280
The whole idea that,
you know,

505
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,060
they'll make fun of fucking Muslims or 
that they'll make fun of scientologists.

506
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,260
They'll make fun of,
you know,

507
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,060
like,
well they've got the wrong thing.

508
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,530
You know,
we to come to Jesus.

509
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Let's see.
I argue that everybody's an atheist 

510
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,451
because a Jew doesn't believe in a 
Christian God and the Christian God 

511
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:41,151
doesn't believe in Buddha and the Buddha
doesn't believe in the Jewish God and 

512
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:41,151
none of them believe in Mohammed.
So it's really,

513
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:43,320
they're all atheists because they don't 
believe in anything,

514
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:48,321
but they're little fantasy truthfully.
So they're all atheists to somebody 

515
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:48,321
else's shit to

516
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,760
somebody else's shit.
They don't believe in their other gods.

517
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:52,590
So Bam,
suddenly we're in alignment.

518
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:54,540
I just don't also believe with any of 
their gods.

519
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,460
It's amazing that there are so many 
different religions.

520
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
Hundreds.
Literally,

521
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,250
we were new.
We were lost.

522
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:05,251
We needed direction.
We need someone to walk up and go where 

523
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:05,251
the food is.
I know where you'll be warm.

524
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,600
I know how to heal you sick when you die
and come with me.

525
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,300
It's amazing that there's so many 
different religions,

526
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:13,480
but even though we know that they all 
say different shit,

527
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,710
everyone is willing to die believing 
that the one they believe is right.

528
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,020
Even though there's so many examples of 
contradicting ideas for whatever fucking

529
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,140
reason.
We compartmentalize that when we,

530
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:27,430
you know,
go down the road of being a mormon or go

531
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,650
down the road of being a Catholic or a 
baptist,

532
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,570
we just don't look at it.

533
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,070
Just don't just say this is my team and 
screw your a team.

534
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,520
And it's a very and 10 fl mentality,
you know,

535
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,600
Rah Rah,
my team.

536
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,410
You're a team.

537
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,330
It's all the same shit.
It is all the same shit.

538
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,970
When I was in Indiana,
I was in Indiana for UFC.

539
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,980
Anybody who fought somebody from 
Indiana,

540
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,290
even if they were American,
they would boo them.

541
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,120
Realize you're not from Indiana.

542
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,040
That's a local boy hoosiers.
But think about Indiana is great,

543
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,050
don't get me wrong,
but at the,

544
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,310
the mentality is so fucked up that your.
You're booing against other Americans 

545
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:05,220
because they're not from a similar 
place.

546
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,280
They're not within a certain distance of
where you sleep.

547
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,860
So you're there.
You don't even like them right now,

548
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,230
who's going up against a guy like we 
need?

549
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:18,231
We don't just have Americans versus the 
rest of the world will go down to 

550
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:18,231
neighborhoods,
will break.

551
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:19,800
We'll break it down to neighborhoods.
We'll break it down to the hatfields and

552
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,310
mccoys.

553
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,810
The problem with Indiana is that there's
nothing else to fucking do there.

554
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
And they're not known for much in 
Indiana.

555
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,880
And so that movie hoosiers came out,
everyone was like,

556
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:33,881
sports is now our big thing.
So now it's like seriously came out 

557
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:34,930
because sports is a big thing.
Right,

558
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:35,350
right,
right.

559
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,360
But,
but they're so proud of that movie and 

560
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,131
that because that's all they have kind 
of living in Indiana to have this thing 

561
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:42,780
called the Indianapolis 500.
That was kind of rights.

562
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,980
Do they have a lot of shit dude?
Yeah.

563
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:49,981
So it's fair to bring farming back to 
the midwest is what we gotta do.

564
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:53,390
We gotta really farming.
You bring it back to him.

565
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,500
We need him,
man.

566
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,260
Well I know farm aid right now is in its
25th year in.

567
00:22:57,261 --> 00:23:02,261
The problem with it is 25 years and 
they've gotten were because all these 

568
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:02,940
people they're trying to convince,
they've built their,

569
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:07,941
their,
their farms on corn and cotton are 

570
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:10,301
completely wrong and they're not gonna 
have any economic independence back 

571
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:10,301
until they get there.

572
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,330
John Cougar Mellencamp came onto the 
screen and they booed him really?

573
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,740
In Indiana from India.
He is the cue card.

574
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,960
He's a liberal liberal fucking real low.
It was crazy.

575
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,840
He showed them.
I expected everybody to go ape shit.

576
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,400
Wow.

577
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,840
Move.

578
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,420
You know,
in Ohio the farms are getting so bad 

579
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:40,420
that they're like closing farms left and
right,

580
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,440
that a lot of the farms are turning into
shopping centers where my mom lived just

581
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:46,490
in five years,
used to be farms everywhere and now it's

582
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,090
like commercial buildings and they're 
just,

583
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,110
they're losing all these farms because 
there's no money in it or something's 

584
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,110
not going on.
Right,

585
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,110
right.
At,

586
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,980
in the farming industry in Ohio,

587
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,360
well there's,
it's very difficult to run a farm and 

588
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,360
make a profit.
It's incredibly difficult.

589
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,430
It's so fucking

590
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,300
hard,
especially when you're up against unfair

591
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,210
trade practices in fucking fuels that 
come from 9,000

592
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,640
miles away.
How about c?

593
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,060
Do you know you don't even own your 
seeds when you're a farmer,

594
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:09,210
when you

595
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:15,550
big deal and you know what hemp is the 
one thing that we need to really push 

596
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,600
that we don't have gml control of.
We have to stand up and ask for a,

597
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,040
you know,
our civil rights back.

598
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,900
We have to demand them and back.
In fact,

599
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:21,770
I mean,
when we.

600
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,890
When the seeds thing though,
what I was saying is when you buy seeds,

601
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:30,891
if you're a farmer,
you buy these seeds that have been made 

602
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:30,891
by this company.
Monsanto.

603
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,340
Yeah.
You don't own those seeds.

604
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:37,341
You Go,
you got those seeds and when you plant 

605
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,280
your new plants and you grow,
like save you grow peppers,

606
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:41,400
you can't take the seeds out of those 
peppers and grow more peppers

607
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,880
because you don't own that.
You don't own that.

608
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,750
They'll sue you in copywritten.
If it is,

609
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,010
it's incredible.
Monsanto has actually people that go 

610
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,190
around and test crops of people that 
they suspect are using a generation away

611
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:57,650
from their last seat and it's really 
scary.

612
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,050
I mean,
and you know crazy is that we take those

613
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:03,440
seeds and like make new new versions of 
that seed.

614
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,640
It can't trace of it.
No.

615
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,600
Is that medically modified so they know

616
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,090
the genome of this particular plant that
they've created is.

617
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,650
So if you have that shit in your field,
you have to pay them every year.

618
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,780
Every year you have to pay for new 
seeds.

619
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:21,000
You can't do the way people always did 
it.

620
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:26,001
You grew tomatoes,
you took the seeds from the tomatoes 

621
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:26,001
mode tomatoes,
they can't,

622
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:26,001
you can't do that.
Now.

623
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,430
It's illegal,
but data is the nuttiest shit ever,

624
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:34,431
and that's the number one reason for 
Jimmy genetically modifying food is to 

625
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:35,760
control the market.
And that's the number one reason.

626
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:39,320
Also why marijuana will always remain 
illegal to a lot of people there.

627
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,300
They'll want to keep it illegal rather 
is because I can't control it.

628
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:42,450
No,

629
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,560
you know,
hemp is grown in every industrialized 

630
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,560
country other than America.
It amazing.

631
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,740
How crazy is that?
Canada right up north,

632
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:49,560
right above us,
right?

633
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,610
They're growing it.
They grow all of the seed products that 

634
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:54,610
are in whole foods and all that.
Nutrition.

635
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,300
So all this is money that farmers could 
be making this shit.

636
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,780
All this shit.
They're stealing from them.

637
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,420
These cons,
the government is stealing from them.

638
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,360
Steve Miller,
Julie,

639
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,680
and it's dealing it by denying them 
their culture.

640
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,690
Fucking best country.
There's going to Indiana,

641
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,650
they're going to bomb California is what
they're gonna.

642
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,210
What are they going to do that 
proposition nine takes over 19,

643
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,280
19,
proposition 19 thinking gay.

644
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,050
It's running when the,
um,

645
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,930
when they,
when that shit goes into effect,

646
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,330
if and when it's going to change the 
culture,

647
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:35,510
it's kind of,
that's the big change is going to be in 

648
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,610
people's behavior because you can talk 
all the paper you want,

649
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:40,611
but what was the most fascinating thing 
to me is what it does to people 

650
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,490
socially.
It changes the fuck out of human beings,

651
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,700
right?

652
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,480
Well,
you know,

653
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,850
some of the things people are coming out
against prop.

654
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:48,930
Nice 19 to saying is that it's going to 
lend itself to corporations and it's not

655
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,940
true.
Corporations are not saying that.

656
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,810
Who's saying that?
Well,

657
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:56,811
believe it or not,
we have a lot of people that are in the 

658
00:26:56,811 --> 00:26:57,120
medical marijuana industry that don't 
want to see prop 19 past because they're

659
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,970
comfortable right now and they're 
profiteering and they don't want to see,

660
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,590
you know,
a status quo change.

661
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:06,591
And it's really sad because these are 
the people that would benefit the most 

662
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,280
when they're local communities allow 
them to start selling to anybody over 21

663
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:09,740
without a doctor's note.
Right?

664
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,870
But the doctors who've been making their
living for all these years,

665
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:15,810
given away prescriptions and charged 150
bucks a pop,

666
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,540
that's the source of income these guys 
have.

667
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,270
That's where historically wealthy and 
they'll do fine.

668
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,470
Actually practicing medicine,
I'm sure maybe,

669
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,670
but when you're set up for years and 
years and years,

670
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:31,671
just given out medical marijuana 
prescriptions and you're comfortable 

671
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:34,611
with it,
then all sudden something's going to 

672
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:34,611
come along to make your business go 
away.

673
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:34,920
You're going to have to come up with 
some whole new business,

674
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,530
but if you're a selfish douche bag,
I could see where you'd be like,

675
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,250
man,
I don't want this.

676
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,510
Isn't that why the alcohol beverage 
industry is giving to the campaign 

677
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,550
against us?
Isn't that why all these interested self

678
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:47,680
interested companies are stepping up?
Some kids,

679
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,800
you don't expect it out of the medical 
marijuana doc.

680
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,830
Another lie heard was that big tobacco 
moneys behind this when it's such 

681
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,470
bullshit proposition 19.
Yes.

682
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,730
When you can look up and see where all 
the money came from,

683
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,900
it it realistically,
the prop 19 was passed by somebody that 

684
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,810
has somebody I've known for over 15 
years.

685
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,200
He's a really good person that really 
just wanted to do the right thing.

686
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,870
He wanted to put forward a more liberal 
PR initiative,

687
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,080
but he had cash and he pulled the 
initiative and he found that more 

688
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,801
liberal initiatives.
We're not polling well enough to 

689
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:18,801
actually pass,
so we actually pulled back,

690
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:23,721
pull back,
pull back on the verbiage until the gun 

691
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:26,270
initiative that polled well enough to 
pass and what a lot of people don't 

692
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,360
realize is that this is not the means to
the end.

693
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,910
This is just.
Or this is a means to the end.

694
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:34,911
It's not the end.
It's just one small step in the 

695
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,600
evolution of getting our freedoms back 
and this prop 19 is going to be one step

696
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:41,601
closer to having our rights back and 
what a lot of people aren't talking 

697
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:41,601
about,
which is pissing me off,

698
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:46,311
is that we got meg whitman buying her 
way into the governorship and we have 

699
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:46,740
Steve Cooley who has been the guy down 
here in la.

700
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,740
For those of you who don't live in La,
who has been closing down all the Los 

701
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,880
Angeles pot clubs,
and if this guy gets the top cop 

702
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,820
position in the state of California and 
prop 19 loses all of these idiots and 

703
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:02,760
I'll say you are idiots that are going 
against prop 19 that are selling medical

704
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:07,761
marijuana,
are going to lose your businesses and 

705
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:08,010
lose your freedoms and the only thing 
that's going to protect you right now is

706
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:13,011
if everybody in the state gets the 
rights that you have been getting for 

707
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:16,221
the last 14 years since medical 
marijuana concentrate on these dildos.

708
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,460
Let's concentrate on that.
Yeah,

709
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:19,050
let's try and concentrate on that cop.
What's the.

710
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,390
Yeah,
I'm sorry.

711
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,610
Steve Cooley is.
This is the guy that's running for 

712
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:25,740
attorney general and he's basically 
running it.

713
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:30,741
Somebody that's against the death 
penalty and in California you might as 

714
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:33,861
well be running,
get somebody on a post running against 

715
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:33,861
someone who's against the death penalty.

716
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:33,861
Yes.
Oh,

717
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:35,610
so he's running unopposed in that sense.
He is.

718
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:37,080
Absolutely.
And when he gets in,

719
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:40,080
his agenda is to do in the state,
but he has already done in La.

720
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,230
Well why's he want to shut down medical 
pot stores ideologically and who knows 

721
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,120
what,
who knows what he's invested in,

722
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:49,770
who knows what his reality is from those
campaigns,

723
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,430
how to his life,
you know,

724
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:52,400
who knows who,
who,

725
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,000
who really he's loyal to in that sense.
You know,

726
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,090
but there's something,
there's some campaign contributions or 

727
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,090
something.
There's something going on.

728
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,020
I would love to be able to find it,
follow the money forensically and see 

729
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,141
exactly where it came to these people 
because in some ways there's got to be 

730
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:07,141
strings pulling them,
you know,

731
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:09,820
and it's not cheap to run a campaign in 
the state of California.

732
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,460
You need to get on the side to people 
with a lot of money.

733
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,540
That's where don't have a lot of that 
money that she is very,

734
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:18,970
very rich.
And what is she?

735
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,360
What was her position in Ebay?
She had something to do with Ebay.

736
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,850
She,
I thought,

737
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,390
founded,
not founded.

738
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:30,391
She was the one that was brought in and 
brought them from being a very small 

739
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:33,121
company to a very large company.
She helped organize them and she rode 

740
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:33,121
their growth curve.
Okay,

741
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:37,330
so she made a ton of money off Ebay and 
now she wants to be the governor and 

742
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:37,330
she's spending how much money to do this
already.

743
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,121
Spent over 100 million dollars of her 
own money to become governor of 

744
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:43,360
$100,000,000
for a job that pays 200,000

745
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,950
a year.
Google it people much as pay.

746
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
It's pays nothing.
And,

747
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,910
and this is the scarier part.
It's like,

748
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:53,911
what do you think she's going to 
accomplish with this hundred million 

749
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:53,911
dollar influence?
What is she doing this for?

750
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:55,720
A testament to their ego.
You know,

751
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,150
it's building a big,
you know,

752
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,710
don't do it too.
And you know,

753
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,370
this is just turned my volume down.
No,

754
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,820
this is the part that kind of bothers me
is that this is more of what we've had 

755
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,881
for a long time.
It's just that now we're looking at it 

756
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:10,711
and were grossed out by it,
but don't think before newspapers and 

757
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:13,561
Internet carried the word that robber 
barons weren't running politics going 

758
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:14,020
back to the thirties and forties and 
fifties.

759
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,430
And when,
when I say they,

760
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,650
I don't mean to sound like some 
conspiracy nut.

761
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,800
I mean to sound like somebody that's 
realistic about the fact that alcohol 

762
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,230
got together after prohibition and went,
Yo,

763
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:24,700
who's our competition?
Oh,

764
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:28,390
these kids are smoking this local weed 
out a psa and then they really should go

765
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,620
after talking to this way.
Okay.

766
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,820
This is Meg Whitman woman.
She is obviously very wealthy.

767
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Um,
so it's going to be very difficult to 

768
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,280
buy a person who's very wealthy.
She very wealthy.

769
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,200
So why would this very wealthy person 
want to stop medical marijuana in 

770
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,230
California?
Because that is what she wants to do.

771
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,350
What would be her motivation?
Because it would not be financial,

772
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:48,610
right?
She doesn't need the money.

773
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,700
She's spending 100 million dollars.
Can I say governor?

774
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,701
You don't think that the alcohol 
companies for sure and not giving her 

775
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:56,701
$100,
million million,

776
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:56,701
killing.
You have that much money,

777
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:58,250
Joe,
it isn't sitting in a locker at the edge

778
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,280
of your bed.
It's sitting in investments and I'd love

779
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:05,281
to know what her portfolio is invested 
in because she has people that are 

780
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:06,100
actually standing there saying,
this is what I'll advise you to do,

781
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,250
and anybody that's advising somebody 
that has literally hundreds of millions 

782
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,010
of dollars vested way is going to say,
listen,

783
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,530
this initiative is bad for your liquor 
investments.

784
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,240
It's bad for your pharmaceutical 
investments.

785
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:19,690
It's bad for a financial decision on her
part.

786
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,730
A lot of why we're dealing with 
prohibition and why we're dealing with 

787
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,631
people that are against it is because of
the financial connections they have in 

788
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:28,330
the more wealthy they are,
the more that people lean against them.

789
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,590
How?
How few?

790
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:34,650
In a sense do we have a view?
Because here you are a guy that made it 

791
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,330
in TV.
Five years of Newsradio,

792
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,350
five plus years on fear factor.
You have a career.

793
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,190
You will have advisors around you 
saying,

794
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,810
listen Joe,
if you do stupid stuff,

795
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,900
it's going to knock it you the big jobs 
that will pay a lot of money and then 

796
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,570
I'm not going to make money.
So where those Pearson's going to advise

797
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,460
you to go be the activist that you've 
become?

798
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,630
Are they going to say,
Bro?

799
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,990
Really?
Because I know that a lot of other 

800
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:55,990
actors have to stop and think,
man,

801
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,130
I won't get hired if,
if I start getting all radical and 

802
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,160
that's what they really believe.
So they towed the line.

803
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,710
You are so rare because you haven't told
the line.

804
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,580
He said,
fuck it.

805
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,840
I'd rather be happy and be myself than 
be some slave to a corporate,

806
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:08,810
you know,
dictation.

807
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,120
Yeah,
well you don't have to do it that way.

808
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:13,230
Those guys are pussies.
A lot of them are.

809
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,190
But when you're a nice person,
but how few woody Harrelson's and Joe 

810
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,210
Rogan's do we have speaking up for the 
right reasons.

811
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,380
Um,
well,

812
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:26,381
you know what?
A lot of people have families and they 

813
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,331
want to play it safe and they feel 
conservative and they get paranoid and 

814
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:31,250
they don't trust in the greater good of 
humanity and the people's ability to see

815
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,690
what they're saying.
They don't.

816
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,750
They don't have faith in their ability 
to express themselves so that people 

817
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,480
understand the point of view that they 
have and where they're coming from.

818
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,900
I have confidence in my ability to 
express myself and you do it for us all 

819
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,630
in the way that's important for 
everybody.

820
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,580
I think everybody should and would do 
it.

821
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:48,830
If you're.
If you're a rational thinking person,

822
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,530
why would you live your life pretending 
to be something other than who you are.

823
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,770
You know?
Why would you not want people to know 

824
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:56,770
about something that's radically changed
the way you look at the world?

825
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,950
Why would you not want to?
Why?

826
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:00,410
Because fucking meg whitman says it's 
bad.

827
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,060
We get that bitch.
Get the fuck.

828
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Did she quit or get fired from Ebay?
I don't know because she's a woman who 

829
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,871
wants to be in control of things.
It's always 75 percent of Ebay's 

830
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,030
audience stone people in the middle of 
night buying shit.

831
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,670
She shouldn't have her audience.
I don't know.

832
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,930
She probably pulled this airplane.
I got fired.

833
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,870
You know she's a slapped away.
Far more lucrative.

834
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,820
Creepy man.
Women don't want to run.

835
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:24,810
Shit creeped me out.
No,

836
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,800
I know it sounds gross,
but it's totally true.

837
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,060
Soundwise Hillary Clinton.
He doesn't.

838
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:32,300
She doesn't creep you out.
She is a creep me the fuck out.

839
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,350
Right?
But at least a rise of Condoleeza Rice 

840
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:37,350
was running things.

841
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,360
When you think you'd freak the fuck out.
Creepy guys.

842
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,570
Dick Cheney came to.
I'm not saying I want guys running shit,

843
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,580
but at least they've been doing that 
forever.

844
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,390
My older chick wants to hop in there and
compete with the men.

845
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,500
I'm like,
what are you crazy bitch?

846
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,240
What are you doing?
You're not balanced.

847
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:55,241
You ain't got no fucking Yogi.
You're not going to see through the 

848
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:55,241
maze.
You're.

849
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:56,360
You're fucking just as crazy as the men,
if not crazier,

850
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,970
because you have to because you're a 
woman and because they're going to prove

851
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,680
that they're tougher than the men 
they're replacing.

852
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,710
That scares me.
I there was a moment where Hillary 

853
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:05,710
Clinton was running for president when I
was thinking,

854
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,760
you know what?
She's going to win at.

855
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:12,761
What if she wins and she gets a new 
position where one of these crazy fucks 

856
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:14,120
from another country tests her because 
she's a woman.

857
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,150
I mean if that political power is real 
and that the president really has any 

858
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:25,001
say,
and then anybody in another country 

859
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:25,001
really does pay attention to them,
that it's not all this big,

860
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:28,400
gigantic build a burger meeting group.
Assuming that a president is real,

861
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,670
could you imagine what Putin would do if
he sat across from fucking Hillary 

862
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,770
Clinton or salar Pailin at a.
it's some sort of a.

863
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,910
it's horrible.
He would crush them,

864
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,740
isn't a mock them.
He would.

865
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,950
He would.
Most cultures put their most 

866
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,351
intellectually capable people in power 
and not their best idiots.

867
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,510
It's just,
it's not that.

868
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,910
It's not that men should be running shit
right.

869
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,030
It's not.
It's the most capable bit of the alpha.

870
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:02,031
The one,
the idea of having a leader is fucking 

871
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:04,281
ridiculous.
I think it's an archaic shit that we 

872
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:06,411
have to figure a new way around,
so I'm not saying that men should be 

873
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:06,411
running shit.

874
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:07,770
Anybody who was a woman that wants to 
run shit,

875
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,320
like that's kinda crazy.
Like you don't even have a dick.

876
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:11,730
Why are you trying to control 
everything?

877
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,940
What are you doing?
Why are you trying to fucking grab the 

878
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:16,940
reins?
What do you do it?

879
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,040
I don't want to be president.
Okay.

880
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,090
I'm not.
I don't want to be a leader.

881
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:23,091
I'm don't get me wrong.
I'm not saying that I am better than a 

882
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:25,821
woman who would be doing the job.
I'm saying when I see a woman who wants 

883
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:28,551
to be a leader,
I understand the man wanting to be a 

884
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:28,551
leader.
It makes sense to me.

885
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:29,070
Even if I don't believe in it or agree 
with it.

886
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:31,120
I understand it.
When I say a woman is wanting to do it,

887
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,030
I'm like,
look at that crazy bitch.

888
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,360
That's what I think.
I think you want to be the king of the 

889
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,360
world and you're a chick.

890
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,400
Whoa.
You know?

891
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,760
But yet,
Iceland's not in wars and they had a 

892
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,740
female froze.
I was thinking of all that female 

893
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,310
leaders around the world.
I'm like,

894
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,630
there's a lot.
I totally sexist.

895
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,770
It's totally sexist,
don't get me wrong.

896
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:54,750
But I don't think anybody should be a 
leader.

897
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:59,751
I think the whole idea based on science,
it's based on some leftover fucking shit

898
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:05,241
from back when we were a tribe of 200 
monkey people and we needed a leader to 

899
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:10,101
protect us from the other monkey people 
wanted to rape our women and take our 

900
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:10,101
food.
I mean,

901
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:14,391
that's what it is.
The idea that one person can represent 

902
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:14,391
the whole country,
like a president.

903
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:18,381
I don't give a fuck if he has a cabinet.
I don't give up the idea that there's a 

904
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:20,730
one guy that stands there and gentlemen,
the president of the United States,

905
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,660
you know,
even the figurehead,

906
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,570
even if the descendant of royalty,
it's shirt and it's an Avatar,

907
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,040
that the whole idea is ridiculous.

908
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,350
It's,
it's,

909
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:34,351
it's so really created our whole 
structure in America to compete against 

910
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:34,351
what they were,
what they were fighting.

911
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,540
And then they became and they became 
wayward,

912
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,950
right?
Wayward.

913
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,690
It's beautiful.
I love that.

914
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,620
I'm going to hear so much shit from my 
female friends.

915
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,650
Well thank you.
Don't think women should be running 

916
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:48,650
things.
Oh,

917
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:48,780
what does that mean?
I think men do it better.

918
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,320
Maybe.
Maybe might have been doing it wrong for

919
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:57,321
so long.
Maybe be good for a woman to give it a 

920
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:59,481
try.
Like you're definitely comfortable in 

921
00:37:59,481 --> 00:37:59,481
your relationship.
That's a worldly thing to say.

922
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:01,080
If she's a woman,
meaning like,

923
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,570
I know what I mean.
I'm not going to be like,

924
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:05,900
yeah,
fuck women should be presidents now.

925
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:08,490
I'm like,
what was his name to be president?

926
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:13,491
What are you talking about?
He's saying he's afraid to get his dick 

927
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:13,491
cut off when it goes home.

928
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,700
And he's obviously saying you're not.
So what he's saying is you misread he's 

929
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,310
saying is he's trying to pretend to be 
someone different.

930
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,180
So he's attractive female race.
It is.

931
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,230
I'm not a bashing that females rate.
Listen,

932
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,240
most females,
the women that take that are constant 

933
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,400
and not bashing the female racers.
I'm not bashing them male race.

934
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:34,650
It doesn't want to be president.
You know,

935
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:36,580
most of the male race doesn't want to be
president.

936
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,320
You don't want to be president.
It's not a male thing.

937
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:43,321
It's a leader thing,
but what I'm saying is I understand the 

938
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,380
creepy fuck control freak men.
I understand that instinct,

939
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,200
but when I see a chick that wants a rock
that I go,

940
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,540
what's going on there?
Sarah Pailin.

941
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I guess one way.
Sarah Palin's just his dummy that got 

942
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:54,720
stuck into a nice position that she's 
trying to make some money.

943
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,930
I mean,
that's really what it is,

944
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,410
but after awhile it's not that anymore.
After a while it's like,

945
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:04,411
well,
you're the figurehead for the retard 

946
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:05,971
movement and you're just like them and 
you got a microphone on you and there's 

947
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:06,760
a spotlight on you and Oh,
now you're a fucking problem because you

948
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,770
never were supposed to get to this point
and send out.

949
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:13,771
You've artificially been inserted into 
the public consciousness with no merit 

950
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:14,140
and now all the retards go.

951
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,950
They rise up and start these fucking tea
party rallies.

952
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,010
Have you watched any of that shit?
Crazy God damn thing Glenn Beck is just 

953
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,661
making gold underwear and gold socks and
diamond covered fucking cars from that 

954
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:34,630
guy.
Must be just scraping it in with raikes.

955
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,370
She'll obviously fully shit too.
It's like his game only works on the DM.

956
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,350
It only put.
There's so many dumb people.

957
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:44,350
It's a very effective tactic.
Him and her together.

958
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:49,351
Men,
they scare the fuck out of double dumb 

959
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:49,351
dumb.
Glenn Beck and Sarah Pailin.

960
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:52,330
They combined forces with the president.
Do they could.

961
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,710
They could run for president,
man.

962
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:54,810
That's real shit.
I hope that

963
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,070
presidents of black lady with a list and
that's totally a lesbian.

964
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,370
I hope it's like every single horrible 
thing that's wrong with,

965
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,590
you know,
like banning gay marriage,

966
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:05,580
you know,
women presidents.

967
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:10,581
I hope it's all combined into one like 
super president that just pisses off 

968
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:14,760
everybody hope it's an alien,
an alien

969
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,330
alien winds than disguise of a human 
being and then tells her buddy,

970
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,230
now that we have a deputy that we'd like
to know that I'm in place and I'm 

971
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,780
running shit,
but just need to sit the fuck down.

972
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,730
We've been thinking about exterminating 
you.

973
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:31,731
Fucks for about 50 years now.
I thought your concept of us being cold 

974
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:32,760
was really accurate.
Well,

975
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:37,761
it is a giant life form.
It's a giant life form on a super 

976
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:37,840
organism.
That's what the human race is.

977
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,490
The human race is on earth.
Earth is a life form.

978
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,970
It is a super organism.
You know?

979
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,660
We don't think of planets that support 
life as a life form,

980
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,330
but because it's an environment where 
life grows,

981
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,480
but I'm not so sure about that.
If you look at lava and the center and 

982
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,601
the magnetic core and you look at the 
magnetosphere and the atmosphere and 

983
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:59,130
like this is not just a place where life
is.

984
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:01,300
It's almost like a system.
It's alive and well.

985
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,030
I don't know what's conscious man.
We're guessing and we assume that 

986
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,770
conscious means that it can talk like us
and move like Gospel.

987
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,860
We don't know.
We don't.

988
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,890
There's a lot of evidence that there 
might be something going on inside 

989
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,951
trees.
Some sort of fucking a real reaction 

990
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:19,350
that trees and plants have to pee.
People

991
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,100
will thank US cellular intelligence.
Yeah,

992
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,520
and that's really where we've always 
thought,

993
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:24,360
oh,
it's in our brain,

994
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:26,640
and then there's this myth that we don't
even use our own brain,

995
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,290
all of our brain,
and it's like,

996
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:33,291
really?
Do you know how many of us are you 

997
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:33,770
stupid that you believe that your whole 
body's not actually it all,

998
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,070
all marks right now.
And I think that our capability of 

999
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,070
intelligence is really,
really deep.

1000
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,490
That's a metaphor.
I think for,

1001
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:45,491
um,
wasted potential if people have this 

1002
00:41:45,491 --> 00:41:45,491
idea that we're only using 10 percent of
our brains.

1003
00:41:45,491 --> 00:41:48,500
If we just really concentrate like that.
No one even knows what that means.

1004
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:53,501
What does that mean?
You're only using 10 percent of your 

1005
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,061
brain.
What's going on with the other 90 

1006
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:55,061
percent of useful?
Well,

1007
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:59,020
you know how we know how the brain works
when we blow holes and parts of the 

1008
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,321
brain,
we shoot people in parts of their head 

1009
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:02,321
and then gonna go,
oh,

1010
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,571
I can't see anymore.
I guess that's the part where you see 

1011
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:04,571
out of it.
Oh,

1012
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,660
we drill the hole here on Sundays.
Calm.

1013
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,240
Well,
I guess this is the part that makes them

1014
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:09,590
aggressive.
We'll just drill a hole in that,

1015
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:10,210
but that's the law.

1016
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,750
Bottomy.
That's what they did.

1017
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,040
When people get a little nutty,
they go,

1018
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,340
what do you wanna do you to kill him?
We want to drill a fucking hole in his 

1019
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,440
head and see if we can fix something.
One flew over the cuckoo's nest.

1020
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,350
Yeah.
They would fix people by drilling holes 

1021
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:25,350
in their head.
Hollaback back.

1022
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,790
Do you know you ever.
There's a whole group of humans that 

1023
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,431
voluntarily put holes in their head and 
they believe that it alleviates pressure

1024
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:39,461
and gives them euphoria and that the 
pressure of the growing brain trapped 

1025
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:40,940
inside the skull causes headaches and 
all sorts of problems,

1026
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,180
and in Africa there's fucking cultures 
that have done this where they 

1027
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,090
literally.
They caught the entire skull.

1028
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:49,490
I posted it on twitter,
see if he can find it.

1029
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:50,870
I mean,
I don't know what you would look under.

1030
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,000
There's A.
There's a term for it.

1031
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,240
There's a term for it for holes in where
they call shit.

1032
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:03,980
I'm fucking up here because there's an 
actual term for it,

1033
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,430
but people do it on purpose.
It's like it's a.

1034
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,930
it's a.
see if you can find that,

1035
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,080
but people will fall interi holes and 
panning.

1036
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,950
Panning.
T R e p a n I n g itself,

1037
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:20,030
near.
You'd sleep pressure beneath the 

1038
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,030
surface.
Yeah,

1039
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,501
and there's,
there's a video of these African dudes 

1040
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,230
where they do it with no anesthesia and 
they do it with these fucking stone 

1041
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:31,510
tools.
They like strip away your fucking 

1042
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,440
scalped and cut out your bone.
Oh,

1043
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:37,450
they don't just do it once.
They do it as many as 20 times they 

1044
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:37,450
ended.
Yeah,

1045
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,080
and they fucked their brains up.
Dudes are not only that though,

1046
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,160
you'd have to wear it.
They have to wear hats from that I'm 

1047
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,160
sure.
Because their brain is exposed.

1048
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,390
There's a like a canoe shape cutout on 
the top of their fucking skull.

1049
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,080
Dr John Clark with the first one to do 
it in 16,

1050
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:55,210
64 and he taught the Africans tend to do
it and that's what they're saying to us.

1051
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,260
I'm sorry,
us us American.

1052
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,150
Hmm.
Well he might've.

1053
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:02,030
It might've been just like religion.
We brought Christianity over to Africa.

1054
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,810
It just says first fits physician to 
perform it in the US.

1055
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,900
And he did it as a alleviating pressure 
on someone.

1056
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,710
Whoa.
It's like,

1057
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,880
if you can think about it,
someone's out there doing it,

1058
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:17,410
man.
You've seen those women in Surrey.

1059
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,420
Is that.
Whereas in Africa where they cut their 

1060
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:22,760
lip and stick a plate in it.
Have you seen that shit?

1061
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,270
You know what I'm talking.
You never seen the plates and the lips.

1062
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:25,810
Yeah,
yeah,

1063
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,670
yeah.
I didn't know the theory to the named.

1064
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,590
It's the most insane thing.
It's not just weird.

1065
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:35,591
The bigger the plate,
the more cows they're worth when they 

1066
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,391
get married.
So like saying if you want to marry my 

1067
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:38,391
daughter,
okay.

1068
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:39,570
And she's got a giant ass fucking plate.
I'm like,

1069
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:41,220
bitch,
that was a 50 cal plate.

1070
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,450
You've got to come strong sign.
Right?

1071
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,470
So dudes would have to give her her.
They have to give up a herd because 

1072
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,010
she's willing to carry around this giant
plate in her lips.

1073
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,010
What else?
Issue in their teeth out to.

1074
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,160
They have to bang their lower teeth out 
because the plate sits there and you 

1075
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,550
can't get a full plate in there if you 
have the lower teeth.

1076
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,610
So when the plate starts getting big,
they have to smash their teeth out.

1077
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,340
You might blow jobs filled like probably
does Africa suck.

1078
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,910
People willing to do that?
You're willing to put plates in your 

1079
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,870
lips and cut holes in your heading where
they stretch the neck out.

1080
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,700
That's fucking crazy.
They must be so freaked out.

1081
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,080
They got stuck in Africa.
They're like,

1082
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,610
look,
we're going to make this interesting.

1083
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,730
Right?
But here we are stuck running from 

1084
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:25,730
hyenas and getting eaten by crocodiles 
and shit.

1085
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,650
We're going to have to stretch our next 
album,

1086
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,520
Mike,
our next real big.

1087
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,470
Well,
who knows why they do these things well,

1088
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:36,471
how about those heads of.
They found in Peru where they stretch 

1089
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:37,230
their head out gigantic,
like a big alien head.

1090
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,620
They did it to like a huge percentage of
the population.

1091
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:45,621
They put boards in their heads and tied 
them down and literally extended their 

1092
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:45,950
head.
You know,

1093
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,950
and people were thinking,
well,

1094
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:49,980
is this to emulate something,
is to emulate the gods.

1095
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:54,981
All the Annunaki people like,
see this is evidence they were doing 

1096
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:55,230
this to try to emulate,
maybe not.

1097
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,660
Because look at these Africans that 
cutting the fucking holes in their lives

1098
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:02,661
and stick and plates and they,
the dudes cutting the holes in their 

1099
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:02,661
heads and letting the air out,
you know,

1100
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:05,550
they're not emulating anything.
They're just practicing medicine.

1101
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,900
They're fucking nuts,
man.

1102
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:07,860
People are nuts.

1103
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,760
Well,
they're still kind of.

1104
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,590
Numbers are trolling everyone.
He knows freaky.

1105
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:13,170
The disease I had as a child I found out
in the mid eighties,

1106
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:17,100
they stopped treating aggressively that 
like more when I was in the seventies,

1107
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:22,101
I was more a victim of fucking 
chemotherapy and an elective surgeries 

1108
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:26,081
are not elective surgeries,
but surgeries that weren't needed and 

1109
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:27,600
radiation than I was of the actual 
disease because they were practicing.

1110
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,750
Well,
yeah,

1111
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,410
you know,
it's fucked up to is the accent.

1112
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,440
Histiocytosis x meant that the pathology
of the disease was unknown.

1113
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,300
And when I first asked an adult,
you know,

1114
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:37,870
where did my disease come from?
And they went,

1115
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,240
we don't know.
And I was like,

1116
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:40,110
wait,
who's we,

1117
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,820
you and me?
Or like,

1118
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
we like.
So what exactly is the disease history 

1119
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,840
of an overactive immune system isn't 
site.

1120
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,550
It's history.
Oh,

1121
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:52,980
site history of cytosis x and it's an 
overactive right,

1122
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:57,981
like I would have too many white blood 
cells and they would like in a sense 

1123
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:57,981
accumulate,
if you will.

1124
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,391
And uh,
usually it was in like bone marrow and 

1125
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:02,391
areas like that and it creates like blow
out.

1126
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:02,391
So like my,
my spine,

1127
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:04,240
it blew out my arm.
It blew out my hip.

1128
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:04,850
It blew out.

1129
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,600
Would it get better if you got sick?
What do you mean?

1130
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:08,530
Sick?
Got a cold?

1131
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,970
No,
no,

1132
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,490
no,
no,

1133
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,500
think no.
Don't sees it all the time.

1134
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,920
But it's funny as I don't really ever 
get sick either.

1135
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:22,760
I either have problems where like 
obviously it was overgrowing,

1136
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:28,030
you know,
in marrows and stuff or I'm always 

1137
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:28,030
healthy.
I went through prison five years.

1138
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:28,430
I didn't get a cold.
Whoa.

1139
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,310
Yeah.
And a crazy place.

1140
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,430
Let me tell you,
but start looking toilets.

1141
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,150
I don't like touching doors and shit 
though.

1142
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:38,590
I'm not a Germaphobe,
but I actually,

1143
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,540
I'm careful.
People are gross.

1144
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,020
Yeah.
People nose picking balls,

1145
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:48,090
scratching ass.
Fucking wipe and just disgusting 

1146
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,180
fucking.
Which is why I always recommend you use 

1147
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,240
the tissue from the bathroom when you 
opened the door to any public restroom.

1148
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:55,780
Take mine open like a man.
Not if you've got to pull it with a man,

1149
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,830
you have to twist it and pull it.
Usually you do actually use a piece of 

1150
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,180
that.
There's ways you can protect yourself.

1151
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,400
And if we had hemp,
we can be using hemp towel.

1152
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:08,590
Man,
you just have to clean it man.

1153
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,810
We'll get some hemp flashlights,
which is why we have to vote yes on 19 

1154
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,270
the vote yes on 19.
It's very important and if you're one of

1155
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,470
those people out there that goes,
man,

1156
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,820
you're fucking annoying.

1157
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,300
Unfortunately,
there's a lot of potheads are annoying.

1158
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,440
You know,
most potheads lot of straight people.

1159
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,860
Yeah.
Like most people,

1160
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,660
a good percentage of people are 
annoying.

1161
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:33,810
And the reason being is because we do 
not have a direction book on how to 

1162
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,470
properly live a healthy life and 
healthy,

1163
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:37,150
fun,
satisfying life.

1164
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:37,740
You know,
we,

1165
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:42,741
we,
we live our lives based on myths and 

1166
00:48:42,741 --> 00:48:44,971
Bullshit TV shows and movies and we have
this distorted perception of what this 

1167
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:46,760
fucking world is all about.
So most people with,

1168
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,550
especially with the situation that we 
have now,

1169
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,890
the way our world is set up,
it's so easy for a moron.

1170
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,920
Just drift through and be taken care of 
every step of the way and yet have 

1171
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,680
opinions and yet be able to vote.
George Bush Jr.

1172
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,050
Sarah pailin.
Man,

1173
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:00,730
that'S way scarier than her,
than him.

1174
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,020
Gary coleman.
He was a man.

1175
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,340
Wow,
that's right.

1176
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,630
I said it.
Gary coleman.

1177
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,090
Gary coleman.
We could vote.

1178
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,260
Yeah.
Angry as fuck.

1179
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,970
I'd been angry too after his whole life.
You know,

1180
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,100
the saddest Part of his life would not 
have been when he was in the hospital.

1181
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,800
Dead,
dying and is fucking crazy.

1182
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,160
Ex wife takes a picture and sells it to 
My over him,

1183
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,910
like all strapped up with pipes and shit
dying in bed and she's right next to him

1184
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,820
with his dead.
She did that yet.

1185
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,080
Dead fucking rubber face.
Just like didn't have any emotion in her

1186
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:33,670
eyes.
Nothing like up here he is,

1187
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,560
he's dead and this is me.
I'm next to the dead guy.

1188
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,030
that's horrible.
Oh,

1189
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,520
it's gross.
Reprise that shit on like pads.

1190
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,590
I'm pretty sure.
well,

1191
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,180
I've never seen that.
It did not know she did that.

1192
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,000
yeah,
that's pretty darn.

1193
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:45,730
I'm learning.
I'm learning.

1194
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,170
Well you got saved even.

1195
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,170
Huh?
Finger should usually I'd do.

1196
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,320
You know,
I can't thank you enough for coming out 

1197
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:55,320
and support prop.
Nineteen minutes dude.

1198
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,140
You know I enjoy the marijuana.
So of course I've got to support prop 

1199
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,701
19.
You know a lot of people that have been 

1200
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:02,701
really confused on what this really does
man.

1201
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:06,301
And you know that's been a big problem 
for us because I was talking about what 

1202
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:06,301
I'm saying.
Most people will.

1203
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:07,240
You look at pot ads,
you think they're annoying,

1204
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,470
right?
Really?

1205
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,990
I'm finding I'm annoying right now 
because I can't believe all these people

1206
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:15,991
I was working around that we thought I 
thought was working towards a common 

1207
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:17,530
goal and now working against it because 
a lot of people were against prop 19.

1208
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,950
That's what you're sayinG.
a lot of people are against prop 19.

1209
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,340
Not for the right reasons,
either financial reasons,

1210
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,620
financial reasons or inaccuracy,
how muCh most hippies are though.

1211
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,130
Every time

1212
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,130
I ever was hanging out with hippies,
they were trying to make money like 

1213
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,650
making profits and still now there's a 
lot of the ideas,

1214
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,340
a lot of non hippies that are just 
commercially motivated.

1215
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:42,341
THere's a bunch of people that have just
been in this industry in the last few 

1216
00:50:42,341 --> 00:50:44,150
years since sb four slash 20 passed and 
allowed for clubs.

1217
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,490
They're trying to make money and right 
now they think,

1218
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,520
oh no,
you're going to change this and we like 

1219
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:51,520
this,
so please don't change this,

1220
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,180
and that is really what we're up against
when it comes from the the enemy within,

1221
00:50:55,521 --> 00:51:00,521
if you will.
There's a lot of people that aren't 

1222
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:00,521
hippies.
They're opportunists.

1223
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:00,521
They are.
I knoW a bunch of people that are in the

1224
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:01,790
business idealism.
Oh yeah.

1225
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:05,150
The people that own like dispensary's,
they're doing a purely for profit.

1226
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,900
There's a lot of good ones.
Berkeley,

1227
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,350
harborside.

1228
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,790
They're all good.
There's a lot of good ones.

1229
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,220
ProvIde something that's good.
Marijuana is good,

1230
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,090
but there's a lot of people that you 
wouldn't expect.

1231
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:18,300
They're not like old dudes with gray 
hair and ponytails right there.

1232
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:23,301
They're younG dudes.
It looks like they're fucking doing 

1233
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:23,301
squats.
Prop 19 is gonna.

1234
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:24,770
Make it so these people aren't having to
get away with it.

1235
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,710
It's they're going to be able to serviCe
their neighbors who have a right to have

1236
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:32,711
pot and everybody in.
The state's going to have a right to 

1237
00:51:32,711 --> 00:51:32,711
grow pot and that's going to be a big,
big yeah,

1238
00:51:32,711 --> 00:51:37,511
so all these people that are selling it,
the shit's going to go under because no 

1239
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:37,511
one's going to need to buy it.
You can just grow your own.

1240
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,990
So easy to see the prices drop.
Well thankfully you know radically and 

1241
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:45,200
profits are going to drop and right now 
you know it's the liquor companies.

1242
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,200
It's the biG drug cartels.
These are the people that are more than 

1243
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,630
willing to play exaCtly what I'm paying 
right now.

1244
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:55,500
Just keep making it just as good.
I'll pay just as you know,

1245
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,220
there's always going to be thousand 
dollar bottles of wine,

1246
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:03,330
you know,
and there's going to be people that do 

1247
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:03,350
things with the high quality and grandma
could grow better than me for instance,

1248
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:07,220
and you'll want grandma's pot over mine.
I Want to look like cheetos.

1249
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:08,300
I wanted to see like,
let's see.

1250
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:12,460
Hi.
Of I just been throwing out my window is

1251
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:17,470
that it doesn't.
It doesn't really lend itself for 

1252
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,010
quality with quantity because when you 
have large amounts of it,

1253
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:24,130
you don't have in a sense is as good a 
quality control right now in smaller 

1254
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,021
batches.
Now let's talk about one thing for the 

1255
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:29,270
nonsmoking non marijuana smoking amongst
us.

1256
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,300
This is one of the things that reallY 
fascinated me the most when I first 

1257
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:34,640
found out about marijuana.

1258
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,260
When I first,
when I first,

1259
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,780
when I was a kid,
I thought marijuana was bad for you,

1260
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,280
made you stupid,
all these different things.

1261
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,460
But when I first stArted smoking weed,
the thing that fascinated me the most 

1262
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,941
was that there are two completely 
different strains that have very 

1263
00:52:48,941 --> 00:52:50,030
different effects.
Just different string.

1264
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:51,170
Okay.
Let me break this down.

1265
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:53,630
can I say this right now?
There's a lot of confusion in this.

1266
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,070
Before I went to prison,
a friend of mine,

1267
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:00,071
he wrote marijuana,
botany and he later wrote the book has 

1268
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:00,450
been revised.
HIs name's robert carnal clock.

1269
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,370
He's forgotten more about cannabis and 
I've had an opportunity to learn.

1270
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,440
And um,
while I was in prison,

1271
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:11,441
these scientists actually looked at the 
specimens of sativa and indica and 

1272
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,670
sativa and indica where questions.
So if I walked up to you at seeds,

1273
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:15,260
joe,
it would actually be.

1274
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,930
Does this make clothing and paper and 
all this stuff?

1275
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,360
Or is it like India?
Because there's,

1276
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:24,110
if you look up the word endeca,
endeca means of.

1277
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:25,570
Or like India.
Okay.

1278
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,680
So when you go to India,
all of the cannabis that's grown there 

1279
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,340
is endeca because it's in India.
But when you go there,

1280
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:37,341
you'll find tropical varieties down by 
goer and northern varieties up by the 

1281
00:53:37,341 --> 00:53:41,010
area that's now Pakistan and hindu kush.
That is the entire range of cannabis.

1282
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,500
And it's all indycar history.
Lesson is interesting,

1283
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:48,501
but either everyone today who wants pot,
there's two different effects in tacoma.

1284
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,330
Makes you sleepy and it makes you couch 
weed.

1285
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,550
It makes you what a lot of people think 
of as a stoner.

1286
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,760
Sativa is a totally different experience
and it makes you much more introspective

1287
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:02,370
and makes you start looking at fucking 
telescopes and space documentaries.

1288
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,920
So let me,
let me saY strain.

1289
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,270
What should we call it?
Well,

1290
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:08,970
it's an equatorial variety.
It's from near the equator because.

1291
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,310
Let me break this down.
There's two different effects though.

1292
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:16,311
Correct?
And this is what I want people not pot 

1293
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:17,550
smokers to understand this.
When you go into these deep historical,

1294
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,580
it's not but,
but definitely in the sixties and 

1295
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:22,770
seventies,
all the pot that was coming into America

1296
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:24,030
was acapulco,
gold,

1297
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:24,850
michu,
ican,

1298
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,490
molly wiley,
jamaican.

1299
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,460
All of these strange were the equator 
tropical.

1300
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,260
They made you hoppi,
horny,

1301
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:33,630
well organized,
wanting to do things like protests,

1302
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,640
and then the hippies went to 
Afghanistan.

1303
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:40,790
They found this short fat leaves plant 
that they thought was endeca and they 

1304
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,451
started mixing it with all these 
tropical varieties like maui wowie and 

1305
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:47,751
thai stick and stuff,
and they shortened the time it takes to 

1306
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,111
flower cannabis and they picked 
varieties that yielded the most amount 

1307
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:51,810
of pot because it isn't being

1308
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:57,130
the ones that were ecuadorian.
The ones that were growing on the 

1309
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,210
equator needed a longer cycle of sun

1310
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,470
because it's right,
because they're in a 12,

1311
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,990
12 and those are the ones

1312
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,510
that have the different psychoactive 
effect.

1313
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:07,850
The ones that come in contact more with 
the sun or the ones that make

1314
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:12,990
not so much more with the sun.
It's just the varieties that develop 

1315
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:15,781
near the equator where there was a 
longer cycle are more innocent psycho 

1316
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:18,250
and in a sense in America they have to 
be grown indoors.

1317
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,170
Yep.
And then what happened is the hippies in

1318
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:22,600
a sense,
started breeding this afghan with all of

1319
00:55:22,601 --> 00:55:27,601
their tropical varieties and through the
eighties we kind of developed this one 

1320
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:29,650
hit wonder pot that took away all that 
good energy and took away all that.

1321
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,320
And now for me,
I always smoke haze.

1322
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,500
I like super silver haze and then a five
by what people don't understand what 

1323
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:37,900
you're saying,
haze mean sativa in a sense.

1324
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,390
It Does in the sense our terminology of 
sativa,

1325
00:55:40,391 --> 00:55:42,980
but sativa really means most useful.
Okay.

1326
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:44,030
The way.
Okay,

1327
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:49,031
that's true.
But what's that's not how it's used in 

1328
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:50,300
dispensary's,
indycar and sativa is how it's used.

1329
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:55,150
Sativa is the heady more trippy space.
We'd and endeca is

1330
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,250
couch high energy.

1331
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:02,070
My whole point in the beginning was I 
did not know there was two different 

1332
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,861
types of pot.
I thought pat was pot and then all pod 

1333
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,320
had a similar effect.
Some pot maybe stronger than other pond,

1334
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,360
but it's basically all pot.
You're going to smoke pot,

1335
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,580
you leave get really high or what,
but it's not the same.

1336
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:14,610
It's not even remotely the same.
There are two different experiences and 

1337
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,571
almost everyone is used to India because
India [inaudible] the easiest shit to 

1338
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:19,150
grow and because the shit that you're 
getting,

1339
00:56:19,151 --> 00:56:22,630
if you're getting it from some dudes are
coming down from Canada,

1340
00:56:22,631 --> 00:56:22,910
growing

1341
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,740
brick weed that grows the fastest and us
the most.

1342
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:31,741
And now that we're getting through 
prohibition will see these varieties 

1343
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:34,650
that take longer and yield less,
but have a profoundly different effect 

1344
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,270
on our energy and our thinking.
And so how is it wrong?

1345
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,340
What I was saying,
well it's not sativa,

1346
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:42,010
everybody's calling it sativa,
but sativa really means hemp.

1347
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,750
It's indo european hemp derived.
Right?

1348
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,840
But we've decided we haven't named what,
what,

1349
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:47,710
what,
what everyone.

1350
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,600
Universally,
in the pot community,

1351
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:51,780
they're looking at two different things 
into and sativa.

1352
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:52,690
That's what they called it,
right?

1353
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:54,280
That's as universally in the poc 
community.

1354
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,190
They're all just annoys you.
Make with your mouth.

1355
00:56:56,191 --> 00:56:59,750
Had described something.
Absolutely different noise soon.

1356
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,470
We're not going to call it sativa and 
indica once we went.

1357
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:03,840
No,
no,

1358
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,140
no.
Right now we look,

1359
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:09,190
we call reality.
California's not that lead and coach.

1360
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,450
We'd,
what do we call it?

1361
00:57:10,451 --> 00:57:11,860
We'll call it names like,
you know,

1362
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,200
arrowhead or you know,
avi on or whatever.

1363
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:19,201
We're calling that water at the time.
We don't really go get me a bottle of 

1364
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:19,201
water when we're sitting in a five star 
restaurant.

1365
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:23,911
We say,
do you have and to do you have bottled 

1366
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:26,641
water?
What am I a fucking water kind of sore 

1367
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:26,641
and now I just want water.
Okay,

1368
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:28,360
now trip on this the same way right now.
You walk up to a week counter,

1369
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:32,140
it's almost like the same thing because 
you can't make distinguishes like you do

1370
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:35,170
liquor and when you walk up to a bar,
you know the difference between wine and

1371
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:37,840
whiskey and if somebody you ought to 
whiskey and they hand you wine,

1372
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,160
you're going to be like,
yo douche bag.

1373
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:42,040
This isn't what I asked for.
But when I go to the store I say,

1374
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,260
hey,
where's your sativas?

1375
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,410
Oh,
we got jack cleaner.

1376
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:46,630
We got train regard.
Give me some of that train wreck.

1377
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,120
I mean that's the way we do,
but technically all drug varieties are 

1378
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,120
endeca.
What?

1379
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:57,170
No,
there's two different types that when 

1380
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,891
you go to indicate when you go to India 
and you get into and it's going to suck 

1381
00:57:58,891 --> 00:58:00,610
my dick.
There's two different experiences.

1382
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,350
We're still good as data people don't 
know.

1383
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:04,720
Look,
practical knowledge is very important.

1384
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,620
What all he's saying is all nonsense.
There's two different experiences.

1385
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,920
There's the couch weed and there's the 
weed that makes you think about the 

1386
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,070
universe and want to be creative.
So that's sativa.

1387
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,920
That's what they call it.
The endeca shit is oji kush,

1388
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:23,310
you know,
I'm going to take a nap and eat cheetos 

1389
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:23,310
all day.

1390
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:27,600
Oh gee.
Grows very much like a sativa just so 

1391
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:27,600
you know.
It's long and leggy and grows tall and a

1392
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,480
small buds and the different.
It's a more version of the event.

1393
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,760
I know.
It's weird.

1394
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,140
My,
my hayes,

1395
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:39,770
my sativa you're calling it came back at
23 point seven thc and my oji cushion.

1396
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,950
Dukkha.
It came back at 20 point six.

1397
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,730
There was a three point one.
Differences.

1398
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,080
There are a bunch of different things 
canabinoids other than thc that make up 

1399
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,720
the high.
It's not just thc.

1400
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,600
Well actually I think that um,
there was a doctorate and by the way,

1401
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:54,460
we should point out that todd knows his 
shit.

1402
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:57,510
Where's your book?
Like,

1403
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,300
who is this?
God?

1404
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,000
Well,
there was a doctor.

1405
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,040
What does he know?
This is what he knows,

1406
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:08,041
bitch.
He's got a book how to grow medical 

1407
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:08,041
marijuana out of europe.
Oh,

1408
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:08,041
I'm right here.
No,

1409
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,340
I came back.
It's on a delay.

1410
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,490
This is a a book how to grow medical 
marijuana and it's not.

1411
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:14,830
It's not in print right now.
Right now to get it.

1412
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:17,470
You go to amazon.com
and maybe get a used copy.

1413
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,990
YEs,
probably do that right on my next book.

1414
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:24,991
Grow.
Medicine's going to come out and I'm 

1415
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:24,991
going to be talking about

1416
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:24,991
strain.
Specific growing.

1417
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:28,960
Yeah.
You could write a lot of books on 

1418
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:28,960
growing wheat.
It's very complex,

1419
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:28,960
isn't it?
It is,

1420
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,750
and there's a lot of differences when 
people try to say,

1421
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:31,190
oh,
generalized is how you grow pot.

1422
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:34,700
You can tell they've never grown pot 
because pot is very different to grow.

1423
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:36,470
I mean,
go ahead.

1424
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:41,530
I was going to say,
this is a question I need answered 

1425
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:43,511
because I do not understand it.
Now the there's a female plant and a 

1426
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:46,751
male plant and you need the female plant
is where the medicine comes from.

1427
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:48,350
Where we come from,
right?

1428
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,760
they're both right,
but.

1429
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:53,690
But they become one or the other,
like you have to get the males out.

1430
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,540
Explain what happens,
like how it pollinates sales or sex,

1431
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,820
much like men in in an irony,
you'll find fun.

1432
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:00,230
Normal with other plants.
By the way,

1433
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:05,090
some plants are either dioecious or have
both sexes on one plant.

1434
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:10,090
Cannabis actually can be both because it
doesn't matter night and sometimes fuse 

1435
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:10,090
on it.
So you get a mail,

1436
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,450
you got to get it out of there.
Right?

1437
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:16,430
Males actually create their pollen sac 
faster than the females actually develop

1438
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:17,750
their butts.
And in hemp,

1439
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:22,751
for instance,
the males pollinate and then die off 

1440
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:25,690
early.
And the roman catholic church 

1441
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:25,690
miscategorized the male and female 
plants,

1442
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,800
even though the female had the seeds and
even though the male blue,

1443
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:29,390
the pollen,
they didn't like that.

1444
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:31,990
The male died off early.
so they called the male,

1445
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:34,430
the female and the female to male.
Yeah,

1446
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,570
they were heavy.
They were heavy into their dogma.

1447
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,520
You know,
can't,

1448
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,570
can't,
can't,

1449
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,730
can't rattle their cage.
That's the way cannabis where,

1450
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:46,731
how do you tell?
So if you grow and see if she'd grown a 

1451
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:48,851
bunch of weed plants,
you have to keep an eye on them bitches 

1452
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:51,551
because if they all,
they're all males just like certain 

1453
01:00:51,551 --> 01:00:51,551
leaves,
like little tiny.

1454
01:00:51,551 --> 01:00:55,260
It's not all these.
What they do is they develop these 

1455
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,061
little,
they developed these little male pollen 

1456
01:00:58,061 --> 01:00:58,061
sacks,
if you will.

1457
01:00:58,061 --> 01:00:59,300
And what they do is they come off the 
flower different.

1458
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:02,570
They come off the plant and they kinda,
they hang like little ball sacs and they

1459
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:03,860
open up and then the,
then the,

1460
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,260
then the pollen.
This is a male flower open.

1461
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,770
The pollen is carried to the.
If you've ever seen the little red hairs

1462
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:13,020
on your pot,
those are the sex glands and they are to

1463
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:18,250
hire at all what the red.
The red hair doesn't get you higher at 

1464
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:18,830
all.
The red hair doesn't have crystals on,

1465
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,190
you know,
they just had these cool though.

1466
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:24,940
So you get some weed and you're like 
that red hair scott.

1467
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,480
Doesn't matter what you want.
Yeah.

1468
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:31,481
And it's funny because it's so pretty,
but when that male pollen hits those 

1469
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:34,961
pistols,
what it does is it causes that to 

1470
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:36,791
fertilize in the seed,
grows in that little pod and if she 

1471
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:40,031
doesn't get fertilized,
that pod just scoot swells and swells 

1472
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:40,031
and swells and the resin develops 
deeper.

1473
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:45,130
That's why we grow seedless cannabis 
because it's like tricking the female 

1474
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,160
into like really producing a lot of 
residents and a lot of,

1475
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:51,340
you know,
just she's waiting and waiting and 

1476
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:51,340
waiting to be fertilized.
It never comes.

1477
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,010
So it makes it more potent.
Well,

1478
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:57,330
you know,
potency I think is an interesting 

1479
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,531
conversation.
There was a doctor at the institute of 

1480
01:01:59,531 --> 01:02:00,740
medicine who got up one day and he said,
I gave my patients 10 milligrams thc and

1481
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:05,741
they had a known effect and then they 
gave him 10 milligrams thc in one 

1482
01:02:05,741 --> 01:02:06,050
milligram cbn and it doubled the 
effective dose.

1483
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,240
And I shot my hand up and I said,
hey,

1484
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,310
would that replicate in nature?
And he said,

1485
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,410
I think it would.
And when I put my hand down,

1486
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:17,411
my publisher said,
what did you two geeks just asking each 

1487
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:17,411
other?
And I said,

1488
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:20,771
basically he told me to breed hemp in 
with my drug varieties because cbn for 

1489
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:25,551
instances,
a chemical that's mostly found in hemp 

1490
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:26,420
and as we have bread away from the 
characteristics of these equity,

1491
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:28,440
loreal varieties that are more hemp,
like,

1492
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,740
uh,
we have actually bred more towards the 

1493
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,811
drug varieties and we've lowered the 
chemical of cbn down while raising the 

1494
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,070
up with less of an effective rate.

1495
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,160
So now we have thc levels over 20 
percent that wouldn't,

1496
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:46,340
that don't hit us as hard as I believe 
is if we had a little bit of cbn mixed 

1497
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:50,511
in with it.
How many different cannabinoids are 

1498
01:02:50,511 --> 01:02:50,640
there inside a marijuana plant?
Um,

1499
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:55,670
well,
there are over 400 chemicals created by 

1500
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:59,001
the cannabis plant.
And that's the definition of a 

1501
01:02:59,001 --> 01:02:59,001
cannabinoid.
And uh,

1502
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:02,571
the reality is,
is that 60 of them are known to be 

1503
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:02,571
therapeutic or your shit's vibrate.
It's okay.

1504
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,230
We'll ignore it.
It was coming through the microphone.

1505
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:04,600
And,
uh,

1506
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:08,880
and what's going to happen is that as 
science understands these elements of it

1507
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:11,970
more than they'll be able to better 
direct what the different chemicals.

1508
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,600
And alSo terpene,
because terpenes are these volatile oils

1509
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:20,601
that are on the bud and what happens is 
they're kind of steamed off when it's 

1510
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:24,681
dried.
So if anybody's ever picked up a 

1511
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:25,590
cannabis flower and it had good body and
you squished it and had studied moisture

1512
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:26,940
and you could smell it was real strong.

1513
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,510
Those turpines were intact anD even that
has a psychoactive effect.

1514
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:33,150
It's very much an a synergistic 
psychoactive effects.

1515
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:35,220
So it's good.
It's good.

1516
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:38,820
Overdrawing it bad job because likes to 
take his weed and put it on the heater.

1517
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:42,090
I put that shit on a year to make 
joints.

1518
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,790
I put that shit on the window sill.
Let it dry out.

1519
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,440
Yeah,
perfect.

1520
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,240
I put it.
Sometimes I put it on top of the tv,

1521
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,260
but the reality is is because a lot of 
what he's getting is people that are 

1522
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,220
hurrying to market and they sell pot 
that's not dry and not cured.

1523
01:03:56,370 --> 01:04:01,370
The best cannabis is actually not just 
dried but cured and then stored for 

1524
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,410
about three months and then see oil set 
up and they're the smoothest.

1525
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:09,710
Yes.
And then there's a window of when those 

1526
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:11,721
cannabinoids actually keep themselves,
which is between three months and nine 

1527
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:11,721
months.

1528
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:11,880
So after nine,
after nine months,

1529
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,260
you,
we'd starts to degrade,

1530
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,150
chemically decompose in a sense.
Yes.

1531
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,230
So old weeds,
whack,

1532
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,760
whatever.
What about if you cook different,

1533
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,430
how about different,
what have you cook with it?

1534
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,290
We feel really good old chocolate bar,
an old chocolate bar.

1535
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:27,291
How long does that last?
If you have an old we chocolate bar 

1536
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:29,660
older than nine months in the dairy 
product and it will be moldy and you 

1537
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,820
have other issues with dark chocolate,
they're ramped up.

1538
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,920
Well,
not the kind of pain is you have some of

1539
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,120
those,
those,

1540
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:42,120
uh,
old fucking nestle's quik bars have they

1541
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,540
made with wheat.
Uh,

1542
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,630
you know,
a lot of why I don't eat cannabis that's

1543
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:50,631
provided to me by people is because I 
don't know the conditions in which it's 

1544
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:50,631
made and they don't trust their,
you know,

1545
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:51,780
the way they handled it and stuff.

1546
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,710
And yet not Just measuring because you 
don't know how strong it's going to be.

1547
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:59,990
Interestingly enough,
you know in holland I'm like hash bond 

1548
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,090
bonds and brownies are considered a hard
drug.

1549
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,770
Totally verboten.
Yeah.

1550
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,810
You can be 16 and go into a dutch coffee
shop,

1551
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:05,670
buy hash on your way to high school and 
you cool.

1552
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,430
You can't buy brownie that you told me 
about first.

1553
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:11,130
You're the first person to tell me about
11 hydroxy.

1554
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,250
That eating we're eating.
We'd when you eat wheat,

1555
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:17,650
it goes through your liver and kidneys 
and it actually turns a chemical process

1556
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:18,280
and it turns

1557
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,280
the psychoactive chemical thc into 
another chemical called 11 hydroxy 

1558
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,061
metabolite and that 11 hydroxy is two to
five times more psychoactive than the 

1559
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:34,501
canvas.
Actually it's three to five times was 

1560
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,211
the estimate I saw out of the uNiversity
of Mississippi and you don't get a thcv.

1561
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,850
I mean a 11 hydroxy in your bloodstream 
when you smoke cannabis.

1562
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,880
It's so.
It's such a different experience and 

1563
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:44,880
you're definitely talking about it.
One night,

1564
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,520
I don't remember what the context of the
conversation was,

1565
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:50,521
but it was probably.
I ate something that was just too 

1566
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:50,521
fucking strong and you had to explain 
it.

1567
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:52,300
It's so many people have had it and 
they're like,

1568
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:54,130
it's a mama,
I'm on acid or something.

1569
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:57,910
It does not feel like pot and you're not
used to it because when you smoke pot,

1570
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,000
you're only used to dealing with thc in 
your bloodstream and that to you and not

1571
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:04,240
11 hydroxy front man,
nothing you should fear.

1572
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,550
We were on a,
we were at a plane the other day.

1573
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:11,551
We were flying to austin,
Texas and a rat ate a cookie in his car 

1574
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,310
on the way to the airport.
And then,

1575
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:13,340
uh,
he got there and you know,

1576
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,100
it takes an hour and 20 minutes or so to
kick in.

1577
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,600
He got there.
We were on the plane,

1578
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:21,630
on the tarmac and he was seriously 
thinking about telling them that they 

1579
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:22,000
had to let him off the plane because 
he's that high.

1580
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:26,170
Oh no.
Until we landed some model,

1581
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:29,340
did that.
The other day I saw dave chappelle did a

1582
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,370
to a dave chappelle.
Had a panic moment on the plane.

1583
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,980
I got to get off.
It might have been that,

1584
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:38,010
you know,
that's one of those things that you 

1585
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:38,010
wonder if you really want to go.
I'll go with it though.

1586
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:38,010
What if you get off the plane?

1587
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:39,100
The plane crashed as you book.
Thank you baby.

1588
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:40,300
Jesus.
I'm not religious.

1589
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,190
No.
It would be a moment.

1590
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:46,420
You know,
I guess parachutes high flux so it would

1591
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:51,421
save george bush's father,
his parachute and the first draft of the

1592
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:56,551
declaration of independence was drafted.
Him know motherfucker integral part of 

1593
01:06:56,551 --> 01:07:01,261
our history men.
And this is why I'm trying to convince 

1594
01:07:01,261 --> 01:07:01,640
people that you needed that had no other
options.

1595
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,140
Canvas was the only thing they had.
There was no cotton gin when she knitted

1596
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:06,850
the first american flag.
You know,

1597
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:11,851
we,
we only need look at our history's time 

1598
01:07:11,851 --> 01:07:14,381
table to realize what we were using 
before the invention of some of these 

1599
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:15,100
things.
This is all lost information,

1600
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:15,820
ladies,
gentlemen,

1601
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:17,770
and if you want to find out more about 
this,

1602
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:19,630
if you're really fascinated,
go pick up this book.

1603
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:22,510
The emperor wears no clothes.
It's a the one that,

1604
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:27,570
as we said,
was written bar late friend jack herer 

1605
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:27,570
harris.

1606
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:28,610
How you say right now?
I think terror.

1607
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:29,480
Yeah.
Hara.

1608
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,660
Like terry used to say,
you know,

1609
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,690
was we'd still available to,
you know?

1610
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:39,320
Yeah.
You can still buy a strain is a strain 

1611
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,320
named after him.
He is there a time.

1612
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,320
Mccormick strain out there.
Thank god.

1613
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,910
No,
no.

1614
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:40,900
Thank god.
No god,

1615
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:42,510
no.
There's a joe rogan out there.

1616
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,800
I don't know.
I don't know where it is.

1617
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,280
I was just going to say fuck it.
I'll give you permission to me,

1618
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:56,281
man.
This is an officially sanctioned joe 

1619
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:56,281
rogan's train will be treated.
Were created by todd mccormick.

1620
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,470
Do you want it or indicus tiva?
Fucking dope.

1621
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:02,470
We just a sprinkle of endeca.
Sprinkle some time.

1622
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,540
Makes you a little silly little 
sprinkle.

1623
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:09,660
I think that's a great idea.
I like to research and see what have 

1624
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:09,660
you.
Tried to put this together.

1625
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,080
Thank you everybody for tuning into the 
podcast.

1626
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:16,081
Once again,
thank you to the flashlight for a 

1627
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:16,081
sponsored.
I don't know why I hold this up.

1628
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:16,490
Can't just say it.
I can just say it,

1629
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:18,080
but I feel like it's right here.
I have to show you that.

1630
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:20,770
It's really does it light?
Is it like,

1631
01:08:20,771 --> 01:08:21,440
no,
there's no light.

1632
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:26,460
There's no fucking fuck it.
Nobody's fucking smell this rubber.

1633
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:27,900
Just shower.
Oh,

1634
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,570
that's fucking weird,
reverend man.

1635
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:31,760
You good man.
What's up with that?

1636
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,180
I'll tell you what's up better for 
masturbating.

1637
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:36,530
Do you masturbate at all?
Don't lie.

1638
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,280
Of course you do.
Right?

1639
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,560
But if you masturbate,
why wouldn't you want one of these?

1640
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:45,620
Because this is masturbation.
I could give you a long list of reasons.

1641
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,120
It just popped right off my head leaning
in.

1642
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,930
Dealing with.
This is how you deal with it,

1643
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:52,370
right?
You open up the top,

1644
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:53,930
right?
So you shoot your load in there and then

1645
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:58,931
you unscrew the bottom and then you 
release the dishwasher.

1646
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:05,810
That dish shuts your sign.
You're not getting that clean.

1647
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,820
The top of it.
You shoot it.

1648
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,470
Oh,
the load on your face.

1649
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:14,150
You do whatever you want to shoot on 
your face.

1650
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,610
I like to think brian plays out with a 
song.

1651
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:17,280
What's the song?
Brian?

1652
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:21,480
Walking on a dream by in.
Thank you everybody for tuning in.
