1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,760
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,660
What's up ma?
What's up buddy?

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,553
Good to see you,
man.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,070
It's good to see you.
I'm glad we decided to get together and

6
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:15,180
do this,
you know,

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,500
and talk and um,
you know,

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,760
it's all crazy subject,
right?

9
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:25,761
I mean you and I have known each other
for since 2012 when I did meet eater.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,920
You were there filming when I shot my
first deer,

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,110
which is very important part of my life
man.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,860
And then you went on to direct and
produce parts unknown with our late

13
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:42,171
friend Anthony Bourdain and we started
probably be a good thing to come in here

14
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,950
and just talk.
Talk about them.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,070
Yeah man.
And uh,

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,230
and I'm really grateful for it,
you know,

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,340
it's actually,
you know,

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,580
a lot of people
have been saying to me like,

19
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,020
oh,
it must be really hard to talk about

20
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:54,711
that.
It must really,

21
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,510
it's.
I actually find it kind of the opposite.

22
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,070
Like I want to talk about him.
I want to talk about who he was and what

23
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,630
that experience was,
you know.

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,280
So,
um,

25
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,310
thanks ma'am.

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,990
My pleasure brother.
Did you,

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,780
did you know him before you guys started
working together?

28
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,270
No,
no.

29
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,200
I met Tony a 10 years ago and I was
called in.

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,420
He had a DP on a show who at the last
minute canceled,

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,520
couldn't go to Egypt.
So,

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,470
uh,
I got a call like a week before,

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,360
you know,
it's like,

34
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,100
do you want to go to Egypt with Anthony
Bourdain was like,

35
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,460
you're fucking absolutely.
Um,

36
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,470
and uh,
and so I met him in Cairo,

37
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,840
man,
like kind of like perfect.

38
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:36,660
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

39
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,080
That's like Indiana Jones.
Exactly.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,890
Man episode when you guys ate a camel.
No,

41
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,260
no,
we didn't need a camel.

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,290
No,
but,

43
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,450
um,
you know,

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,370
uh,
I met him there,

45
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,290
you know,
we start filming,

46
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,170
we're on the streets of Cairo and like,
you know,

47
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,940
like all of a sudden is thrown into
these kitchens.

48
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,620
We were eating pigeon,
you know,

49
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,020
it's like go in,
cover them cooking pigeon.

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,350
And I'd seen the show like maybe once
before,

51
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:07,160
but I knew who he was and I knew what
that adventure was,

52
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,100
you know,
and I was so amped for it.

53
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,580
Um,
and then there was this seminal moment

54
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:18,581
on that show where we go out and we'd go
ripping across the desert with the

55
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:23,330
Bedouin and go out and cook a goat,
a in the ground,

56
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,770
you know.
Um,

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,980
and so as we're driving out over the
desert,

58
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,521
we're like,
well,

59
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,530
we need to,
we need some shots from car to car.

60
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:31,041
Right.
And I was like,

61
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:31,910
Oh,
get on the roof,

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,350
you know,
and uh,

63
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:36,290
and there's like this for,
for some reason there's a four post bed

64
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,640
tied to the roof of this land rover.
And so I get up there and kind of like,

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
you know,
latch my arm around it and these guys

66
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,920
take off at I,
I swear,

67
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,100
80 miles an hour across the desert and
you're on a bed.

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,320
Absolutely,
absolutely no regard for the fact that

69
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:56,150
like,
I'm on the roof,

70
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,400
you know,
I'm shooting.

71
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,900
And,
and when we got there we got to camp.

72
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,500
I survived it.
I'm at this big black and blue where I

73
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:10,490
was holding onto the four post bed and I
go over and I show Tony and um,

74
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,630
that was it man.
From that moment on,

75
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,080
he was like,
I liked this guy and I started going out

76
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:17,861
with him,
you know,

77
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,080
I started getting invited to do more
shows.

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,080
So that was good.
How many years?

79
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,060
Ten years.
Wow.

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
Ten years.
Yeah.

81
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,460
That's crazy.
I didn't realize that parts unknown was

82
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,091
even an oil.
Well,

83
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:31,260
you doing no reservations.

84
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,650
Yeah.
So that was a no reservation show and

85
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,200
then we went to parts unknown five years
ago.

86
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,930
Wow.
Yeah.

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,930
So parts of one has been on for five
years

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,790
and that uh,
you know,

89
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,850
that transition.
No,

90
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,910
no reservation was great and it really
laid the foundation for what we do and

91
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,370
what Tony did.
I think it really built an audience and

92
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:55,670
a following for him and that's where I
found out about it.

93
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,331
Right,
exactly.

94
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:58,100
It was a great show,
you know?

95
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,930
Um,
but that,

96
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,210
like that transition going on to CNN,
going into parts unknown,

97
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,080
that really,
that really changed things have really

98
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:11,030
opened up a lot of locations and stuff
that we didn't have access to before.

99
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,470
It opened up,
you know,

100
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:17,471
kind of CNNS logistics,
a Rolodex and you know,

101
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,380
things that we didn't have at the other
network,

102
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,700
you know.
And uh,

103
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,170
and so that's,
you know,

104
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,530
no reservations was awesome.
We did some incredible shows.

105
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,780
Parts unknown is where it got really
fun.

106
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,690
Yeah.
That was on another level.

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,110
I remember watching the chains.
I'm like,

108
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,260
okay,
this is more more him,

109
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,690
you know,
to everything from the opening music to

110
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,430
the tone of it and the narration.

111
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,130
Yeah,
for sure.

112
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,600
And then in,
you know,

113
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,720
you've got to hand it to CNN to is like
all of a sudden we had these creative

114
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:49,410
partners who were like willing to let
him be him,

115
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,680
you know,
like willing to let him do a show like

116
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:53,910
the Tokyo show.
We're like,

117
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,890
you know,
really climbing into Japanese subculture

118
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,990
is rope bondage,
tentacle porn,

119
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,020
you know,
all this stuff that most network

120
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:07,260
executives,
they're probably a little bit leery of.

121
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,060
CNN was Kinda like,
you know,

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,350
go for it man.
Be Yourself,

123
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,270
you know,
and let's figure out what this is

124
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,060
together.
You know,

125
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,820
that's amazing.
That really is amazing.

126
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,600
And with one of the things that really
made that show was Tony's narration

127
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,710
because the narration gave you a sense
of the way his,

128
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:28,330
his sort of passionate enthusiasm for
the world and for various aspects of

129
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:32,740
cooking and travel and food and culture.
Like you got it through his own words,

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,490
you know?

131
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,420
Yeah.
I think that's,

132
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,380
I mean maybe in some ways the most
important aspect of the show.

133
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,630
Uh,
you know,

134
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,130
I mean he is after all a writer,
right?

135
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:43,840
Yeah.
You know,

136
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,350
and I'm in that is how he experienced
the world.

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,710
Um,
but actually making the shows and the

138
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,200
technical part of actually making the
shows,

139
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:56,620
you know,
we'd once you go through and kind of

140
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:01,190
edit the and you know,
none of that voiceover was in at the

141
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:05,090
rough cut phase and then you send it out
to him and get his writing back and

142
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,330
record that.
Vo and I keep describing it is like that

143
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:13,331
kind of Dr. Frankenstein lightening bolt
to the temples kind of moment where like

144
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,480
the monster rises,
it would really bring the show to life.

145
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,650
So this kinda carcass that was laid out
in rough cut form on the table,

146
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,500
all of a sudden just gasped and jumped
up and,

147
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,520
you know,
it was really beautiful to see that and

148
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,080
to have,
you know,

149
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,490
as a director,
as a producer,

150
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,990
as a creative,
you know,

151
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,520
at any level,
you know,

152
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:39,521
to have that kind of power to have his
voice and his writing and his

153
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,390
introspection and thoughts and you know,
um,

154
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,660
that would have like powerful,
powerful force to work with.

155
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,730
Well,
it was a brilliant design.

156
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,390
The way the show is put together,
that narration really did make it

157
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:57,410
something special and different from all
those other kinds of shows because it

158
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,640
just his articulate and insightful and
poetic and artistic view of these things

159
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,610
that he had this infectious passion for
things.

160
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,070
He completely changed the way I thought
about cooking.

161
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,990
I had always thought about cooking as,
oh,

162
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:14,420
this guy knows how to make delicious
food.

163
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,040
Oh,
this place has good ribs is.

164
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,150
And then when I saw his show,
when I saw parts unknown,

165
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:20,810
I went,
oh,

166
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,660
it's an art form.
It's just an art form that you eat.

167
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,990
Absolutely contemporary art form.

168
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,550
Yeah,
and even beyond that,

169
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:33,960
it's an art form that's in that taking
and incorporating all of these greater

170
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:36,870
kind of macro social elements of,
you know,

171
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,660
where you are,
the history of where you are,

172
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,480
you know,
what people did for a living,

173
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,700
what people's ancestors did for a
living,

174
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,870
you know,
it.

175
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,960
Um,
it's rooted in so much more than what I

176
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:49,860
think,
you know,

177
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,290
you know,
ultimately it feels like we kind of joke

178
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,670
around a lot and say like,
yeah,

179
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:55,350
it's the food shows,
not a food show,

180
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,900
you know,
but the reason that worked I think is

181
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,120
because of what you're saying and you
know,

182
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,450
the food food is an art form that
incorporates all of these other aspects.

183
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:11,571
And so it can be a jumping point off for
exploration into anything you want to

184
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,250
talk about.
I'm to talk to about the history of a

185
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:15,960
place,
the politics of a place,

186
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:17,130
you know,
uh,

187
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,720
the religion of a place,
you know,

188
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,510
all of these things that inform who
people are.

189
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:25,500
Well that's all written into the cuisine
of a place or an area.

190
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,580
Yeah.
And,

191
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,580
and he was into stuff that wasn't
necessarily even like high,

192
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,110
you know,
high dollar items.

193
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,600
He was into like street food.
Definitely.

194
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,330
Yeah.
It wasn't just the finest French know

195
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,530
trolls where these celebrated world
famous chefs were cooking these bizarre

196
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,960
small plate sort of masterpieces.
No,

197
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,610
he would love street tacos.

198
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,850
Yeah,
absolutely.

199
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,410
I mean,
again,

200
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:58,830
I think that kind of like a whole new
fresh take on looking at food,

201
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,020
you know,
it's like,

202
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,680
it's easy to,
you know,

203
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:07,130
to look at these kind of high end French
preparations is highly talented,

204
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,470
highly trained French chefs.
Um,

205
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,080
and there's,
there's tremendous beauty in that and

206
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,640
all of those other things we've talked
about.

207
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:19,550
But to look at the woman on the corner,
you know,

208
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:20,700
the making,
uh,

209
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,050
you know,
the best,

210
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,400
you know,
Lingua Tacos,

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,890
that was revolutionary.
And then the realization that all of

212
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,720
that,
all of that greatness,

213
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,750
all of that nuance,
all of that flavor,

214
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,400
you know,
um,

215
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,690
contained right within there,
that was an access point to it as well.

216
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,050
It's just an access point that everyone
can afford that everyone can go and,

217
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,000
and uh,
you know,

218
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,100
I mean,
right place at the right time.

219
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:50,940
I think that people like,
it seems like the culture at large was

220
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,130
ready for that,
ready for that,

221
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,420
like experience in food and ready to
kind of chase that because now that's,

222
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,190
that's all anyone wants now.

223
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,510
Well,
I think it's because of him.

224
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:03,960
I really do.
I really do because I'm sure that he

225
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:07,530
changed the way I look at things for
terms of food and I think he had that

226
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,531
effect on many people may think about
how many years was known for five and

227
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,410
then no reservations for nine new
reservations.

228
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,670
Yeah,
for about 10.

229
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,770
And then there was a cook's tour before
that,

230
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,060
so original all told a decade and a half
of his influence on people's food

231
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:30,240
choices and just appreciation for food.
I mean,

232
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:32,490
I know personally I've had some great
meals in restaurants,

233
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:35,850
but some of my favorite meals had been
like stepping outside of a bar,

234
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,260
you know,
it's 1:30,

235
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,100
you got a little buzz on and some dudes
got a Taco truck and like,

236
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,040
oh baby,
what do you got over there?

237
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,070
And my friend or in New York,
you know,

238
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,140
it's late at night and there's a falafel
cart.

239
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,890
And some guys got a incredible kabobs.
Like,

240
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,350
oh,
something about street food man.

241
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,750
Absolutely man.
And yeah,

242
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:57,800
I kinda keep like a,
like a loose running list of my favorite

243
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,910
meals,
you know,

244
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,550
and um,
and some of them are on the show and

245
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:06,551
some of them are not on the show.
And I'd say most of them are that,

246
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,080
you know,
most of them are accidentally stumbling

247
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:13,370
into someplace where someone's doing
something completely awesome that isn't,

248
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,540
you know,
some massive 26 course tasting menu.

249
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,440
Um,
and I think it's also about,

250
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,030
you know,
it's about place,

251
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,010
you know,
it's about where you are,

252
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:27,530
the context of where you're getting,
what it smells like,

253
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:29,810
what it sounds like,
what it looks like,

254
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,350
you know.
Um,

255
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,160
who you're with,
you know,

256
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,360
and uh,
and so,

257
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,620
you know,
that's Kinda,

258
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,610
I think another reason to show kind of
worked is we had an opportunity to

259
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:44,720
architect or articulate all of those,
all of those elements,

260
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:47,750
you know,
are able to choose an incredibly

261
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:52,310
interesting guests to sit down with it,
a really interesting restaurant with,

262
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,000
you know,
cooking over

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,460
a really interesting backstory in a
beautiful place and uh,

264
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,570
and then use the power of kind of the
magic of TV to,

265
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,230
you know,
to Polish it up and present this version

266
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,320
of travel and food in the world that,
you know,

267
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,160
really everywhere too.
I mean,

268
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,710
you guys covered Asia,
you covered Europe,

269
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:16,520
you covered some weird places in the
south where people are cooking pigs in

270
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:18,350
their backyard.
I mean,

271
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:19,230
it was just,
it,

272
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,350
it gave people an understanding of the
preparation of food and a view to chefs

273
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,970
and this view of chefs as artists.
I mean these chefs look like tattoo

274
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,260
artists.
They look like,

275
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:31,940
you know,
guys who are painters or something,

276
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:34,160
or women who are sculptors.
I mean,

277
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,950
they're,
they're real similar in the way they,

278
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,160
they appear to what we consider artists.

279
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,460
Yeah,
absolutely.

280
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,840
And I,
and I think too,

281
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:43,850
I mean,
I,

282
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,060
you know,
what I kind of love about like,

283
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,120
you know,
at this point,

284
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:51,570
spent a good amount of time in kitchens
and good around Mount of time around

285
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,810
kitchen staff is there's kind of two
elements coming together.

286
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,670
There's,
there's the,

287
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,320
the artistic element that you're talking
about,

288
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,320
right?
But there's also this very,

289
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:04,380
you know,
very earnest working class kind of

290
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,140
element to the way a kitchen works,
you know,

291
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,700
it was tough,
hard,

292
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:11,070
sweaty work,
you know,

293
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,620
it's a rough environment,
you know,

294
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,340
and I,
and I think that's kind of part of what

295
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:21,150
makes it so appealing to us.
He kind of pulled back the curtain on,

296
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,830
on that,
you know,

297
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,650
let's say like these guys are,
you know,

298
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,100
these guys are not these inaccessible
icons though.

299
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,960
Paul bocuse of the world,
you know,

300
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:34,290
they are um,
as much as Paul bocuse is awesome,

301
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,500
you know,
they are these kind of rough and tumble,

302
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,250
you know,
guys that are back there making

303
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:42,450
something really awesome.

304
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,280
Tony also had this sort of punk rock
sensibility to it all to you know,

305
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,080
mean that was part of the thing about
him that people found appealing is that

306
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,770
they had seen cooking shows before,
but they never saw cooking shows where

307
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,060
the host gets fucked up.

308
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,190
No,
dude,

309
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,160
I was first time I partnered with him,
I'm like,

310
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:04,280
this guy goes so hard.
I was amazing.

311
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,380
Told me about it.
It was amazing.

312
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,240
I was like,
I can't believe he can do this all the

313
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:10,280
time.
Like I think one of them

314
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,030
first times we ever got hung out
together was in Montreal.

315
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,910
We were there for UFC fights and we went
out afterwards and got.

316
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,560
We had some steaks and it was just
amazing walking into this restaurant and

317
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,080
people freaking out.
One guy actually had a copy of kitchen

318
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,950
confidential in the actual kitchen
itself and had tony sign it.

319
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,660
It was pretty fun.
A fucking

320
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,900
bad ass.
Where'd you go?

321
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,190
You do not remember Joe Beef?
No,

322
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:35,710
it wasn't,
but he turned me on a job and eaten

323
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,850
there several times since then.
Those guys are coming on the podcast to

324
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,470
fred and Dave now.
They're fucking amazing.

325
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,170
That restaurant is one of my favorite
restaurants on the planet.

326
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,200
No doubt they'll hurt you.
They keep it coming for sure.

327
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,040
Give you an inch thick slab

328
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,830
of flog raw.
Yes.

329
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,800
Well

330
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,280
show.
One of the ones that I really loved was

331
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:03,281
the one where they did ice fishing there
were on the water and they had this ice

332
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,870
fishing shack,
but inside the ice fishing shack they

333
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,730
had find silverware and find China and
they had bottles of really excellent

334
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:14,180
wine and they were cooking on a wood
stove.

335
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,040
They had a wood stove and they were
cooking fog while right,

336
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:22,041
right there on the stove and then they
were laying out what they think makes

337
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:25,580
you a good dinner companion.
And David's like,

338
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:28,250
I shut my phone off.
I turned it off.

339
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,130
I put it away and he goes,
I don't check it,

340
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,791
don't.
He goes,

341
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,090
I don't put my elbows on the table,
you know?

342
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,110
And he's like,
can I come prepared with stories?

343
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,170
And Tony was like,
you prepare your stories.

344
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,300
I have stories to tell.
I come prepared like to him it's like

345
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,470
not really a performance,
but it's an agreement that you're going

346
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,130
to,
you're going to go there and you're

347
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:52,760
going to share this enthusiasm for this
experience together and you're going to

348
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:57,200
try to enhance it with your own
anecdotes and personality and your own

349
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,980
appreciation for the food and the wine
and then afterwards they're smoking

350
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,000
Cuban cigars.

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,650
It was like the whole things it made you
want to go eat at a really good place.

352
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,360
Yeah.
Or in a,

353
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,170
in a,
in a shack on a frozen lake with,

354
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,370
with people who understand that there's
an elegance to all of these things,

355
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:20,180
you know,
that you can create an environment that,

356
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,680
that has an elegance.
And that's,

357
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,380
you know,
I'd say that's like a hallmark of a lot

358
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,790
of the chefs that I've met through the
show is like,

359
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,080
you will see that no matter how big they
get,

360
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,110
no matter how successful there is an
inherent kind of desire to please on

361
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
multiple levels.
You know,

362
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,820
you'll have,
like I remember we were in a Daniel

363
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,940
Boulud's house in France or did his
parents house.

364
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:44,860
Right?
And so he,

365
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,720
Daniel Ballou like the mega chef,
you know,

366
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,810
um,
but like running around to all of the

367
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,850
crew members,
like you have something to eat,

368
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,470
are you good?
Do you want another glass of wine?

369
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,580
Do you want to look,
you know,

370
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,510
and it just inherited his nature is
exactly what you're talking about.

371
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,610
This idea that,
you know,

372
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,970
they have this just
ongoing desire to please their guests,

373
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,640
to entertain,
to,

374
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,980
you know,
make sure that everyone's taken care of

375
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,810
the curators,
have an experience.

376
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,040
Absolutely.
Yeah.

377
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,323
Yeah.
You know.

378
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,490
And so to be able to,
you know,

379
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,680
run around the world for 10 years and
explore.

380
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,190
That was nice man.
Man.

381
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,490
I can only imagine.
I can only imagine.

382
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:29,030
How many shows did you guys film
together?

383
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,890
I don't,
you know,

384
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,530
I dunno.
Fifty seven or 60,

385
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,530
something like that.
Somewhere in La.

386
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,423
Yeah.
Wow.

387
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,870
So I mean listen,
there are people,

388
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,180
you know,
at 10 years on the show,

389
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,730
I was on the show for a long time.
There's people lot longer.

390
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,380
There's people that did the whole 17
years.

391
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,150
People have done well over $100,
you know,

392
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,040
no one left that

393
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,630
show.
You don't leave that show if you get a

394
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:54,950
spot on it.
Were you with him when,

395
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,790
when it ended?
No.

396
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,110
Uh,
no.

397
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,410
I was with him,
um,

398
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,530
about a week and a half before.
Uh,

399
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,090
so now I had good friends that were
there.

400
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,450
I was in Chicago and uh,
I've woke up and checked my phone and I

401
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:16,940
got a text from my friend Maynard
Maynard Keenan

402
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:24,010
from tool and um,
maynard is a Jujitsu brown belt and

403
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,920
really loves Jujitsu.
Any,

404
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,754
any,
um,

405
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,070
texted me.
He said so much for the uh,

406
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,410
maynard versus Anthony Bordain celebrity
Jujitsu match

407
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,530
and that's the whole text
and um,

408
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,660
you know,
just sunk,

409
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,610
sunk a pit in my stomach and I just
picked up my phone.

410
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,650
I went into Google and I looked it up
and I saw it.

411
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm just like,
oh fuck.

412
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,180
I just couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it.

413
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,883
No.

414
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,490
Started crying
I think.

415
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,810
I think I called my wife.
They're called maynard.

416
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,090
I texted him,
I called my wife,

417
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,280
called a few friends,

418
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,080
you know,
just like,

419
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,400
you know,
just couldn't believe,

420
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,920
you know,
when someone's just not there anymore.

421
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,920
I didn't get to see him a lot,
but I was just,

422
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,560
uh,
just appreciated the fuck out of that

423
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:34,760
dude,
you know,

424
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,850
like,
I don't want to do anybody's TV show,

425
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,130
but when I got a call from him I was
like,

426
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,160
fuck yeah,
what are we going to do?

427
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:45,590
We're gonna shoot pheasants and,
and hunt and camp and we're going to

428
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:47,600
cook by the campfire.
Fuck them in,

429
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,220
dude,
you know,

430
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,210
I'm in.
I just really appreciated him as a

431
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,800
genuine,
unique person.

432
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,290
Like is it genuine,
rare person?

433
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,490
And uh,
you know,

434
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,950
that's,
that's what I got out of being.

435
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,890
Being able to spend some time with him
and being able to talk to him and pick

436
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,740
his brain.
And he did my podcast once and we always

437
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:15,680
planned on doing it again,
which we never got around to it because

438
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,670
we're both have ridiculous schedules.
But just my,

439
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,880
I would think about things differently
because of him.

440
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,410
Like my eye.
I would sometimes hold things to his

441
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:32,411
standards and he me like legitimately is
appreciation for things and his

442
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,710
enthusiasm for things changed the way I
look at a lot,

443
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,000
a lot of aspects of food and culture
and,

444
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,240
and,
and even travel,

445
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
you know.
Yeah.

446
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,220
I mean I'm,

447
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,720
I'm sorry ma'am.
I and I,

448
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,160
and I know he thought very highly of you
and that was that experience in Montana

449
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:55,220
was fantastic,
man.

450
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,000
So fun.
Um,

451
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,390
okay.

452
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,090
You know,
it's been,

453
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,410
it's been a rough three months and it's
still hard for me to really

454
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,620
contextualize it and put it together.
It feels like,

455
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,090
you know,
upside down world,

456
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,030
like there's no.
And he was such a,

457
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,290
I mean it was a friend and a
collaborator,

458
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,830
you know,
but also just such an icon to me,

459
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,450
you know.
Um,

460
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,080
and uh,
did,

461
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,460
it's almost like,
you know,

462
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:29,460
it's almost like the sun disappears,
you know,

463
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,120
or something.
It's something that is so just

464
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,150
inherently part of life they're in and
dependable and you know.

465
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,480
Um,
so yeah,

466
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,200
I mean that's been all right.
It's hard to describe how,

467
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,920
how profound that span.

468
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,890
I remember when he got into Jujitsu,
I got psyched because I'm like,

469
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,300
we got more to talk about now I can
actually,

470
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,980
I can actually show them shit,
you know,

471
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,920
he was always asking about things,
you know,

472
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:03,230
he's really good at things.
Remember when we were in Montana,

473
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:06,020
we were rolling around on the dirt
shoulder stuff.

474
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:07,310
Him and Josh was like,
like,

475
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:09,290
when you're in here,
like here's what you can do,

476
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,190
you can get.
And he's like,

477
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,570
oh yeah.
He's like,

478
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,150
he was so a wide eyed,
you know,

479
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,650
I think it was before he even got his
blue belt or maybe it was like around

480
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,490
blue belt.
So he was super,

481
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,830
super jacked about it and he was doing
it every day.

482
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,020
I remember when we were,
we were filming,

483
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,990
we were outside of billings.
Is that where we were?

484
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:27,830
Where were we?
Yeah,

485
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:30,050
well we're,
the hunt was the hunt.

486
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:30,750
We were in like

487
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,930
go up in central Montana,
you know.

488
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,140
So,
um,

489
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,020
we kind of started in billings,
but we headed up towards central

490
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:37,580
Montana.

491
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,580
He was training so often and even on the
road that he traveled to a club,

492
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:44,810
there was just a Jujitsu club and
Bozeman.

493
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,350
Yeah,
and he found some guys and he was

494
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:48,830
rolling with these guys in Bozeman.
Definitely like,

495
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:50,180
damn,
you're doing it every day because that

496
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,450
was a day for a long time on the show.
That was a mandate and we find the

497
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:54,440
local,
you know,

498
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,000
the local clubs and make sure that he
had a place or role texted me from some

499
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:02,850
European bloc country.
Said he was shitting bone bone chips as

500
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,820
a.
He worked out with some old school

501
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:08,150
Carlson Gracie guys.
They don't believe in rolling light.

502
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:12,140
It's all top game and smashing you
shitting bone chips,

503
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,740
but I just,
I admired that a guy could be 58 years

504
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:19,820
old and decide I'm going to learn
Jujitsu and I'm going to be obsessed

505
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:22,160
with it.
And then he became addicted to it.

506
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,240
Which,
you know,

507
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:25,880
Jujitsu is a very beneficial thing to be
addicted to,

508
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:28,070
but it is absolutely an addiction.
I've,

509
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,610
I've come back from injuries were.
I definitely shouldn't have been

510
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:35,000
training yet and I just wrapped my arm
up and just fucking get in there.

511
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,210
People get super,
super addicted to it and he got addicted

512
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,770
to it.
Just like he's been addicted to many

513
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:40,580
things.
He,

514
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,610
he jumped right into the Jujitsu,
Jujitsu experience.

515
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,583
Yeah,
man,

516
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,483
I'm,

517
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,410
I'm glad he did.
It wasn't me.

518
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,150
Anyway,
it was clearly like really good for him

519
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,021
to us.
I mean,

520
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:55,490
I know very little about Jujitsu.
I know what I know from Tony,

521
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,210
you know,
slim.

522
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,880
Yeah.
He lost all that weight.

523
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,740
All of a sudden you had to stop spacs up
smoking,

524
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,540
you know,
those were,

525
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,770
those were big things,
man.

526
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,300
And uh,
and he looked great and he,

527
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,400
you know,
he got off statens.

528
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,570
You're no longer on any sort of
medication.

529
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,140
He lost all that weight to cut all the
carbs out.

530
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,970
It was just eating like crazy man.
He looked so good.

531
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,510
He did look good.
Um,

532
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,590
he did look good and also just,
I,

533
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,160
you know,
the whole thing was kind of indicative

534
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:27,450
of the way he.
I mean,

535
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,510
he did things so passionately,
you know,

536
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,390
whether it was travel the world and
soaking up all these experiences or

537
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,060
Jujitsu or whatever he was into
something.

538
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,870
If something caught his attention,
he was just so aggressive about

539
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,750
knowledge,
learning what he could,

540
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,170
pulling everything out of it that,
that he could,

541
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
you know,
it was crazy to see someone do something

542
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:55,001
that's that physically demanding 58 with
no background in athletics at all.

543
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,170
Yeah,
like you could see when he was like,

544
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,870
even when he was doing things,
like when he went to curt oce anders

545
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:02,790
place and was rolling around,
like he doesn't have a background in

546
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,790
that,
but he's just pushing himself to it.

547
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

548
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,730
And again,
I think that was true with everything,

549
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,380
you know,
I mean if he,

550
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,110
if it was something that was interesting
to him,

551
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,900
he just went,
you know,

552
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,170
he loved it,
man.

553
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:17,150
It was crazy.
And I said,

554
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,220
you know,
I remember texting him going like,

555
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,570
how deep you getting into it?
He goes,

556
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,790
real fucking deep end.

557
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,720
He goes,
he goes,

558
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,460
he goes,
I'm getting tapped out everyday.

559
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,370
But he goes,
I'm giving guys half my age of real

560
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:29,780
struggle,
and he goes,

561
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:30,710
uh,
and I'm loving it.

562
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,080
Yeah.
And he talked about that a lot.

563
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,190
I mean,
I think he talked about like the,

564
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,220
the failure as much as anything else.
I love that going in and,

565
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,870
you know,
getting smashed.

566
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,783
Yeah.
It,

567
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,000
you know,
again,

568
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,220
to his credit,
you know,

569
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,300
show up in these places,
you know,

570
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,980
Bozeman,
Montana,

571
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
man or,
or butte.

572
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:53,660
You know what I mean?
I think he rolled in Butte butte a hard

573
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:54,500
hit and town,
man,

574
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,940
listen,
I love beauty.

575
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,610
I love you too much respect to anyone
from butte.

576
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,620
But man,
that's a hard hit in town.

577
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:03,060
You know,
you'd roll into real cowboys,

578
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,450
you know,
and uh,

579
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,150
and get the shit kicked out of him and
show up on set all you know,

580
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,020
sore and bruised and oh man,
oh no.

581
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,400
And then just jump into that.
Know it's just different for a guy who's

582
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,650
58.
I mean you got a guy who does it at 20.

583
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:22,040
I admire anybody who does Jujitsu
because it's a real humbling ego

584
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,820
dissolving experience and a lot of ways
because she's makes you realize like all

585
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,250
your illusions of how well you can
defend yourself.

586
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:31,310
They go out the window and some just
chokes you easily and you're like,

587
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,110
oh great.
I'm just a pitch.

588
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:36,290
Wandered around running around this life
thinking I'm a man.

589
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,660
But the fact that he did it at 58 just
showed what kind of a unusual duty was.

590
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,560
Yeah.
But what you just talked about there.

591
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,850
I mean,
what you're talking about with like the

592
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:46,950
ego diminishing aspect of it.
Again,

593
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,270
I think that that was something that he
took great pleasure in and I think that,

594
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,760
you know,
if you look at the way he went through

595
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,970
the world,
I'm one of the things that,

596
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,640
you know,
I appreciate it right off the bat.

597
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,600
And one of the things that kept me
around as long as I stayed around,

598
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,950
you know,
um,

599
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,260
it was the fact that it took for Tony.
I think that he was constantly trying to

600
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,830
dismantle that persona.
You know,

601
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,420
to say like,
I'm,

602
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,630
I'm not the focal point of this scene,
what I'm the,

603
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,110
what we're interested in here,
what I'm interested in talking about is

604
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,990
out there.
That's the camera's pointed away from

605
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,070
me.
You know,

606
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,260
he was kind of a clearinghouse for all
that information and he was the root of

607
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:33,120
the show and it was his journey.
But,

608
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,100
you know,
ultimately,

609
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,370
you know,
what was refreshing is he wasn't like

610
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:42,150
working with some celebrity or hosts
that was completely consumed by their

611
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:44,330
own ego and their own,
you know,

612
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,520
brandon and how they were presented to
the world.

613
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,600
That's so disgusting,
right.

614
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,411
You know?
Yeah,

615
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:49,740
Dude.

616
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,820
But it's,
it's everywhere.

617
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:51,571
It's everywhere.
Yeah.

618
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:56,520
He was very self deprecating and,
and he had reverence for real artists

619
00:27:56,521 --> 00:28:00,690
and real masters and that reverence came
across cross.

620
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,110
I texted him about some guy,
there was a photo of a restaurant and

621
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,610
uh,
I'm sure it's still on my phone,

622
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,770
subdued,
who's like a real famous guy who's like

623
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,740
some big time chef character and I was
eating in this restaurant.

624
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,200
And so I'm like,
who the fuck is this guy?

625
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,230
I guess it seems like it's a big deal.
And so,

626
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,310
uh,
I uh,

627
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,770
I texted him the photo.
This cat right here.

628
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,260
Yeah.
Do you guys was that guy's name?

629
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,281
So I said,
who is,

630
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:33,540
that guy says Marco Pierre White Made
Ramsey cry like a bitch all the time.

631
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:37,200
Original rockstar chef genius madman the
original punk.

632
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,290
But that kind of text,
like that's,

633
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,190
that's a Tony Bourdain texts.
Um,

634
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,430
and that's,
that's what that,

635
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,720
that text shows that reverence for the
master.

636
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,830
Oh yeah.
You know,

637
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,620
I mean even the way he phrases it,
you know,

638
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,050
made him cry like a bitch all the time.
Original rockstar chef genius madman

639
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,490
know.
And um,

640
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,410
and,
and that's the way it was.

641
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,930
What worked about that is he had a,
like an instant ability to sniff through

642
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,100
the bullshit,
you know,

643
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,780
so,
you know,

644
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,360
listen,
there's all kinds of famous people,

645
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:16,710
celebrities and well accomplished people
that he met that he didn't feel that

646
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,310
way.
Not,

647
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,010
you know,
he would cut through that shit

648
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,240
instantly,
but if you were on his radar in that

649
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:25,230
way,
you know,

650
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,290
it's like total commitment to what you
do.

651
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,570
You're in or you're out there.
You Got Anthony Bourdain.

652
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,920
Exactly.
Do you want to be in that list of people

653
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,420
is like,
that's a cool list of.

654
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,570
Yeah.
Well I just remember hanging out with

655
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,420
them,
you know,

656
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,100
like I just,
it was one of those

657
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
guys.
He was one of the ones that I met that I

658
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:45,880
was like pretty starstruck.
Like right away.

659
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,530
Yeah.
I said something really stupid,

660
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:51,700
like my wife says you're my boyfriend
because they watched actually show all

661
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,890
the time.
She would just joke around how you want

662
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,990
your boyfriend on TV.
Like great.

663
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,580
Skype is great,
but I'm like,

664
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,990
uh,
when we were in Montana,

665
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,450
that's when I really.
Well I always knew how hard he went,

666
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,570
but when I was blasted out of my mind
and he was like,

667
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:09,700
where's that bottle?
Where's those joints?

668
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:12,730
And those like Jesus man.
Like I can't even.

669
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,110
I'm hanging onto the earth here.

670
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah.
It was a late night.

671
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,480
Yeah,
it was that one.

672
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,340
I mean,
listen,

673
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,360
they're like,
in all fairness,

674
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:22,300
not every night was quite like that,
you know?

675
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,060
We had a lot of fun that night for sure.
It was real fun and in a really

676
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,530
interesting,
thoughtful dialogue around the campfire

677
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,540
with super townie from backwoods country
hunters and anglers and all these other

678
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:38,600
guys that were with us or you know,
these guys who it was good to get a

679
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:43,601
different perspective on what going out
and getting your own wild food is like,

680
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,990
you know,
and then having him cook it there.

681
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,370
It was delicious.
Yeah.

682
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:48,204
It was awesome.
And,

683
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,470
but also being able to put those ideas
on like a major network and print.

684
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,390
Pretty rare.
Yeah.

685
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,170
Kudos to CNN for having the Kahunas to
put together that kind of a show and

686
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,520
have it on,
you know,

687
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,910
big time man.
What can I say?

688
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,760
This is the best creative partners you
could ask for in terms of that,

689
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,210
you know,
you really enjoyed that.

690
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,530
Yeah.
What's not?

691
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,980
That was the dream job.
You do what I do know you are interested

692
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:18,710
in making documentary television and you
know,

693
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,780
um,
that's it man.

694
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:24,440
That's the wind up.
Were there some other options?

695
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:27,320
Because I know he had a giant problem
with the travel channel because I know

696
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:30,170
he had told me that they,
they fucked him over and did some

697
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:32,570
Cadillac ad.
Yeah,

698
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,460
I know.
He was really pissed about the Cadillac

699
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:34,951
and.
Well,

700
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:35,370
what,
what,

701
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,740
what was that about the I,
you know,

702
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:39,350
honestly,
I don't really know a lot of the details

703
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:41,810
of the whole story.
I don't know what other deals are on the

704
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:45,040
table besides Sienna,
but safe to say that the.

705
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,010
I think the relationship with travel
channel was toxic before that,

706
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,720
you know,
the travel channels,

707
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,050
religious own place at least was,
I don't know if still is,

708
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,960
I think the original people that owned
it because my friend Bert Kreischer has

709
00:31:57,961 --> 00:31:59,310
a show over there.
I had a show over there,

710
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:01,260
a couple shows.
Birth to conquer.

711
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,120
And what was his other show?
Hurt Bert.

712
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,570
Yeah,
she's crazy asshole.

713
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,290
But uh,
you know,

714
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,230
Bert had issues with that too.
Like when he would be on the show,

715
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,720
if we'd all be hanging out together.
If you wanted to smoke pot,

716
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,760
he had to make sure that Jamie turn the
camera away from him.

717
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,340
Oh yeah,
because they couldn't see.

718
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,410
Oh No.
Yeah,

719
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:18,244
yeah,
for sure.

720
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,253
You know,
but,

721
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,700
and listen,
I don't have any inside information,

722
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,070
so this is purely like my outside
perspective.

723
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:27,550
I don't do the deals and I don't deal in
that stuff and make the shows,

724
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,780
you know.
But uh,

725
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,060
you know,
I saw a network that was more interested

726
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:31,930
in making,
like,

727
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,160
you know,
the show's about sand castles,

728
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,600
you know?
Yeah.

729
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,660
The ghosts,
you know,

730
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,770
then they had a bunch of ghost shows,

731
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,570
shows her fucking popular.
Really popular man.

732
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,020
So stupid.
The dumbest fucking shows on television

733
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:52,460
and there's like 100 of them.
But the thing is if you're watching

734
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,000
everybody's scared of ghosts,
so if you're watching and it's like

735
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:59,480
people in there in the basement and they
have night vision on and they pretend

736
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,670
they see something like what are they
seeing as,

737
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,970
they're a fucking real ghosts,
cuts to commercial and then all of a

738
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:06,920
sudden you're hooked and you watch.
It's a hook after a hook.

739
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:07,820
After Hook.
Yeah.

740
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,020
It is the craziest,
weirdest thing.

741
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,030
It's one of the weirder things on
television.

742
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,190
Just got co showing the shoot.
Those shows,

743
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,240
can you imagine trying to make them
interesting like you were stumbling

744
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:23,330
around some fucking old house like with
night vision,

745
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,164
you know,
trying to.

746
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,840
Is that a fear now?
I mean,

747
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,360
look,
you're,

748
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,100
you went from mediator,
which is an amazing show and parts

749
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:36,101
unknown and no reservations and so
you've got these three amazing shows and

750
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:39,890
they put you on a go show.

751
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,700
No,
that's not a fear of mine.

752
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,890
That might be a nightmare.
That might be something I dream about.

753
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,280
Wake up sweating through my sheets,
you know?

754
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,070
No Man.
I'm,

755
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,861
I,
you know,

756
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,050
listen,
I still work for zero point zero,

757
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:54,681
you know.
Hi,

758
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:57,470
Morgan Morgan found it's Mike from
finding bigfoot.

759
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,590
Listen,
we're coming back for season 1000.

760
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,760
We're going to find them this year.
Please,

761
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,970
please come aboard.
We love what you did with Tony Bourdain

762
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,320
and we think you could do that with
Bobo.

763
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,310
You know,
but here's the thing,

764
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,930
they don't,
they don't want that.

765
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,140
They don't want,
they don't want cinematography and art,

766
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:15,974
you know,
they want.

767
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,320
Listen man,
they want some kid,

768
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:21,530
producer,
director slash cinematographer that they

769
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:22,364
can,
you know,

770
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,990
they don't want,
they don't want what we do.

771
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,180
Big Foot noises.
Oh yeah.

772
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,330
No.
And I'm still,

773
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,400
like I said,
I'm still with zero point zero.

774
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,850
Tony's longterm,
you know,

775
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:35,660
long time production company.
We do awesome work.

776
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,520
We got a ton of awesome stuff lined up.
You know,

777
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,600
we'll be okay ma'am.
But are you going to do more stuff with

778
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,960
Steve at mediator?
So I'll go out with steve anytime he

779
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,720
calls.
I just need a little more advanced

780
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:50,300
warning these days.
I think they called me last week to see

781
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,610
if I wanted to do an elk hunt.
Now if you do that,

782
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,490
would you try to get in shape first?
Like,

783
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,030
like heavy duty?
Yeah,

784
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,770
absolutely.
It was the last time I went out.

785
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:58,740
It was um,
I got my ass kicked.

786
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,590
It's fucking you kidding,
man.

787
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,783
Dude,
he's got,

788
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,110
I mean talk about a guy with like,
you know,

789
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:09,430
he has no empathy whatsoever for um,
for the people he's with.

790
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,640
Maybe can't keep up with no man.
When you're in the,

791
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,400
it's like if you can't make that hike,
you're just not making that hike,

792
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:17,890
you know,
and you know,

793
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,170
he weighs 110 pounds and he couldn't
walk for days.

794
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,023
Yeah.
Yeah.

795
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,630
And he's been doing this since he was a
baby.

796
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:24,464
Yeah,
exactly.

797
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,783
No,
man,

798
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,760
I went,
the last time I went out with him was

799
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:30,650
uh,
I guess two years ago I went up to

800
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:34,550
Alaska and did the blacktail hunt,
but we actually had nice weather,

801
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,230
which was kind of unbelievable because I
know you've been up there when it's

802
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:38,090
like,
you know,

803
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,490
10 days of rain coming sideways.
We had to leave early last time was

804
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:45,260
there because a storm was coming and we
had to make a decision that says I'm

805
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,790
coming every time we went up there,
but we weren't gonna be able to get out.

806
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,600
There was a possibility.
Exactly.

807
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,280
Part of me was like,
even though we're rain soaked,

808
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:58,281
I want to hunt the last six hours
because if I stay the last day,

809
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,000
never know that might be the,
that so many times that's when you hook

810
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,320
up with an animal.
Absolutely.

811
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,210
I mean,
in my experience up there with an

812
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,160
animal,
sounds like the wrong thing really,

813
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,320
really wrong because a couple of animals
and catch can.

814
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,990
No Man,
but you know,

815
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:17,880
like it was.
That's exactly the way it was.

816
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:20,600
You go up there and you'd be in six days
rain.

817
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:24,570
Then all of a sudden the fog a clear and
there's some,

818
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,360
you know,
black tail standing right there looking

819
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:29,370
at you.
You know that a lot of bear up there

820
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,031
too.
Yeah.

821
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:31,530
Tons of bear.
No,

822
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:32,281
but he,
you know,

823
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,560
I got my ass whipped last time.
I went up there first time I went up

824
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:35,610
there,
I was still in shape.

825
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,840
You know,
I was younger.

826
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,810
I did pretty well.
Well you were doing it all the time.

827
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,700
You have to do it all the time.
You have the hiking thing is something.

828
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,940
I mean you're,
you're basically building up this

829
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,130
difference in your legs that you only
get from hiking.

830
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,590
Absolutely.
Biking.

831
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,780
Endurance is no joke.
It seems like it's a joke because if you

832
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:54,300
hike for like five feet,
it seems like nothing.

833
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,410
You climbed a small hill.
Yeah.

834
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,500
I could do this all day.
You think you could do it all day?

835
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,450
You do that for 20 minutes.
You can start.

836
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,760
He even,
you'd be drenched in sweat.

837
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,810
He'd want to take your jacket off and
then you realize like,

838
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,840
oh my God,
I have to do this for eight more hours.

839
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,610
Eight more days.
Yeah.

840
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,550
And then the morning.
And then if your immune system,

841
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,440
is it all tax,
it's going to crash hard.

842
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:14,670
You might get sick.
Yeah,

843
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:16,320
man,
I know you,

844
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,820
like you said,
you can't train for it.

845
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,800
You can't train for that kind of back
country stuff.

846
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,180
You can go out and,
you know,

847
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,490
run up and down the stair master,
whatever,

848
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,670
but that doesn't really.
Doesn't train all those little muscles

849
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:28,800
that you use to constantly stabilize
yourself.

850
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,630
You know,
Senator Hassle,

851
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:34,620
help a little with stairmaster will help
a little but really helped the major

852
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,250
muscle groups.

853
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,480
Right.
Running hills,

854
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,503
uh,
helped me,

855
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,260
helped me a lot just because it's so
much harder than hiking.

856
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,360
He's run them.
You could do it easier.

857
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,200
It makes you hiking easier.
Lucky with weighted packs onto.

858
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,480
Do you ever do that?
Oh yeah,

859
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,630
yeah,
that's what we did,

860
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,060
but not just for training.
For training.

861
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:51,820
Yeah,
I would.

862
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm on the stairmaster actually.
I'm pretty sure I am.

863
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm guessing the stairmaster with us.
Yeah,

864
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,760
no,
I'd put weights on my pack and go on the

865
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,100
stairmaster.
Yeah.

866
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,910
Yeah.
And boots,

867
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,080
you know,
boots on the stairmaster.

868
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,420
Did they let you do that at the gym
where they look at you weird or will

869
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:09,660
everyone looks at you weird?
Oh my God.

870
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,510
If you're,
if you even talk about hunting and Los

871
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,730
Angeles and looking at weird metro,
you know,

872
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,380
like
what's wrong with you?

873
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,970
It's the fuck that guy got Cammo on for
Jesus Christ.

874
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,850
Did you were camera with the gym?
I feel like I may have had some cammo

875
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:31,851
aspect of my pack of course,
but I'm bloodstains you know,

876
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:32,821
I,
you know,

877
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:35,530
it's interesting though because I think
back on those times and you know,

878
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:38,530
like while we're talking about like all
the shitty weather and all that stuff,

879
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,590
and then just think back to that.
The first time I went out with Steve,

880
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:43,480
him saying like,
Yeah Dude,

881
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:44,600
but you won't,
you know,

882
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,050
you never tell stories about the good
days,

883
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,020
you know,
and I got to say to his credit that's

884
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:53,380
been absolutely true is like those,
those shitty days,

885
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,680
freezing cold,
you know,

886
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,760
getting out of here,
getting out of your sleeping bag in the

887
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:02,620
morning and putting on wet clothes,
cold wet clothes to go to go out and

888
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:04,030
hunt all day.
You know,

889
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,380
I look back on that with like a great
degree of fondness and I also have to

890
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:12,070
say it made me a lot more of a person
than I was before,

891
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,100
you know,
toughens you up to it.

892
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,720
It,
it toughened me up to open me up to the

893
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:21,721
idea of it opened me up to accepting,
you know,

894
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,230
possibilities for myself that I had
never thought of before.

895
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,330
You know,
like your capabilities,

896
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,970
your capabilities,
you know,

897
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,540
that,
that we,

898
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:36,040
like,
we all have that somewhere back down in

899
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,390
the brainstem.
This idea,

900
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,140
this ability to just go out in the woods
and,

901
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,610
you know,
hunt something and eat it,

902
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,530
you know,
and up until that point I had never done

903
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,390
that.
I'd done some hiking and some camping.

904
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:50,320
It was always on trails and they're all
nicely marked and stuff like that.

905
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,820
The idea of stepping out of Steve's the
backdoor seeps cabin in just into the

906
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:57,220
woods at that time for me,
when I first did it,

907
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,780
that was completely new.
I was like,

908
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,790
well,
you can just walk into the woods,

909
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,020
where do we go and uh,
and then to do it and to have it be

910
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:11,870
successful and to bring that animal back
into sit around and eat it and all this

911
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:12,460
stuff.

912
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,000
That was a real huge Aha moment for me,
you know,

913
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,100
personally and professionally.
Like,

914
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,560
oh,
we can do shit that we used to do,

915
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,000
you know,
10,000 years ago.

916
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,120
It was big for me too.
I remember saying that on the show,

917
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,720
like when Steve was asking me and Brian
on the first hunt,

918
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:31,640
which just by sheer luck we were
successful on the,

919
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:32,710
on the first hunt.
Yeah.

920
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,260
And Steve was like,
a,

921
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,860
do you think you're going to do it
again?

922
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,820
I said,
fuck you.

923
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,380
I'm doing this forever.
Like,

924
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:39,480
I knew it.
He goes,

925
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,330
when did you know?
I said,

926
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:42,040
the moment that deer dropped.
Yeah.

927
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,240
The moment the deer dropped him,
like,

928
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,710
okay,
I'm doing this forever.

929
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,380
This is how I'm making,
getting my meat now I'm going to do

930
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:48,370
this.
Yeah,

931
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:49,930
man,
it's the,

932
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,910
it's shows.
I don't know.

933
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,610
There's so many.
Just like really glib interpretations of

934
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:56,620
like the motivation behind hunting,
you know,

935
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,800
I was say cruelty and blood lust and
it's like,

936
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:02,950
because in its worst cases that's,
that's true.

937
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,960
Yeah.
And because I,

938
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,730
I,
I do think that hunting shows for years,

939
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:10,630
that's a lot of what they put forward
was like kind of machismo and guys

940
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:13,680
shooting black bears over,
you know,

941
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,640
donut barrels,
you know,

942
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,740
um,
for all the wrong reasons,

943
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,000
you know,
the beliefs.

944
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,920
We think of that as something that
people,

945
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:23,740
or at least I do think of that as
something that people eat for food.

946
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,090
When you think about Cecil Cecil a
little while and that kind of shit

947
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:32,830
really sours people on the idea of
hunting because there's no justification

948
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:34,100
for the person for shooting

949
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,330
a lion.
I mean you have to,

950
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,460
you'd have to do decades of education
about conservation and the importance of

951
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:43,340
the money that goes for the hunt and
then they still don't get it because

952
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,080
they're like,
why would you want to shoot a line?

953
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:46,930
And that's the good question.
Good question.

954
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,803
Why would you want,

955
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,730
you know,
and I would say it's a good question for

956
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:50,630
me too.
I like,

957
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,010
I definitely have limits,
you know,

958
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:56,330
as much as I went around with Steve.
I have limits on what I would personally

959
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,670
choose to do and I got to say the Africa
stuff for me,

960
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:59,504
ma'am,
I just,

961
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,260
it's not interesting to me,
you know.

962
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,910
See that's interesting to me in Africa
would be to hunt something that I would

963
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,580
eat.
So they have antelope in Africa.

964
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:12,690
I would love to hunt and hunt and
antelope and cook it and eat it.

965
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,070
That to me,
makes sense.

966
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,500
There's no way I want to shoot a hippo
or anything else,

967
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,950
even if people do eat hippos and I
understand they do that.

968
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:24,510
Okay,
good luck.

969
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,581
Yeah,
I don't,

970
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:27,120
I don't want to have nothing to do with
any of that,

971
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,270
but,
but game animals that have been,

972
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,910
that are delicious Neil Guy,
things like that,

973
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,560
that people have eaten forever and that
they hunt,

974
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,670
they hunt elk or deer here.
That to me makes sense.

975
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:40,680
It would be just an adventure to go to
Africa,

976
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,240
Africa,
so fucking scary.

977
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,943
It's so sketchy.

978
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,080
I mean,
I love Africa and I became like,

979
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,860
I kinda took all the Africa shows I
could on parts unknown.

980
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:55,730
Really.
That's mostly wonderful place.

981
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,530
Well,
um,

982
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,700
first of all,
I think there's like a,

983
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,151
I think it's,
uh,

984
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:03,860
there's a lot of misperception when it
comes to.

985
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:06,770
I've never had a negative experience
there.

986
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I've had maybe I had one experience.
It was kind of quasi threatening,

987
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,030
you know,
and we got to.

988
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,133
Yeah,
I mean,

989
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,730
you know,
we had a crowd kind of turn on us and

990
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,890
throw rocks at us was we were driving
away.

991
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,310
That's the one experience with like
hundreds experiences.

992
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,770
Well,
we're in a,

993
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,270
we're in Goma,
in the DRC,

994
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,660
you know,
and it's just a,

995
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,520
it's just a really,
really chaotic place.

996
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:34,640
A place has been run over by a civil
wars for decades.

997
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,110
People are in serious desperation,
but I think worse than any of that,

998
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,440
there's a huge culture of,
um,

999
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,240
of nonprofit organizations and stuff
there.

1000
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,540
So I think they're used to kind of white
folks coming in with this very

1001
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,950
patronizing kind of view.
Um,

1002
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,520
and then we're down there with cameras
filming them and then all of a sudden

1003
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:58,040
they realize that we're not paying
anyone for this,

1004
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,640
you know,
and uh,

1005
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,710
and I think,
you know,

1006
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,600
there's a tendency for people to feel
like,

1007
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,760
well,
you're here taking something from us,

1008
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:07,190
you know,
you're clearly making more money than

1009
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:10,430
any of us will ever be able to make.
And uh,

1010
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,680
and what the fuck did we get for it?
You know,

1011
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,980
and I can understand that point of view.
And how did it turn into them throwing

1012
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,600
rocks at you guys?
You know,

1013
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,730
again,
they realized we weren't going to be

1014
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:21,140
paying for any of this.
You know,

1015
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:24,170
our security team was like,
hey guys,

1016
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:27,710
time to get in the car and as soon as
you get in the car and you're leaving,

1017
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,910
it's like,
oh,

1018
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,590
these fucking assholes,
man.

1019
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,900
It just came down here,
got not older footage,

1020
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,940
gonna pack up and go back to their nice
hotel,

1021
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,100
you know?
Um,

1022
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,210
but that's the one experience and little
like a lot of experiences there,

1023
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,630
you know,
for the most part I found people that

1024
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:46,860
are like incredibly gracious.
You know,

1025
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,290
I've found it to be one of the most
hopeful places,

1026
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,940
honestly.
Um,

1027
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:56,030
my day to day experiences in Africa,
I saw people who were working their

1028
00:44:56,071 --> 00:45:00,600
asses off on a grassroots level.
The [inaudible] like some of the most,

1029
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,040
um,
you know,

1030
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:07,070
some of the most like dynamic grassroots
capitalism that I've ever seen and

1031
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:13,401
people who will literally find any,
any way to scrape out an existence and a

1032
00:45:13,941 --> 00:45:15,030
living.
You know,

1033
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,480
this is not like,
this is not a lazy culture.

1034
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,660
This is a culture that will fight
through anything,

1035
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,380
you know,
go to Lagos and legacy is one of the

1036
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:27,270
most dynamic cities I've ever been in.

1037
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,930
There's a constantly moving,
constantly people trying to make money,

1038
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,300
constantly.
People trying to find a niche,

1039
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,670
you know,
in a city of 20 million people,

1040
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,330
you know,
so I find a lot of beauty and just like

1041
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,840
raw human endeavor there.
And I think that,

1042
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,540
you know,
if they can clear some of the,

1043
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,350
like obvious stumbling blocks that they
have in terms of corruption,

1044
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,520
in terms of,
you know,

1045
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:52,380
foreign pressure,
um,

1046
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:53,470
in terms of,
you know,

1047
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,190
manipulation of markets.
Um,

1048
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,010
there's,
there's tremendous promise there.

1049
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,450
I mean like,
just,

1050
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,480
just in terms of the,
just the Internet and technology sector

1051
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,940
in Africa is absolutely booming.
You know,

1052
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,970
you have kids that come in from the
villages on the streets of Lego's who

1053
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,230
can take your computer apart and rebuild
it by hand,

1054
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,420
you know,
self taught and all of that potential is

1055
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:26,640
there to be tapped,
you know,

1056
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:27,780
and,
and they're starting to,

1057
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,350
you know.

1058
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,010
So I guess I just find it a hopeful
place.

1059
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,530
That's amazing that you only had one bad
experience,

1060
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,330
only one,
only one.

1061
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,630
But I can say that about traveling the
world kind of in general.

1062
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,870
I mean we've been in a number of,
you know,

1063
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,360
relatively hot zones.
I mean we never did active conflict

1064
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:48,890
because we don't make that kind of show.
Um,

1065
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,770
but you know,
being in places like Gaza or the DRC or

1066
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:56,910
you know,
I can count on one hand in,

1067
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,380
you know,
in many,

1068
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,270
many years of doing this,
you know,

1069
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:03,240
the number of times that I actually felt
threatened by someone.

1070
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,180
You know,
I've found that the most likely

1071
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,000
scenarios you're going to get accosted
by a sandwich,

1072
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,200
you know,
or someone trying to,

1073
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,930
you know,
introduce you to their kids,

1074
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,340
you know,
or take a selfie with you.

1075
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:17,430
And that's,
that's the world that I know.

1076
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,570
I don't really understand the world that
we see on TV here,

1077
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,410
man,
because that's not,

1078
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,260
that's not my experience.
You know,

1079
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,100
you know,
a lot of good people.

1080
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,170
And again,
getting back to Tony,

1081
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,040
I think that,
you know,

1082
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,810
that's legacy,
right?

1083
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:33,640
I think that he really showed people
that

1084
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,930
that is a problem with our view of the
world is that if it doesn't look scary,

1085
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:39,540
they're not gonna show it to,
you know,

1086
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,150
just because if it's not dangerous,
I mean other than his show.

1087
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,080
What else are you seeing on CNN where
they are in Africa where it's a good

1088
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:51,860
thing.
What else are you seeing where people

1089
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:54,920
are in Egypt where it's a good thing?
What else are you seeing where people

1090
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:57,560
are interacting with people on the
street and there's not some sort of a

1091
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:02,000
murder story or rape story or something
awful?

1092
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,003
Yeah,
I mean,

1093
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,070
I think you're starting,
you're starting to see it a little bit.

1094
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,410
Um,
but mostly you're seeing it in like,

1095
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,760
you know,
on like CNN,

1096
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,070
Africa,
you know,

1097
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,940
network or you know,
there you're starting to see them

1098
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:18,200
covering stories about entrepreneurs,
right.

1099
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,440
You know,
positive aspects,

1100
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,900
you know,
building economies.

1101
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,300
But it's a real problem in our view of
the world for people that don't travel

1102
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:25,670
well.
Listen,

1103
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,780
Africa just simply doesn't make news in
the United States.

1104
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,940
I mean,
and yet it takes a genocide,

1105
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,470
you know?
Well,

1106
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:35,170
all I've been hearing about Africa
lately is what's going on with white

1107
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:37,230
farmers in South Africa.
So yeah,

1108
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,720
it's very scary stuff where people are
encouraging people to attack white

1109
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:45,210
farmers,
you know,

1110
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,360
and there's a whole lot of
sociopolitical economic shit that goes

1111
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:50,980
on without that.
I'm not even going to pretend I

1112
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:52,290
understand,
but uh,

1113
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,700
that's what you hear about.
You don't hear about good things here

1114
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:56,230
about how many farmers have been
murdered.

1115
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,333
Yeah.
Homes.

1116
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,170
Well that's a shame man,
because,

1117
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,350
you know,
you go there and most of what I find

1118
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,940
going on there as positive,
you know,

1119
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,740
listen,
there's a lot of pain,

1120
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:11,110
there's a lot of suffering,
there's a lot of bad shit that happens

1121
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:12,010
there too.
Obviously.

1122
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,290
I'm not gonna deny that,
you know,

1123
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,183
but uh,

1124
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:17,980
you know,
we don't hear the good stuff.

1125
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,250
Did you have a good,
did you have like a place where you

1126
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,340
enjoyed traveling to the most?
You know,

1127
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,940
no,
I don't think really because uh,

1128
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,980
I,
you know,

1129
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,771
this,
to me,

1130
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:33,130
this is another kind of like real lesson
of the show,

1131
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,070
you know,
I think we got to a place where we were

1132
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:39,130
finding something kind of everywhere,
you know,

1133
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,080
there's some places that I didn't enjoy
as much,

1134
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,610
you know,
but uh,

1135
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,360
I think most places we found something
that was like,

1136
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,194
oh,
this is,

1137
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,460
this is awesome.
You know,

1138
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,470
what was the one place where you like,
Eh,

1139
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,520
I'm not going back here again.
I don't want to say,

1140
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,510
okay.
The positive people keep it positive.

1141
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,210
Let's just say it's a highly militarized
state.

1142
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,110
Okay.
Now and deep divides and uh,

1143
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,360
on both sides.
Yeah.

1144
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,950
Okay.
And,

1145
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:13,900
uh,
and a lot of beautiful people on both

1146
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:14,734
sides,
but,

1147
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,170
you know,
um,

1148
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,790
but I think,
you know,

1149
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:23,050
I mean this was something we like,
we encounter a lot as we kind of

1150
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:24,370
progress in the show is this.
I,

1151
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,050
you know,
I remember my dad would say it to me all

1152
00:50:26,051 --> 00:50:26,411
the time.
It's like,

1153
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:26,910
well,
where,

1154
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,550
where are you guys going to go now?
You know,

1155
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:29,600
you've been everywhere.
It's just like,

1156
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,910
yeah,
but I think we started to learn that you

1157
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,430
could like really point the camera kind
of anywhere.

1158
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,050
I think a big one for me was like doing
this West Virginia show last year,

1159
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,170
which the place it always been like
really close to my heart.

1160
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:45,590
Like I grew up there when I was a kid.
Um,

1161
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,830
you know,
it's a place that has been,

1162
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:49,790
I think like deeply misrepresented.

1163
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,410
Again,
another place has been deeply

1164
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:53,150
Ruttenberg,
misrepresented in the media,

1165
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,730
you know,
um,

1166
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,990
and uh,
but,

1167
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,960
you know,
we got like I got into town on the scout

1168
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,940
there and it's like there's no
restaurant,

1169
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,130
you know,
it's not just that there's no restaurant

1170
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,810
like in the town,
there's like two restaurants in the

1171
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:07,340
county,
you know,

1172
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:09,260
and I remember having this moment of
like,

1173
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,150
can we do this,
this is work,

1174
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,630
like will Tony Respond to this?
And we make a show here.

1175
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,310
And within two days he was like,
this big,

1176
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,760
you know,
very deeply heartfelt statements about

1177
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,290
the place.
I really loved it,

1178
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,390
you know,
and it was kind of another Aha moment

1179
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:27,081
where you're like,
oh yeah,

1180
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:29,380
of course.
Because there's something everywhere in

1181
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:34,100
the human story is everywhere and dig
into it wherever you go,

1182
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,160
the fundamentals of that don't change.
And I think that,

1183
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,080
you know,
what he did was so cleanly and clearly

1184
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:47,210
and so free of bullshit,
cut to the core of those very

1185
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,600
fundamental kind of human stories,
you know.

1186
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,990
And um,
anyways,

1187
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:56,840
it worked well.
We won an emmy two nights ago for it.

1188
00:51:56,841 --> 00:52:00,740
So yeah,
posthumous Emmy's are always odd,

1189
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:01,820
right?
Yeah.

1190
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:03,290
That was a,
it was a rough night.

1191
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,120
Um,
when he would get the rough cut,

1192
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,860
would it be length of the actual show
and then he would add narration to it.

1193
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,110
Did he have any say in the editing
process?

1194
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:15,801
Huge.
I mean,

1195
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:19,610
so I think that's something important
too about who he was,

1196
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,900
you know,
um,

1197
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,960
I mean like everyone calls him a chef.
He wasn't a chef,

1198
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:26,240
like he was a producer,
he was a television producer,

1199
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,740
you know,
um,

1200
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,260
he,
he would pick the locations he had

1201
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,420
picked a subject matter for the most
part.

1202
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:33,350
You know,
there were a couple of lights.

1203
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:35,720
How did you guys work it out?
Let's say if you were going to go to

1204
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,420
Puerto Rico or something like that,
how would you make,

1205
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,790
make the decisions,
how would you decide where to go and

1206
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,930
why?
Okay,

1207
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,520
well I'll take you through the whole
process.

1208
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,130
So,
so tony would come up with a list of

1209
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:49,670
places that he was interested in going
and maybe we would throw a couple in

1210
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,200
light had mentioned the West Virginia
Show,

1211
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,790
you know,
be like,

1212
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,410
but this is my list,
right?

1213
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,200
And um,
and then he'd write like a brief on each

1214
00:52:57,201 --> 00:52:59,390
one.
I'm interested in x,

1215
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,060
you know,
like I'm interested in Singapore,

1216
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,940
it's Disneyland with the death penalty.
Right.

1217
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,811
And you're like,
okay.

1218
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,780
So there's like,
there's kind of a basic operating

1219
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,950
thesis,
right?

1220
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,070
We can kind of like go in and look at
this place.

1221
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,410
I'm from this perspective.
Um,

1222
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,430
and so some of them,
some of them didn't add the Lego's

1223
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:21,180
episode for example,
you just be like,

1224
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,910
we,
we haven't been to Nigeria,

1225
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,520
let's go to Nigeria,
you know,

1226
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,360
and,
and so we would start doing research on

1227
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,390
what that was just big kind of,
you know,

1228
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,420
30,000 foot macro,
you know,

1229
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,600
what is this environment like,
what are the interesting things,

1230
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:39,870
what are the stories that have been told
about this place and how can we look at

1231
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,750
it from a different angle.
So like the Nigeria one,

1232
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:44,970
we kind of focused in on like I said,
you know,

1233
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,890
grassroots capitalism dei,
why entrepreneurship,

1234
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,930
you know,
street level,

1235
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,400
the street level kind of dynamics of the
economy,

1236
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,293
you know.

1237
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:02,330
And that became like we could see ways
to kind of make a beautiful human story

1238
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:09,261
out of those elements.
So I'd end up putting down to him

1239
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:11,970
probably in like a two or three page
thing.

1240
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:14,160
Like here are my ideas,
you know,

1241
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,280
here's what I found based on what you
were interested in.

1242
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:20,910
Here's some other things I've found,
this is the way we'd Kinda like to go

1243
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:22,170
about it.
And he'd either be like,

1244
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:23,004
yeah,
or no,

1245
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,810
you know,
and from that point,

1246
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,720
um,
we'd just get heavy into research,

1247
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,300
write a treatment,
you know,

1248
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,960
I'm in break that story into like six
acts,

1249
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,610
right?
And then look for scenes to kind of fill

1250
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:40,350
in,
articulate that story.

1251
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:42,330
So it seems like,
you know,

1252
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:45,420
I have this great economist,
I know we're going to need an economist

1253
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:47,760
at some point,
but we got to put a,

1254
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,910
economists are kind of boring by nature,
so we got to put him somewhere more

1255
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:54,780
dynamic where there's this really
interesting computer market that has a

1256
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:55,680
lot of energy.

1257
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,500
So let's put the economists there.
They can walk around,

1258
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,450
there's a great restaurant in the corner
there.

1259
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,100
So like here's some elements we can put
together that's a scene in a act of the

1260
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,740
show.
So you put all that stuff together and

1261
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:10,110
treatment form,
send it to Tony,

1262
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,640
usually minimal notes from him,
you know.

1263
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,830
Um,
and then,

1264
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,530
uh,
and then we'd go out and Scout,

1265
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,110
shoot the show,
you know,

1266
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,780
how weird is it shooting in a restaurant
with camera people standing over the

1267
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,910
table?
I think we got,

1268
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,300
I think we've got really good at not
taking over the environment,

1269
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,890
you know,
so I don't,

1270
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,773
I,
I,

1271
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,640
I don't know.
I don't know how to answer that because

1272
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:37,150
you do it.
How do we save?

1273
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,710
You and I are having a conversation at
dinner and we're being filmed right?

1274
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,360
Is,
would they be as close as Jamie is?

1275
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,500
Right there to cameras closer.
Not around.

1276
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,450
On top of you.
Yeah.

1277
00:55:46,451 --> 00:55:48,030
It's pretty close.
But you know,

1278
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,530
understanding.
Yeah.

1279
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,800
But we wouldn't use like your,
there were rules to that,

1280
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,410
right?
Because like we're a documentary show.

1281
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:59,700
We can't just go in and just completely
take over some place or take over some

1282
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:02,310
village or scare the shit out of local
people are,

1283
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:05,640
you know what I mean?
Like we got to go in with some deafness,

1284
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:07,440
you know,
so we would go in early and we would

1285
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:12,030
light so that the character's Tony
aren't really seeing us screw around

1286
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,440
with lighting,
stuff like that.

1287
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,720
That's all kind of in place.
Um,

1288
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,590
put the cameras in there.
No sound guy.

1289
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:22,980
No big booms.
Sit the rest of the crew down.

1290
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,820
Are they wearing wireless mics?
Yeah,

1291
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,290
exactly.
And then,

1292
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,330
and then,
uh,

1293
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,400
and then fill in local people and the
rest of the restaurant and make sure

1294
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:36,280
that there are people who actually go to
that restaurant in the restaurant,

1295
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,350
make sure that fuels like alive,
not like full of extras,

1296
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:43,800
like miming dialogue and

1297
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,500
carrying large cameras.
Like how big are the cameras are

1298
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,650
carrying their big cameras,
like regular big ole production cameras,

1299
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:52,320
heavy on the shoulders.
Like you guys would use a mediator.

1300
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,090
Yeah.
Again,

1301
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,440
you know,
but again,

1302
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,600
you know,
it's two guys standing there with

1303
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:02,230
cameras that have been traveling,
at least from Tony's perspective and

1304
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:04,480
traveling with Tony for a long time.
You know,

1305
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,380
it was just like having two more friends
at the meal in terms of what the

1306
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,400
sidekicks,
you know,

1307
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:13,270
I think we learned early on that like
you gotta like you gotta go up,

1308
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,190
you've got to introduce yourself,
you've got to smile,

1309
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:17,650
you gotta laugh,
you gotta be able to be self deprecating

1310
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:21,700
and make them feel comfortable.
Like you're there to ask them questions,

1311
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:23,560
not to tell them who they are,
you know.

1312
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,260
And um,
I don't know,

1313
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:26,930
man,
it,

1314
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,120
I,
I just say we,

1315
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,700
we traveled all over the place.
A lot of people who've never been on

1316
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,430
camera for that largely worked,
you know,

1317
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,020
so it must've been doing something
right.

1318
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,540
Was there ever a time you in a
restaurant in.

1319
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,420
We're pissed off that there was people
standing there with cameras filming a

1320
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:40,980
table.
Oh yeah,

1321
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,993
yeah,
yeah.

1322
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,460
But you know,
that's pretty easy.

1323
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,560
You know,
someone gets pissed off and they wave

1324
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:47,670
you off.
Okay,

1325
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:48,540
cool.
Sorry.

1326
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,130
No,
no worries.

1327
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,590
You know,
I,

1328
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,490
I,
it never really escalated,

1329
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:54,900
you know,
listen,

1330
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,740
may never escalated.
You had a view of the world by doing

1331
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:03,330
that show and traveling the way he did
that it's less than one percent of the

1332
00:58:03,331 --> 00:58:06,180
population is ever gonna experience.
Probably less than one percent of one

1333
00:58:06,181 --> 00:58:06,721
percent.
Yeah,

1334
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:08,190
I would say for sure.
Yeah.

1335
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,180
I mean it's got to be an incredibly
enriching journey for you.

1336
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,040
Yeah,
hugely.

1337
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,570
I mean,
here's Lee.

1338
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:16,710
There's,
I mean it's,

1339
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,360
I don't know,
it's very simple.

1340
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:22,620
There's before and there's after and
it's two different people really,

1341
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,360
because just all the data you had to
take in the view of the world changes,

1342
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,470
it gets bigger.
It becomes a much bigger place.

1343
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,040
It does.
That's was,

1344
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,150
you know.
That's exactly right and not what's

1345
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:34,740
really interesting.
I tell people this too,

1346
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,940
they'd be like,
oh well,

1347
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,570
you know,
you've been all these places.

1348
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,560
It's get out of the gap,
but the world doesn't work like that.

1349
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:42,510
It doesn't sound like the more places
you go,

1350
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:44,940
the smaller the world feels more places
you go.

1351
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:47,250
The bigger the world feels.
It just feels bigger and bigger and

1352
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:49,540
bigger because he realized like there's,
you know,

1353
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:50,910
people,
every country,

1354
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:53,130
there's this county in this country,
in this town,

1355
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:54,690
in this county,
there's this street,

1356
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:57,120
there's all these other streets,
there's all these other people.

1357
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:02,070
You know,
our shows were just a sliver of a place,

1358
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,020
a tiny little sliver,
you know,

1359
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,740
you can go into Lego's.
We'd go back to Lego and make 10 more

1360
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:10,680
shows.
Each one of them completely unique and

1361
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:11,730
individual.
You know,

1362
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,680
the world's a big place.
A lot of shit

1363
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,120
going on.
Know,

1364
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,100
yeah,
now

1365
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,980
they're going to keep hearing shows,
right?

1366
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,940
I mean,
how long are they going to,

1367
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,500
how long are they going to do this for?
They have.

1368
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,470
How many did they have all told?
How many they did?

1369
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:28,760
Five seasons.

1370
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:32,480
Actually it's an 18.
I guess we're getting near 100 shows,

1371
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,580
you know,
I've never counted.

1372
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,950
I don't really know a lot of shows.
Uh,

1373
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,843
yeah,
they'll keep her.

1374
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,290
I have it on my dvr so they'll
occasionally run these marathons and

1375
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,840
then I'll go to my dvr and there's like
20 new shows,

1376
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,230
you know,
and I've watched a few of them the other

1377
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:51,590
night for the first time I watched it in
awhile.

1378
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:55,340
I posted a thing on instagram too about
it because I,

1379
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,640
I was real reluctant to watch it after
he died.

1380
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:03,641
But then I went on a bender wash,
like binged watched like three of them

1381
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:04,970
in the night.
I was like,

1382
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:06,830
God damn on a good show.
It was.

1383
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,060
Yeah.
Yeah,

1384
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,490
it was good man.
You guys nailed it and you really,

1385
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:13,470
you should be really proud.
Thanks man.

1386
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,100
Yeah,
and you know,

1387
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,270
I'm actually still working on one right
now,

1388
01:00:18,271 --> 01:00:21,370
which is maybe the weirdest experience.
You know,

1389
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,880
you're asking about process before,
you know,

1390
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,300
after we chewed it,
that's when Tony really came in.

1391
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,220
What do you do if he's not there for
narration?

1392
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:29,910
Well,
that's the,

1393
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,650
that's the thing.
Who narrates it,

1394
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,410
you know,
I'm not,

1395
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,120
I'm not going to replace Tony,
so no narration now.

1396
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,150
Yeah.
I mean we have our sidekicks,

1397
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,680
uh,
talking to him.

1398
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:44,570
We have his dialogue in the field,
you know,

1399
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,710
but who's going to step in and do that
voice and how offensive would it be if

1400
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:50,930
we did that?
It would happen

1401
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:54,430
to be someone who is so close to him
that it didn't,

1402
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:57,840
it didn't freak everybody out and have
to be someone who was on the show a

1403
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,760
thousand times.
It was just there with them always.

1404
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:01,770
Yeah.
That person doesn't really exist.

1405
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,200
Doesn't?
Yeah,

1406
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,300
there's no,
there's no voice there.

1407
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,040
When you would give him a rough cut,

1408
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,250
I'm safe.
Like I said,

1409
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:11,010
a show on Puerto Rico,
what have you.

1410
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,350
So he would take that,
he would watch it and then he would

1411
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:14,184
start writing.

1412
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,410
Exactly.
So yeah,

1413
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:17,150
getting back to process,
you'd like,

1414
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,890
I'd send him an act right once it was in
rough cut form and then you get his

1415
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:25,160
notes back because that was always kind
of a terrifying moment too because

1416
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:26,300
you're like,
dude,

1417
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,060
you worked on the thing a lot and you
send it off to him.

1418
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,720
He can go one way or another.
Man,

1419
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:35,180
I got you.
I got gutted a few times but I got a

1420
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,460
couple that were like out fucking
standing,

1421
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:39,090
you know,
and that's all the notes he had.

1422
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,200
But you would,
you'd send them basically scratch

1423
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:44,120
writing.
So you'd say like here's what we're

1424
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:45,170
thinking,
you know,

1425
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:47,630
is this kind of idea,
goes here,

1426
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:50,240
this kind of idea goes here.
And then he would actually write it,

1427
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,730
you know,
and you get that writing back.

1428
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,500
How long will it take for him to do
something like that?

1429
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,940
Oh he ripped that shit out,
man.

1430
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,230
Yeah,
he fast.

1431
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,880
And that's the thing too.
I never,

1432
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,980
you know,
there was never an email or a text that

1433
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:04,970
he didn't get back to you because he was
no slouch man.

1434
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,410
He liked,
he was sharp,

1435
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:08,180
he was on it.
He'd get back to you,

1436
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,160
he'd do the work,
you know,

1437
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,023
it.
Um,

1438
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,350
when he took pride in that,
we would talk about doing the work.

1439
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,370
Yeah,
yeah,

1440
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,360
yeah.
And he did.

1441
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:18,040
I mean,
there's another,

1442
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,510
that's another,
another thing that was so delightful

1443
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:22,440
about it,
you know,

1444
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,590
suddenly you're having to drag some,
you know,

1445
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,470
carcass along and,
you know,

1446
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,390
prop them up in front of the camera and,
you know,

1447
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,740
he was into it man.
And like he had total ownership,

1448
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,810
total control,
awesome.

1449
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:39,930
Incredible creative ideas,
incredible creative power.

1450
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:42,180
Like he was in,
you know,

1451
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:44,500
and no show was like,
yeah,

1452
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,301
fuck it,
you know,

1453
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:47,610
we can just kind of slipped by on this
one.

1454
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,330
You know,
every show is important and when they,

1455
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:52,830
you know,
when they weren't working,

1456
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,030
he was pissed,
you know,

1457
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,910
and great.
You know,

1458
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,950
I think the biggest thing that I miss in
this process of cutting this Texas show

1459
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:06,951
that I'm doing now is not having the
pressure of him looking at it and being

1460
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:09,180
like,
dude,

1461
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,350
you know,
no man,

1462
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,600
this ain't working.
You know,

1463
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,280
that was a real benefit to us.

1464
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,713
Huh?

1465
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:17,850
When did he start smoking again?

1466
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,140
You know,
so weirdest thing,

1467
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:21,890
man,
I,

1468
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,930
I didn't know.
I didn't really know his smoking again.

1469
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:29,210
And then the police show came out and I
just saw him light up on camera,

1470
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,500
you know,
I was like,

1471
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,570
Oh shit,
I guess we're doing this again.

1472
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,920
And then a couple of my,
like a couple of my shows at the end,

1473
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,770
he'd start just lighting up on Cameron.
That was always like,

1474
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,230
that was always no go territory.
Like in the past when he was smoking,

1475
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:47,280
we would like stop shooting,
you know?

1476
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,600
Um,
all of a sudden he was just lighting up

1477
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:53,700
right on camera and
I don't know,

1478
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,460
shocked the shit out of me,
you know,

1479
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,220
I kind of looked around,
the crew liked w,

1480
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,120
what do we do?
Like

1481
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:03,060
I was shocked because he said that when
his daughter was born is when he decided

1482
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:05,850
to stop smoking because he realized
that,

1483
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,670
you know,
he had something else to live for that

1484
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,511
he,
you know,

1485
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:14,511
he didn't want to be on some cancer bed.
Fuck Iron Long.

1486
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,710
Having his daughter visit him.
Yeah.

1487
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:17,723
So he quit.

1488
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:18,893
Yeah,

1489
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,130
it was a bummer when you started again.
That's,

1490
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,590
you know,
did he stop going to Jujitsu?

1491
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,770
I don't know.
I,

1492
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,613
it

1493
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,030
here's,
it wasn't as frequent during the end,

1494
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,983
you know,
uh,

1495
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,190
during the last few episodes,
I know we stopped kind of having to find

1496
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,503
gyms.

1497
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,143
Um,

1498
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,000
and we'd offer,
you know,

1499
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:44,210
and be like,
Nah,

1500
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:47,110
I'm cool.
So I think the last couple of shows

1501
01:04:47,111 --> 01:04:48,910
would probably like that for me.
I was like,

1502
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,740
you want to find local gym?

1503
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:52,740
It'd be like,
Nah,

1504
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:53,760
you know,
I'm good man.

1505
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,170
So was it within the last year or so,
or less.

1506
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,120
Less than a year.
So he's the last year or so.

1507
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,980
Yeah.
So that's when the smoking started.

1508
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,610
I guess maybe a little earlier in that.
Yeah,

1509
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,330
that's a bummer.
When you see someone quit and then go

1510
01:05:10,331 --> 01:05:14,230
back on,
that is one of the weirder it is of our

1511
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,064
culture.

1512
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,870
Does he got through.
I mean,

1513
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,300
he got through the really hard part,
you know,

1514
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,440
couple of years under his belt and you
look great man.

1515
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,410
He was,
you know,

1516
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,600
really,
uh,

1517
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,010
he was doing really well.
Now

1518
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,350
where do you go from here?
Where do I go from?

1519
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,660
Oh Shit,
I didn't,

1520
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,480
you know,
um,

1521
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,240
I,
you know,

1522
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,560
Tony Gay I think gave us tremendous
tools to,

1523
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,210
you know,
for how we look at the world and like

1524
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:49,720
how we will continue to go on looking at
the world and um,

1525
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:55,630
I don't know exactly what show I'll do,
but I know it will continue that kind of

1526
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,740
ethos,
you know,

1527
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,970
and I'm like,
you know,

1528
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,930
I feel like I have this very powerful
kind of,

1529
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,433
um,

1530
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,011
no,
like I said,

1531
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:11,850
set of tools now that,
that he kind of handed us and you know,

1532
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:12,923
that,
uh,

1533
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,960
to go on and keep doing this work,
you know,

1534
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:22,470
isn't the problem with this work that
you need someone like him?

1535
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:28,230
He kind of need like either a Rinella
who's a very unique person and in many

1536
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:32,130
ways similar,
not self-destructive at all,

1537
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,160
but really meticulous about his work and
a very good writer as well and his

1538
01:06:39,211 --> 01:06:41,520
narration,
like one of the things that separates

1539
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:46,050
mediator from any other show is that
Steve has this eloquent narration

1540
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,980
exactly that goes to it and it makes you
realize like our perception of what it

1541
01:06:49,981 --> 01:06:53,370
means to be a hunter is based on
stereotypes,

1542
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,660
negative stereotypes that this is the
best example.

1543
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:02,661
This is a really well read,
brilliant man who has a great passion

1544
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:07,500
for the outdoors and for public lands
and for wildlife and for consuming

1545
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:08,970
wildlife in this,
this,

1546
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:15,790
this adventure of pursuing it and eating
it and cooking it and showing you the

1547
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:19,280
art of cooking.
You know,

1548
01:07:19,281 --> 01:07:22,580
the that you,
you wouldn't be able to make meat eater

1549
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,160
with pig.
Man.

1550
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:32,190
I can't even talk about
the apocalypse.

1551
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,501
Yeah,
I mean,

1552
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:34,460
come on.
Well,

1553
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,780
unfortunately I enjoyed that
with,

1554
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:44,110
for all the wrong reasons.
There's justification to joining a pork

1555
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:45,050
lips,
first of all,

1556
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:47,420
because you got Ted nugent with a
machine gun in the helicopter.

1557
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,310
Okay,
and then two,

1558
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:54,580
you have this real wild pig epidemic.
It's a legitimate epidemic in Texas and

1559
01:07:54,921 --> 01:07:57,470
they don't know how to eradicate them.
I guess

1560
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,160
all that,
and I've been putting it on television

1561
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:03,400
on a hunting show.
It's not really hunting,

1562
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:07,720
it's assassinating out of a helicopter
and they're laughing and that it's that

1563
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:09,460
part.
It's the mentality behind it.

1564
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:10,300
The,
you know,

1565
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:11,051
I'm like,
listen,

1566
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:14,140
I'm not saying don't have fun on a hunt.
I've bet a lot of fun on hunts,

1567
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,130
you know,
and a great time on a hunt.

1568
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,830
I don't know.
There's something about,

1569
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,713
you know,
just,

1570
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,140
you know what you're saying.
I know.

1571
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,210
Exactly.
Firing off a thousand rounds,

1572
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:25,620
cackling inside of a helicopter.
Yeah.

1573
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:28,930
Laughing when you see pigs do
somersaults because you had shot at him.

1574
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,280
A helicopter,
you know,

1575
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:35,300
I
think I think is one of the things I

1576
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:36,970
really loved about Steve,
you know,

1577
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:40,610
like,
or love still that I still love about

1578
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:42,080
Steve.
Um,

1579
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:47,180
you know,
a really poignant episode on that show

1580
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:47,580
for me.

1581
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:52,580
It was when we went up to Alaska and
we're hunting black bear and uh,

1582
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:55,730
and he decided not to take a shot,
you know,

1583
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:59,180
I mean,
here's a guy that loves animals as much

1584
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:03,480
as he loves hunting animals as much as
he loves conservation of animals as much

1585
01:09:03,481 --> 01:09:06,920
as he loves the knowledge and the
science behind animals and the natural

1586
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:07,754
world,
you know.

1587
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,640
Um,
that to me was appealing.

1588
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:12,710
Like that's something I can sink my
teeth into,

1589
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,650
dedicate my efforts towards,
you know,

1590
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,350
from working on.
Yeah,

1591
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,560
it was a crazy show,
man.

1592
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:21,410
I mean,
I talked to him about it and his sort of

1593
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,560
idea of why he didn't do it was so
interesting.

1594
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,710
He just kind of went with his feelings.
Yeah,

1595
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,460
exactly.
Yeah.

1596
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,320
To have a hunting show where you have a
bear,

1597
01:09:30,321 --> 01:09:33,410
which is what you're looking for,
lined up in your scope and go,

1598
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,390
I don't want to do it.

1599
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,770
I'm not feeling it in a,
in.

1600
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,050
I loved what he said to at the time.
So he was like,

1601
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,150
I'm not saying I'm never going to shoot
a bear again.

1602
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:46,360
I just don't want to shoot a bear today.
And I'm not gonna and that I,

1603
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,480
that was a big moment,
man.

1604
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:48,090
That's.
Well,

1605
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,790
that's the words coming out of his
mouth.

1606
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:53,810
How conflicted must his perception be to
realize that?

1607
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:55,820
Okay,
I'm filming a show where I'm actively

1608
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:58,670
hunting bears his camera people.
There's a budget behind it.

1609
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:02,480
Now I have to make a show about my
decision to not have to bear and then

1610
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:05,960
next week I'm going to go hunt something
else and then the next week I'm going to

1611
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:07,520
go hudson something else.
Yeah.

1612
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:12,290
But I mean that like his ability to,
to like admit and kind of understand

1613
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:17,240
that the human being is a complex animal
with complex emotions and that,

1614
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,780
you know,
this idea of just kind of uniform

1615
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:24,230
direction of the human mind is like a
total fallacy.

1616
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:26,480
Man.
We're all over the fucking place,

1617
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:27,680
you know?
And like,

1618
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,000
I dunno,
I really bought in at that moment if I

1619
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:34,190
hadn't before,
which I completely kind of had,

1620
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:36,560
but I really bought in at that moment.
I was like,

1621
01:10:36,561 --> 01:10:37,400
whew,
this is,

1622
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,650
this is a guy I can always stand behind.
You know,

1623
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,510
one of my favorite episodes.
Brave.

1624
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,680
It was brave because you realized this
is on the sportsman's network.

1625
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,410
Yeah,
so the sportsmans channel and they have

1626
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,150
only hunting shows.
Oh Man.

1627
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:53,570
And then he's on a hunting show with you
got all these people that are watching

1628
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:58,190
that would kill to be on a hunt like
that and to have a big old bear in their

1629
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:00,260
sites what they want and they're
thinking,

1630
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:03,020
we're going to see Steve shoot this.
Then we're going to see them cook up a

1631
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:08,021
bear rose and he's getting a c stewed
carrots and onions and potatoes and

1632
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:09,580
there's going to be amazing and he's
got,

1633
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,900
I don't want to do it.
And everybody's like,

1634
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:12,800
why?
Yeah.

1635
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,240
And we were like,
we're

1636
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,980
really nervous.
I remember when the episode came out was

1637
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,920
this and when we had done a few things
before,

1638
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:21,780
like we had failed at a hunt.
Like,

1639
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,260
you know,
we had taken shots that missed in the

1640
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:27,870
hunt failed.
We had gone on a mountain lion hunt

1641
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,100
where we never even thought mountain
land.

1642
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,840
Those were all kind of moments where
like,

1643
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:33,120
will this work?
Can we put this out in the hunting

1644
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,580
community?
Will they respond to it in every one of

1645
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:38,700
those had kind of like hit or worked and
I think people actually appreciate it

1646
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:41,040
because of the realism of it,
you know,

1647
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,200
that one was like,
can you,

1648
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:49,280
can you put out a show where there's a
perfectly legitimate shot at a very high

1649
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:53,040
percentage shot at,
uh,

1650
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:57,450
at exactly the animal we're going after
and the choice to not take the shot,

1651
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,730
you know,
how are People gonna Respond?

1652
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,100
Overwhelmingly,
people were like,

1653
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,380
hey man,
I know exactly how you feel.

1654
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:06,840
You know,
it was incredible,

1655
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,910
you know,
it was like,

1656
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:12,390
it was like this moment and I don't mean
to bag on anyone else,

1657
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:14,280
man.
And I don't know that much about hunting

1658
01:12:14,281 --> 01:12:16,470
shows before,
you know,

1659
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,890
I know that a lot of what I saw I found
to be really,

1660
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,740
really either uninteresting or just
fucking stupid,

1661
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,180
you know.
But,

1662
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,850
um,
you know,

1663
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,770
I think that it was like this moment
where like,

1664
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,491
oh my God,
like,

1665
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:30,780
all these,
you know,

1666
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,940
this,
this industry is like,

1667
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:37,560
missed a big,
big part of who the people you know,

1668
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,410
that are paying attention here are,
you know,

1669
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:43,440
um,
you don't have to just go like sell

1670
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:45,030
arrowheads,
you know,

1671
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,490
and uh,
you know,

1672
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,860
and cackle hanging out of a helicopter.

1673
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,790
Yeah,
well that's worst case example,

1674
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:01,360
but for some hunting people that are
like sort of a deeply indoctrinated into

1675
01:13:02,331 --> 01:13:03,950
the world of hunting,
they don't mind that show.

1676
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,370
None of mine.
And he listened and no power,

1677
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,263
more power to them.
I,

1678
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,103
I,
I'm not,

1679
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,780
I'm not trying to tell anyone how to be
or what to like or was

1680
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,100
a lot of guys like Steve.
I mean,

1681
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,840
do you know Donny Vincent?
No.

1682
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,950
Similar guy.
Yeah.

1683
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,060
Similar guy.
Really,

1684
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,810
really smart guy.
And a just great reverence for the

1685
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:23,520
outdoors and for wildlife.
And you know,

1686
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,980
he does everything self filmed and sells
the asco films.

1687
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:29,140
He's smart,
you know,

1688
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,530
he knows,
he knows what he's doing.

1689
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:32,360
Cool man.
But he,

1690
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:33,380
um,
you know,

1691
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:37,340
Steve,
he sort of changed the perception of

1692
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:40,580
hunting for a lot of people that have
become fans of his show the same way

1693
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:43,280
that Tony sort of changed the
perceptions.

1694
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:44,600
Absolutely.
End of cooking.

1695
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,620
Yeah.
Yeah,

1696
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:46,610
absolutely.
I mean,

1697
01:13:46,611 --> 01:13:49,040
I,
I,

1698
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:52,400
you know,
I mean I'm not like terrence malick or

1699
01:13:52,401 --> 01:13:54,820
something,
but like I got a lot to offer and I got

1700
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:56,210
to,
I got a career.

1701
01:13:56,690 --> 01:14:00,260
I'm not gonna I'm not going to dedicate
my career to these people unless I

1702
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:02,660
really,
really believe in what they're doing.

1703
01:14:02,661 --> 01:14:07,580
And like that's,
those are two cases of people really

1704
01:14:07,581 --> 01:14:12,070
believe in man because they were willing
to look at an industry or look at

1705
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:14,290
something that they loved and say like,
well,

1706
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,840
I have a completely different take on
it,

1707
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,200
you know,
and I'm willing to put that out there.

1708
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:22,030
Whatever cost.
And in both cases at work,

1709
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:24,820
because they're both super smart,
you know,

1710
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,200
I'm really capable people,
you know?

1711
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,830
Yeah.
I don't think I've ever met really

1712
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:33,800
anyone more capable than steve and a lot
of ways guy is a,

1713
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,480
he's,
he's kind of a force of nature.

1714
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:37,810
You know,

1715
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,360
he's a very unique person and um,
and uh,

1716
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,400
the,
the amount of stuff that he's able to

1717
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:43,780
get done as well,
you know,

1718
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,140
written a bunch of bugs and constantly
doing these shows and just the

1719
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:53,860
enthusiasm to mean he's not just going
to these places and staying in hotels.

1720
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:57,250
He's sleeping on the ground outside in
these,

1721
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:00,790
you know,
really fucked up places and you know,

1722
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:03,310
about a fog back.
What happened with the bear attack?

1723
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,173
I do.
Yeah.

1724
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,170
Yeah.
Which is just,

1725
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:09,400
if anybody doesn't know,
there's a two part series on the

1726
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:12,520
mediator podcast about a fog,
NAC,

1727
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:17,521
which is an island in Alaska where they
have enormous brown bears and they got

1728
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:22,330
charged and attacked by a fucking 11
foot bear,

1729
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:27,430
which is just so crazy to think of.
And the description of it.

1730
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:31,090
And then they made this podcast right
after the fact.

1731
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,150
So it's fresh in everyone's mind.
It is amazing.

1732
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:35,560
It's amazing.

1733
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,170
So amazing story.
It's also amazing of center.

1734
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:42,030
First time he has been charged and uh,
you know,

1735
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,030
by a number of different animals,
it was run over by a moose.

1736
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,163
Yeah.
You know.

1737
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,400
Yeah.
But I will say that,

1738
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:48,310
I mean,
you get,

1739
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:51,120
Steve also is like physically one of the
toughest people I've ever met.

1740
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,780
I mean,
I watched him set a beaver traps one

1741
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:56,640
time in,
I mean,

1742
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:00,810
breaking ice with his bare fist to set
beaver traps for hours,

1743
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:03,660
you know,
put your hand in that water for put your

1744
01:16:03,661 --> 01:16:06,090
hand in that water for two minutes,
you know,

1745
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,870
just bad.
Someone who does not have trouble,

1746
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,760
you know,
enduring during a lot of physical

1747
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:13,870
discomfort.
And uh,

1748
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,700
and that was what was kind of exciting
about the show too,

1749
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:19,890
is he was really like willing to
integrate that stuff into the

1750
01:16:19,891 --> 01:16:20,880
experience.
You know,

1751
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,710
it wasn't like,
it wasn't like we need to go out,

1752
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:28,860
we need the perfect kill shot,
we need to set this up.

1753
01:16:28,861 --> 01:16:30,480
When you said that,
it was Kinda like,

1754
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,550
well,
we're just going to go out and we're

1755
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:35,730
going to see what happens.
We're going to kind of grit our teeth

1756
01:16:35,731 --> 01:16:38,280
and bear it no matter what,
you know,

1757
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:40,380
the,
where the journey takes us and we're

1758
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:42,800
just going to document that.
Um,

1759
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,860
that was super exciting television to
make at that time too,

1760
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:47,803
is that,
you know,

1761
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,080
I've done five episodes of his show and
we struck out on two of them,

1762
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,070
[inaudible],
you know,

1763
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:58,580
that's a,
it used to be.

1764
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,620
They will never air shows like that.
No,

1765
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:03,340
I don't know that they aired.
I mean,

1766
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,000
I'll probably,
I'm sure a lot of people will be like,

1767
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:06,391
yeah,
dude,

1768
01:17:06,391 --> 01:17:07,230
you don't know what you're talking
about,

1769
01:17:07,231 --> 01:17:11,660
but I'm not sure that they aired a lot
of failed hunts before we started doing

1770
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:13,010
it.
I don't think they did.

1771
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,410
I don't think it was a popular thing and
it might've been done before,

1772
01:17:16,411 --> 01:17:19,800
but not to the extent the way Steve did
one of my favorite episodes.

1773
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,960
He never,
never shot a deer.

1774
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:27,050
It was talking about his dad.
He was brilliant and I think that was

1775
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:28,470
Alaska as well,

1776
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,290
wasn't it?
I don't think it was,

1777
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:32,930
it was.
It wasn't a blacktail hunt,

1778
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:35,200
maybe it wasn't Alaska.
No,

1779
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,580
I feel like it was a cruise deer hunt,
I think.

1780
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,530
And Arizona.

1781
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:44,860
And um,
most of the show was him using a

1782
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,950
spotting scope and binoculars,
looking for deer and talking about his

1783
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:51,860
relationship with his father and there
was no music.

1784
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,470
Whoever edited it and put it together,
it was brilliant.

1785
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:55,304
Yeah.
Perfect.

1786
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,540
Yeah.
Because it was,

1787
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:57,800
you know,
some heavy,

1788
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:01,690
heavy duty shit and it sort of makes you
realize like,

1789
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,590
oh,
this is where you came from.

1790
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:05,180
You came from a hard man.

1791
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,203
Yeah.
Yeah.

1792
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,740
Taskmaster.
Yeah.

1793
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,280
You know,
um,

1794
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:13,720
that was a brilliant episode is also
like,

1795
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,390
I think,
you know,

1796
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,290
one of the things I liked so much about
that episode too is it feels so much

1797
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:21,360
like the process of hunting,
you know,

1798
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:26,030
it's um,
long hours with people really kinda

1799
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,110
getting deep into stuff.
And I,

1800
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,180
you know,
I did an episode with him too.

1801
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:31,500
I,
it hasn't aired yet.

1802
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,320
Um,
but it was a lot of that I lead it like

1803
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,450
just talking about life,
you know.

1804
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:39,780
Yeah.
I really enjoyed that part of Vietnam

1805
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:43,430
with him until a written spending those
long hours just sitting glassing hills,

1806
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,270
like talking about our families and you
know,

1807
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,860
plans for the future.
And,

1808
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:51,720
uh,
it was nice,

1809
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:52,800
man.
I listened.

1810
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:55,620
I feel,
I can't tell you how lucky I feel in my

1811
01:18:55,621 --> 01:18:58,680
career to like landed with these folks,
you know?

1812
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,720
Yeah.
That's a great one too,

1813
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:01,770
right there,
those two,

1814
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,980
those two guys.
Yeah.

1815
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,140
But like we were saying,
it's real hard to find those kind of

1816
01:19:07,141 --> 01:19:09,240
guys.
There's not a lot of those kinds of guys

1817
01:19:09,241 --> 01:19:10,074
out there.

1818
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:12,650
There's not a,
you know,

1819
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:13,900
um,
I think,

1820
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:17,390
you know,
it feels like there's more of what they

1821
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:19,970
call premium content now,
you know,

1822
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:25,120
on tv there's more people looking for
things that have more substance to it.

1823
01:19:25,731 --> 01:19:28,490
But that is.
What do you think has happened?

1824
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,480
What's the shift?
I,

1825
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:30,141
I,
you know,

1826
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,670
I got,
I guess I don't really know.

1827
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:35,450
I think I'm,
I'm not in development so I'm not really

1828
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:36,284
in a,
you know,

1829
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:39,200
a place to say.
But um,

1830
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:44,620
I get the feeling that outlets like
Netflix have really shaken up the,

1831
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:45,950
uh,
the paradigm,

1832
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,050
you know,
I think the Internet in general has

1833
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:53,051
changed people's expectations and,
and uncensored content is so prevalent

1834
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,560
and so much more attractive.
And yes,

1835
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,700
it's,
it's just changed,

1836
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,840
changed the way people absorb things.
Yeah,

1837
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,660
I think that,
you know,

1838
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,760
I think I,
I think,

1839
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,820
you know,
listen,

1840
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,970
Netflix is there,
spent a lot of money.

1841
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:12,090
They've taken a lot of swings,
not all of those swings of Hit,

1842
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:17,390
but they've been pretty brave in terms
of like how much and how would a wide

1843
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,430
range of content they've been willing to
take on.

1844
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,560
And uh,
and so,

1845
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:23,071
uh,
you know,

1846
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:23,670
again,
I,

1847
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:27,080
maybe that's part of what's driving it.
Um,

1848
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:28,260
I know,
um,

1849
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,350
I've been lucky enough to land at,
like I said before,

1850
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:35,550
like zero point zero with Chris and
Lydia there and their ethos of,

1851
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:40,170
you know,
making content that like has a purpose,

1852
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:43,470
you know,
that that works towards bettering,

1853
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,960
you know,
the world or showing people something

1854
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:48,840
about the world or you know,
connecting people.

1855
01:20:48,841 --> 01:20:51,660
And uh,
and that's probably been the greatest

1856
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:52,980
gift.
That's what brought me in a Tony.

1857
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,750
That's what brought me to Steve.
You know,

1858
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,890
there's a connection with them.
So there are people out there that want

1859
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:02,210
to use the medium to.
Yeah,

1860
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,790
they're,
they're idealistic suckers.

1861
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,080
Well,
one of them,

1862
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,900
that's what creates that satisfying art.
I mean,

1863
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:14,870
the stuff that we're talking about you,
you're not going to get that any other

1864
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,330
way.
You have to have those people with that

1865
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,870
deep reverence for the subject that
they're discussing,

1866
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,650
the subject that's being portrayed.

1867
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1868
01:21:22,931 --> 01:21:26,530
And in now again,
more and more we have the outlets to put

1869
01:21:26,531 --> 01:21:28,240
that on the air.
Hey,

1870
01:21:28,241 --> 01:21:30,130
think back to the days when it was three
networks,

1871
01:21:30,131 --> 01:21:31,840
you know,
Tony's never again

1872
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,630
on the air.
Now we'll never going to find out about

1873
01:21:34,631 --> 01:21:35,260
him.
I mean,

1874
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,330
he'll have to stick with being an
author.

1875
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:38,080
Yeah,
exactly.

1876
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:38,913
Yeah.

1877
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,480
Um,
it's,

1878
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,550
it's a lot of ways.
It's the wild west now,

1879
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:43,770
but in a lot of ways that's

1880
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,620
a good thing.
Oh,

1881
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:45,730
it's a good thing.
I mean,

1882
01:21:45,731 --> 01:21:50,731
it's great thing for me.
Nobody would ever giving me a fucking

1883
01:21:50,741 --> 01:21:52,750
show.
It wouldn't have been that crazy.

1884
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:56,020
This kind of show where it go.
So what do you want to do?

1885
01:21:56,021 --> 01:21:59,470
I just want to talk to you was going to
schedule it me,

1886
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,940
what are you going to do on the show?
Whatever format of discussion.

1887
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:06,100
Dope.
But it a lot of ways.

1888
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:08,890
That's what Kinda,
that's what mediator was in the hunting

1889
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:09,800
version,
you know,

1890
01:22:09,801 --> 01:22:12,160
it was like,
what's the concept of the show?

1891
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:13,570
Well,
I'm going to hit the shit that I want to

1892
01:22:13,571 --> 01:22:16,960
hunt when you go to places I want to go
and hang out with the people I want to

1893
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:18,280
hang out with.
Well,

1894
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:19,960
you know,
are you going to shoot animals?

1895
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:21,010
I don't know.
Maybe,

1896
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:23,550
maybe not.
It's something I can't tell you we're

1897
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,423
going to try.

1898
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,700
And uh,
I was,

1899
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,140
man again,
it was great to be able to do that and

1900
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,170
have that freedom.
And I think CNN,

1901
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,004
a lot of ways,
like,

1902
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,070
you know,
when Tony,

1903
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:33,760
that,
that,

1904
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,530
you know,
to have the freedom to be like,

1905
01:22:35,531 --> 01:22:36,730
well,
here's a,

1906
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,260
you know,
60 year old,

1907
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:39,730
you know,
ex heroin addict.

1908
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:43,300
Um,
we're gonna do whatever he wants to do.

1909
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,170
We're going to go wherever in the world
he wants to go and we're just going to

1910
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,940
kind of let him talk right now.
Um,

1911
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,850
well the,
the Seattle one,

1912
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,640
they let them get blasted.
I mean,

1913
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:56,860
he was,
he was smoking weed on camera,

1914
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:00,970
smoking weed through the show,
going and visiting growers and then

1915
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:04,240
going to restaurants high as fuck,
like you could tell he was high and he

1916
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:06,220
was talking about I been smoking all
day,

1917
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,410
talking about being baked with two
people who are growers,

1918
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:13,360
the brother and sister with her of Larry
[inaudible].

1919
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,950
There were a whole.
I know they were laughing with them and

1920
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:19,470
it's like the whole family's involved is
really.

1921
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:22,750
That was a great episode band and it
also,

1922
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,270
fuck God damn.
That episode got me hungry because you

1923
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:27,970
like,
you see all the seafood in Seattle and

1924
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:29,050
all the delicious food.

1925
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,340
I haven't been up there.
No,

1926
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,220
that was a good episode.
Um,

1927
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,870
in those,
those folks were awesome.

1928
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,180
I went out to that place and I filmed
that and it's like they were like,

1929
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:45,670
it was like dream scenario.
I mean that kid.

1930
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:48,490
Like he,
he put together the names.

1931
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:52,810
I'm trying to remember it.
It'll look just to give them a shout out

1932
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,490
Seattle episode.
I'm growers.

1933
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,830
It'll come up African American family.
But um,

1934
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,190
they were awesome.
They were awesome.

1935
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:04,240
And like,
you know,

1936
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:07,030
that was all that kid he had put
together a pdf,

1937
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,300
showed his family and they were like,
cool,

1938
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:12,970
let's sync everything into it.
And they did and I went out to their

1939
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:15,790
place and they were just sitting back
laughing,

1940
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,940
you know,
like counting stacks,

1941
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:20,200
some money,
you know,

1942
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,770
and all smoking joints,
you know,

1943
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:28,130
grandma's there smoking a huge doobie.
She was like quality control testing

1944
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,050
these kids working for them and stuff
like,

1945
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,550
you know,
rolling joints and they can oil and,

1946
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,130
and it was just like,
it was like good for you guys,

1947
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,030
you know,
like,

1948
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,913
like way to go.

1949
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,460
Isn't that the way of like kind of
American entrepreneurship is supposed to

1950
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:48,280
work well,
it's just rare that something comes

1951
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:49,510
along.
This is controversial,

1952
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:53,140
but yet also lucrative has marijuana
sales and then all of a sudden it's

1953
01:24:53,141 --> 01:24:54,760
legal in the state.
Totally.

1954
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:55,610
And you're like,
oh,

1955
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:57,970
okay,
well we could just do this.

1956
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1957
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,260
I'll tell you what's funny.
The controversial part of that episode

1958
01:25:02,261 --> 01:25:05,080
was not Tony Smoking because that's
legal.

1959
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:10,090
It's perfectly fine for him to smoke.
It was when he handed the joint to me

1960
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,270
over the camera.
That one was a little.

1961
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,920
I think that was a little tough for some
folks to swallow as well because.

1962
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,960
Because I'm working,
you know,

1963
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:21,250
but he's working too.
Yeah.

1964
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,170
Well,
Geez,

1965
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:24,460
you know,
I never thought of it that way.

1966
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,170
I guess he was working.
Yeah,

1967
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,700
he's worked
with,

1968
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:33,190
I guess is the idea that you're holding
machinery the Hollingsworth.

1969
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:36,360
That's right.
Shout out to the Hollingsworth's

1970
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,480
Hollingsworth farm.
Hollingsworth far.

1971
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,493
Yeah,
they are.

1972
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:41,890
Yeah.
Why was it,

1973
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,190
I guess because maybe they're thinking
you're holding a machine that's real

1974
01:25:45,191 --> 01:25:48,070
expensive gas man or the.
I think they,

1975
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:49,780
you know,
they didn't want the perception that we

1976
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:52,510
were just partying and out of control in
the field and we,

1977
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:54,250
and we weren't man,
you know,

1978
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:55,870
we're like,
we're professionals.

1979
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:57,460
So did CNN have a problem with it?

1980
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,960
I think maybe there were elements at
CNN.

1981
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:04,100
Someone might've had,
someone must have chimed in,

1982
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:05,120
but in the end,
again,

1983
01:26:05,121 --> 01:26:06,900
to their credit,
in the end I left,

1984
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,360
you know,
they left us alone.

1985
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,213
Like,
you know,

1986
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,150
that's the only way would make a good
show.

1987
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,770
Yeah.
As soon as I was fucking cook,

1988
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:16,550
start coming into the kitchen and still
and wanting to add ingredients.

1989
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,980
Yeah,
but that's the whole industry.

1990
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,360
I know.
That's the process on believable.

1991
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,150
Again.
That's why this was so refreshing.

1992
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,240
You know,
how rare is it not to get,

1993
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,040
not to have people just breathing down
your neck.

1994
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:32,150
All the ton of.
Same thing with mediator because Steven

1995
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:36,050
Rinella came from the wild within,
which was a show that that's where I met

1996
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:38,360
him.
I met him from that show and I had him

1997
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:42,020
on my podcast,
but that show was a fucking goat rope.

1998
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:45,410
He was telling me that they were trying
to let animals loose out of cages and

1999
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:47,830
then he would shoot them.
Those were the early days when they're

2000
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:49,160
like.
Then when they were like,

2001
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,220
there were line items in for like animal
wrangler and like,

2002
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:54,320
but you know,
to everyone's credit and like very

2003
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:56,660
quickly at zero point zero.
I'm very quickly with Steve,

2004
01:26:56,661 --> 01:26:57,620
there were like,
dude,

2005
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:59,270
we don't do that.
Like we're not doing that.

2006
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:03,300
But it's hilarious at a producer
actually came up with that idea like,

2007
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,490
oh,
I know how to do this.

2008
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,250
Producer didn't know it sounded like a
producer came up with that idea.

2009
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:12,020
That was just a playbook on how you make
tv just pulling from the playbook for

2010
01:27:12,021 --> 01:27:12,771
sure.
You know,

2011
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:14,720
I mean air quotes,
TV.

2012
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:15,710
Yeah,
exactly.

2013
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:17,420
You know,
bad show.

2014
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:18,650
I mean,
listen,

2015
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,960
there's,
there's a lot of huge mistakes in that

2016
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:22,370
show and a lot of bullshit.

2017
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,410
Um,
though it was,

2018
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:29,000
I thought it was a pretty revolutionary
in a pretty interesting show in a lot of

2019
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:30,040
ways.
Um,

2020
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,750
there's a lot of truth in there too,
you know,

2021
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:36,290
we did end up going out and just like
going on hunts,

2022
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,020
you know,
this is a very high pressure situation,

2023
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,370
you know,
but also like this is very typical of

2024
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:46,760
kind of like the,
I think the way that television works,

2025
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,830
there's like still as we're out in the
field,

2026
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:53,510
there's still at the network a lot of
kind of infighting and jostling about

2027
01:27:53,511 --> 01:27:55,860
what the show actually was.
Is this a,

2028
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:58,370
is this history,
is this,

2029
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,290
you know,
reality?

2030
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,690
Is this subsistence?
Yeah.

2031
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:04,940
You know,
I remember at one point someone saying

2032
01:28:04,941 --> 01:28:05,631
something like,
well,

2033
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:07,040
it's not a hunting show,
you know,

2034
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:10,340
and we're like,
I'm like in the field covered in fucking

2035
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:11,710
moose blood,
you know,

2036
01:28:11,711 --> 01:28:13,290
and I'm like,
well,

2037
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,290
it looks like a hunting show from where
I'm standing,

2038
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:16,050
you know,
like,

2039
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,060
I don't know what to say.

2040
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:19,640
What does that mean?
You're saying it's not a hunting show?

2041
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:20,990
Yeah,
I think that there's,

2042
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:23,750
you know,
I don't remember who that was,

2043
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:28,120
but I think that they were very leery of
this idea of like a hunting show.

2044
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:31,550
What was the subsistence shows that they
have?

2045
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,990
They're all hunting and gathering.
I mean that is like one of the more

2046
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,030
popular shows on all of these cable
channels where these,

2047
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:42,050
these people that live in Alaska and
they're trapping now.

2048
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:42,741
It is,
shoot.

2049
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:43,461
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2050
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:44,830
It wasn't then.
I know it's crazy.

2051
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:47,570
I mean not John,
we're really exploded after that.

2052
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,010
Yeah.
And I think there's something very

2053
01:28:49,011 --> 01:28:49,880
different,
you know,

2054
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:51,680
when you take like a,
you know,

2055
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:53,480
when you take like,
I don't know,

2056
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:57,710
for some reason when you take Steve,
the New York City intellectual and you

2057
01:28:57,711 --> 01:29:00,050
put them in that environment,
I think there was a different reaction

2058
01:29:00,051 --> 01:29:01,260
then like,
oh,

2059
01:29:01,261 --> 01:29:02,010
these people live

2060
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,720
in Alaska.
It's like watching pygmies hunt,

2061
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,360
you know,
there are these certain days,

2062
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,740
this is the natural environment of,
you know,

2063
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:11,250
and that's what they do.
And so hunting is acceptable under those

2064
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:12,270
conditions.
You know,

2065
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:15,000
it's like,
why isn't it acceptable for someone who

2066
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:18,750
like lives it as like a base philosophy
in their life.

2067
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:22,030
Give them a chance to explain why,
you know.

2068
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,480
But he lives in Brooklyn.
Why would you ever hunt,

2069
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,740
you know,
you live in Brooklyn,

2070
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:28,200
just go to the shopping center.

2071
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:29,250
Well,
yeah.

2072
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,080
Well you must be,
there must be something wrong with you

2073
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:31,914
if you enjoy it.

2074
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,930
Right,
exactly.

2075
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:35,510
And I think that's,
I think that's part of the mentality.

2076
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:36,560
Well,
Tony Address

2077
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:37,790
on the show too,
you know,

2078
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:41,040
I remember one of the first times tony
shot a deer on the show and then they

2079
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,140
cooked it at that same guys restaurant.
Yep,

2080
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:47,160
exactly what?
Marco Pierre White at his restaurant and

2081
01:29:47,161 --> 01:29:50,280
they shot a deer and Marco put the blood
on Tony's head.

2082
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,241
Yeah,
exactly.

2083
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:52,890
It's supposed to do and you get your
first kill.

2084
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,550
And then um,
they went and cooked it and it was a,

2085
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:58,590
there was a lot of that,
there was,

2086
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:03,540
there was one time where he shot a pig
at point blank range with a pistol and I

2087
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:04,111
was like,
wow,

2088
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:05,550
they put that on TV.
It was a big.

2089
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:08,550
That was a big moment for him.
He tell you talked about that a lot.

2090
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,630
Yeah.
So,

2091
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:11,430
well,
I mean,

2092
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,710
uh,
he um,

2093
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,120
that was Cajun country,
right?

2094
01:30:15,121 --> 01:30:16,840
Yeah.
And um,

2095
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:21,210
I think that,
I think he,

2096
01:30:21,211 --> 01:30:23,460
I think the story goes that he liked,
he goes,

2097
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:27,150
they asked him to kill the pig and he
goes up and like just very,

2098
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,390
very coldly double taps the pig in the
head.

2099
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:35,340
And I think that he says there's just
this moment of silence amongst the

2100
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:36,174
crowd,
like,

2101
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:39,000
oh Geez man,
was that,

2102
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:42,570
that was cold dude.
What do they expect?

2103
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,030
I don't know.
But he was like,

2104
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:48,060
he,
he would talk about it as if like a gasp

2105
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:50,260
came up from the crowd was like,
Geez,

2106
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:51,360
wow.
You know,

2107
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,650
the Donald,
you know,

2108
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:56,460
like was like a mob hit or something.
Yeah.

2109
01:30:56,490 --> 01:31:00,420
I think one is enough for a pig blank
range.

2110
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,070
I've seen animals shot in the head
though.

2111
01:31:02,071 --> 01:31:05,420
That could have used another one.
Really?

2112
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:07,980
Yeah.
That's why I think especially with Jesus

2113
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,730
I've seen,
I've seen a couple of pigs go real ugly.

2114
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:16,680
So double tap is totally acceptable to
me because when a pig goes bad,

2115
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,400
it's really not pleasant for anyone,
man.

2116
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,620
Yeah.
Well it's also,

2117
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,590
you don't want an animal ever to suffer
if you.

2118
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:28,140
Exactly see it's still alive,
but another one in it.

2119
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,610
That's always.
Yeah.

2120
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,440
Bow Hunting,
rifle hunting.

2121
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,900
If it's still standing,
put another one in it.

2122
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

2123
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,320
Or suffering in any way.
I mean,

2124
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,190
I think that's,
you know,

2125
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,083
um,

2126
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,140
you know,
that's like kind of a responsibility you

2127
01:31:42,141 --> 01:31:44,390
take on yourself when you decide to
hunt.

2128
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,940
For me,
um,

2129
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,800
when I made that decision and I've been
on two hunts now with Steve,

2130
01:31:51,801 --> 01:31:55,130
I've shot two deer.
That was like a very clear kind of

2131
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,660
aspect of it,
you know,

2132
01:31:56,661 --> 01:31:57,081
it was like,
well,

2133
01:31:57,081 --> 01:32:01,030
I'm taking responsibility now,
not only like this animal's life,

2134
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:06,031
but for this animal's pain and suffering
and the consequences of my actions,

2135
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,700
you know,
so I'm not going to be lobbing off any

2136
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:11,670
750 yard,
you know,

2137
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,830
rifle shots because I'm not qualified to
do that.

2138
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:19,840
And it's irresponsible to the animal and
the potential suffering that you can

2139
01:32:19,841 --> 01:32:21,460
cause,
you know,

2140
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,610
um,
or losing the animal or you know,

2141
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,210
so,
um,

2142
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,450
you know,
and I don't know,

2143
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:30,840
I guess that all comes from Steve
Really,

2144
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:31,823
you know,

2145
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:34,880
at least he's got such strong ethics.
Yeah,

2146
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:36,400
exactly.
Yeah.

2147
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:39,550
I mean it became really clear,
uh,

2148
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,290
with me just knowing him that this guy
is a,

2149
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:43,490
he's got a,
like a very,

2150
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,920
very powerful moral compass.
Yeah.

2151
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:49,250
Core set of beliefs that are just non
negotiable.

2152
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:50,480
Again,
both of them.

2153
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,280
Tony and Steve,
I mean Tony,

2154
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:57,060
his moral compass is rock solid as well,
you know,

2155
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,540
um,
any mistakes that he may have made in

2156
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:04,020
his life,
I can honestly say he made them with his

2157
01:33:04,021 --> 01:33:07,200
heart.
He made him with his moral compass in

2158
01:33:07,201 --> 01:33:11,190
mind and making his best attempt to,
to follow that,

2159
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,140
you know,
um,

2160
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:14,070
and again,
that,

2161
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:16,160
you know,
that was something that was,

2162
01:33:16,161 --> 01:33:19,190
it was really nice to be around a
refreshing of urine,

2163
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,040
you know,

2164
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,040
Brian especially in this world of people
with gimmicks trying to become more

2165
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:30,150
popular and more well known.
And he had put zero effort into that.

2166
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,200
Yeah,
I mean,

2167
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,810
just the basic philosophy of the show.
We're not going to fake anything.

2168
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,050
We're not going to do second takes.
We're not gonna know what the one where

2169
01:33:37,051 --> 01:33:40,950
they were thrown frozen octopus.
So this is like a really famous story,

2170
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:42,690
right?
The Sicily episode.

2171
01:33:42,691 --> 01:33:44,980
Yeah.
And he describes that is like the,

2172
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,520
maybe the darkest existential moment of
his life,

2173
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:48,900
you know,
it was like,

2174
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:51,780
who is throwing the fake octa?
The frozen side kicks,

2175
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:56,370
so they set up these sidekicks who were
like the guy who was running the fishing

2176
01:33:56,371 --> 01:33:59,460
operation will,
I guess they were the psychics and the

2177
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:01,890
scene that we're gonna work with Tony.
Right.

2178
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:06,090
So the way you'd set a scene up normally
like that is you'd have like a psychic,

2179
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:07,590
someone who's going to talk to Tony and
be like,

2180
01:34:07,591 --> 01:34:08,640
Hey,
what are we going to do?

2181
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:09,451
Oh,
we're going to go out.

2182
01:34:09,451 --> 01:34:13,840
And the sidekick would be a local,
like a local or

2183
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:16,150
an expert in something or you know,
a fisherman.

2184
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,030
Probably in this case,
I wasn't on that trust.

2185
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,190
I don't know exactly.
But um,

2186
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:21,631
you know,
and you'd be like,

2187
01:34:21,631 --> 01:34:22,520
oh,
we're going to go walk to us.

2188
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,230
Do you know someone who fishes octopus?
Oh yeah,

2189
01:34:25,231 --> 01:34:27,420
I know so and so,
and we'll go out with them.

2190
01:34:27,421 --> 01:34:28,140
Right.
So,

2191
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:32,760
but it turned out that they went to like
this very crowded beach,

2192
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:34,970
you know,
and I think even in the scene,

2193
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:39,580
can we really catch activists?
They're just like people swimming or a

2194
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,530
kids with like a snorkel masks,
you know,

2195
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:42,761
and like,
yeah,

2196
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:43,151
yeah,
yeah.

2197
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:44,640
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

2198
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,680
He got in the water and he starts
hearing these plops.

2199
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,590
It looks above him.
And is these dead octopus,

2200
01:34:50,591 --> 01:34:53,740
like floating,
drifting down to the bottom of the

2201
01:34:53,741 --> 01:34:56,470
ocean.
They're lobbing them in off the boat and

2202
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:59,060
then picking them up as of late.
I got an octopus,

2203
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:00,620
a got one,
you know,

2204
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,540
but I,
I think again,

2205
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:07,541
like most TV shows that do exactly that,
you know like where's the octopus

2206
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:12,470
wrangler and for Tony,
like that was always completely

2207
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:16,700
unacceptable way to make tv.
So he had no idea it was going to happen

2208
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:18,030
before it started happening.
No,

2209
01:35:18,031 --> 01:35:19,370
no.
I started happening.

2210
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,930
What did he say?
He,

2211
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,890
he left and went to the beach in order
to like get like seven Negroni's in a

2212
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:25,580
row.

2213
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:29,840
He was really bummed out about it.
I saw him two weeks later in Tokyo and

2214
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:32,090
he was still talking about it because
like I just,

2215
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,590
I just had the worst experience of my
life.

2216
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:36,620
Worst thing that ever happened to me,
the darkest moment of my life,

2217
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,230
the darkest moment of throwing frozen
octopuses to the water,

2218
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:46,100
completely went against the whole ethos
of the show,

2219
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,570
but he made fun of it on the shelf.
Listen,

2220
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,140
honestly,
it's a great scene.

2221
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,600
It's a great.
It's a great scene.

2222
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:57,690
It largely because Sally Freeman,
the producer of that is like absolutely

2223
01:35:58,281 --> 01:36:01,430
brilliant and one of the best directors
has ever come through that show.

2224
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:06,290
So yeah,
it was funny to take on realizing that

2225
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:08,450
they were throwing frozen octopus into
the water.

2226
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:12,500
Exactly.
Like how mortified he was bi at all.

2227
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:13,490
Yeah,
totally.

2228
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:16,010
But I mean I bet that again,
like that's,

2229
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,760
that's the way it was,
you know,

2230
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:19,970
like we didn't go in and like be like,
okay,

2231
01:36:19,971 --> 01:36:21,140
action and now cut.

2232
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,670
Okay,
now we're going to move the cameras and

2233
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:23,900
say that again.
You know,

2234
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:26,150
there's none of that man.
You.

2235
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:28,700
I mean,
part of the hustle of the show was like

2236
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,890
being there with the camera.
Yeah.

2237
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,810
You set up the scene and then you press
play and you let it go.

2238
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:36,620
And what happens happens.
And I'm sorry if you don't get exactly

2239
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:38,300
what you hoped out of it,
you know,

2240
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:40,160
but we're not going to interrupt the
world.

2241
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:42,080
We're not going to manipulate and
control things.

2242
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:47,120
That is the difference between really
good reality TV in the word reality TV

2243
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:49,280
is so weird.
Like what does that even mean?

2244
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:52,310
Because a lot of these shows are
scripted.

2245
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,120
Yeah.
They have these loose scenarios and then

2246
01:36:56,121 --> 01:36:58,910
they go in a script them and they redo
things.

2247
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:00,710
The reshoot things.
It's not reality.

2248
01:37:00,711 --> 01:37:05,711
It's like shitty acting with people that
are not trained and they're edited with,

2249
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,240
uh,
people talk in front of the camera.

2250
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,290
Like I didn't know what Mo was thinking.
I was crazy.

2251
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,850
And they got you.
Was like,

2252
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:17,160
I told Joe What we're going to do.
No advanced,

2253
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,620
no shit.
And then it's like conflict,

2254
01:37:20,621 --> 01:37:21,830
like the Kardashians.
I mean,

2255
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:26,390
if they've got it down to a science,
a science of more ronic television

2256
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:27,180
viewing,
right?

2257
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:28,430
Greg,
if you could just sit there,

2258
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:29,270
slack,
jawed,

2259
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,430
uh,
they'll keep you locked in,

2260
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:33,520
they'll keep you locked in the Ed.
They're good at it,

2261
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,720
edits,
they'll show you their tits and boom,

2262
01:37:35,721 --> 01:37:37,660
you cut to commercial in there.
Right.

2263
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:42,920
That's reality TV with what you guys
were doing is more documentary

2264
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:44,030
television.
Yeah,

2265
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:46,040
it is.
And it's not saying that.

2266
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,360
It's not saying that there's no aspect
of,

2267
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:51,080
of the convention of television there,
of course their ears.

2268
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,210
But we used to say like,
you know,

2269
01:37:53,211 --> 01:37:56,400
like Vietnam doesn't look like that,
but Vietnam

2270
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,590
doesn't not look like that,
you know,

2271
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,770
there is a,
there is a refinement in a manipulation

2272
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:04,920
in what we're doing because we're
choosing these locations are choosing to

2273
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:07,260
talk to this person.
We're choosing to shoot it in a certain

2274
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:08,250
way.
That's beautiful.

2275
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:10,050
Where adding light,
you know,

2276
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:13,200
it's not exactly the way reality is,
but there's a threshold,

2277
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,700
there's a line which you don't cross.
And that line is,

2278
01:38:16,701 --> 01:38:21,390
is it a morally and ethically
established line by Tony and by the crew

2279
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:26,040
that says like there's,
there's a place at which it becomes

2280
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:29,430
unfair.
The manipulation of reality becomes a

2281
01:38:29,431 --> 01:38:31,060
manipulation.
Um,

2282
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,140
that is now become unfair to the people
who are viewing this.

2283
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,150
The people who are there,
you know,

2284
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:37,140
we're,
we're,

2285
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:39,290
we've become selfserving,
you know,

2286
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:42,180
and that's the line that we chose never
to cross.

2287
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:44,310
You know,
we can make it beautiful,

2288
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:46,280
we can refine it down,
you know,

2289
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:49,170
we can edit it,
we can make a compelling show,

2290
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,380
but it has to,
it has to exist within,

2291
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:56,070
under this,
within this certain threshold or else,

2292
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:59,250
you know,
what the fuck are we doing know it must

2293
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:04,080
be a small percentage of people in the
business that have that ethic incredibly

2294
01:39:04,081 --> 01:39:07,320
small and it's incredibly powerful to
have people.

2295
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:10,710
I'm backing you that believe in that
and,

2296
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,420
and super rare.
I mean,

2297
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,760
you know,
we talk about in the film industry

2298
01:39:14,761 --> 01:39:17,910
today,
how rare it is to have true artur final

2299
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:19,380
cut directors,
you know,

2300
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:21,180
left.
There's only a handful of them,

2301
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:24,420
you know,
largely the studios have taken over that

2302
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:27,690
control will equally in the television
industry.

2303
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:30,870
It's,
it's that rare to have people that have

2304
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:34,950
the kind of power and control to have
the luxury of saying,

2305
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,180
you know,
hey listen,

2306
01:39:36,181 --> 01:39:38,640
I have guidelines here and we're not
going to cross them.

2307
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:39,751
You know,
and,

2308
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:42,090
and have people be like,
great,

2309
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,613
go,
go,

2310
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:44,940
go make it,
you know,

2311
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:47,100
and we were able to do that.
Yeah.

2312
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:50,230
It seems like netflix would be a really
good place for something like that.

2313
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:53,310
Seems like Netflix will be a really good
place for a lot of things.

2314
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:58,170
It seems like that's the,
that's the best place for like real

2315
01:39:58,171 --> 01:39:59,004
freedom.

2316
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,800
Yeah.
Well I know how much is real fried when

2317
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:04,920
they're giving you money.
Anytime someone's given you money,

2318
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:07,430
there's always like,
you got to get the real way to deal.

2319
01:40:07,431 --> 01:40:12,120
It'd be like to produce it yourself,
but in the end is CNN was the best place

2320
01:40:12,121 --> 01:40:13,170
to do that,
you know,

2321
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:17,240
and they really did back us up and they
really backed up Tony and that

2322
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:20,850
philosophy and they completely
implicitly understood what we were

2323
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:23,300
talking about when we said,
well we can't do that now.

2324
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,110
It was jeff soccer.
Was it his idea?

2325
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,581
You know,
again,

2326
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:30,630
I don't know how the deal came about.
I assume so because I think it came,

2327
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,270
it came in just after that transfer of
power.

2328
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:35,880
So did they,
did he have other places where he's

2329
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:37,100
thinking about taking it?
Started?

2330
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:38,700
CNN again?
I don't know man.

2331
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:39,950
I don't know.
I mean,

2332
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,090
you know,
it was a really successful show in its

2333
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:44,100
own right at that point.
So I'm sure it would have gone

2334
01:40:44,101 --> 01:40:46,230
somewhere,
but that was,

2335
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:52,100
I assume it was Jeff Zucker who brought
it in and that was like such a brilliant

2336
01:40:52,261 --> 01:40:53,740
moves,
like a perfect marriage,

2337
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:55,540
you know?
Perfect marriage,

2338
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,360
the perfect move for CNN,
like perfect move for us.

2339
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:59,670
Yeah.
I thought it was interesting when they

2340
01:40:59,671 --> 01:41:03,270
were taking a chance on these unscripted
television shows.

2341
01:41:03,271 --> 01:41:05,650
These,
these non news show.

2342
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:05,880
Yeah.

2343
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,380
Have,
you've seen the united shades of

2344
01:41:07,381 --> 01:41:10,780
America?
He's all bell and he's great.

2345
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,630
He's the best.
He's a super,

2346
01:41:12,631 --> 01:41:13,740
super nice guy.
Yeah.

2347
01:41:13,741 --> 01:41:16,410
I did an episode with him in Kenya with
Tony,

2348
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:18,360
um,
which will be the premier of this

2349
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:19,520
upcoming season.
Oh,

2350
01:41:19,521 --> 01:41:20,354
okay.
You know,

2351
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:23,190
so how many episodes have you guys done
that haven't aired yet?

2352
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,070
Well,
I think we'll have seven in this next

2353
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:31,170
season.
That's the only one,

2354
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,320
um,
of those seven that was actually

2355
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:37,350
completed with Tony's narration
narration,

2356
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:42,620
the rest of them are uncomplete and in
that respect,

2357
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:45,690
and again,
we've been kind of fighting through

2358
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:48,300
editing those over the last few months
and,

2359
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:51,540
and trying to figure out ways to,
you know,

2360
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:54,870
to do this without completely gutting,
you know,

2361
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,420
the,
the method of making this show.

2362
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:59,960
So wow.
Um,

2363
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:01,970
and then there's a couple of specials in
there like,

2364
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,530
you know,
talking to the crew and stuff like that,

2365
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:07,860
you know,
so it's going to be a pretty profound

2366
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:09,403
see isn't.

2367
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:14,000
So um,
once you're done with that,

2368
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:17,360
you just start looking at new projects
and different things to do.

2369
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:18,194
And I have

2370
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:22,320
couple like assignments already,
some projects I'm like pretty excited

2371
01:42:22,321 --> 01:42:23,490
about,
you know,

2372
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:24,920
um,
I just don't know that they've

2373
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,580
officially been announced yet.
So,

2374
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:28,080
uh,
you know,

2375
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,390
but there's good stuff out there and
there's,

2376
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,000
you know,
it.

2377
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:37,100
One Nice thing in all of this incredibly
difficult time has a lot of people have

2378
01:42:39,421 --> 01:42:41,980
come to us and said like,
listen,

2379
01:42:41,981 --> 01:42:44,340
when we wrote,
we always believed in what you guys did

2380
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,450
and we'd like you to continue doing it.
And here's a project we have the we

2381
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:49,860
think,
you know,

2382
01:42:49,861 --> 01:42:54,210
so hopefully we can continue to make
things in the same kind of,

2383
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,950
you know,
it looks like we can.

2384
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,270
Well,
it seems like

2385
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:02,320
the success of the show and then the
infectuous enthusiasm that Tony had and

2386
01:43:05,031 --> 01:43:06,020
that,
you know,

2387
01:43:06,021 --> 01:43:09,560
so many people are fans of the show had
for that style of television.

2388
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:12,980
It's just gonna lead to more,
more people taking more chances and

2389
01:43:12,981 --> 01:43:14,060
doing things like that.

2390
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:15,650
I hope so.
You know?

2391
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:17,240
Um,
I think so.

2392
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:19,340
I think it's getting better,
you know,

2393
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:23,390
um,
there will never be another Tony you

2394
01:43:23,391 --> 01:43:25,100
won't find that,
you know,

2395
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:30,470
and I think that's something that
people will have to be aware of going

2396
01:43:30,471 --> 01:43:32,030
forward.
You're not going to copy that,

2397
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:35,020
right?
He's Tony and that's what you saw,

2398
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:37,850
Gordon Ramsey,
they announced some show with him

2399
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:40,700
traveling and people immediately just
start shitting all over him.

2400
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,100
Yeah,
but he's really from everything I

2401
01:43:43,101 --> 01:43:43,671
understand.
It was like,

2402
01:43:43,671 --> 01:43:47,840
just like a really good guy.
You know what the problem is?

2403
01:43:47,841 --> 01:43:50,510
The way you phrase himself on the show,
the kitchen nightmares.

2404
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,100
She turns in like an asshole

2405
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,990
and yells at people that are intimidated
by him and that's his shtick,

2406
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,450
honestly.
Just this,

2407
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:57,820
this TV shtick.
Yeah.

2408
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,170
As far as I know.
I don't know.

2409
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:02,720
Yeah,
it seemed like a real nice guy.

2410
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:04,220
Yeah.
I might Guy Fieri too.

2411
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:07,940
He was nice guy.
Just got crazy.

2412
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,390
You know,
Guy Fieri relentlessly shit out.

2413
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:15,050
I'm
constantly Jews.

2414
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:18,690
But he shits on everybody.
Did he show up Martha Raye to.

2415
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,630
I don't know.
Yeah,

2416
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:23,310
maybe.
I think maybe right?

2417
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:24,643
Uh,
he would,

2418
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:27,540
he would pull that trigger all the time.
Dude.

2419
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:29,570
He would always make fun of his
Lamborghini and I'm like,

2420
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:33,270
I'm Kinda like a Lamborghini,
like what are you talking about?

2421
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,180
One of those things you're not supposed
to have,

2422
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,520
right?
Like you could have some cool cars like

2423
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,130
our member when he did the show with the
Queens of the Stone Age,

2424
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:44,350
Josh home and uh,
one of the guys had a 69 Camaro shot.

2425
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,090
That was a bad car.
Yeah.

2426
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:51,110
But that's an okay to have bad ass car
because it's a classic because it's got

2427
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,780
style points.
Totally.

2428
01:44:53,781 --> 01:44:56,690
But I would suggest to Tony that he
might want to pick up the Lamborghini

2429
01:44:56,691 --> 01:45:01,691
because the traction control
a big problems and big problems when the

2430
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:04,330
Camaro.
No,

2431
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:08,270
I'm sure as most people would have to
learn how to drive one of those.

2432
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,920
That was hot rod,
man.

2433
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:12,310
The thing was sick.
Okay.

2434
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:15,020
But listen brother,
I'm glad we did this.

2435
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:18,260
We reached out.
We decided to get together and talk,

2436
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,300
give a lot of people insight to what it
was like to work with one of my heroes.

2437
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:24,283
Yeah,
me too.

2438
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:27,080
Alright.
Definitely my hero.

2439
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:28,940
All right.
Thanks brother.

2440
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:29,511
Thanks.
Appreciate it,

2441
01:45:29,511 --> 01:45:30,330
man.
Thank you.
