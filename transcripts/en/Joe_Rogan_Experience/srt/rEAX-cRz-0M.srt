1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,830
I was,

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,950
I was 22,

4
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:05,670
and I,

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,870
my wife left me,

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,280
I moved to Boise just cause it sounded
funny because I was still in that fraud

7
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,170
telemarketing so I could do it anywhere.

8
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,010
There's a phone,

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,400
right.

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm in business.

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,991
And then,

12
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:16,680
uh,

13
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,000
after we moved to Boise and immediately
my wife left me for my best friend.

14
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,170
We all moved out there together and
then my other buddy that moved with us

15
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,400
couldn't handle the stress,

16
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,230
so he went back to Vegas.

17
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,830
So I'm,

18
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,281
oh,

19
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,430
it was all my shit to Boise
and within two weeks I'm alone.

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,410
So I moved up to this fucking,

21
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,450
I bought a cabin like a

22
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,840
for sale by owner.

23
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,674
Like,

24
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,060
like I didn't get a loan.

25
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:42,630
I was like,

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,710
I'm just going to give you,

27
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,840
what did he,

28
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,673
what do you call it?

29
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,553
We're

30
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,340
just signed a contract and I'll pay you,

31
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:55,341
I didn't go through a bank owner financed
owner finance and a little cabin,

32
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,580
two bars in town and you are either a
long branch guy or you're the dirty shame

33
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:02,820
guy.

34
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,800
And I was a dirty shame saloon guy and
I would drive back and forth cause in a

35
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,801
small town they open around noon
but not necessarily at noon.

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,980
And how old were you then?

37
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,630
22 that's hilarious.

38
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,070
No fucking chicks there.

39
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,100
So you were would drive back and forth
in front of the bar until Jolene showed

40
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:22,951
up to open.

41
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,570
So if it's 1215,

42
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:28,720
I've been just driving back and forth
waiting for it to open and I would uh,

43
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,230
I lasted like six months and then I had
to ditch out on the fucking there by his

44
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,380
owner financing.

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:34,921
Yeah.

46
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:39,540
At one point my buddy that moved back
to Vegas came up and he was there for a

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,810
couple months,

48
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,520
but we'd get on the phone just
enough to pay our bar tab.

49
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,061
In fact,

50
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:45,894
my bar tab,

51
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,450
I traded out like furniture when I,

52
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,381
when I bailed,

53
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,381
six months later I traded Jolene like my
furniture in the cabin for my bar tab.

54
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,940
And yeah,

55
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,960
this is fucking crazy.

56
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:01,200
So you could set your own
hours when you're doing that
scam telemarketing stuff.

57
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,560
He just did it whenever you want it to.

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,490
And they just got like you clocked in,

59
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,101
he got pay?

60
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:06,301
No,

61
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,190
I was doing it out of my cabin.

62
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,960
This was just pick up the phone.

63
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,480
I had leads I stole from Vegas.

64
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,314
And,

65
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,701
and what did you do?

66
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,600
Like how did that work?

67
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,610
I'd call up businesses and the dad the
pitch and you won one of these awards and

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,590
you just have to buy this many,

69
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,090
you know,

70
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,410
it was a pens like ad copy,

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,370
ad specs,

72
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,110
advertising specialties,

73
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:29,390
this mug with a,

74
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,530
hey Joe,

75
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,230
uh,

76
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,530
uh,

77
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,750
you won a big award and I'm going to,

78
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,920
all you have to do is make a small
purchase of these mugs with your business

79
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,754
name on them,

80
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,260
the Joe Rogan podcast,

81
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,060
and you're guaranteed
to win this big award.

82
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:42,790
That's worth way,

83
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,623
boy.

84
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,731
Wow.

85
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,320
So it was just a total scam.

86
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,220
Yeah.

87
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,053
Wow.

88
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,730
But cleverly phrased,

89
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,880
so to stay in that gray area of legal,

90
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,020
right,

91
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,853
where like,

92
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,620
I knew a dude who had an
really interesting scam.

93
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,160
He had a scam

94
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,310
where they were making a,

95
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,690
it was a company that would
allow you to fix your credit,

96
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,120
so they would give you a line of credit.

97
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,890
And a,

98
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,920
you would buy things and then pay off
the credit and it would boost your credit

99
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,131
backs.

100
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,360
If you had fucked up credit.

101
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,961
It was all,

102
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,580
it was allowing you to fix your credit.

103
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:25,630
But the catch was the only things you
could buy with their credit card was

104
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,010
things from their catalog.

105
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,250
So my soul to the company's story,

106
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,800
I,

107
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,750
you know those things.

108
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,580
So they had these Camelot scam,

109
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,980
but I'm catalepsy and words go with stuff.

110
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,230
But say if something costs,

111
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,471
uh,

112
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:38,711
you know,

113
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,490
whatever it was,

114
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,490
toenail clipper for cost like $3
at the grocery store there is $25.

115
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,870
So if you want to buy it,

116
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,201
you're,

117
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:47,441
you're,

118
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,870
you're giving them a
giant chunk of profit.

119
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,940
So they would ship these terrible little
items and it would really actually

120
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,290
boost these people's credit.

121
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,840
It actually did work wear boot.

122
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,270
So it was enough that,

123
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,430
but it was a total scam.

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,060
So you,

125
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,780
you're the only shit they can buy with
your credit cards is stuff from your

126
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,390
catalog and everything's marked
up through the fucking roof.

127
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,170
And this dude made millions
on that made millions

128
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,753
products.

129
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,120
Like when I was working for a
company originally we have the uh,

130
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,133
the uh,

131
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,470
uh,

132
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,303
black matte,

133
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,350
a pen with the gold middle Florentine
Trim and five lines of your ad copy on it

134
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:33,121
and we'd be selling these fucking
25 cent pens for like $4 a piece.

135
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,130
So it was put the scan that I was just
getting into when I started doing comedy

136
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,380
and then bailed out then went
full time in comedy was the uh,

137
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,690
the invention once like
the George Foreman.

138
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,711
Oh look,

139
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,370
the grill.

140
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,203
Yeah.

141
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,740
Do you have an invention
it and it's a fucking guy.

142
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,530
It's just such a great scam because
egos involved and it's getting,

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,011
you know,

144
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,320
everyone thinks they
should be on shark tank,

145
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,120
those kinds of people.

146
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,421
And you go,

147
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,470
I can't say,

148
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,730
but I think what you have here and the,

149
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:09,610
and then it's a multilevel
where vent help.

150
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,150
There it is.

151
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,490
Submit your invention idea to companies.

152
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,310
I'm not saying invent help is a scam.

153
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,860
I'm saying scams of that.

154
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,480
Do you have an invention?

155
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,130
And then there's step one
is we're going to do a,

156
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,760
like a,

157
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:23,950
uh,

158
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,730
patent,

159
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,540
uh,

160
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,260
uh,

161
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,850
research to see,

162
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,230
and this is going to cost you this,

163
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,550
but honestly,

164
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,384
Phil,

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,310
I think you're onto something.

166
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,610
I can't say that this is $1 million idea,

167
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,473
but

168
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,830
I know when I have a feeling
it's the way you say it,

169
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,160
but you can look at examples where the
United States has imposed a minimum wage

170
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,430
on other countries.

171
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,950
I mean the minimum wage did a
lot of damage in Puerto Rico.

172
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,341
But you know,

173
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,960
look at another American territory.

174
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,780
American Samoa or in American Samoa.

175
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
We basically American Samoa

176
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,030
with our minimum wage.

177
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,660
I mean there's Samoans or you know,

178
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,011
you know,

179
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:01,270
are,

180
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,300
are furious about it.

181
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,190
This happened years ago actually.

182
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,700
And I,

183
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,380
the reason I even found out about it,

184
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,970
I was watching 60 minutes and they were
doing a report about I think football

185
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,840
players in Samoa.

186
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,610
And um,

187
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,820
and during their report they mentioned
that there was like a depression going on

188
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:20,600
in Samoa and it was like there was 30%
unemployment and really high inflation.

189
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,050
And I was like,

190
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,190
what the hell is going on in Samoa?

191
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,140
So I wanted to research that on my own.

192
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:28,060
And I found out that we impose the
minimum wage on Samoa and we destroyed all

193
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:28,760
their jobs.

194
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,140
They're the two biggest employers were
to a chicken of the sea and starkist,

195
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,500
they were canning tuna and then they
were shipping the tuna back to the

196
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,280
mainland.

197
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,140
But the minute they
raised the minimum wage,

198
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,730
they made the production,

199
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,270
uh,

200
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,150
uncompetitive because now you
had to pay the higher wages,

201
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,200
plus the shipping costs.

202
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,580
They get the tuna back to the mainland.

203
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,990
So they all,

204
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,140
the canneries shut down and then
it created massive unemployment.

205
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,830
And then prices went way up on the
island because they no longer had boats

206
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,660
coming back and forth to pick up the tuna.

207
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,600
So now all of a sudden the shipping
cost of imports went way up.

208
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,100
So they had massive inflation,

209
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,600
sky high unemployment,

210
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,010
all because the minimum wage.

211
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,020
So you could look at examples of
how minimum wage destroys jobs.

212
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,740
Uh,

213
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:09,951
you know,

214
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,521
right there,

215
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:14,750
yet they continue to advocate for these
higher wages because it sounds good.

216
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:14,961
Oh,

217
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,360
everybody should earn a decent living.

218
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,721
Well,

219
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:17,961
you know,

220
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:18,201
not,

221
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,370
if you don't have any skills,

222
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,204
you can't.

223
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,630
And a lot of course you
know a lot of kids here,

224
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:22,970
you know,

225
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,661
they're 16,

226
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,141
17,

227
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:24,471
18,

228
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:24,861
19,

229
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,221
20.

230
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,050
I mean people live with
their parents still.

231
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,620
Uh,

232
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,510
the most important thing is getting a job
so you can acquire the skills to get a

233
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,620
better job to,

234
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:33,800
you know,

235
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,340
to move up the ladder in an
organization to enhance your,

236
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:37,581
you know,

237
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,160
your value to employers in general.

238
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,660
The argument against this,

239
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,340
short against what you're saying about
minimum wage against to all of these

240
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,630
ideas that you're,

241
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:48,590
you're just proposing,

242
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,090
do you do get a lot of pushback?

243
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,541
I mean,

244
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm sure what you're saying,

245
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,990
this free market capitalism approach is,

246
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,641
you know,

247
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,780
there's a lot of people that oppose it.

248
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,831
Of course.

249
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,870
I mean know there's a lot of
people that don't think it out.

250
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,580
They think with their mind or their,

251
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,080
or their,

252
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,210
their heart and they don't even get there.

253
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,430
The re the origin of the
minimum wage was racism.

254
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,791
I mean,

255
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,260
the first minimum wage is here.

256
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,560
It was designed to keep
employers from hiring.

257
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:12,860
Uh,

258
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,440
the Chinese are from
hiring blacks because they,

259
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:15,930
you know,

260
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,750
that that's where the
minimum wage came from,

261
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,171
you know,

262
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,720
to try to prevent employers
from hiring certain people.

263
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,261
So they said,

264
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:21,351
well,

265
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:25,280
let's have a minimum wage and that will
reduce a hiring of people who have less

266
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,090
skills.

267
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,481
And,

268
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,021
and so,

269
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,100
and the labor unions,

270
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:31,850
the biggest supporters of the
minimum wage are the labor unions.

271
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,900
And none of the labor unions
workers earn the minimum wage.

272
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:36,441
So you might think,

273
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,274
why are they,

274
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,990
did they still care
about the minimum wage?

275
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,520
If they don't,

276
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,210
they'll get paid a lot
higher than minimum wage.

277
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,770
And it's because you always have a
competition between skilled labor and

278
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:46,760
unskilled labor,

279
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,001
right?

280
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,680
So let's say a business,

281
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:52,730
a business man has the option of hiring
a skilled person to do something.

282
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,060
And let's say the skilled person is
going to charge quite hours an hour or an

283
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,280
unskilled person.

284
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,270
And let's say I can hire three
on skilled people for $5 an hour,

285
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,980
and that equals 15.

286
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,550
Well,

287
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:05,731
Hey,

288
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,410
I'd rather hire the unskilled worker.

289
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:11,340
I can pay three $5 an hour to do
the same job of one skilled worker.

290
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,260
But now if the skilled worker can,

291
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,630
could lobby for $7 minimum wage,

292
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,880
now if I have to hire
three unskilled people,

293
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,770
it costs $21 Aha.

294
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,611
Now all of a sudden,

295
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,020
I hire the guy with skills.

296
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,410
So the labor unions benefit by keeping
unskilled people unemployed because they

297
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,840
have more skills and therefore they can,

298
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,081
you know,

299
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,100
they can get more work.

300
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,860
That sounds like a complicated mess to me.

301
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,730
It is a mess for the,

302
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,590
for the,

303
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,870
for the people that get
get priced out of a job.

304
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,763
Yeah.

305
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:50,520
Okay.
