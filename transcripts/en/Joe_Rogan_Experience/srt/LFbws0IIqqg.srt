1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,580
Good googly move.
Me Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,550
actually lie. That's it.
Actually live. It's that easy.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,930
We don't fuck around anymore, man.
That's pretty cool. It's beyond cool.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,200
Um, this video that you gave
me, let's get right to it. Yo.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,920
First of all, I love the characters and
I see a reality show in your future.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,430
I see a parody of, of, of, uh,

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
like a duck dynasty type moonshiners type
of situations are real far better with

8
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,000
music. Okay. Fuck it.

9
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:41,001
Just genius guys who live out in the
desert who just happened to make amazing

10
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:45,940
music and be completely retarded
and think they're,

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,840
I think they're a punk rock band.
No, that's fucking great. It's,

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,290
it's really interesting what you're
doing. I love how you're, you know,

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,820
you don't have any roles.
We just do whatever the fuck
you think is interesting,

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,210
creative and mix the two of them
together. I mean credit, you know,

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,540
credit where credit is due when it,

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,200
when it comes to working
with Lauren Milligan and Mike
King, uh, her husband, uh,

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,390
large, just like, she'll just go
off on a tangent and I'll just,

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,540
just film it. And you know,
and we just kind of go with it.

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,160
So if you pick the right wig for the
bright tangent, then you just go,

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,760
I like what you did to, or you're
mixing different styles of music,

21
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:25,230
you're mixing like legit country music
and then some of the songs sound almost

22
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,660
like tool.
You know,

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,150
some of the sounds have like your
same type of vocals that you would,

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,950
one of your tool songs,

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,110
but it's just got this
completely different extra
vibe to it. Yeah. I think, uh,

26
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,070
I think there's a,

27
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,220
there's a lot of flexibility just
because we are kind of a moving target.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,420
So why don't we start to kind of
get inspired in some direction.

29
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:50,050
We're not where they can find
to, you know, I love slayer,
but slayer. Slayer, right?

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,910
Yeah. They're not gonna all of a sudden
put out a country record. Yeah, no,

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,390
that's kind of one of
the cool things about,

32
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,360
I really enjoy what you're doing that
you just do whatever the fuck you want to

33
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,150
do. You don't, you don't have
a box that you have to fit in.

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,340
You're just doing what
you feel like doing. Like,

35
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,420
I know what it never expect you wearing
a wig and playing this character. I mean,

36
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,090
he calls he fucking,
you ride it too man.

37
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,670
It's not like you just like
play it at the beginning. No,

38
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:16,140
I fucking keeps coming back and it's
really funny. Shit man. It's really funny.

39
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,620
Shit. Thank you. What does,

40
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,340
what inspired you to make like a
half country, half comedy half?

41
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,550
You know what I mean? It's like, it's just
this, I think just watching, you know,

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,680
I think we talked about this last time
like a Monty python movies, right?

43
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,020
They're just,
there is no,

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,030
you can't really pin him down and like
the meaning of life just, you know, it's,

45
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,190
that's Kinda how we did this
new DVD is there's a whole,

46
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,050
the whole documentary is at the
beginning, you know, when you go, what,

47
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:47,070
I'll watch the DVD again. You can actually
skip the documentary if you want to,

48
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,100
but it was important to see the
documentary and see, you know,

49
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,350
Billy Dee and Hildy Burger,
uh,

50
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,410
so that you understood when they came
back up later in the actual show.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,670
Who the hell? Who the fuck is that? If he
didn't, if he didn't see the documentary,

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,650
you don't understand where those
people are when you do the live shows.

53
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,130
Do you play the documentary first?

54
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,990
That's our opening band.
It's a great idea, man.

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,640
And the live DVD that you found, was that
in Phoenix? Did you film it in Phoenix?

56
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:19,660
Phoenix? Still repping Arizona
baby. That's where we are.

57
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,190
If you've seen the,
uh,

58
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,510
there's been a lot of camera trap photos
of Jaguars are starting to cross the

59
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,200
same paths from Mexico into the
United States. That the, uh,

60
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:33,010
the drug guys do jaguars
the cars. No, no, no.

61
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,820
Jaguar is in the native
North American giant cat.

62
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,010
Yeah. Yeah. There's, uh,
there's, well we have like,

63
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,850
I guess are they called Pomona's or,
yeah,

64
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,670
the mountain is up around us,
but we haven't actually,

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I haven't actually seen
the jaguars coming out.

66
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:49,821
Yeah,

67
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,920
there's not that many of them and they're
starting to take photos of them on

68
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,581
camera traps.

69
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,810
Apparently a long time ago they were
native species in North America.

70
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,020
Now they're starting to make its way

71
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,050
through your, your town. Excellent. Mm

72
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,360
indeed. So a is winemaking
season over for you now?

73
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,410
Yeah, I just wrapped up, uh,
had a good year. A lot of,

74
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,180
a lot of interesting challenges,
a lot of stuff that came up that um,

75
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,400
I wanted to try,
um,

76
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,680
stuff that was going to give me a
hard time kind of giving me trouble.

77
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,700
Well that's another perfect example
of you just not fitting in a box. Oh,

78
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:26,390
he makes wine. Like you just,
you don't just dabble in it.

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,740
You have a fucking vineyard, like a
full time set of employees, a vineyard.

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,270
You produce an excellent wines, a bunch
of different ones. It's really good stuff.

81
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:39,320
You know what you're doing. It's, I mean,
you just threw yourself into wine maker.

82
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,290
Okay. Yeah. I mean that's
one of those, you know,

83
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,550
you could pretty much read the back of
east packet to figure out like what to do

84
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:49,420
to inoculate fruit. But you know, to
really actually learn how to make wine,

85
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:53,650
you just got to dive in. You know, you can
go to explode, you can go to college to,

86
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,880
to get all the nuances and be taught
how to make wine with fear in mind,

87
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,550
but just dive in and make it.
It's really,

88
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,551
it's not that difficult to get over the
first basic comp of like the one oh ones

89
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:09,510
of it. It's not that hard. Then you know,
after that then it's like the nuances,

90
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,080
the,
you know,

91
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,300
the upper percent of just
intuition and instincts, you know.

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,620
Do you mingle it all with the people
in the wine world? Like do you,

93
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:24,320
do you communicate with other people in
the wine industry and gas guys at speed

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,060
dial that I know that are world class
wine makers from around the world and if I

95
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,030
have a, I have a question
that I think that they can,

96
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,960
that they've seen the answer to or seen
that challenge, we're seeing that hurdle.

97
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,340
I will not even hesitate to text or
call or write or email or you know,

98
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,950
something just to go, okay, so here's
the, here's the challenge. I'm your,

99
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,160
or here's the thing, I'm going
to try and based on, you know,

100
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,960
the kind of fruit that we get because
the fruit we get is not like it would get

101
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,550
in Napa or get in a necessarily get in,

102
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,170
uh,
New Zealand.

103
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,530
It might be more specific to like Adelaide
hills but not necessarily the Barossa,

104
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,610
you know, so there's, there's, you
know, different stuff, parts of Spain,

105
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,160
maybe parts of Italy maybe.

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,750
Do you do anything to your soil or
do you just let it be what it is?

107
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,480
For the most part, you let, you
know, you have to kind of give a,

108
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,330
I'll give it some, some food now and
then some kind of nutrients that are,

109
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:22,630
that are not going to come. They're
not going to like cripple, you know,

110
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,880
you don't want to give it steroids
or anything like that. I get it.

111
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:26,710
But you want to, you want to
give it something that it needs.

112
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,000
If it needs a little extra doses.

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,400
So what do you do? Do you add
like minerals or, yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,430
I guess if there's something that it's
kind of short on and how would you know

115
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,890
petioles you take the, you
know, samples from the plant,

116
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:41,040
you take samples from the
soil. Uh, we have, uh,

117
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,660
for moisture we'd take it
to have a pressure bomb,

118
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:46,230
the pressurizes the leaf to see if it,

119
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,810
how much women wash straight
actually needs today.

120
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,740
Wow. You give it like, if it
wants 10, you give it nine. Yeah.

121
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:56,070
That's a thing about the grapes for wine.

122
00:06:56,071 --> 00:07:00,090
They're supposed to suffer a little bit.
Right. Why is that? Uh, it just, it just,

123
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:04,290
it just gets some stronger. I mean, you
know, you train Jujitsu that's there,

124
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,090
you know, there's
suffering involved. Yeah.

125
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,080
I couldn't get anywhere unless you are
pushed a little bit. Even as a grape,

126
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,430
even as a grape. How many,
even as a salary, Joe,

127
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,570
even as a salary. I see, I
see. Now it all becomes clear.

128
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,130
How many years you've been doing this
now? Uh, I broke ground and around 2001,

129
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:26,610
2002, um, made my first wine in 2004.

130
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,830
I find that absolutely fascinating.
I've never once heard of a,

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,990
a Rockstar who decided to not
just make wine. Like, I mean,

132
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,740
I suppose Sammy Hagar has it Tequila,
right?

133
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,540
How much is he really involved in it?
Is Sammy out there harvesting at Nga Bay?

134
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,460
You know, is he a, is he pressing it
and I'm saying, yeah, I don't know.

135
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:55,380
Think so. Okay. I don't think so. He's
definitely not doing what you're doing,

136
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:59,280
man. You're, you're, I mean, cause you
know, for me, I have, I have, uh, my staff

137
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,760
sitting room. So basically come
to Jerome. There's like, you know,

138
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,810
there's a staff of people that, you
know, of course rotate. But, uh,

139
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,910
we have Chris Turner's like my
right hand man and the vineyard.

140
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,190
I'm not a vineyard guy.
I'm, I'm in the cellar.

141
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,630
So Chris has his team of people in the
actual vineyard making sure that they all

142
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,840
have their finger on the pulse of what
I'm looking for in the grapes to make the

143
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:21,440
wine. We have, of course our
shipping staff and you know,

144
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,530
the business affairs managers and
stuff. But in this, in the cellar,

145
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,990
it's just my wife and I, it's
just us making the wine, uh,

146
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,850
pressing the grapes and acculate ing.

147
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,680
So there's not actually a staff
of people in the actual seller.

148
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,920
Cause that's my house. Wow.
So it's just us doing it.

149
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,000
So I don't think people quite understand
like, uh, he can't make it. It's harvest.

150
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,270
So wanted his employees handle that.
There's,

151
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,030
I don't quite think he'd
been listening to me.

152
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,880
There's nobody in the cellar but
me. I mean, we have a couple guys.

153
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:53,160
I have a friend down the street that
comes up and cleans up after me. Um,

154
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:55,070
have a guy that comes out at
the beginning of the season,

155
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,720
I'll buy some new equipment
that I don't know how to use.

156
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,300
I Bill Greg makes that work. He'll
go, okay, I'll read the directions.

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,510
We hate reading directions. So I'll just
have Greg figure out how to make that,

158
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,344
make that go.

159
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,070
How do you piece together a team?

160
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:13,170
Like when you decide that you're going
to start making your own wine, you,

161
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,390
you get a piece of land, you decide
where you're going to grow grapes.

162
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:20,900
You decide here, how did the fucking
piece together a team to create wine.

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,960
Anything else? It's hit and miss. You
got to just figure out who has natural,

164
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,320
you know,

165
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,920
natural talent toward it or is it ready
or willing to do all the work if you

166
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,650
have any, if they're not even
naturally. I mean my wife doesn't,

167
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,320
she's not a chemist, but
she works the lab. She went,

168
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,830
I went and guess what you're
doing. So she's like, I am.

169
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,390
So you're nine years into
production essentially,

170
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:44,480
but the 10 1112 years into this project,

171
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,320
is this still challenging for you?
Do you still enjoy,

172
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,010
you know, every, every year that I'm
making wine on my, on my own, you know,

173
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,851
previous years,

174
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:56,350
like from Oh four up to about
a 2009 I had other people,

175
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:58,750
I was kind of like looking over their
shoulder and trying to be involved in

176
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,980
doing it, but until 2010,
you know, like part the,

177
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,280
but the part of 10 until I was
actually in, you know, doing it myself.

178
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,240
Uh, you're only going to learn
that way. And so, you know, that's,

179
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,810
it's just,
you just dive in basically.

180
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,063
Wow.

181
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,510
And now how many months out of the year
does it take to do that and then the

182
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:23,110
rest you devote to whatever else? Like
postal for anything else if you like doing

183
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,570
and anything else? Yeah. Um, yeah. Uh,

184
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,980
don't even look for me on August
1st August 1st and November 1st.

185
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,710
Don't even look, I'm
not around. I'm dug in.

186
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,240
So for four months you're gone.
Yeah. Yeah. Do you enjoy that,

187
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,900
that you're committed to this
like four month project, that,

188
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:45,240
that list for four months you're accounted
for. That's it. This is your life.

189
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,330
Yeah. I mean it's, it's
nice to know that, you know,

190
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,410
I'm going to be sleeping in my own bed,
right. And it's, you know, it's hard work.

191
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,244
You're up,
you know,

192
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,210
I'm up at six 30 doing punch downs and
just checking things out and make sure

193
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:57,320
everything's, you know, not, you know,

194
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,500
something didn't blow up or
I forgot to seal something.

195
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:02,120
So it's leaking or you know,
there's just those,

196
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,240
those tragic things that
kind of happened in the end.

197
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,090
The seller that you look over and like
the spouse wasn't shut and there's like

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,250
peanut grief pouring onto the
ground and like foc, bonehead,

199
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:14,540
move Brent over and shut it.

200
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,090
This, that, that it's, it's
such an interesting idea,

201
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,360
but I love the fact that you figured out
a way as a musician to guarantee that

202
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:25,770
your home for four months, you know,
like people don't know the musicians are,

203
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,430
comics aren't,
that fucking road gets sad man.

204
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,870
It gets so boring and it gets so,
it gets,

205
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,100
it gets grueling body,

206
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,230
you know, as you go forward in time, uh,

207
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,010
there's no going back in time. What
was your back doesn't get it. You know,

208
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,580
it doesn't get stronger from the journey.
It gets weaker.

209
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,510
Yeah.
Especially the travel.

210
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:51,500
We were talking about a guy that you know
that had a blood clot from an airplane

211
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,130
ride and was feeling shit.
And I was telling

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,130
you how I flew back from England
and got sick. The flights,

213
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,330
every flight is like going on a bender.
It's like getting hammered.

214
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,960
Every one of them is just like,
just wrecking your body like Ah,

215
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,940
and skidding into home plate and it was
fun. I'm laying in the bed, not, yeah,

216
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,870
it's very, very weary. Okay.
It really beats you down.

217
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,050
So then when that's over,
November's done.

218
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,280
Dee Dee had just chillax for a little
bit or uh, last couple of years.

219
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,260
Now I would jump right into,
you know,

220
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,010
doing some stuff with perfect circle or
puts a for if the guys were writing with

221
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,180
the tool,

222
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,410
work with them or maybe we go out and
do some quick tour or something, but,

223
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,411
and that's all it,

224
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:37,930
just to kind of keep it alive and because
you've done some work that you need to

225
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,820
kind of tidy up and do something with.

226
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:42,760
Like we came up with conditions of my
parole and I had to, like, I had to,

227
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,820
I had to promote that records. I had to
get on the road right away in November.

228
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,040
Uh, that was a couple of years ago. So,

229
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,420
and then between you add some Jujitsu?
Yeah, that was the fun part this year.

230
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,570
It's like, watch it, like

231
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,600
poor Matt Mitchell from poster for you.

232
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,650
Came out to like record some
tracks with me and uh, you know,

233
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:02,610
I'm up at six, seven out there doing my
thing. And that would come in and like,

234
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,310
we tried to like work on a song or work
on some tracks and he was helping record

235
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:10,390
some stuff. And, uh, and then I
go, I gotta go, I gotta do the,

236
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,900
I gotta quickly destemmed these,
this fruit.

237
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,960
And then at 1145 I got to drive down the
hill cause I gotta go do Jujitsu from

238
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,470
noon to one and then I'll be
pack up here at one. Okay.

239
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,120
I'll be here at one 15. We can do a vocal,
but then I got to press the Chardonnay.

240
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,000
He's like,
who the fuck are,

241
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,520
are you,
and he's known you from long before this?

242
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,340
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I toured with him.

243
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:42,220
First Time I met him was
on a perfect circle tour.

244
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,950
So what do these people think that I've
seen you prewired and post one or they

245
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,510
like, did they think of originally
like, God, this is just his new thing.

246
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,330
He'll do it for a little bit and
then it's probably, you know,

247
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,860
it'll last a year or so, 12
years later, 12 years later.

248
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,980
How many bottles do you make
a year now? Uh, I did about,

249
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,590
I'm horrible mass.
Um,

250
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,080
this year I did about six and a half,
7,000 cases in my cellar.

251
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,110
Holy Shit.
That's incredible.

252
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,150
How many acres are you growing on?

253
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,340
Uh, in northern Arizona, I,
right now I have planted, uh,

254
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,640
40, just under 40 planted. Uh,

255
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,050
and only about 10 of those are
actually producing at the moment.

256
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,420
I'm southern Arizona. Uh, my sister
company, Arizona's stronghold.

257
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,200
I have access to fruit from our
vineyards down there. So, uh,

258
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,070
there's a lot and there's a lot
of growers all over the state. Um,

259
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,030
and there's growers just over the
border into New Mexico as well,

260
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:40,770
just to it just over from those counties.

261
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,930
So there's also like
kind of a mirror image,

262
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,800
a terrain over in New Mexico with
even more established vendors.

263
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:47,640
And we have an Arizona,

264
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,010
so 40 acres you're, you're
planting, but only 10

265
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,731
of them are,

266
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:55,910
you're actually harvesting fruit from
and probably by next year I'll see a

267
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,420
little bit more from the other 30.
And then by, you know, by 2015,

268
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,980
I'll see full production from everything.

269
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,550
How does that work?
Do you have to do something to soil?

270
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:05,680
Do you have to just get you
to the grapes used to it?

271
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,800
That and the ticks takes you three and
three to four years to see fruit off the

272
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:13,760
vine. Once you plant that, it's real.
It's a commitment in time for sure. So you

273
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,130
planted and it,
is it just a matter of it growing or is it

274
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,060
and establishing you want to make sure
an adult depends on what you're kind of

275
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,450
going for. You know, if you want,

276
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,570
if you want to plant like tighter spacing
and set free a little earlier on the

277
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:31,170
plant when it's younger so it doesn't
quite get big and it kind of like almost

278
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:34,830
stunt its growth in a way. He gets some
really concentrated fruit on, on a,

279
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:37,860
on a smaller,
on a smaller vine.

280
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,880
But you've seen some that are like
these huge old school of vines.

281
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,770
There's different schools
of thought on that.

282
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:46,200
You got guys that pull out everything and,
and uh,

283
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,560
20 to 30 years I'll just pull everything
out and start over cause the vine might

284
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:53,880
produce, you know, an eighth of what
it was producing when it was younger.

285
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,680
And if it's not great,

286
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
I mean if it's like prove to these
producing an eighth of fruit and it's

287
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,850
fantastic, just undeniable fruit, well
yeah, hang onto it. But if it's not,

288
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,820
most guys are pulling it out.
Oh let's start over.

289
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,240
Do you find that this whole potatoes,
you know,

290
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,430
the process of creating
this new thing and then,

291
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:14,080
and then getting involved in
this completely new endeavor,

292
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:16,750
does that do anything to
the rest of your creativity?

293
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:20,370
Do you find that it opens up new
possibilities for other things that you,

294
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,560
I get a, I mean it opened yet it opens up
other stuff. Cause you know, when you're,

295
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,520
it's a whole different kind of
creativity and a year when you're,

296
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,670
when you're in the seller and you were
just hovering over some of these wines,

297
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,190
you, you're having to
be kind of, you know,

298
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,130
you have to have the tech,
you know, the technique down.

299
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,030
You have to understand the
process that you're going through,

300
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:43,910
but you're also have these
opportunities to go, okay,

301
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,910
I have to make a creative decision
right here. There's like a,

302
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,220
there's a challenge that's come in.

303
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,710
Something comes in extremely ripe
that you didn't expect that coming in

304
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,680
extremely ripe because they just were,
the numbers were just all over the map.

305
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,590
The sugars are extremely high and
it's just probably an IB not finished

306
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,080
fermenting. It's so ripe and
then you have something come in,

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,370
it's a completely under ripe and you
go, hmm, if I put these together,

308
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,020
they're right there,

309
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,320
right at the right number that I want
rather than trying to finish something

310
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,140
that's not high enough sugar and something
that's way too high sugar. You know,

311
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:15,530
there's little moments like that that
happen that you just didn't expect and you

312
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:19,570
can't plan. It's just chaos and you just
have to just navigate the chaos. Yeah.

313
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,950
Would you like a big fan of
wine before you did this?

314
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,390
Or is this just something that you,

315
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,780
you just decided to slowly
but surely step into?

316
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,040
Um, I guess I had a great grandfather
who made wine in northern Italy,

317
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,730
but I didn't know that until I
was actually planting grapes. Wow.

318
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,630
So he just dove in, dove in? Yeah, I
know, but I was into wine a little bit,

319
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:42,110
you know, back in, I lived in
Boston for Awhile, so I, you know,

320
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:46,280
I enjoyed wine with my friend Kurt.
He worked at a nice Italian wine shop,

321
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,010
so he'd always bring stuff home on
the weekends and we'd, you know,

322
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,230
he would grill and I would
drink this wine and you know,

323
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,570
let you years later and go,
oh wow. That was pretty,

324
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,130
I think we were drinking some
pretty awesome wine. Yeah.

325
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,070
I don't know shit about one.
I have a really good friend who's a,

326
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,410
he's a real connoisseur.

327
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:08,400
He has this gigantic room in his house
that he constructed that it's digitally

328
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,860
set to a certain temperature.
And I mean,

329
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:15,170
he has this ridiculous
clash in the La area. Yeah.

330
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,730
He lives in the Palisades and he's got,
I mean,

331
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,470
he built this room onto his house before
he moved into this house. Mean he's a,

332
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,120
he's a nut and you know,

333
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,480
he can look at blind lists and tell
you what's good this year, what's nine?

334
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,390
He's constantly on top of it. And he took
me to a wine testing for his birthday,

335
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,950
wine tasting.
You know,

336
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:39,000
they brought up different flights
of wine and it was all good to me.

337
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,230
But hearing describe it,
it's so, it's baffling.

338
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:46,330
The fruity taste, the
Tannin, the smokey mic,

339
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,470
but like the more people
don't really get does it,

340
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,500
you don't have to know any of that stuff.
If you have it like a good,

341
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,760
if you know somebody you know that's uh,
oh,

342
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,630
it's a cool shop or has a nice
tasting room, like, you know, uh,

343
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,970
Matthew over at Corvelle.

344
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,120
If you just go talk to Matthew about
what they'd have on their list or go to

345
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,120
silver lake wine or talked to Randy or
April of George to go, okay, what's open?

346
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:06,331
You know,

347
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:11,331
when you had their tastings and they just
take notes on the of stuff in front of

348
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:16,200
you. Okay. Write down did I
like it? Did I not like it?

349
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,150
That I like it,
that I not like it.

350
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,640
They just write down what you liked
and we get, didn't like and why?

351
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,110
If there's just a couple words like,

352
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,370
I didn't like that because of this or I
like that because of this, write it down.

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,980
And then you just show
them like write down,

354
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,120
have them write down what the wines were
that you had and not so much for you

355
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,770
but for them and come back again and do
it again at for some other flight there

356
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:41,760
or whatever. And once you have some notes
down, they're going to start to get,

357
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:45,120
figure out what you might like
and then they're gonna go, okay,

358
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,200
try this or try this and then come back
and tell me if you liked it or not.

359
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,650
I like, I tend to like, like
the fruity or like a Pinot noir.

360
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:56,730
I like that kind of wine and
just see again does, you know,

361
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,170
don't even gravitate towards the peanut,

362
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:02,450
just like just taste stuff and then
write down what it was and start kind of

363
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,070
keeping a log or something
of what that was.

364
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:09,120
Because if you have a
pretty good intuitive person
working at one of those wine

365
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:13,030
shops, they can kind of go, okay,
having, having poured you have, you know,

366
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,380
a hundred little tastes
over the last couple months,

367
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,300
we've narrowed down what you like.

368
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,530
Do you see yourself going into whiskey
next dude, I love Angel's envy.

369
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,630
Angel's envy. What does that I can't, can
I plug? Sure. Okay, why not? What is it?

370
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,570
It's, it's, it's a, it's a mellow,

371
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,510
a bourbon aged in port barrels.

372
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,470
It's super mellow in port barrel.
So they take the, the older port,

373
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,110
the port it pours out. Yeah, there
is a bigger list. Wow. About that.

374
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,000
By the barrels from somebody.
How does that affect the taste?

375
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,010
Like what is it supposed to do to the
table to tell you? I'm not a guy, but

376
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,780
I like that one. That's it right
there. Angel's envy. There you are.

377
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,180
Hello. Do you see yourself
doing anything else? I mean,

378
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,420
any other crazy ideas you have cooking
in the back burner that you might get

379
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,940
onto? I Cook a little bit, but uh,
I don't think I would actually,

380
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,100
guy wouldn't go be a chef.
I would probably open up like a I.

381
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,300
From that though, I could totally see
you becoming a chef. So were just, well,

382
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:17,050
it started out I just wanted to open up
a restaurant and one then here I am. Wow.

383
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,850
No wants pizza
and always in Arizona.

384
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,590
Yeah.
I've got a couple,

385
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,860
got a couple of things up my sleeve
and Arizona brick oven, pizza place,

386
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,230
northern Arizona.
It's pretty fucking bad ass.

387
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,000
It's do you live near the mountains
or near Sedona. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,260
That's an interesting spot.
Yep. A lot of Weirdos in Sedona.

389
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,220
You think a lot of people,
a lot of people believe in crystal power.

390
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,660
Yeah.
It,

391
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,170
the people you just reach up
and grab their leg and pull
them down to the ground.

392
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,990
It's,
it's to hear what happens to people.

393
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,860
How does that happen where you get a
spot like Sedona for say where it just

394
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,030
people gravitate towards
their healers in quotes?

395
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,680
I don't know. I can't, I
have no answer for that.

396
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,560
I have no answer for it either.
I've always been fascinated though.

397
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:09,400
It was like how does a spot like that
come to be? And what do you mean you can,

398
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,300
if you've been into, you
know, a decent size city,

399
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:16,990
there's always going to be a spot.
Like for example in La. Okay.

400
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,070
You got Millie's over on
sunset. What's that? And silver,

401
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:24,190
like Millie's Millie's cafe.
Millie's the restaurant.

402
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,340
It's a little breakfast
place over on sunset.

403
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,390
That's always going to have a gathering
of people in that spot. Yeah, it's okay.

404
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,790
It's like that moment. I'll never heard
of it. Millie's Millie's on sunset. Yep.

405
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,780
You know where, um, sunset
and one, you know, uh,

406
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,450
just say silver lake just
to, yes, in silver lake,

407
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,490
just a side of a silver Lake Boulevard.

408
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,940
There's a lot of fucking
cool spots down there a lot.

409
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,450
But that's the one that just like no
matter what, no matter who owns that spot,

410
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,930
there's always going to be
people gathering in that
spot for a cup of coffee or

411
00:22:55,931 --> 00:23:00,910
like some kind of opiate know
sunrise kind of event, a Brunch,

412
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,870
you know, even if it's not called
brunch Sunday, just like something,

413
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,120
even if it ends up being a doughnut shop,
there's going to be,

414
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,420
there's always going to be something
there where people gather in that spot and

415
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:15,421
you kind of have to assign some kind
of value to that energy you're talking

416
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,380
about. It's the Dona until like those
little, we'll call them for Texas.

417
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,490
There's like a, there's some kind of
gathering vortex at that spot. Well,

418
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:27,430
I think a lot of those places,
especially in La,

419
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,970
they have this deep history of people
returning to these spots and then it's

420
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:38,401
almost gets like seeped into the wood
places like the comedy store or ever eat

421
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:41,680
it. Dantanna's no, fantastic place.

422
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:45,350
It's one of the oldest school old
school restaurants in Hollywood.

423
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,170
It's on Santa Monica,
uh,

424
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,200
right near a boys town and it's this like
super old school bar slash restaurant

425
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:59,210
that hasn't changed the menu
since 1966 or something like that.

426
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,670
Cooks a fucking tremendous
stake, has amazing pasta.
The waiters all wear Tuxedos.

427
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,290
It was just one of those like super duper
old school spots. That's cool. Yeah.

428
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:13,510
And when you go in there,
it's like canter's Deli. It
had been a canvas telling.

429
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:17,750
Yeah. Yeah. That feel like that place
has been used man. It's just uh,

430
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,360
it's in the feel it. Yeah. You know,
you can't get that in a new place.

431
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,480
Cantors in years.

432
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,520
That's a classic as a classic comic
spot because it's open 24 hours a day.

433
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,220
Go there all the time after food
or after, uh, after shows. Yeah.

434
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,100
Cause the Largo is right across the
street. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,340
La has so many of those really cool old
school spots that I've just been around

436
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:44,480
for so long.

437
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,230
I think that's, and I think, you
know, back to our SEDONA conversation,

438
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:51,680
it's probably some version of that
where those spots just kind of have that

439
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,790
energy. And you know, just
in general, uh, I was,

440
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,300
I was driving to a la from kind of the
Sedona Prescott area and I forgot that

441
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:06,560
the RNL fires,
they were,

442
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:09,950
they had kind of had the road closed
off so I couldn't go that way,

443
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:12,890
but I thought it, you know, a month had
passed and I figured everything was fine.

444
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,753
It wasn't fine yet.

445
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,610
So I get to a certain spot and there's
of course a guy standing there,

446
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:19,040
gone psych,
you can't go this way.

447
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,690
So I had to backtrack and then I kind
of took another route that took me

448
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,423
farther,

449
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,880
kind of back tracked West
Ish and kind of came back in.

450
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,530
And, uh, there's an area out in
that way where it's basically,

451
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:40,850
it's that kind of Sedona place where
you go there, but there's no people,

452
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,410
there's no cell signal, there's nothing.
It's just these crazy moon rock,

453
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,930
you know, setting with these, uh,

454
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,520
Joshua trees and Cacti just
as far as the eye can see.

455
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,250
And it's like these crazy
rolling hills who this,

456
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,820
it was like the coolest hour and a half,
you know,

457
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,460
added hour and a half to my trip. It was
completely worth. It just goes. He just,

458
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,540
and that, when you see that
kind of place, you can go,

459
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,440
you can see how somebody who,
you know when Sedona isn't there yet,

460
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,280
you can see how somebody would go,
I want to start something here.

461
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,890
There's an energy here that
I want to like, you know,

462
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,400
did you see that video of
those Doby Boyscout guys who
tipped over those hundred

463
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,900
million year old rocks? Did
you see this? You know the,

464
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,000
I think it's called Goblin Canyon.

465
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:33,170
There's an area of Utah that has these
incredible, did they find the price?

466
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,050
The video,
these dumped fox,

467
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,220
they made a video of pushing over
this hunter. The rocks fall on them.

468
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,810
Unfortunately.
No.

469
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,920
Do is it to pull it up?
Yeah, it's too late.

470
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,280
I don't think you can glue it back,
but what? I mean is it too late to,

471
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,120
to kill them? I didn't say
that all loud. Um, I did.

472
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,090
Um, yeah, they're too stupid to
be held responsible unfortunately.

473
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,190
But they did get fired
from the boy scouts.

474
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,770
Yeah.

475
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,580
Which, yeah, that sucks. But the point is,

476
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:12,440
it was one of these, a really cool
ancient structures where it's this, this,

477
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,180
this giant like top,
like a mushroom cap almost.

478
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,900
And it's just all this wind and sand
has eroded it to the point where this is

479
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,320
just like this little peak that's
holding this thing in place.

480
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,610
And it was so fucking cool looking
and these tools just decided to,

481
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,990
to tip it over. Did you find it?
What's that adds on all these,

482
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,970
there's ads on them.
Of course there are,

483
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:38,900
because that's what happens when a
video gets 10 million hits in a week.

484
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,700
Oops. Yeah, no worries.
No worries there. For me,

485
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,890
those structures are so cool though.
It's so,

486
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,920
it's so interesting when you see like
something that's been created by hundreds

487
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,360
of millions of years of
erosion. I was in a, um, uh,

488
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,000
a cave in Colorado. There's
the thing, these, these things.

489
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,350
So that's like,

490
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,000
that's 170 million years old or
something like that. This structure

491
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,990
and these fucking idiots
push this thing along.

492
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah.

493
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,580
I mean,
it's like a Coen brothers movie.

494
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,120
We have now modified
Goblin valley problem.

495
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,350
Valerie exists with the,
this boulder down here,

496
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,250
the bottom hold muscles.

497
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,570
You're hired, you're pushing it off. Yeah.

498
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,020
So sad. But those things, so
the, the, the, the, that area,

499
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:42,280
Goblin valley is a,
another one of those sort of,

500
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,900
those spots where you drive through it
and it's just has such an inward draw.

501
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,070
Any interesting those fuckheads hopefully,
you know,

502
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:54,970
people will learn from the reaction
to this and it'll never happen again.

503
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,560
It's still a lot of really cool
shit shit there, but right.

504
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,640
Are you a one time, um, when
I'm one of those, um, uh,

505
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,290
publicity flights for the blue
angels, they took us, uh, uh,

506
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,720
you go down to San Diego and then from
San Diego you cut across like deep into

507
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:13,150
the desert and it looks like fat.

508
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:18,151
It has all these incredible rocks and
weird formations and desert and there's

509
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:23,930
something bad ass about that man. Is
that this is the area. Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,610
There's a lot of spreadable.
Yeah.

511
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,070
And it's all just wind
erosion caused all this stuff.

512
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,630
That's pretty amazing. Yeah.
The, the desert south west of,

513
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,310
of this country has some really fucking
interesting landscape and fascinating

514
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,530
energy to too. I'll try to, I'll try to
text you or email you with the, with the,

515
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:48,430
uh, the exact area that it was, that I was
driving through. Cool. But you, you know,

516
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,770
you can barely see them.

517
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:53,980
Make sure you bring water because
for some reason, if you get,

518
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,270
if your car breaks down,
there's no signal. You're not
getting out of there. Yeah.

519
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,450
What do you do? You have to wait for
someone to arrest you. There's, you know,

520
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,800
there's people out there that you can,
you got,

521
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,430
you go by ranches and stuff
throughout in that area. But uh,

522
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,700
yeah, no. Yeah. That's when counting
on humanity gets very sketchy.

523
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,780
You don't realize how vulnerable you are
until your car runs out of gas in the

524
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,920
middle of the desert and
you're like, oh shit. Okay.

525
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,960
This is not just a matter of convenience.

526
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:26,070
This is a matter of we might
dehydrate to death out here. Yeah.

527
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,830
There was actually a mixed martial
arts fighter, a former UFC champion,

528
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,601
Evan Tanner,

529
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:36,601
who went on this sort of vision quest
in death valley and disoriented,

530
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,070
lost his water and died side. He was
going to go camping. Don't do that.

531
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,720
Don't get all like into the
wild on people too late.

532
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,020
Yeah, he did it. He died. Yeah,
it was definitely not good.

533
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,910
But he was an interesting cat. He was a
type of guy that, you know, he was uh,

534
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,590
whether or not it was a smart move.

535
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,620
It was a typical Evan Tanner sort
of self discovery type of a journey.

536
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,680
And he did a lot of those and most of
them he came through. But some of them,

537
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:14,170
you know, this one, obviously
it didn't work out for him.

538
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,450
He was a fascinating guy though.
Really interesting,

539
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:23,020
very deep thinker, like a deep
original thinker. It's just, you know,

540
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:24,700
these guys are always
trying to test themselves,

541
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:28,690
not just inside the cage but in
life period. And for him it was,

542
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,380
I think a bit of a vision quest to go
out there and one of the most extreme

543
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:34,660
environments known North America.

544
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,410
And test himself or see
find himself. Yeah, I think,

545
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,030
but you know when you're
gonna do a thing like that,

546
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,690
you probably should prepare to be tested.
Exactly.

547
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,270
It's like the end of the wild movie.
The same thing.

548
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,060
I mean the movie's infuriating. The book
is infuriating. The stories infuriating.

549
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,280
There's a seven 11 or right over there.
Yeah, you've done it to do that, man.

550
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,310
I'm only that if you're going to do that,

551
00:31:57,311 --> 00:32:00,190
if you're going to do that into the
wild shit man, you should it take,

552
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,650
if you were really respect nature,
we,

553
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,930
you should fucking prepare
for it for a long time.

554
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,460
You should really know what you're doing.

555
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,570
Like I am in love with
these subsistence shows,

556
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,630
like these shows, like these
Alaska shows where these people,

557
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,970
they live off the land and
trapping and hunting and fishing,

558
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,740
but they fucking know what they're doing
and they've been doing it a long time

559
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:23,110
and they have like cabins
set up along the way.

560
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,970
Like in case they get trapped outside,

561
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,880
they know that they just have to get a
half a mile down the road and they can

562
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:31,520
get to this cabin. There's, there's dry
wood inside of it. They can start a fire.

563
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:36,070
There's matches. Everything's ready to
rock and roll and over prepared. Exactly.

564
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,980
They're ready. I mean they're in Alaska,
it's 50 fucking degrees below zero. If

565
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,380
you're a runner and you're like,
uh,

566
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,280
you know, like send me distance runner,
like a four mile runner or you know,

567
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:46,870
like a 10 K or whatever.

568
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:50,530
You do sprints and you do
marathons for training.

569
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:55,531
You do the extremes and you do it often
and you'd do it well and then you go to

570
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:56,600
your race.

571
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,410
Well it's also,
if you're going to,

572
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,650
you really do respect that area of you
really do respect the wilderness. I mean,

573
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:08,000
you've got to prepare for it. You, you,
you really have to prepare to respect it.

574
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,450
It's the only way you can respect it.
Cause by going out there unprepared,

575
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,720
you're disrespecting it and it
doesn't give a fuck about you.

576
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,290
It doesn't give a fuck about your ego.
It doesn't give a fuck how, you know,

577
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,530
a lot of guys might get lost out here,
but I got a natural sense of the woods.

578
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,560
It's not hearing that shit
that's on hearing that shit. No.

579
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,170
It will dry you out and turn
you into coyote food. Yeah.

580
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,810
It's kind of school you for sure.

581
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,590
Do you enjoy the fact that there's
like less humans out where you are?

582
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,020
Do you feel that there's
a benefit in that?

583
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,230
Yeah, there is. Right? Yeah, I absolutely,

584
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,620
I mean, you know, it's, it's um,

585
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,250
it's all a matter of perspective and uh,

586
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,400
I guess it's, it's, it's a microcosm,

587
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:54,600
macrocosm kind of a situation
where if you're in at the end,

588
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,570
a big city like this,

589
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:58,480
you're going to see a cross section
of a certain kind of people. Uh,

590
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,720
my friend Todd that I was
just talking about the

591
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,740
talking in reference to,
uh,

592
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,950
just any kind of an
infrastructure or hierarchy.

593
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,170
You got your 10% that are kicking ass.

594
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:14,680
You got your 80% that are just kind of
coasting. You got your 10% that suck,

595
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,440
so you're going to end up,
if it's La for surfers,

596
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,950
like I was going to a 400 population town,

597
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,020
you're going to have similar percentages.

598
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:28,021
There's going to be 10% that are that
care and know what they're doing or want

599
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:33,961
to know what they're doing and then 80%
that are just there and then 10% that

600
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,560
you just want to run over

601
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,231
this.
The one,

602
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:41,440
the good thing about being in a place
like New York City or la where there's a

603
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:46,441
large population is there's the 10% is
a larger number and you can cultivate a

604
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,000
good group of them and yeah,
you can see, but you have to,

605
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,460
you have to go out and find them.
Yeah. You've got to find them.

606
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:55,630
You got keep them close and you got to
feed off of each other and then hopefully

607
00:34:55,631 --> 00:35:00,400
encourage some other people perhaps
that are in the other 80% to break free.

608
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,610
Maybe tip the numbers a bit.
I agree.

609
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,860
When you die 75 cause they're all capable.

610
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,460
We're all capable of learning,
doing.

611
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,420
Do you feel a responsibility for
that or towards that as an artist?

612
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:17,050
Do you ever feel like because of
what you're doing, because if you're,

613
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,120
you're so motivated,
you get so much done,

614
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:21,670
you have so many different projects going.
Do you,

615
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:23,650
do you realize the impact of that?

616
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:26,260
Because a lot of people
were inspired by though the,

617
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,880
not just the work ethic that you have, but
the, how much quality shit you produce,

618
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,400
whether it's wine or music or,
I appreciate it straight

619
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,030
to compliment. Um, I think, I think
you can't worry about it. You just got

620
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,860
to do what it is you're doing. And for
me, I just have to do what I'm doing.

621
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,770
There's a, there's a, there's a sense of
responsibility for the art or for the,

622
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,780
the process. And just for myself, I
just, I care about what I'm doing. Um,

623
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,200
if I start caring about what
you think about what I'm doing,

624
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,930
whether it's going to be helping you, that
I'm, uh, that I'm, uh, an assisted living,

625
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,370
uh,
employee.

626
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,440
You said something in your video that
was very unpretentious but had the

627
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,540
potential to be massively pretentious.

628
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,820
But it wasn't because
you were being honest.

629
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:13,650
And what you're saying is that life is
too short to not create with every breath

630
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:18,600
you take. Right. And but you, you,
when you said it, the audience cheered.

631
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,040
It was a real moment. You know,
they recognize that real moment.

632
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,980
But God damn the wrong person
could say that. And you're like,

633
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:30,700
well you just shut the fuck up.
Create with every, oh pluse yeah,

634
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,260
you have to get that all the time. But
you really mean it. If you really mean it,

635
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:38,330
it is inspiring. And that's
where the cheer and the
audience comes from. You know,

636
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,200
the people fucking love that.

637
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:44,460
They love when someone is
motivated to make shit motivated,

638
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:48,600
to put out art,
motivated to test themselves creatively.

639
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:53,280
It's exciting. And, and you know, I'm, I
have a lot of people around me especially,

640
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:56,820
you know, just within the music,
within the film, within the animation,

641
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:00,840
like all those things. But especially
in the, in the vineyards and the,

642
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,910
and the restaurant stuff. I see. I
see people that are just every day,

643
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,240
there's like an inspired by their
work ethic. And because, you know,

644
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:12,420
we were talking about a restaurant,
like that's not, that's not a whim.

645
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,120
That's not something that you can kind
of just start on a whim and not expect to

646
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:19,350
be responsible for keeping
the boat floating. That's
like, you know, I see. I, uh,

647
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,570
there's a restaurant in,
um,

648
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,780
in Arizona called the F and B [inaudible]
and Charlene and just watching what

649
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:29,330
they go through and what, but, you
know, not go through it. That's,

650
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,630
that's the wrong way to put it. But like,
just the process, their process and,

651
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,250
and uh, and their motivation and
their, and their fire and they're,

652
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,950
they're derive just,
it's very inspiring. Um,

653
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,830
and then a lot of the winemakers that I
know in the state as well, there's just,

654
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:47,640
you're watching them go through their
changes and you're watching them go where

655
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:51,180
they discover a new thing about a new
potential of what they can do and how bad,

656
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,940
how much better they can make
it. And, you know, just see.

657
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,550
You just see that process.
That's really inspiring.

658
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,400
Do you watch any of Anthony Bourdain's
TV shows? You know, he is, yeah.

659
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,300
He's, he had a, the no reservations
and show and now the new show is, uh,

660
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,710
his wife trains with Henzel. Yeah. Yeah.
His wife's good man. That's all I saw.

661
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:15,300
I saw their kid training there. Was that
last, that hilarious. Yeah. She's bad ass.

662
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,160
She's a at the fights constantly. Um,
I'd never actually met Anthony, but,

663
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,130
and I've seen some of the shows,
but he's a great guy.

664
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,910
He's heard he has a new one that's kind of
fun. Yes. What is it called? Dead Parts.

665
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:31,680
Unknown parts on them. Yeah. And
it's, it's basically the same show,

666
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,230
but this one he has more control
of and it's, now it's on CNN.

667
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,040
It's got a bigger budget.

668
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,290
But the,
the show,

669
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,520
the one that he had on the travel channel
was the first experience that I had

670
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,230
ever had with chefs.

671
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,760
A guide knew that I liked good food and
I kind of understand that it takes a

672
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,170
special person to make good food,

673
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,070
but I'd never understood how
intensive the processes are,

674
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:56,770
how creative the processes. And, I mean,

675
00:38:56,771 --> 00:39:01,570
he explored some really
boutique restaurants where
these guys grow their own

676
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:06,040
food, hunt their own meat. And
there's a, there's one place in Spain,

677
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,940
I think it was, I think it's closed. It
was called El Bulli where this guy was,

678
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:15,030
this head chef was this legendary guy who
brought in all these amazing chefs and

679
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:18,610
they would just create these
fucking intense works of art,

680
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,790
these small plate works of art that
were just so unique and inspiring.

681
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,680
Maybe want to write jokes, you know,
maybe may, maybe want to expand my comedy.

682
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:29,800
Right.

683
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,520
Retain, you know, you know, but at the
same time there, the, as as intense,

684
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:38,020
they are about those unique dishes. You'll
also catch a eating a bowl of popcorn.

685
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,020
Yes. Yeah. Why not? Well,
Bourdain's a big one on street food.

686
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,590
He loves like street Tacos
and sure. I mean, why not?

687
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,840
Don't be pretentious about it. It's
all about the, the full spectrum of

688
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,030
is Kinda like that film.
Um, perfume, what is that?

689
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,760
Uh, was it dubbed? Yeah.

690
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,150
Um, intense. Uh,

691
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:05,270
a movie about this guy that's
got a perfume, a story of murder,

692
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,590
I think is what the title is, right?
Is that right? Yup. Um, and it,

693
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,000
it starts going off about this
child who was born in poverty, um,

694
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,860
that,
uh,

695
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,150
what had such an incredible sense of
smell. He didn't differentiate, uh,

696
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,480
bad smells from good smells.
He just could smell everything.

697
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:28,160
And he was very good at like deciphering
all these, all these smells there,

698
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,870
but you know, so it's, uh, I'm an,
I'm not going to spoil it for you.

699
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:34,650
You get to see it. I'm not going to watch
it. It's awesome. It, it really good.

700
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,240
This is the trailer right here.
It's pretty awesome. It's uh,

701
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,613
it's pretty intense.

702
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,270
Dude's a creeper. A creeper. It's got to,

703
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:52,410
I think it's got Dustin Hoffman.

704
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,150
I read about a polar bear today that they
train or a dog they trained to smell.

705
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:58,380
If polar bears are pregnant.

706
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,220
You have to just

707
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,510
to stop and think of that.

708
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,750
How specific is that dog trained to
tell if polar bears are pregnant?

709
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,490
So it likes, is it just
kind of sit around? Uh,

710
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,000
almost like a firefighter
kind of went through a fire.

711
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,980
That's powerful.

712
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,633
Ooh,

713
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,080
good movie. You recommend
that. Okay, I'll get something.

714
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,290
I got to fly to Kentucky tomorrow. No
threat. Throw that bitch on the laptop.

715
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,980
It's pretty fun. I,
you'll enjoy it. If you

716
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,420
don't enjoy it, I'll recommend out of
them. What would you on enjoy? Okay.

717
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,980
It sounds like a good deal.

718
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,780
A dog that can smell if
a polar bear is pregnant,

719
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:50,020
they say that the best way to describe
how good a dog's nose is is skunks.

720
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,500
Cause that's the one time where
we can smell parts per million.

721
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,440
A skunk is so the,
the,

722
00:41:56,441 --> 00:42:01,430
the scent is so strong that we actually
can catch that sent from blocks and

723
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:05,900
blocks away. Yeah. Very much like
a dog can smell things. Okay.

724
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,140
Yeah. Which is pretty
interesting way of, uh,

725
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,610
exploring the idea because otherwise it
seems like intangible. Well, when, yeah,

726
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:14,480
when,
uh,

727
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,250
we have have Lena around the Arizona and
as soon as I have on the come anywhere

728
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:22,670
near the vineyard or near their
yard, the dog is up. Yeah.

729
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,310
He could smell them already.
Well, they're scary animals.

730
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,430
Not even in the yard yet and there
they're up in what they can tell.

731
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,780
Those are freaky things,
man.

732
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:33,780
Do you ever seen when they hunt Hava
Lenas it's pretty intense. There's,

733
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,810
they're the one of the few animals that
when you call them, they come running.

734
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,720
Like if you make a sound
like an injured animal,

735
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,840
they don't sort of like
sneak around or try to start.

736
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,000
They come running straight towards that
sound and then they realize there's a

737
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,630
person there that Yikes, they haul it
and turn around and run the other way.

738
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,070
But they supposedly it tastes great.
It tastes like very much like a wild pig.

739
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,300
Yeah. But you, what's one
of those situations where
if you don't, if you don't

740
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,210
feel dressed them properly,
uh,

741
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,360
they've got some weird glands
will just ruin all the meat.

742
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,260
He cut the wrong gland and it's done.
Yeah. Probably the tarsal glands. Yeah,

743
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:17,090
they're stinky fucking animals.
But they have to be, man,

744
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:21,110
they have to be wild hardy bitches.
They live in out there in the desert man.

745
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,790
There's, that's what they look
like just to like a freaky small,

746
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:29,120
wild pig looking thing.
And I keep,

747
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,070
people keep telling me
that they're actually more,

748
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,530
had more in common with a rat pig.
Yeah. But that looks like a tree.

749
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,170
That looks like a fucking pig to me.
Yeah. It looks like a pig to me too.

750
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,280
But I guess a rack kind of looks
like a pig too. They just small.

751
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,000
I have no desire to eat them, so they
must not be a pig because I love a bacon.

752
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,510
They apparently tastes really good.
They taste very much like pig.

753
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,180
Wild pig is supposed to be
the best I've never had.

754
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:55,480
There's got to be silenced in La.

755
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,990
This serves Hev Lena someplace
in La has to serve out her.

756
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,830
Avalina you would assume.
Let's find out.

757
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,700
I bet it's really hard to get
commercial. Have Alina though. You know,

758
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:06,860
you'd have to hire hunters
to go out and get it for you.

759
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,910
And what kind of a supply could you
actually get? What's that place?

760
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,430
It's up in uh, like Malibu.
It's like that kind of, um,

761
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,500
game restaurant. Oh yeah, the
saddle peak lodge I wouldn't have,

762
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,440
yeah, I have it. I don't think
so. I was there recently.

763
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,580
They have like elk and venison and
things along those lines. And Pheasant,

764
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,940
I don't think they have Havoline
is pretty, that's pretty freaky.

765
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:31,440
You got to go to Lake New Mexico
to get a house call and say

766
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,640
step up. Yeah. Call Him and
say, listen man, I'll come in.

767
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,510
If you have Havalina Tako who have a
polar bear periods sniffing dog steaks and

768
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:44,810
have Lena,

769
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:49,810
there was a website that was selling
exotic meat from animals like lions.

770
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:54,990
They were selling like lion meat
and also at Catalina Cantina.

771
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,030
What does that sit down in Arizona.
Oh,

772
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:00,030
did they really sell Havalina
there though? Probably not. No,

773
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,800
that's like a Friday's Tgi Fridays.
You know,

774
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,420
in Arizona it's more like a Thursday.
I said they take a day off really more,

775
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:13,620
a little more laid back. A little longer
weekend. It's hot. Yeah, it's hot.

776
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:17,250
It's fucking the summertime man.
And then you get that Sheriff Arpaio,

777
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,790
Dick Wad that sheriff,
you know who that guy is?

778
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,440
You don't know who sheriff Arpaio is.

779
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,440
You guys have the most controversial
sheriff in the entire country. Uh,

780
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,020
John Down South around Tucson.

781
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,420
He's the guy that puts everybody in
pink underwear and a pink jumpsuits and,

782
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:36,180
and it has the men stay outside and
tense, no air conditioning. It's bad.

783
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,400
Make some work.
Um,

784
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,410
it sounds like it sounds like college.
I think it's more,

785
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:46,890
there's more but fucking than regular
college. Oh, okay. I think it's, uh,

786
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,250
he's just this really controversial,

787
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,010
conservative a guy.
Yeah.

788
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:58,011
I'd see the photo of these guys that
he puts him in this a clean and sober.

789
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:02,860
I guess he had Mike Tyson, uh, in
one of those apparently resting to,

790
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,330
and didn't get knocked the fuck
out. No, I mean, he's pretty,

791
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:09,000
pretty insulated by the
time you get to him.

792
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,360
Quite a few people with guns in the way.
It's true.

793
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,560
But he's a famous for sort of
representing Arizona, you know,

794
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,990
and then we get a lot of,
we have a lot of those people,

795
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,480
like those governor that Jan brewer chick,

796
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:29,430
she's one of the few people that I've
ever seen like give a debate where I was

797
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,080
like, hmm, I could be a governor.

798
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,180
I was listening to her talk and
I was like, I could do that job.

799
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,170
I can definitely beat her. George Bush
wasn't enough. You had to wait to her jam.

800
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:46,110
Bruce? No, I don't think I could
be president of too many skeletons,

801
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,580
but I could be a governor.

802
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,070
I can tell you they'll let you get
away with a few skeletons if you're a

803
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,480
governor. Sure. I mean, none of them are
bad and I've never done any real crimes.

804
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,880
I don't have any bodies or
anything like that as Ooh drawer,

805
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,650
actionable wisdom said a few
things were sort of two things.

806
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,300
Mark come back to haunt me,
but nothing,

807
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:08,040
but I watch her give debates and I'm like,
oh, this is hilarious. And then she won.

808
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,170
I mean I watched a debate
where she was just,

809
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,580
and then you realize you to be
stumped. Yeah, it really is.

810
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,900
I can beat this check I'll have to
do is prepare a little saint hard.

811
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,640
How the fuck did she win? How was she
your governor? How is that? I don't know.

812
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,240
You didn't vote for it to do.
All right.

813
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,150
How far away is the a place
that you trained Jujitsu?
Is it a, a real town? Yeah,

814
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:30,280
it's uh, in Cottonwood, so it's small,

815
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,210
you know,
small Dojo,

816
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,970
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
It used to be one point in time.

817
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:37,340
It was super hard to
find a good Jujitsu jam.

818
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:42,341
Guys would buy like VHS tapes and train
each other and now it's so amazing.

819
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:45,570
There's so many, there's, there's guys in
Prescott now, there's guys in cottonwood.

820
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,940
I think that might be guys in Sedona,

821
00:47:46,941 --> 00:47:49,250
but there's definitely guys in
Prescott and cottonwood. Well,

822
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:53,060
Arizona itself is a huge hotbed
for mixed martial arts. You know,

823
00:47:53,061 --> 00:47:56,300
you've got the lab, which is where
a Benson Henderson comes from.

824
00:47:56,301 --> 00:48:00,860
John crouches place. Then you've
got a power MMA, which is where,

825
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:05,440
you know Erin Simpson, CB. Dot. The way
a lot of like big name MMA fighters.

826
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,460
A lot of guys come out of as a mega
tons. The studios there. Yup. Yup, Yup,

827
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,160
Yup. Yeah, it's a, it's
really interesting how, um,

828
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,900
that sport has a,
it's opened up the door for not,

829
00:48:18,901 --> 00:48:21,170
not be even people that
want to compete in MMA,

830
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:25,350
but people that are just interested
in exploring martial arts. You know,

831
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,450
the amount of legit martial arts schools
is probably at an all time high in this

832
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:30,284
country now.

833
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,800
Yup. Yeah, I would, yeah, I would have,

834
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,460
I would agree that I just got back from
a training with my friends in St Louis

835
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:39,250
that was
hurt my wrist.

836
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,520
Derp derp how much training do you do
when you're on the road? Do you like,

837
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,910
it's harder, way harder.
I mean, if, you know,

838
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,150
if we have a day where we
can go in and train and, uh,

839
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,200
we have like a nice day off or a
day off, you know, two days off,

840
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,280
then I can risk it. But,
you know, to go in and just,

841
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,480
there's what time, you know, when would
you do it on, right. On a show day,

842
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,314
there's just no way.

843
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,470
But you've been involved
in one form or another,

844
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:08,830
at least peripherally in martial arts
for a long fucking time now. Right.

845
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:13,150
You know, I saw a photo of you with Bj
Penn back when he was like a purple belt.

846
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,770
I got,

847
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,770
I got injured in like 2003
or 2002 actually before that.

848
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,880
And then I just kind of compounded and
then I had to just stop around 2000.

849
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:29,430
That was the back thing, right? Yeah. This
is what a, I got drawn out of my blood.

850
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,940
This is the what pushed me over
the top and gave me the flu.

851
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:34,230
I'm gonna pull this up for you.

852
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:37,560
You see this fucking ridiculous amount
of blood they sucked out of my body.

853
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,530
That's, yeah, Jello shots. Let's go. Uh,

854
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,040
that's what they take and heat up and
then spin in the centrifuge and I'll let

855
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:52,470
you know how it works out.
But I've been dealing with a,

856
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:56,940
a back injury for the past
altogether for about four,

857
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,690
four or five years now, but pretty
bad over the last year and a half,

858
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,700
on and off and started getting numbness
in my hands and things along those lines

859
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:09,930
where I was realizing that my nerves
are getting in impeded and smushed.

860
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:12,180
And I realized I had to
do something about it.

861
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,270
So I don't have any of the
symptoms anymore. But, uh,

862
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,060
this is supposed to do an amazing job
here. Yeah, it did in Santa Monica. Okay.

863
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,500
Well they do it in Germany
and that's where I was going.

864
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:26,910
Dana white has been going over there for
it. He has [inaudible] disease, which is,

865
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:29,420
uh, something to do with a in the, the,

866
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:34,421
the inner ear and it makes
Vertigo and tinnitus.

867
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:37,910
He gets like this ringing in his ear and
you're like literally can't stand up,

868
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:38,960
loses his balance.

869
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,610
But the guy who developed
this process in Germany, uh,

870
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,810
trained a bunch of other doctors and
now they're doing it in Santa Monica as

871
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:52,100
well. So I just went in today,
you're my Guinea pig then I'm in,

872
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,710
I just got the first, uh, injections
today, but I'm with Ya. Old dudes

873
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,580
back problems.
So I look,

874
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:05,270
so one thing that does soc about, about
trainings that your, you know, your body,

875
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,270
your vehicle,
it's not a race car to assist flesh,

876
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,550
just in general wrestling and Jujitsu.
It's just,

877
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,200
it's just brutal. It's not, you know,

878
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,610
it's not just going into a
gym and there's a, there's a,

879
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,910
there's a direction at this weight
machine moves and that's it. Yeah,

880
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,850
it's every direction.

881
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:27,870
That's why it's so critical to find
good training partners. You know?

882
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,600
It's just like we were talking
about cultivating good friends,

883
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,360
cultivating good training
partners is another one.

884
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,980
Like there's a few guys had a 10th planet
Jiu Jitsu that I know I can count on

885
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:40,070
to not spazz out to be tested.

886
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,770
And I'm still learning that,
you know,

887
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:45,730
even even now it's like I'm so used to
my wrestling background where it's like

888
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:50,290
go, go, go and I'm having to go slow,

889
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,300
slow,
slow.

890
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,010
Yeah. If you ever watch like
really high level guys go at it.

891
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,340
One of the more fascinating aspects of
it is it looks like there's very little

892
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:04,810
effort being applied,
you know,

893
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,780
especially when they're sparring a little
bit more. So when they're competing,

894
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:09,520
when they're competing, you
know, they're going after it.

895
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,140
But when they're sparring,

896
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:13,990
like a lot of times these guys
are just sort of rolling around.

897
00:52:13,991 --> 00:52:18,730
It seems like they're flowing
like walk, walk, walk, walk.

898
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,870
Never give the guy a position where
he could sprint to the finish line,

899
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:27,850
always make him that he's got four or
five steps before he can sprint because a

900
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:32,100
regular person won't see the difference
between that, between the, the,

901
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,700
the what it looks like casual rolling.
And even though they're casually rolling,

902
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:40,930
he's always going to be two or three spots
away from the finish line. It's chess.

903
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:45,340
Yeah, it really is. And that's
something that I've found, uh,

904
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,760
like we were talking about things
that inspire you creatively. I,

905
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,160
I get inspired by people who have
a lot of discipline for Jujitsu.

906
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,330
I get inspired by people that are, you
know, constantly creating and, and,

907
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,360
and putting,

908
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:04,230
putting a new slant on that in that
Jujitsu is very much an art form.

909
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,850
I mean,
the word martial art,

910
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,620
it seems wrong to people that don't
participate in it. Like the word art,

911
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,930
it seems like the wrong thing.
But when you do it,

912
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:18,931
you realize like if you watch it and
you see if you have an aptitude for you

913
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:22,600
understand it and you see what's going
on and then you watch someone's really

914
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:27,450
good at it, it becomes beautiful. And then
it does become an art. It is something,

915
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,900
not just an art as far as like
something creative but in art,

916
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,980
like as in something
visually beautiful and very,

917
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,320
very inspirational man,
I think.

918
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:42,420
And it's also another one of those
things that I think like creating wine,

919
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:45,590
like putting together a band,
like putting together a comedy act,

920
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,580
like writing a novel, like these things
that we do when we put our, our, our,

921
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:55,240
our thoughts and our creativity
into something, they sort of, they,

922
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:58,140
they don't just exist in a vacuum,

923
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,500
but they sort of enhance all the
other aspects of our life too.

924
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,310
I agree. Yeah. And just in
general, I mean there's the,

925
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:11,090
just that whole just physical aspect of
making the blood go through your system

926
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:15,050
and then being in shape, you just
start, you start thinking more clearly.

927
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:18,090
You're more creative. Uh, you can Kinda,

928
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,400
you can kind of solve puzzles better
if you're just, if you're, if I notice,

929
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:25,430
if I just, I just needed a break.
I just started slouching off.

930
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:30,560
It starts to kind of compound. If they
don't get back into something, walking,

931
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:35,120
running, no job. Do you ever fuck
around with Yoga? A little bit. Yeah.

932
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:38,320
I need to do more. That's one of those
things that I just feel like it's the,

933
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,583
that's the,

934
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,010
that's the on the to do list that I just
keep being embarrassed about having to

935
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:45,830
put it on the next to do list.
Yeah.

936
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:49,310
That's one of those things that everybody
always says to, I need to do more yoga.

937
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,050
I, we talk, we talk about Yoga and, Oh
God, I need to do, it's, it's a, it's an,

938
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:58,660
it's an, it's an absolute
embarrassing reality. I ha it's,

939
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,760
I have to do more yoga. Yeah. I, uh,

940
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,880
couple good DVDs,
so I slapped in the laptop on the road.

941
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,310
It's a very satisfying thing to do,

942
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:12,550
to work out in a hotel room completely
alone and do just a whole yoga class

943
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:15,080
through a laptop.
When you get through it,

944
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,830
it's a real feeling of accomplishment
because I could have just ate Doritos and

945
00:55:18,831 --> 00:55:20,250
watch TV and stuff is what I

946
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,820
did last night.
Yeah,

947
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,230
it was actually a Swedish fish. It wasn't
treatise Swedish fish. Those are rare.

948
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,290
When you have those nearby,
it's really tough to say no to them.

949
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,320
That's what I'm saying. Like,
Ooh, Swedish, I can pay,

950
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:37,230
I can do yoga or I can have
these. Well, you could do both.

951
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,210
That's where it gets hard.
I was out of town,

952
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:43,200
so you know when I'm in a hotel
out of town and my wife's mental,

953
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,160
wherever she is,

954
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,180
it's my opportunity to watch like all
the stupid movies that she just won't

955
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:52,470
watch while I'm around. Like what?
I watched that new a Riddick buoy.

956
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,880
I saw that.
I saw that with my daughter.

957
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,350
She was looking at me like, what the
fuck did you take me to say? I'm like,

958
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:05,050
I'm sorry. It's so awful to
watch the whole thing so bad.

959
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:10,320
The whole, yeah. It was one of the
worst moves laughing the whole time,

960
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,440
laughing at myself and knowing
that like she's probably laughing.

961
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,180
Knowing that it sucks
so bad and here I am.

962
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:18,080
I like watching the whole thing and
just laughing at myself for watching it.

963
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:21,690
The craziest thing is the first
one was really good, you know,

964
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:24,010
and I tried to explain that to my 17

965
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,970
year old after we saw it, which was
like the first one was good near dark.

966
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:33,340
It was a good fucking movie,
good scary science fiction movie.

967
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,620
But somewhere along the line, what
is this number? 34 as for I think,

968
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,080
I can't tell you how many
times I've watched chronicles.

969
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,040
Is chronicles good idle while
my wife doesn't think so.

970
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:52,090
There's something going on now, man
with science fiction movies where there,

971
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,350
there's so much CGI and they can get
away with doing so much on the screen

972
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,600
visually that I'm detached.

973
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,770
I'm not feeling like I went to see star
track the last star trek one into the

974
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:04,960
darkness, whatever the fuck
it was. And I was like,

975
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:06,730
this is just a bunch of things happening.

976
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:11,610
I have no connection at
all to any of these panels.
Pretty connected, but not bad.

977
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,200
Yeah.
But the last one was just like,

978
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,800
it's just a series of things
happening in front of you. Well,

979
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:22,210
you don't give a fuck. Right.
You know, it's just, they're,
they're, they're almost,

980
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,920
I get, well I guess, you know, it comes
down back to the art. Yeah. If you,

981
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,970
if you see somebody taking even a
mediocre script and just running with it,

982
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,090
you see when you see an
artist kind of ticking those,

983
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:40,110
being able to tell those stories too
where you just believe it. You know, I,

984
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,760
I don't know if I use this example
with you last time, but, um,

985
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,540
I just saw it again,
this a,

986
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:50,541
this season of sons of anarchy watching
Kim coats fully get an erection over.

987
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:56,200
I'm Walton Goggins and drag and
it's just, you know, it's, you know,

988
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:59,450
a while and God says fake tits
and he's, you know, like a mass,

989
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,220
cause he's trying to get
his son back and you know,

990
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:04,810
the lipsticks all smeared
and, and like, you know,

991
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:08,440
Kim Coates is trying to figure out how
he's going to date this dude. He's just,

992
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,540
it's just such an awkward,
but they completely sell it like,

993
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,650
like all the way you're,
you're convinced like that.

994
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,380
He loves her and it's like not a her,

995
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:22,650
it's Walton Goggins and with fake boobs.
There you go.

996
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,580
That's hilarious. I haven't given
a choice to try to find a shot of,

997
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:31,060
of Kim coats staring at staring
at him. Her, it's an incredible,

998
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,240
and now as he supposed to be a
transsexual or transgender or trends,

999
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,020
uh, I think, I think, uh,

1000
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,430
I think she still has her previous
equipment but also has tits.

1001
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:48,610
So are the tits, those are their
implants or their hormones? Implants.

1002
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:53,440
I Dunno. Hmm. They don't
specify. No, probably. They
don't really say, I don't think.

1003
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:54,820
Yeah.

1004
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,740
The only thing they'll throw you off
with those things is the dimple size and

1005
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:02,620
jet men generally don't have the
right nipples for boobs like that.

1006
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,370
So when you see him and they
used to be a man, can I go,

1007
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,310
just trying to give you advice, Bro.
Thanks. Get Dark. Don't get sensitive.

1008
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:18,340
If she gets weird trend transgender
communities. Therefore you,

1009
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,220
he sound like you've done a lot of
research on I have, unfortunately,

1010
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,423
I'm fascinated

1011
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,150
by a gender identity.
I'm fascinated by people who

1012
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,580
decide that they think you'll love it
and you can see why they brought their,

1013
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,140
he's, he's got his arm
around her now. Wow. Awesome.

1014
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:41,210
Um, what'd, you can see why when it
first came up, they were just using this,

1015
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,230
this tranny to blackmail a dude.
And even in that scene,

1016
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,660
the character tig,

1017
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,770
Kim's like just was so
distracted by what was like,

1018
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,380
they were supposed to just be
doing this job and he's just,

1019
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:59,381
he was so fascinated with this person
and you could see why the writer put it,

1020
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:05,020
put it back in to a later season because
anybody who's watching that show and

1021
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:10,730
bring her back, that was
awesome. And now he's now oh wow.

1022
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,910
Boom. Oh Wow. How did they do that?

1023
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,770
So that's the dude from the shield. Yeah.
Yeah. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. And a,

1024
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:23,470
and a justified, I'm missing
out. I need to start.

1025
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,040
He's one of my favorite actors,

1026
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:27,950
but I think he's a great actor
that they can act his ass off.

1027
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:31,950
He was fantastic in the shield to
are they on like season? What season?

1028
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,590
Like six or seven. Yeah. I can't catch up
now. It's too late. It's just daunting.

1029
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,490
It's too much once. Yeah.
I Dunno. I can't, I don't,

1030
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,660
do you watch anything else on TV? The
stupid no I cause I, I mean I watch,

1031
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:47,630
I watch all kinds of stupid shows but
I'm always looking at like if I find out

1032
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,970
there's an actor that I like in a thing,

1033
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,390
I want to see how they're dealing with
the puzzle they've been dealt. That's,

1034
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,910
that's my, that's kind of
like why I'm even watching it.

1035
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,940
I'm just want to see the craft of or you
hear a rumor of like watch this fucker

1036
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:03,870
unravel. Like cause you
can, he had some, he slips.

1037
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,250
This particular actor is having some
issues so you'll want to watch the show to

1038
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:11,050
watch his feet can see if he could get
a whiff of the crazy coming off them.

1039
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,900
Like what do you mean? Like, yeah,

1040
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,470
maybe they are getting into pills or
something and kind of looking just seemed

1041
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,220
just trying to hold it together.
And you can also like two episodes later,

1042
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:22,400
there's like a new character that could
potentially take over that person's

1043
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:26,990
position. Oh, that's fine. I think in a
building it into the script to go. Okay,

1044
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,760
so you add the background,
you have a little flavor.
Yeah. Just to see how they're,

1045
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:35,090
just see how that's gone. Well
that's a, that's a common issue.

1046
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:39,130
Especially the pills. Yeah. It's poor
fucks. Yeah. And it's hard to want the,

1047
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,730
you know,
I have a lot of friends that are,

1048
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,440
that go through that
kind of stuff and it's,

1049
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:45,440
that's one of the hardest things
to get out of your system.

1050
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,310
You'd probably rather,
you know,

1051
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:52,040
you're better off trying to get off heroin
because the pills just go deep. Yeah.

1052
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:55,960
When the pills essentially our heroin,
heroin, I mean that's what they are.

1053
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:00,050
They're, they're their opiates and they
leave a lot. They do do damage. Yeah.

1054
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,880
Nature damage. And they prescribed
them like they're giving out free gum.

1055
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:05,590
I mean it's,

1056
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:09,740
it's amazing how many
people are on prescription
painkillers in this country and

1057
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:12,290
how many of those painkillers or
opiates and how many of those people are

1058
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:15,830
addicted to those
opioids. So we're, we're,

1059
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,590
we're fucking weird when it comes
to that man. Without a doubt.

1060
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,250
That's of the most disturbing aspects

1061
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,850
of our society. The uh, amount
of pills that people consume.

1062
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,230
No, it's a, it's dark. And
when you see someone, yeah,

1063
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,620
they had a cardiac care can I
started right? Kind of, you know,

1064
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:33,160
like about a generation
before us with the Valium

1065
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:37,230
[inaudible] sudden sure. Rolling
Stones Song. Mother's little helper.

1066
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:41,820
Yeah. She goes running for
the shelter. Yeah. That's a,

1067
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:45,730
that's when they first found out that
you could live a shitty life and,

1068
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:50,600
and get through it with some sort of
medication and just medicate yourself and

1069
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,270
dull the angst and dull the,
the desire for,

1070
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,160
to free yourself from this fucking hell
she existence and, or just do something.

1071
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:03,300
You could definitely do that
to just go do something. Yeah.

1072
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:06,600
I wonder how long it's going to take
society figured out as a whole to,

1073
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:08,800
that'll be a thing of the past without,
yeah.

1074
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,730
Expecting to be compensated for it.
Just do it because you want to do it.

1075
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:17,660
Yeah. No, that's great
advice for some people.

1076
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:20,480
I think they have a hard time finding
something that they actually enjoy doing

1077
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:21,460
too.
Well you're so kind

1078
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,870
addition to it wants stuff and to have,
you know,

1079
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:28,180
like the fluff around it from
the glory days or whatever.

1080
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,250
He forget that just,
you know,

1081
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:35,170
work harder for less to just enjoy your,
what you do

1082
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,440
you have children now? I have,
I have a son. He's 17, 18.

1083
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,790
What does it like, like
seeing someone who, you know,

1084
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:48,230
you created who's about to enter
into this crazy world as a,

1085
01:03:48,231 --> 01:03:51,090
an an independent,
I mean it's essentially a,

1086
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:56,090
on his way to being a man
is 18 is basically at the
launching block of manhood.

1087
01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:00,550
Well, you know, he's
way smarter than I am,

1088
01:04:00,551 --> 01:04:05,050
so there is no, I don't have any
worries about him finding his way.

1089
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,850
He's intuitive. He's um, uh, personable.

1090
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,780
He is good at understanding
social dynamics,

1091
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:18,190
but he's extremely smart. You know, he
wants to go into a chemistry and biology,

1092
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:23,110
so, but he's also an incredible
cello player, so, wow. Um,

1093
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:27,570
he'd got a scholarship to play cello
for a performance of high school, uh,

1094
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,510
for cello. And so, but he's not going to
pursue cello for his college. He just,

1095
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:36,280
that's just an extra thing he does and
he rocks at it. So I don't have any,

1096
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:41,080
I guess part of it is when you,
my parents are,

1097
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:46,200
my dad is just a very active person,
very smart man and uh,

1098
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,680
and healthy. And so when
I see him, when you know,

1099
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,740
when you kind of know where you are,
where you've been,

1100
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:55,240
you know where you're going.

1101
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:00,040
So I have feeling that's just
having my son see what I did,

1102
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:05,080
see what my, my dad has
done. He's, he has in a way,

1103
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:10,000
he has a good compass. Um,
good navigation skills.

1104
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,270
Yeah. I mean, the only
concern that I have,

1105
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:18,271
the big concern is that children today
are up with so many more variables than

1106
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:24,630
we ever did and also much more potential
for quicker learning because of the

1107
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:30,640
Internet. And, and with that, again, more
potential, more and more possibilities,

1108
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:34,060
more variables, more things to
think about. It's like more,

1109
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:36,880
more that could potentially
be overwhelming. Right.

1110
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:40,070
And I, and I think most kids are,
I think there's, you know this,

1111
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,380
my father was a high school teacher and
by the time he retired it was basically

1112
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:46,210
because um,

1113
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:50,080
they kind of pushed him out to get into
new person who wasn't going to question

1114
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,390
the curriculum.
He was very,

1115
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:55,990
he was very adamant about making the
people who came into that classroom.

1116
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:59,560
You had to make an effort in his classroom
to pass the class. You couldn't coast.

1117
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:02,710
It wasn't anything,
it was like a multiple choice question.

1118
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:06,400
You were answering the questions
and you had to know the material.

1119
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,990
Then you had to be on time. You had
to put in over the course of the year,

1120
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:15,100
you were also doing homework and coming
in with completed thoughts that were,

1121
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,550
that counted towards your grades.

1122
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,410
Then if you didn't complete all aspects
of that in his class, you didn't do well.

1123
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:21,241
Yeah.

1124
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:26,220
If there's any one thing that you can
in instill in a child that's going to

1125
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:31,221
guarantee them a healthier existence
is an appreciation for work and a pure

1126
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:36,360
appreciation for accomplishing things,
calm setting and accomplishing goals.

1127
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,101
So,

1128
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:42,680
so few kids are ever
indoctrinated into that,

1129
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,780
that sort of the way of life.

1130
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,001
No,
we didn't.

1131
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:52,001
We didn't get to school unless he got up
at 6:00 AM and snow blowed the driveway

1132
01:06:52,191 --> 01:06:54,080
in the winter.
We weren't going to work.

1133
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,910
Where'd you guys live? Boston. Michigan,
Michigan. Yeah. I lived in Boston.

1134
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,860
Same.
Same sort of situation.

1135
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,510
Yeah. You know, our driveway
was almost a quarter mile long,

1136
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:07,580
so we didn't snow blow the driveway.

1137
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,340
We weren't getting to the main
road that was hopefully plowed

1138
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,380
a quarter mile of snow
blowing. Holy Shit. Well,

1139
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:19,330
luckily it was snow blowing
and not shoveling. Yeah,
mother fucker. Yeah. A quarter.

1140
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:22,420
And you're dealing with
some serious snow up there.

1141
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:26,630
Yeah. Cause it's on the Lake Michigan
side, so you get a lot of, oh wow.

1142
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:31,250
It's fucking cold. My uh, senior year,
we had seven days of school in January.

1143
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:36,430
What's that? That's hilarious. Lizard
would hit on Sunday or Monday and boom.

1144
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:40,510
Done Til Thursday. Tell me though,
how awesome were snow days growing up?

1145
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,860
That's one thing. People
in California, Arizona Spo,

1146
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,550
mountain dew and red licorice,

1147
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,850
I used to look out that window
and if I saw like a foot on,

1148
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,520
on the car outside park,
I'll be like, fuck yeah.

1149
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,360
And then you would call that number and
it was a number. They would, you know,

1150
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:58,780
they would,

1151
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,580
they would list off the different towns
where school was cancelled and if they

1152
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:06,790
got to Newton,
I would go fuck yes.

1153
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:11,210
Who was just this huge radius the day.
Yeah.

1154
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:12,460
I was a beautiful thing.

1155
01:08:12,461 --> 01:08:16,820
And it was also the thing that I really
appreciate lot about a grown up in a

1156
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,050
really fucking cold place despite,
uh,

1157
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,510
on top of learning that,
you know,

1158
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:28,430
there's a good to having really
fucking cold snowy days. And that's,

1159
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:33,100
you really appreciate the sunny
days. A different vigor, you know,

1160
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,500
seasons. Yeah. But there's also the quiet,

1161
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:41,780
there was a weird quiet when everything's
covered in snow that I don't think

1162
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:44,570
anybody will ever appreciate
unless they experience it. Oh yeah.

1163
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:49,571
It's amazing when you're out there
and it's like a full on snow storm and

1164
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:52,130
there's just a foot and a
half of snow on the ground.

1165
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:55,850
The trees are covered with snow.
You don't hear shit.

1166
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,930
It's this weird eerie rigging silence.

1167
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,630
Yeah. Cause it's a different, you
know, if it's, if it's a rainstorm,

1168
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,670
of course you're hearing the rain.
Yeah. Just that floating snow,

1169
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:10,610
big chunks coming down. It's almost like
an incredible sound barrier. Yeah. Yeah.

1170
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,540
Absorbs everything. And you're
just like, you're such a like,

1171
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,730
like an isolation tank.

1172
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:15,531
Yeah.

1173
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:18,710
You hear like every now and then you
hit a car and the distance trying to get

1174
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:19,544
out of a driveway.
Right.

1175
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,463
Ooh.

1176
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:27,370
Or your name and long ago
fucker wold start. Yeah.

1177
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:32,140
I grew up in this area that was across
the street from a river. And uh, we, we,

1178
01:09:32,141 --> 01:09:35,050
it was a fairly rural area.
And um,

1179
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:39,610
this a giant park and the river was
across the street from my house and the

1180
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:44,300
street was a pretty steep and every time
it would snow or especially if it would

1181
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:49,301
rain the street would become a hockey
rink and I would watch cars drive down the

1182
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,180
hill and just right when
they got to my house,

1183
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:55,720
that'd be losing control into your room,
bouncing off curbs.

1184
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:59,230
I F I think there's something
to learn about that.

1185
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,640
Then there's something about dealing with
weather that I think is healthy for a

1186
01:10:03,641 --> 01:10:05,320
person.
Healthy for your character.

1187
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,460
Well I haven't driven a
car in snow and you know,

1188
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:11,530
decades or for any length of time,

1189
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:16,390
but in Jerome we get snow in the winter
and it's amazing to me how people just

1190
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:20,200
cannot drive in it. Yeah. We get it
every year, you know, a little bit,

1191
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:23,320
sometimes a lot more. But having to, like,

1192
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,970
I immediately just get in my jeep and I
go up to a point in the town where it's

1193
01:10:27,971 --> 01:10:31,780
the problem spot and just park and wait
because there was somebody that can't

1194
01:10:31,781 --> 01:10:36,730
get up the hill or around the bend because
I just can't understand not to slam

1195
01:10:36,731 --> 01:10:39,730
on the gas.
So you parking weight to help people?

1196
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:43,050
Yeah cause cause they're good because,
well I'm helping, you know I'm not,

1197
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,470
don't you know I'm not to,

1198
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,430
here we go stuff at one of those
ones where they do the crash thing.

1199
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:55,000
Not because I'm like some
kind of, you know, helping,

1200
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,630
helping hand type guy did this.
Oh Jesus Christ,

1201
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,460
the guys getting [inaudible].

1202
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:08,120
The cool thing about though
about accidents and the
snow is they just sort of

1203
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:12,560
bump into each other and slide around.
There's no one's glued onto the ground.

1204
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:14,160
So it's the same kind of impact.

1205
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,790
Right.
Well you know I,

1206
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,550
I go up there to help them out
just because I know if I don't,

1207
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:22,390
there's going to be like 20 cars behind
them. They can't get where they're going.

1208
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:27,160
So it's just like, it's just more a
matter of like bringing a plunger to the,

1209
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,420
to the shit show.

1210
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,570
This is a certain amount
of camaraderie too, when,

1211
01:11:31,571 --> 01:11:35,320
when things like that happened snow and
people have to help push people's cars

1212
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:39,040
at a spots and things long.
That's another thing that people don't,

1213
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,910
don't deal with an la, the
lack of weather in La. It's,

1214
01:11:42,911 --> 01:11:47,110
I think one of the reasons why people
are so cocky because they never get

1215
01:11:47,111 --> 01:11:49,710
humbled. This is your
fucking rain here. You know?

1216
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,920
I remember after the
earthquake in [inaudible] 94
is just when I moved here in

1217
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:54,970
93 whatever it was,

1218
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,350
I moved here right after that happened
and I remember people were so nice,

1219
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,620
they were so humble. It was
a weird thing. It was like,

1220
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:04,240
it brought people
together for a little bit.

1221
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:09,030
So that was a strange experience to,
yeah. You know, I was all, you know,

1222
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,330
Steve Martin, the jury out in the backyard
with my dogs in front of me. Like,

1223
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:12,661
you know,

1224
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:17,661
like hearing the trees just like
creaking around at all the car alarms,

1225
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:20,910
like a symphony of car alarms going off.
It was crazy.

1226
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:24,210
Like hearing the glass shattered
everywhere. Freak me out.

1227
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:27,320
Yeah, I missed it. I came, I
came right after it happened,

1228
01:12:27,321 --> 01:12:30,800
but I got caught in one
of the bigger aftershocks.

1229
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:35,840
I was in an apartment on North
Hollywood and my apartment moved around.

1230
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:38,870
The best way I could describe it
as if it was a refrigerator box.

1231
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:42,230
It just went side to side,
side to side side.

1232
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:46,700
It's like it was made of nothing
and I was just going holy shit

1233
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,500
by like, uh, um, Lankershim
Vineland and camera. Yeah,

1234
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,970
yeah, yeah. That's what I was,

1235
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:56,210
that's where I lived right behind the
blockbuster there by the Firestone. Yeah.

1236
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:58,190
I was like, uh, just uh,

1237
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,490
I guess it would be just
east of Laurel Canyon,

1238
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:06,040
like deep down, like more park.
I was, I'm more park. Yeah.

1239
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,360
You weren't that you weren't that far
from me and know that fucking thing

1240
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,880
outside nude with my dog as a Merkin

1241
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,050
freaked the fuck out.
Yeah.

1242
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,970
And there was that feeling about like
Los Angeles then where people were

1243
01:13:19,971 --> 01:13:22,580
humbled, you know, they were like
a little nicer to each other.

1244
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:27,840
And I felt that again in New York right
after September 11th, I remember a,

1245
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,370
I lived in New York in the
early nineties. And then, uh,

1246
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,690
when I went back to New York, I
remember, uh, like California,

1247
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:40,520
I'm thinking that people in California
were like a lot more mellow and nicer

1248
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:43,310
than people in New York and people in New
York always had that sort of hard edge

1249
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:46,580
to it. But when I went after
September 11th, that edge was gone.

1250
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:51,320
There was this warmth to people in New
York and a friendliness that I hadn't

1251
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:55,310
ever experienced before. I was like,
this is really interesting. I'm like,

1252
01:13:55,311 --> 01:13:56,750
there's a real tangible,

1253
01:13:56,751 --> 01:14:01,751
positive impact that this tragedy has
had is that people are appreciating each

1254
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:06,710
other more people are silver lining.
Yeah. The, I think, you know,

1255
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,870
it's almost like people need perspective.

1256
01:14:08,871 --> 01:14:12,070
They need to see negative to positive.

1257
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:17,071
You need to see those shitty Michigan
winters to appreciate a good summer day in

1258
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:20,470
California. Every day is a great summer
day. Today was a great summer day.

1259
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,550
It's fucking November 4th it's
82 degrees outside. You know,

1260
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,800
we're, we're a little spoiled when
it comes to that. People need nature.

1261
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,790
They need to see it and you know,
fucking rainstorm,

1262
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,340
just kick your ass just to let you know,

1263
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:38,140
like it's fucking thing can
come down on you. And anytime

1264
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:45,070
I have no point, that's where it ends.
I liked it. It's true though, right?

1265
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,200
I think that's the one curse. It's
almost like being born rich, you know,

1266
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:54,170
you ain't never have to deal with
adversity in California. There's a,

1267
01:14:54,171 --> 01:14:58,360
a lack of appreciation for the fact
that you're actually on a planet,

1268
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:02,710
that you're actually a part of nature.
You know, just, there's no seasons here,

1269
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,960
so you don't really get the
chance to see that change.

1270
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:09,430
So what a perfect place to put the,
the factory of all things fake.

1271
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,990
You know?
I mean,

1272
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:14,710
if you really wanted to think about a
great way to fuck up a culture, right?

1273
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:14,981
You know,

1274
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:19,981
just take a spot where the weather never
changes and then put cameras on people

1275
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:22,870
and pretend they're interesting.
Pretend they're amazing.

1276
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:27,790
Give them lines to say that the winds too
fucking stupid. Oh yeah. Convinced them.

1277
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:31,810
Give them cocaine.
Give them tons of money for pretending.

1278
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:36,330
Confuses the shit out of everybody and
make it so that they get in line first at

1279
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,140
a clubs. Everybody lets them in. They,

1280
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:42,640
they throw velvet carpet down and they
walk on them and everybody cheers.

1281
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:47,110
Confused the fuck out of everybody.
Right. This is the spot. And by the way,

1282
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:52,060
it never rains and it never rains.
Rain and Arizona this year did it.

1283
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,840
Yeah. And a lot of good rain. Yeah.

1284
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:58,860
Arizona doesn't get much
props, man. It's not like when,

1285
01:15:58,861 --> 01:16:01,180
when people talk about the
cool spots in this country,

1286
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:04,660
Arizona doesn't get much props
unless you're on, you know,

1287
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,540
unless you're on a vision quest,
unless you're on a vision quest.

1288
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,960
Let's look for some solid payoti.
Yup.

1289
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:15,870
Some San Pedro cactus and a
good sweat lodge. That's pretty,

1290
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:19,390
you try to find your spirit. That's
for the kids. That's for the kids.

1291
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,030
I don't fuck with that.
Payoti I've never fucked with Payoti.

1292
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,590
I've heard mixed mixed reviews.
Um,

1293
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,720
hi. You know, maybe, maybe, uh,

1294
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:34,530
I had a balls friend who had a
good experience on it. Oh yeah.

1295
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,250
Did he look like you?
A little bit. Not then.

1296
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:45,160
Not quite then. Yeah. I'm but more of
a mushroom guy myself, mushrooms and,

1297
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:50,010
and tryptamines. But a, hey,
snub my nose. It no pod.

1298
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,200
This pod is a weird one too, because you
can actually own legally own the cactus.

1299
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,320
Not just own it,
but you can buy it at hardware stores.

1300
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:02,490
You'd go to Home Depot and get San Pedro
Cactus and I'm pretty sure that's how

1301
01:17:02,491 --> 01:17:05,480
you make it. Right. I
don't know. I was with,

1302
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:10,190
I was with some indigenous
people who invited me into their

1303
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:14,990
ceremony, so it was quite,
quite a special moment. Right?

1304
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,940
Yeah.
I have no personal experience,

1305
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:21,941
but I have one friend that did it and
said that he was in an apartment building

1306
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:27,160
and he was listening to people talk that
were easily five blocks away and he was

1307
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,550
listening to every word out
of their mouth. And he could,

1308
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,990
he couldn't believe that he could hear it,

1309
01:17:32,991 --> 01:17:36,230
but he was absolutely sure that
he could hear it. God bless him,

1310
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,150
God bless pot

1311
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:44,270
and woke up with one of those orange
cones stuffed in his ear. Good.

1312
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:50,540
No, he woke up trying to figure out
whether or not it was a dream. You know?

1313
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,470
That's, uh, that's the problem with
those hallucinogen is experiences,

1314
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,620
even if it's an incredible
beneficial experience,

1315
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:01,820
there's that wrestling match or were
you like, was it real? What was that?

1316
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,710
And I'm trying,

1317
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:08,600
I try to get people to look at
psychedelic experiences as this way.

1318
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,840
Like whether it was real
or whether it wasn't real,

1319
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,700
the experience was exactly the same.

1320
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:18,980
So if you took mushrooms and truly did
go to another dimension and communicate

1321
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:20,840
with ultimate knowledge and,
and,

1322
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:24,770
and then then and tune into
the love of the universe,

1323
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:28,190
tune into the frequency of,
of life and of,

1324
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,170
of progress and,
or whether it happened in your mind,

1325
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,270
it's still the same experience.
Right?

1326
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,500
And it, but you know, I would, if
people are going to do those things, uh,

1327
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,320
I think it goes back to what you were
talking about before about understanding,

1328
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,760
you know, preparation for this thing
you're going to do. Having respect for it,

1329
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:53,330
to having absolute respect for it and
understand what you're getting into and

1330
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:58,220
understanding when you get, you know,
wherever you go, uh, understanding,

1331
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,150
uh,
how to handle it.

1332
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:06,170
Just to kind of us finding us a center
in yourself that can you kind of handle

1333
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:10,310
what it is you're seeing and try
to stay out of fear in a moment.

1334
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,790
Stay away from fear and just
to, you know, just prepare.

1335
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:17,270
If you're going to do those kinds of
things. Just prepare for the journey,

1336
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:19,960
prepare for the journey
and learn how to let go.

1337
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:21,580
And if you are going to do those things,

1338
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:25,630
do it hopefully with somebody who knows
what the fuck they're doing because if

1339
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:29,980
you start messing with that stuff and
neither one of you know what you're both

1340
01:19:29,981 --> 01:19:34,590
going to be under that, that, that fog of
fear. Right? You're both going to be tech.

1341
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:37,690
But if one guy's like, dude,
trust me, I've been here before,

1342
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,470
I know how to get out of this neck of
the woods. Right. Going to be okay.

1343
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,360
All right. How much benefit have you had
personally from psychedelic experiences?

1344
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:51,950
Um, I didn't, you know, I didn't
really, uh, do a lot of it. Um,

1345
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,810
compared to people that I knew that
did a lot of it and didn't make it out,

1346
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,050
didn't make it out. He has a
lot of guys, you know, you know,

1347
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:02,300
you've met them and you've met
those kind of people that just,

1348
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:07,290
they didn't quite make it out and
it's Kinda twisted him for, for life.

1349
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:12,660
How many people do you know like
that? Dozens. We'll, yeah. Holy Shit.

1350
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:14,850
Just, you know, they're just
not, they're never going to,

1351
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,260
just because of the whole nature of how
it breaks down some of those barriers

1352
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:21,870
between your left and right brain.
Um,

1353
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,070
just metaphorically, you know, just, uh,

1354
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,890
just how you think about
your creative processes.

1355
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,460
They can never quite get their feedback
on the ground to understand what it,

1356
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:36,570
what it means to actually, uh,
do a thing rather than just,

1357
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:39,930
you know,
imagine a thing.

1358
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:41,711
So,
you know,

1359
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:45,760
dozens of people like that and wouldn't
know what was it was a lego series of

1360
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:49,810
trips or was it like, did just did too
much, too much, too much, too long.

1361
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:54,640
Just lived in that world for too long.
Yeah. That is, it didn't prepare again,

1362
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:57,070
doesn't prepare for what they
were going to do. And See,

1363
01:20:57,071 --> 01:21:01,570
and Mckenna always had the best
advice when it came to psychedelics.

1364
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,940
Large doses. Infrequently.
Right, right. And, and prepare,

1365
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:11,770
prepare and don't do it all the time.
Do it and then process,

1366
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,160
figure out what,
what can you get out of this yet

1367
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:19,080
again, it's contrast you whatever you,
whatever it, whatever journey you took,

1368
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:22,620
even if not on the psychedelics, see
if it, if it's like just some tire,

1369
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:27,870
you're going to go for a month
to be silent in some, you know,

1370
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:32,300
some spiritual place and
introspection and you know,

1371
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,210
do a fast or whatever. You don't want to
do what you don't want to do that like,

1372
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,700
you know,
12 months out of the year that doesn't,

1373
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:42,660
they don't have any contrast
with anything. Just go do
it, get intense about it,

1374
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,170
prepare for it before you go and then B,

1375
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:50,210
and then be ready to take a while to come
out of it when you are coming back and

1376
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:52,050
then you live your normal life.

1377
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:58,200
Do you feel like you creating wine or
when you're putting together a DVD or when

1378
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:58,411
you,

1379
01:21:58,411 --> 01:22:03,411
when you take on a project that you're
kind of on a journey like that as well?

1380
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:05,223
But absolutely.
Yeah.

1381
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,490
Everything, everything that uh,
yeah, everything that I've done this,

1382
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,220
there's been some element of
preparation attached to it.

1383
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,870
It's not something I just dive into

1384
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,880
and then every time those
things are accomplished,

1385
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:18,340
there's this feeling of
reinforcement of the process.

1386
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:19,920
Yeah, I mean you, you know,

1387
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:23,160
everybody has a way to check themselves
into thinking they're right or you know,

1388
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:28,050
kind of consistently put up particular
process and to get some results back that

1389
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,760
reinforces the behavior. But you
know, aside from that, if he just,

1390
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:37,761
if you're just preparing a properly that
there's definitely a satisfaction from,

1391
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:41,540
you know, coming from, you know, even
even the happy accidents along the way.

1392
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:44,070
Things you learned that you didn't
think you were going to learn stuff.

1393
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:46,630
That was actually a challenge
that he hadn't prepared for it,

1394
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,850
but you managed to get through.

1395
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,710
Those are the kinds of things that
really kind of make those results a

1396
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,573
satisfying.

1397
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:57,770
Do you intentionally seek inspiration
like through books or through

1398
01:22:57,771 --> 01:23:01,700
documentaries or anything? Not
intentionally, but just, you know,

1399
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:06,130
I'll, I'll be reading a
book or an article seeing

1400
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:11,130
a film and somebody will use a word that
resonates on some level and I go write

1401
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,490
the word down.
Then I might build something on that word.

1402
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:21,160
So it could be, it could be two years
from now that I'd come back to that word.

1403
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,233
Right?

1404
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:27,480
So just following your own curiosity or
interests and that eventually leads you

1405
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:27,970
to it

1406
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:31,450
ration, right? I mean, if you're,
if you're, you're into, you know,

1407
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:35,230
physics and geometry in general chemistry,

1408
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:38,470
there's those Thursdays structures
that are already there in terms of the,

1409
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,270
the relationships between a numbers
and shapes and angles and, and, uh,

1410
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:47,530
you know, just molecules. Um, and they're,

1411
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,500
and they're very similar,
uh,

1412
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,380
in respect to just the
emotional experiences, uh,

1413
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:58,370
just life experiences, even just the Jira
and journey from, you know, an infant to,

1414
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:01,330
uh, an elderly person. There's a whole,

1415
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:06,660
there's very common angles and structure
and a commonality between those

1416
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:10,330
experiences that can be,
can resonate.

1417
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:15,340
So if I see a word that for some reason
resonates with me at the age of 35 or

1418
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:16,174
40,

1419
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:21,330
I write it down right away because most
likely there's some kind of a geometry

1420
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,480
or residents with that word
that's speaking to me at this age,

1421
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:28,180
in this stage of my life that
I should pay attention to.

1422
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,560
So I'll write it down and I'll see you.

1423
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:34,150
I'll explore it more to see if it is in
fact something that wouldn't be relevant

1424
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:38,890
when I was 20 might not be relevant
when I'm 60 but it's relevant now, so,

1425
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,510
so I'll look at it and I'll build on it.

1426
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,610
Yeah, that's an interesting thing
about getting older and the,

1427
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:46,490
the ideas that you come across,

1428
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:50,930
these ideas are sort of cross referencing
with these other experiences that

1429
01:24:50,931 --> 01:24:54,140
you've had in your life up to this
point now and now. Now it resonates.

1430
01:24:54,141 --> 01:24:55,070
Now it makes sense.

1431
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,630
Whereas at 21 it didn't mean a damn
thing to write a documentary and a guy

1432
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,380
making Sushi when you were 21 would
be like, oh fuck am I watching? Right?

1433
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:06,180
But when you're 41 it's like, oh, okay,

1434
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:10,320
this guy is obsessed with this art.
There's something to this, right?

1435
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:14,720
This guy's making swords. Look,
he's making a CS, folding the metal.

1436
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:19,280
I watched a whole documentary on this
guy making traditional style Samurai

1437
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:24,281
swords and the incredibly
intensive laborious process
involved in folding steel,

1438
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:29,930
hammering it down, folding
it, hammering it down.

1439
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,040
Fascinating Shit. Yeah. And that,

1440
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:36,800
like everything else,
it's all just,

1441
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,760
they're still skipping any steps
in the impossible. You know,

1442
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:44,570
we weaving a rug properly,
you know,

1443
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:48,500
making your own fucking clothes, uh,
of a thread. Yeah. Pulling, you know,

1444
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,490
weaving threads together. Like some they
had to do that. That's what they did.

1445
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:57,110
And you know, that's, there's,
there's, there's no other
way. I watched this, um, uh,

1446
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,860
documentary on indigenous
tribes, Inuit tribes, uh,

1447
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:05,890
creating fishing nets and that it would
take a year often to create one net a

1448
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:09,750
fucking year. You better
have a couple already. Yeah.

1449
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,840
You have to have a couple
already made and you know,

1450
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:15,200
that's the way you're eating is the way
these fucking people are going to eat.

1451
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,620
It goes back to those subsistence
shows I'm absolutely fascinated with.

1452
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:24,470
Like there's this one that
I've been watching now, it's
called a life below zero.

1453
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:28,190
And it's just these different families,

1454
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,230
families or individuals who live up in
Alaska and then go from one to the next

1455
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:35,840
and follow these people.
And this one,

1456
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:40,870
a tribe that's a man and a
woman and the woman is a,

1457
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:43,880
a native in you at woman.

1458
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:47,930
And the man is a American from the lower
48 and they have children together and

1459
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:48,651
you know,

1460
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:52,910
like they've lost family members because
they fell through the ice and died.

1461
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:56,690
And I mean this is like, this
is real shit. This woman who's,

1462
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,470
they're walking across the ice and they're
like knocking holes into the ice to

1463
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:04,370
make sure that it's deep enough for them
to walk and they're with their children.

1464
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:07,820
And then they got to put this net
down underneath this ice and, and,

1465
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:11,000
and feed it to each other and the other
side of the river and they're going to

1466
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:12,410
catch fish.
And that's how they're,

1467
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:16,220
they're all eating and there's no other
way to eat. And this is what they do.

1468
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,080
And that's,
and that's their life.

1469
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:23,080
And there's something about it that's
so fucking terrifying to you that just,

1470
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:29,030
that just shut me down. That sounds
cold. Oh, it's fucking cold as shit,

1471
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:33,200
man. Well, you know, this woman had
lost two family members. She lost a,

1472
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,680
one of her sisters and I think one
of her brothers or maybe a cousin or

1473
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:39,850
something like that, fell through. It was
just going to reach for a sweater. Yeah.

1474
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:44,210
Yeah. It's, it's, it's wild shit man. But
to them, that's life. That's what they do.

1475
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,330
That's what they're doing. That's,
that's, that's their existence.

1476
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:50,970
Laughing while they're doing
it and everybody, I mean it's,

1477
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:54,020
I guess people just
adapt and get used to it,

1478
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:58,160
but there's also this like intense
spiritual connection with their food.

1479
01:27:58,161 --> 01:27:59,510
That way,
you know,

1480
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:02,690
when they're pulling these fish out of
this water and the grabbing hold of it

1481
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:04,940
and making sure it doesn't
fall back under the ice.

1482
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:09,770
Like there's this intense connection
between this, this animal,

1483
01:28:09,771 --> 01:28:14,150
this, this creature that they just
caught, we don't really ever get.

1484
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,340
And when they eat that animal,

1485
01:28:16,341 --> 01:28:20,030
there also this intense feeling of
satisfaction that goes with that,

1486
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:24,800
that this substance living
very, very, very intense man.

1487
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:29,540
Very intensive. Lost touch with that
because we have so much available to us,

1488
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:34,040
you know, no matter where we look. Yeah,
we've got food, clothing, shelters,

1489
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,610
pretty much readily available. We've
got a little lazy on that kind of stuff.

1490
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,720
A lot lazy.

1491
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,770
And I think it's a lot like what
we're talking about Los Angeles.

1492
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,300
I mean Los Angeles too. Goddam
easy. There's no weather. No.

1493
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:50,240
Whether it's simple,
go to the supermarket,

1494
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:55,130
everything spelled out for you. Soft
life. Soft life creates soft people.

1495
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:00,620
We got to figure out a way to fix
that. What's the way, dude? Um,

1496
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,513
yeah,

1497
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,430
reset. Do I, the only way I think is for
people to figure it out on their own,

1498
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:13,380
to be inspired by people who are or
have figured that out. You know, the,

1499
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,960
this marble is way smarter than we are.

1500
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:19,450
So when it decides that
there's any even, you know, if,

1501
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:22,350
if the kids get a little too cocky,
it'll,

1502
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:27,480
it'll toss a few title ways or toss a
few meteors at it just to, just to reset.

1503
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:32,310
It'll just reset and you'll go back to
having to figure out what to do with your

1504
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:34,080
time,
not having your PDA.

1505
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,940
I've always wondered if that's what
it did with the dinosaurs. If it,

1506
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:43,130
if the earth looked at the
situation was like, those are big,

1507
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:47,940
this is a mess. No one's going to figure
that out. No one's going to stop that.

1508
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:50,100
They're stupid as fuck.
And they don't have to get smart.

1509
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,210
They kill everything with their face
the way 50,000 pounds a piece. Right.

1510
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:59,340
All right. You know what?
It's time to throw in a race
or their way. Yeah, I agree.

1511
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:02,340
I think, I think that's probably the
case. Eventually we'll, you know,

1512
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:06,630
something that you said how dependent
we are on I just everything digital and

1513
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:11,550
electrical, just a simple,
natural, naturally occurring.

1514
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:16,230
You know, electromagnetic pulse. We'll
just fucking ruined people's lives. Yeah.

1515
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:20,100
One big fat solar storm that
erases everybody's Kendall. Yeah.

1516
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:24,960
Don and go try find a book now. A hundred
years from now. Try Finding a book.

1517
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:28,590
Yeah. Books. It'd be like records. It
was be like try and find vinyl today.

1518
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:34,980
I many final do you Elliot? Everything
a few people do. Right? Yeah.

1519
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:37,440
It's still pretty common.
We try to do every that every,

1520
01:30:37,441 --> 01:30:39,840
there are only a couple of things
I've released flustered with the,

1521
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:42,210
haven't come out on vinyl to,
cause they were just digital,

1522
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:47,190
but the pretty much everything
even. Yeah. Even the remixes we do,

1523
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:48,810
we'll do final four to,

1524
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:53,520
well there's a weird push now for not
even just a digital copy of something but

1525
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:56,550
in the cloud to leave
everything in the cloud.

1526
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,140
Like have you seen these
new Google chrome books?

1527
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:04,290
They barely have a hard drive and
everything's in the cloud, right?

1528
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,700
You're accessing your day. And I'm so
like, and I'm not, I'm not being like,

1529
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:12,660
you know, grandpa kind of
know, hang onto his, you know,

1530
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:18,240
his Beta Max or eight track
tapes or any of that that,

1531
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:21,690
I mean, I honestly just like I keep,
when I download stuff off iTunes,

1532
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:26,220
I have like a hard drive and I just
can't let go of the idea of like just

1533
01:31:26,221 --> 01:31:28,410
deleting it all and getting
it later when I want it.

1534
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:32,700
Because I mean are we really going to
wash those CSI Miami episodes again?

1535
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:35,460
Probably not.
Probably not.

1536
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:39,410
But you feel better if they're sitting in
on that because I paid, I paid for him.

1537
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:42,210
So why did you,
why don't I have them somehow near me?

1538
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,960
I just am not willing to accept the
idea that everything's in the cloud.

1539
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:48,750
And then it's secure either.
That's the other thing. I mean,

1540
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:52,170
they want you to put all your photos
in the cloud and contacts in the cloud.

1541
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:55,110
That stuff. I was like,
no. Yeah, I don't believe.

1542
01:31:55,111 --> 01:31:58,230
Think about it before you print
this photo out. Fuck you. What if I,

1543
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,190
I'm not to have this photo.
If something

1544
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,320
crazy happens like that and it's lost.

1545
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,350
Yeah.
And also the,

1546
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:09,130
the latest revelations that the NSA
tapped into the Google cloud and basically

1547
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:12,400
access to everything that was
up there, which is a, you know,

1548
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:16,240
Google's all pissed off, but come on,
you didn't see that coming, you know,

1549
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:19,450
aren't you guys at the front of the line?
Don't, don't you know what's possible.

1550
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:24,550
You seen that show yet? No.
What's that down? What is it?

1551
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:28,400
It's everything you're talking about.
Like what's a show that just started,

1552
01:32:28,401 --> 01:32:31,430
you know, a couple of seasons ago and
like maybe it's third season or second,

1553
01:32:31,431 --> 01:32:35,300
third season. I think now Ben from
losses on it. Oh really? Yeah.

1554
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:38,720
And it's all about him having been
the engineer, this computer that,

1555
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:43,580
that was predicting, um, national threats.

1556
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,420
And I think it takes everything. It takes
every camera it out with the access.

1557
01:32:47,421 --> 01:32:49,910
Any camera that has, you
know, that's in the system.

1558
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:53,210
Here's the cameras on your phones,
every microphone.

1559
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:58,130
And it puts together all of this data
looking at all the digital information and

1560
01:32:58,131 --> 01:33:02,190
uh, predicts like your national threats
and, and, but the, the trick, you know,

1561
01:33:02,191 --> 01:33:04,940
the whole trick of this story is like
nobody really knows about this thing at

1562
01:33:04,941 --> 01:33:05,774
all.
It's so,

1563
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:10,190
so self contained than it
inserts this information into,

1564
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,560
uh, and to studies or you
know, when they're looking at,

1565
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,840
when we're looking at somebody

1566
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:20,210
that was too weird. People that was Ben
from loft and Jesus does Jim Caviezel.

1567
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:24,770
Yeah, the passion of the
Christ. That fucking nutty dude.

1568
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,520
That dude thought he was Jesus. Who is
that Candy Alexander in the back? No Way.

1569
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:34,520
Benjamin buttons. Mom. Oh,
okay. Wow. Pr. So good.

1570
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:35,660
You recommend this,
right?

1571
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:40,100
It was funny because like everything about
what the show is all of a sudden came

1572
01:33:40,101 --> 01:33:43,610
out with all this, you know, all
this NSA spying. They were like,

1573
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,960
that's what they're doing already.

1574
01:33:44,961 --> 01:33:48,230
So this show is like kind of being
a cutting edge thing like on, Oh,

1575
01:33:48,231 --> 01:33:50,600
there's a supercomputer doing all this
stuff and they're like looking through

1576
01:33:50,601 --> 01:33:53,270
the cameras and there's gathering all the
information and all of a sudden you go,

1577
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:56,120
none of their doing that right
now. Like this, this is not a,

1578
01:33:56,121 --> 01:33:58,520
this is not a stretch.
This is not a supernatural show.

1579
01:33:58,521 --> 01:33:59,630
This is like actually happening.

1580
01:33:59,800 --> 01:33:59,981
Well,

1581
01:33:59,981 --> 01:34:04,180
it went from being something that guy
like Alex Jones would rant and rave about

1582
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:09,300
to the reality of the day and
it happened within like a month.

1583
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:13,990
Right. You know, I mean everybody
sorta just realize like, oh shit.

1584
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:18,550
Like everything you've ever
emailed somebody actually
is somewhere in a database.

1585
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:21,970
That is the facts.
That's the world that we live in now.

1586
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,610
This isn't science fiction anymore.
Does that,

1587
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:27,940
that off color photo you sent me to,

1588
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:33,220
I told you that wasn't real. What
do you, does that freak you out?

1589
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,720
This is, what do you, what do you think
this is going to lead to this, this,

1590
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:42,490
this does dissolving of
privacy. I Dunno. Um,

1591
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,870
part of me says that I'm not, I'm not
really that important that it were,

1592
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:53,180
that I'm too worried about anybody
looking at what I've got. Uh, you know,

1593
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:57,940
the government like sifting through my
crap. There's nothing, there's nothing of,

1594
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,210
yeah,
I agree in that personally,

1595
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:06,060
but I also see it as something that's
very different than I think what,

1596
01:35:06,061 --> 01:35:07,720
what people are realizing.

1597
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:12,070
I think everybody's worried about their
personal privacy and people were worried

1598
01:35:12,071 --> 01:35:14,350
about not just their personal privacy,

1599
01:35:14,351 --> 01:35:19,351
but the government being able to access
their personal privacy and to be able to

1600
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:23,890
look into their photographs and read
their emails. And I get all that.

1601
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:28,690
But I think that ultimately what
we're dealing with is a dissolving of

1602
01:35:28,691 --> 01:35:33,691
boundaries between people and information
and that it's going to be some,

1603
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:38,230
there's going to be some
breakthrough one day,

1604
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:39,790
whether it's some,

1605
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:44,820
some ability to read minds or
some new way of connecting people,

1606
01:35:45,161 --> 01:35:49,690
some new way of separating boundaries
that's going to make this seem like a

1607
01:35:49,691 --> 01:35:50,200
joke,

1608
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:55,030
that this is just basically one more
step in this neverending trend of a

1609
01:35:55,031 --> 01:35:56,410
dissolving of boundaries.

1610
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,870
And I don't know. I don't,
you know, again, I don't know,

1611
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:06,230
the other side of me is like, don't,
don't be looking at my emails. I don't,

1612
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:09,680
you know, there's, that's, that's just my
personal stuff. And then you'd have no,

1613
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,820
there's nothing of interest there
for you. I think I've done, you know,

1614
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,430
I've done my part for society.
Why you're looking at my bunk.

1615
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:20,820
Yeah. The, I think the, you know,
the people that are doing it too.

1616
01:36:20,821 --> 01:36:23,670
That's one of the weirdest things.
Like this Edward Snowden thing.

1617
01:36:23,671 --> 01:36:26,270
When it came out, it was, uh, they were,

1618
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,370
they were trying to discredit him and
they're like this high school dropout,

1619
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:33,630
Edward Snowden. And you're like, wait,
wait a minute man. Did you guys hire him?

1620
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,780
Like you're, you're, you're
making fun of him now, but right.

1621
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,400
Cause you're fucking employee,
man.

1622
01:36:38,401 --> 01:36:41,910
And he's telling everybody that he
had access to everybody's email,

1623
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:45,180
not just encrypted,
but can actually fucking read them.

1624
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,250
It wasn't just mad at metadata.

1625
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:51,570
He could actually go and read your
emails and he was a high school dropout.

1626
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:55,650
Right? Like who else is working
for you guys? Right? Like,
well, who gets these jobs?

1627
01:36:55,651 --> 01:36:59,430
How do they get these jobs?
Like the, the, the questions,

1628
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,720
the questions are just leading to this,

1629
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,750
this weird ultimate reality,

1630
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:10,200
which is that the trend
seems to be across the line,

1631
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:14,820
this dissolving of boundaries between
people and ideas and people and

1632
01:37:14,821 --> 01:37:19,500
information and then eventually everyone's
going to have access to everything.

1633
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:21,030
It seems that that is,
and I just

1634
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:25,540
think that that's, you know, I, I
get caught up in the idea of like,

1635
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:28,000
well maybe this is part of some,
you know,

1636
01:37:28,001 --> 01:37:30,220
this might be just our tendency
to do things, you know,

1637
01:37:30,221 --> 01:37:33,790
this is what we do to control people.
You know, just through the ages, power,

1638
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:36,760
you know, power wants more power. Uh,

1639
01:37:36,761 --> 01:37:40,790
but at some point you have to wonder like
was so is that, is that choice and the,

1640
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:44,680
the dominant, you know,
whoever's in charge,

1641
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:49,000
that's a tendency of uh, whatever
we are, whatever it makes us up.

1642
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:52,840
Is that an extension of what,
again, going back to the marble,

1643
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:56,010
is that what the marble wants in some way?
Is

1644
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,630
that,
is that a,

1645
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:01,770
is that consciousness just trying to
sort some things out and just take us to

1646
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:05,470
the next step? Um, you know what
I mean? I, you know, I don't,

1647
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:08,820
I have no answers to them. I'm just
saying, I still, I started asking,

1648
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:13,680
I started asking those questions of like,
okay, so what's the, how, how would I,

1649
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:16,590
you know,
if I was David Koresh,

1650
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:21,080
how would I rationalize that
perspective? I mean those, so think,

1651
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:23,310
but think like a crazy person who,
you know,

1652
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,970
comes up with some awesome
rationalizations to justify
the actions and then try

1653
01:38:27,971 --> 01:38:30,810
to go the other way. Like, try to feed
like, you know, be more like the paranoid,

1654
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:36,460
you know, opposite Defensive Brat,
you know, reasonably defensive, uh,

1655
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,720
person who wants to be like,
wants to know why,

1656
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,770
what the fuck do you
need to see in my emails?

1657
01:38:41,771 --> 01:38:43,290
I don't understand why
that's important to you.

1658
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:48,710
I tried to look at it as someone who's
analyzing the human beings as a complete

1659
01:38:48,711 --> 01:38:52,970
alien, outsider looking at
us collectively as a group,

1660
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:57,980
which is what we, we move as a group.
We act as a group and I, I would say,

1661
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:58,550
well look,

1662
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:03,550
here's this thing that works collectively
to make technology but thinks it's an

1663
01:39:03,621 --> 01:39:06,530
individual.
They all think that they're individuals,

1664
01:39:06,531 --> 01:39:11,000
but essentially all they're doing with
their manic desire to acquire goods and

1665
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,190
did the acquire material possessions.

1666
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,700
What they're really doing is just
pushing innovation because they need the

1667
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:20,870
biggest, baddest, newest, craziest. They
constantly need the latest and greatest.

1668
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:25,640
They're pushing for these innovations
and these innovations are constantly

1669
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:29,720
within, you know, three,
four, five months.

1670
01:39:29,721 --> 01:39:34,721
The exponential increase of these
things is making every new step far more

1671
01:39:35,421 --> 01:39:37,070
powerful than any step before it.

1672
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:41,240
And it's happening faster and faster and
faster. It's happening exponentially.

1673
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:44,130
And I don't even think the
creatures even realize that

1674
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:45,530
doing the, the, the, the,

1675
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:50,040
the periods as Mckenna had put a thought
at the time periods between novelty and

1676
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:53,620
novelty and normality or it's
like a home now. It's not even a,

1677
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,040
it's not even a peak and valley anymore.

1678
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:59,080
Yeah. Makenna described it
as a funnel that, you know,

1679
01:39:59,081 --> 01:40:02,110
if you spun a quarter around
the top of the funnel,

1680
01:40:02,111 --> 01:40:05,170
who took a long time to go
all the way around the circle,

1681
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:07,120
but as it gets lower and lower,

1682
01:40:07,121 --> 01:40:11,320
it's getting faster and faster and faster
and faster until it reaches what he

1683
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:14,020
thought would be a point
of ultimate novelty.

1684
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:18,640
But he thought it was going to be the
December 21st, 2012 but think, you know,

1685
01:40:18,641 --> 01:40:23,410
he had, he's a a dude, you know,
he's a guy, right? You know,

1686
01:40:23,411 --> 01:40:25,990
at the end of the day it's brilliant.
As he was his fan,

1687
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:30,370
fantastic as his mind was. He's still
just a person with an idea. And, you know,

1688
01:40:30,371 --> 01:40:34,330
we can, we grab ideas sometimes and
ride those bitches right into the rocks.

1689
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,740
But you know,
if you look at those,

1690
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,580
those, uh, this beautiful chaos, uh,

1691
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:42,440
equations that kind of make those cool
kind of Paisley looking things and that

1692
01:40:42,441 --> 01:40:44,080
he looked really close and you see like,
oh,

1693
01:40:44,081 --> 01:40:48,720
the detail becomes fractals
Mandelbrot set. Yeah. So, you know,

1694
01:40:48,721 --> 01:40:50,150
if you look at that,
um,

1695
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,610
when we get down to the bottom of that
funnel and you're looking close, there's,

1696
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:57,790
there's a deeper funnel. It's just as
much detail as the funnel above it. So,

1697
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:03,080
and he might ultimately have been right
in some sort of a way that December

1698
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:07,020
21st, it might not have even been
that exact day, but that era,

1699
01:41:07,021 --> 01:41:11,850
the era between 2012 2013 which is the
era we're living in and experiencing

1700
01:41:11,851 --> 01:41:12,660
right now,

1701
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:17,580
it might ultimately be this new
opening for this new future.

1702
01:41:17,581 --> 01:41:19,260
And this what we're talking
about where there's,

1703
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:24,240
that's that TV show or the revelations
about the NSA that could be just the

1704
01:41:24,241 --> 01:41:29,070
first steps an opening up this new door
of perception, this new door of reality.

1705
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:32,220
Right now we're living
in strange times man.

1706
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:34,640
Yeah, totally. Yeah. Mixed
and it makes you know,

1707
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:39,570
mix up person when I'm trying to write
songs or trying to make this wine or you

1708
01:41:39,571 --> 01:41:44,250
know, doing, you know, doing whatever, uh,
writing and doing comedy bits or whatever,

1709
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:46,320
it almost makes it feel weird.

1710
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:51,180
You almost feel kind of an odd like
self conscious way of like, what am I,

1711
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:51,871
what am I doing?

1712
01:41:51,871 --> 01:41:56,670
Like you go to a show and you see like
the dude up there dancing around in front

1713
01:41:56,671 --> 01:42:00,810
of the people that are like watching
them dance around and look at you dancing

1714
01:42:00,811 --> 01:42:03,780
around.
Just feel so fucking weird.

1715
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:05,910
Such a weird relationship of like,

1716
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:11,450
like such a show until kindergarten
thing and when I like when you say a word

1717
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,370
enough times, that was,
that sounds weird. Yeah.

1718
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,850
That when I look at that and I think
about it like that, like coming back,

1719
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:20,520
repeating the word to the point where
it doesn't make any sense anymore.

1720
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:24,390
That thing just seems so strange standing.

1721
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:29,820
So I'm going to imagine like most
people at some point in their career,

1722
01:42:29,821 --> 01:42:32,370
whatever there's they're doing,
they all said it's kind of go,

1723
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:36,480
what the fuck am I doing this to
something? We'll just thing I'm doing.

1724
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,900
Yeah. If you like rip, paying
too close attention to ballet,

1725
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:45,100
if you're locking into a ballet,
you can enjoy it.

1726
01:42:45,101 --> 01:42:48,430
If you're in the moment and you're
just appreciating the movements.

1727
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,710
But if you look at it too closely,

1728
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:55,711
then you start to s to step back and
pull back and look it into perspective of

1729
01:42:56,171 --> 01:43:00,850
this planet spinning a thousand miles an
hour and a circle around this gigantic

1730
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:02,260
nuclear explosion.
You're like,

1731
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:07,360
look at this asshole and tights
throwing his body through the air.

1732
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:08,980
This is so preposterous.

1733
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:13,930
Like why does anybody give a fuck whether
or not you can sing the words to your,

1734
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:18,640
your play right now? I went
to, my wife was taking Spanish,

1735
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:22,120
uh, or a, a Italian rather. And uh,

1736
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:26,920
one of the things that she did in her
class was they took everyone to an opera.

1737
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:28,480
So we went to an opera.

1738
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:31,690
And so we're sitting there with the
rest of the people in her Italian class

1739
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:32,800
watching this opera.
I'm like,

1740
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:37,120
this has gotta be one of the dumbest
fucking ways to entertain people I've ever

1741
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:40,930
seen. Why the life they're saying in
this language that nobody understands.

1742
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:46,090
It's everything is like everyone falls
in love immediately. So I can't buy it.

1743
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,570
There's no reason why these people are
in love with each other so quickly,

1744
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:52,820
like this ready to die.
Like, this is preposterous.

1745
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:58,260
This is made in an era when people didn't
have books. Like they didn't, they,

1746
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:01,430
they bought into this because
they were dumb as shit. But yet

1747
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,590
here we are, 21st century. The
entities in a seems absurd as,

1748
01:44:06,591 --> 01:44:09,690
and as it would if anybody was coming
here from some different, you know,

1749
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:13,100
galaxy walking in and seeing,
you know,

1750
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:17,260
a standup comic or, or, or, uh, you know,

1751
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:21,740
we're about a band playing on a stage
or a person like getting up so early in

1752
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:26,150
the morning to, uh, you know, to make
bread. I ain't got had, that's food.

1753
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:31,080
I guess that that makes more sense
about to make wine. Yeah. I mean the, I,

1754
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:33,650
you know, you always kind of take
that, take it out of that perspective.

1755
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:37,350
Like somebody comes to this culture and
then there's this thing where you, you,

1756
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:40,760
you stick rocks in your ear and that's
like this thing you do. And there's like,

1757
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:41,210
oh,
there's,

1758
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:43,400
there's better rocks and other rocks
that you're sticking in your year.

1759
01:44:43,401 --> 01:44:46,010
And then people start stumbling around
and you know, falling, you know,

1760
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:48,310
bumping into a wall. Like, okay, so you,

1761
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:50,930
you pick up a rock and you put it in
your ear and there's different kinds of

1762
01:44:50,931 --> 01:44:53,250
rocks. I feel different and give
you different effects. And there's,

1763
01:44:53,251 --> 01:44:54,410
Dear Stephanie, you know, you can,

1764
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:57,440
there's certain rocks that are really
expensive and some that you can just pick

1765
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:58,520
up and know,
stick in your ear,

1766
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:02,450
but you just basically bumped into a wall
afterwards and that's cool. Right? Yeah.

1767
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:07,810
Okay. There you have it. Good luck. Oh,

1768
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:13,010
whoa. Yeah. It just seems so
absurd when you, when you,

1769
01:45:13,011 --> 01:45:17,300
when you kind of tick take the, take the
words and replace them with, you know,

1770
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:22,010
other, other objects or
things, you know, wine, food,

1771
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:26,400
I mean food is food, but like
singing a song. I've heard of it.

1772
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:30,210
Yeah. And there's some things that to
the people that participate in them,

1773
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:35,220
our life itself, it's, it's almost, uh,
you know, one of the things that I do, uh,

1774
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:40,350
I've done since I was a, a young
man, this play pool I play,

1775
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:45,710
I played in tournaments and I play like
on a just below professional level and a

1776
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,760
to peer.
Should I play pool now?

1777
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:54,090
That's a weird word
that only gets used to.

1778
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:57,690
It only gets used outside of pool shark.

1779
01:45:57,691 --> 01:46:01,500
Actually impose a negative term,
meaning someone who distracts you,

1780
01:46:01,501 --> 01:46:05,070
why you shooting? They tried to shark
you. Okay? Like if you were shooting,

1781
01:46:05,071 --> 01:46:07,350
I was like, Hey, come on man,

1782
01:46:07,351 --> 01:46:10,050
you ain't going to make this shot if
I was fucking with you while you were

1783
01:46:10,051 --> 01:46:12,210
shooting.
That's called sharking someone.

1784
01:46:12,211 --> 01:46:16,470
It's actually poor form and it never
happens in tournaments with the highest

1785
01:46:16,471 --> 01:46:20,100
level guys. They never do that.
But to my point was that the two,

1786
01:46:20,101 --> 01:46:23,340
the people in that world pools everything.

1787
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:27,390
I mean to watch the great matches from
going from tournament to tournament,

1788
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:31,380
you know? Now nowadays they're there
watching them streaming on the internet,

1789
01:46:31,381 --> 01:46:36,010
whether it's through paper view venues or
whether it's through a, you know, some,

1790
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:40,620
some people set up cameras at various
tournaments, but to a person has nothing.

1791
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:43,830
No connection to that world.
It's idiotic.

1792
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:48,390
You're watching these fools are,
there's a Tate, the table never changes.

1793
01:46:48,391 --> 01:46:50,040
The six remain in the

1794
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:54,630
exact same spots and it's just about
which way the balls roll around.

1795
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:58,620
Like who gives a fuck? Nothing
changes outside the table. I mean,

1796
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:02,670
this is the microcosm of microcosms,
man. I mean, it's a fucking table.

1797
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:06,510
It doesn't even mean it's level.
It doesn't even move.

1798
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:10,170
It's just a matter of balls colliding
and that that interests you.

1799
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:14,230
But to the people that are involved in
it's every or a person who, you know,

1800
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,950
goes to the kind of process
of self discovery. You, you,

1801
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,200
you did something and it went in the hole,

1802
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:23,190
you wanted it to go in and you've had
that positive reinforcement and that

1803
01:47:23,191 --> 01:47:26,790
encouragement from that,
from that behavior. Uh,

1804
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:30,080
then you follow it more because
like you got some, some hugs,

1805
01:47:30,081 --> 01:47:33,120
some kind of accolades, either from
yourself or from someone around you.

1806
01:47:33,121 --> 01:47:38,121
So you start pursuing that thing and it
has more about your ego developing in

1807
01:47:38,281 --> 01:47:41,990
terms of like the praise that you
got for doing that thing. Yeah.

1808
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,610
So you end up, you can see how things
get to that level, you know, watching,

1809
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:50,700
you know, watching, uh, you're,
you know, English, footy.

1810
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:53,110
I was never a footie fan.

1811
01:47:53,111 --> 01:47:56,640
Angela had somebody kind of walking
me through what was happening.

1812
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,440
And then I recognize something and I was
patted on the back for recognizing this

1813
01:48:01,441 --> 01:48:04,350
thing that I still don't have any
fucking idea what I was talking about.

1814
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:08,220
But you know, I'm watching it more
cause I want to see where this goes.

1815
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:09,263
And you were like

1816
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,730
six total goals tops and that's like,
that's what we're watching here.

1817
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,970
If you're lucky. Yeah. But you know, at
the same time I, you know, not other,

1818
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:21,810
now that I've got sucked
into the rabbit hole,

1819
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,980
I completely enjoy what that is.
And there's entire like, you know,

1820
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,980
there's probably a bunch of English shoes
right now outside of the studio ready

1821
01:48:28,981 --> 01:48:30,690
to kick my ass for even
mentioning it at that.

1822
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:32,970
That might not be something
that's interesting. You know,

1823
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:36,630
like there's like a fury that police,
you didn't call it soccer.

1824
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:39,120
I did not do that. Yeah, I would not.

1825
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:44,060
I would not go that they'll fucking
scream at you if it was football before

1826
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:48,160
football. They have a point. They
do have a point. But yeah, it's,

1827
01:48:48,161 --> 01:48:49,380
it's that same thing.

1828
01:48:49,381 --> 01:48:53,730
It's like that seeking higher truth in,

1829
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,470
in whatever discipline it is.

1830
01:48:55,471 --> 01:48:59,520
Whether it's the discipline of football
or wine making or music making or jokes

1831
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:03,300
or Jujitsu, those, those microcosms,

1832
01:49:03,301 --> 01:49:08,301
those worlds that exist sort of a holy
on their own and are very difficult to

1833
01:49:09,961 --> 01:49:13,290
appreciate by people standing
outside of them. It's a, it's a,

1834
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:16,740
it's a very fascinating aspect of,
of human beings.

1835
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:19,950
So I guess going back to what you
were asking about the, you know,

1836
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:21,810
the Pulitzer for DVD, how I can, you know,

1837
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:25,280
the flexibility of everything that we do.
I guess that's,

1838
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:29,220
that's kind of what that is.
Me and the guys that I work with,

1839
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:33,330
realizing how absurd some of the things
are that we do anyway with our other

1840
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:34,890
projects are with this project.

1841
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:38,100
But we do it anyway cause we're just
really enjoying. We're in the rabbit hole.

1842
01:49:38,101 --> 01:49:40,790
We enjoy seeing how far we can take,
uh,

1843
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,280
a particular absurd
obsession with something.

1844
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:47,560
And that's absolutely what I
loved and appreciated about it.

1845
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:50,830
Besides the fact that it was funny and
beside the fact that the music was good,

1846
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:55,090
I loved and appreciated the fact that I
could tell it this structure was wholly

1847
01:49:55,091 --> 01:49:59,650
your own. This was a, your own, this
is, you just decided to do it this way.

1848
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:03,290
And you know, I don't know if he saw
some of the, some of the shows. The,

1849
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:08,291
we normally have a table and chairs that
we set up at the front of the stage.

1850
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:11,140
Depending on the show, there'll be
different kinds of tables and chairs.

1851
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:14,050
But we always have like some wine and
some stuff on stage because we have

1852
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:15,160
friends that will either,

1853
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:19,240
that have either opened for us or coming
down to see us or I actually playing in

1854
01:50:19,241 --> 01:50:22,240
this particular band that while
they're not doing anything,

1855
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:24,870
they sit down and have a glass
of wine onstage and you know,

1856
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:28,060
at the front of the stage, uh,
with us and we've, you know,

1857
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:31,580
we've done a lot of shows like that
where we've had, um, like, you know,

1858
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:34,840
two drummers, two base players and
a couple of extra guitar players.

1859
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:38,680
And then like that rhythm section just
sits down for five songs and just having

1860
01:50:38,681 --> 01:50:40,480
wine and cheese at the front of the stage,

1861
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,900
just kicking it and then they get back
up and do it because it just felt,

1862
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,820
it just feels more casual.
Even Korean around,

1863
01:50:45,821 --> 01:50:49,570
I'll sing a couple songs and I'll
sit down and just kind of, you know,

1864
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:53,770
watched the show from the stage that,
is that,

1865
01:50:53,771 --> 01:50:57,430
is that something you saw someone else
do or just so I don't know that I've way,

1866
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:59,140
I don't know that I've seen anybody do it.

1867
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:03,670
I'm sure that tasks have been done right.
But I just feel like there's a,

1868
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:04,730
and I've actually tried to,

1869
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:08,740
I've been trying to put this other
show together with no luck. Uh,

1870
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:12,580
well we have several bands kind of
come up and do a very similar thing,

1871
01:51:12,581 --> 01:51:13,720
but they play,
you know,

1872
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:18,130
four songs and then they sit down and
maybe there's some kind of segue work,

1873
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,670
one of those guys who's playing with that
other band. And then like a band does,

1874
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:22,210
you know,

1875
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:26,080
four songs or five songs and they sit down
and the other guys come back and said,

1876
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:29,590
you just keep rotating, you know, rather
than doing your whole set and like,

1877
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:33,610
here's who I am and this is what I
do kind of, you know, just kind of,

1878
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:39,640
you know, do it almost like a very
well rehearsed rehearsal, you know,

1879
01:51:41,090 --> 01:51:44,860
very well rehearsed rehearsal,
like not the final performance,

1880
01:51:44,861 --> 01:51:48,400
but like a week before it had a little
glimpse into what it was, you know,

1881
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:52,090
a little bit of the chaos of those guys
getting up there to do their next three

1882
01:51:52,091 --> 01:51:55,420
songs. And it's not like them in their
rhythm and in their element of like,

1883
01:51:55,421 --> 01:51:57,880
you know, start to finish.
This is our set, right?

1884
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:01,510
It's more like we're going to get up and
do these three songs and then we kind

1885
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:04,390
of have to, and it's not like, you know,
some guys have to get up, you know,

1886
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:06,820
full on Boehner to go do their set and,
you know,

1887
01:52:06,821 --> 01:52:09,500
they do the whole thing and you know,
we fucking nailed it.

1888
01:52:09,501 --> 01:52:12,110
And then whatever that is.
Uh,

1889
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:15,910
but just the idea of like getting up and
performing those songs and a couple of

1890
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:20,920
ways and put, putting them and
putting us in an uncomfortable,

1891
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:24,820
unfamiliar environment that kind
of helps us just look at it again.

1892
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:28,810
And Ray and joy will be remembered
doing when we started doing it in a way.

1893
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:33,430
So fuck yeah, dude. And working
on that. Yeah, I love it.

1894
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:37,300
That's exactly it man. You know,
if you could find that that's a,

1895
01:52:37,301 --> 01:52:39,730
that's how honest energy,
you know,

1896
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:43,720
that's a and an honest form of
expression to, because you know,

1897
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,400
you're showing the whole thing,
you're showing the underbelly,

1898
01:52:46,401 --> 01:52:50,150
you're pulling the curtain back. Yeah.
And then you're still, but if done right,

1899
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:52,340
it's not necessarily the underbelly,
it's a,

1900
01:52:52,341 --> 01:52:55,130
it's a show in and of itself that has,

1901
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:59,360
has depth and movement
and passion and you know,

1902
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:04,040
uncertainty and fear and all the real
stuff that comes along with a movie. Yeah.

1903
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:06,620
And that is within the
songs you're hearing,

1904
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:08,930
there's all that stuff is built
into each one of those stories.

1905
01:53:08,931 --> 01:53:12,950
Usually there's some form of
conflict within that song.
That's why they wrote it.

1906
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,440
Yeah.
And then seeing that preparation,

1907
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:19,580
it makes you appreciate the final
product even more. So. Yeah,

1908
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:24,800
that's bad ass man. When are you
a, what are you touring right now?

1909
01:53:24,801 --> 01:53:28,400
Like what's a just got done with harvest?

1910
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:29,900
I'm doing a lot of writing.

1911
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:31,323
MMM.

1912
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:35,210
Training. Jujitsu. Well I
was to like hurt my hands.

1913
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:40,190
So you sprained it a ahead. My, my
coach and Saint Louis fell on it.

1914
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:43,520
That wasn't me. I was, I was going
the wrong way. It's totally my fault.

1915
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:44,630
I was going the wrong way,

1916
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:47,930
pushing the wrong way and I have my hand
out the wrong way and he went the other

1917
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:51,860
way and like this whole body
like landed on my hand and went,

1918
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:56,330
I can hear like popcorn. Did you
get an MRI or anything? I just,

1919
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:00,170
this happened four hours ago. Doesn't look
that bad. Yeah, I think you'd be okay.

1920
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:04,460
Yeah, I see some swelling. Yeah. So I had
it, I had the, the poor guy on the plane.

1921
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:06,860
I'm like using a puke bags.
I go, can I get some ice?

1922
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:10,880
Like I say my arm on the plane coming
here. Do you think the bones cracked?

1923
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:12,560
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1924
01:54:13,290 --> 01:54:16,910
I had to come and do this fucking podcast
instead of going to that hair. You man,

1925
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,740
I know what it's like. I gotta get up
and four hours go to the airport. Well,

1926
01:54:21,741 --> 01:54:24,050
I mean, the good news is
I'm getting a, um, uh,

1927
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:27,620
Kim say is doing a tattoo
of some tattoo work on me.

1928
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:31,820
So I'm actually kind of out
of the training game for a
minimum of a like a week

1929
01:54:31,821 --> 01:54:33,380
or so. Anyway, cause I got to let the,

Where, where is she? Uh, and I'm
going to forget the name of her.

1936
01:54:57,441 --> 01:54:58,700
How do you spell her last name?

1937
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:03,970
S.

1938
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,633
A. I. G. H. S. A. I. G. H. K. I. M

1939
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:08,610
and Shawn Barber.

1940
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,290
Oh Wow. She's wild work,
man. Fantastic stuff. Yeah.

1941
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:20,690
So what town is she in again? She's in
La. Memoria Tattoo Memoir. That's the one,

1942
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,640
that's the word I was looking for.
I was going to say heirloom,

1943
01:55:22,641 --> 01:55:26,810
but that's my friends that make
food. Oh Wow. No more tattoo.

1944
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:32,150
And where's that at?
It's in kind of the Hollywood,

1945
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:36,300
uh, area, I think. I'm Beverly.

1946
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:40,000
Wow. She's got some
fucking amazing work. Yeah.

1947
01:55:40,001 --> 01:55:43,130
She's got some skills to pay the bills.
And Sean's work is awesome too.

1948
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:44,220
That's another

1949
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:46,790
art form that over the last, say, two,

1950
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,580
three decades has really come into its
own in a very strange way that didn't

1951
01:55:50,581 --> 01:55:51,130
really exist

1952
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:54,430
before. Right. And again, when you look,
when you step back from it, you go,

1953
01:55:54,431 --> 01:55:57,550
what are you doing? You're drawing
on yourself. The fuck's your problem.

1954
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,240
Go fucking get, just get a pad
of paper and just, you know,

1955
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:02,350
draw a little bit on it.

1956
01:56:02,351 --> 01:56:04,930
And then when you don't like it and
you'd draw another one. But no, like,

1957
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,910
but you know, but then I,
I get caught up in the, uh,

1958
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,230
just the art of tattooing.
And like you said, it's just,

1959
01:56:11,231 --> 01:56:14,440
it's come so far and just the people that
are so passionate about it and do such

1960
01:56:14,441 --> 01:56:19,390
good work now it's no longer,
you know, Tasmanian devils
and shit. That's for real.

1961
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,020
Yeah. I've had both of my
sleeves done by the same guy,

1962
01:56:22,050 --> 01:56:27,050
Aaron Dellavedova firm grew tattoo in
San Diego and a grew tattoo is one of

1963
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:32,430
those uh, cool shops where
it's, they're all artists.

1964
01:56:32,431 --> 01:56:32,611
You know,

1965
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:36,240
they're all creating these weird pieces
of art when they're not painting.

1966
01:56:36,241 --> 01:56:38,400
They're doing,
they're not doing tattoos,

1967
01:56:38,401 --> 01:56:40,080
they're painting and
not painting the Dune.

1968
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:44,600
Some guys sculpt some guys in there
fucking around constantly and he just,

1969
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:49,200
this is just one more medium that they
express themselves then. Right. But the,

1970
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:53,250
the medium of tattooing, I mean
there was the tattoos have, you know,

1971
01:56:53,251 --> 01:56:58,251
the 1950s in the 1960s and they have no
relation to what is being done today.

1972
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:04,750
Well and the u s yeah, you always had
the core of the Japanese tattooing.

1973
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:07,230
This is like insane,
beautiful stuff.

1974
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:08,740
Insane,
beautiful and,

1975
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:12,200
and ridiculously fucking painful
cause they're doing that tapping

1976
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:17,180
way. That's part of this one. I got
done with that. Oh, did you? In Osaka?

1977
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:21,240
No kidding. So they did it.
How long does that take? Uh,

1978
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:24,530
didn't take much longer than the
gun. I mean, the guy was pretty,

1979
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,850
I mean the guy was fantastic.
That was at the chopstick tattoo in Osaka.

1980
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,020
That was just so they
use like as fans stick,

1981
01:57:33,021 --> 01:57:37,100
they hold it there and the other stick.
Yeah. Tap's over the top of it. Wow.

1982
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:41,480
That's pretty cool house.
How precise can they get with that thing?

1983
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:46,090
It's pretty precise. I said,
get in there, buddy. Yeah,

1984
01:57:46,490 --> 01:57:50,090
that's pretty bad. I love the Thai
style. Once they're doing too, like the,

1985
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:53,540
I'm going to have them do a drag and
I'm actually going to talk to, to,

1986
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:57,080
to the memoir is the number three,
five, three. What is that? That's a,

1987
01:57:57,081 --> 01:58:00,740
it's part of my wine story.
I don't know.

1988
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:05,900
Can you tell us a store? No, it's
a secret really. You have secrets?

1989
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:09,460
It's a little fucking
tap in your email sun.

1990
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:11,480
At least that secret
within the secret's out.

1991
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:18,420
And so you had that guy and do that.
Would that tapping style with the bamboo?

1992
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:23,190
I think Tara Patrick had her whole
arm done that way. She's like,

1993
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:27,150
it was huge. Japanese sleeve. I'm pretty
sure she had it done the traditional way,

1994
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:32,280
like the uh, the, the full, I don't
know what the word is. They uh,

1995
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:36,540
they do it. It's funny when you go to
Japan, you can't show your tattoos.

1996
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:40,860
I was a at an OBL both in the
gym. Yeah. They made me cover up.

1997
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,210
They told me I have to wear a,

1998
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,640
go back to my room and put a
long sleeve shirt on and a,

1999
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,820
I couldn't train as you're
a fucking derelict. Yeah.

2000
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:52,540
I tell I try to let them know
I'm not, yeah, that's her, uh,

2001
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:54,760
her tattoo there.

2002
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:00,550
I'm pretty sure that's done
the traditional way or at
least part of it is. Yeah.

2003
01:59:00,551 --> 01:59:05,320
In the Japanese culture, that's not
a good thing. That's a no, it's bad.

2004
01:59:05,321 --> 01:59:09,340
That's the Yakuza and it's really
interesting because they're the ones who

2005
01:59:09,341 --> 01:59:11,620
created such beautiful,
these,

2006
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:15,370
these beautiful full piece
body designs like that,

2007
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:20,050
those bodysuits that are actually
just one long flowing piece of art.

2008
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:23,560
That's the origin of that,
but not respected in the
country where it came from.

2009
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:28,870
It's funny. Yeah. It's kind of
fun. I got jumped. Please society,

2010
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:30,160
please.
What'd they do?

2011
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:33,350
Maybe put the robe on. I had to I
to put like sweat pants on and a,

2012
01:59:33,351 --> 01:59:34,940
and a top to be in the gym.

2013
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:41,270
Where were you? In Japan. Which part? That
was in, I think that was in Tokyo. Yeah.

2014
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:45,800
That's where I was too. There were, there
were not having it [inaudible] it's a,

2015
01:59:45,801 --> 01:59:48,050
if you have anything on your neck,
you have to wear a turtleneck.

2016
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,400
I think if you have a tattoo
scene and act like it's,

2017
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:55,160
it's much more discriminatory
than it is in America.

2018
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:59,710
Politely discriminatory. Yeah. They're
very polite, polite about it. Well,

2019
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:02,140
there are so polite in such a strange way.
It's a,

2020
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:07,141
it was a really interesting culture
and we went there pretty shortly after

2021
02:00:07,161 --> 02:00:12,161
Fukushima where there was this
weird feeling of distrust for,

2022
02:00:12,561 --> 02:00:17,270
uh, the, the government's assessment
of the damage and the dangers. And, uh,

2023
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:17,870
we were,

2024
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:20,990
we had this long conversation with this
taxi driver because he had to drive us

2025
02:00:20,991 --> 02:00:25,550
from the venue all the way down to Tokyo.
And it's about an hour's drive.

2026
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:26,800
And so he was a,

2027
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:29,840
he spoke pretty good English and he
was saying that for the first time,

2028
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:32,870
people are, uh, openly
starting to question,

2029
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:36,550
we're not the government's being
honest with them about yeah. Without,

2030
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,410
they can eat vegetables,
whether or not, you know,

2031
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:43,760
the ground is radioactive and
they're Fisher edible. Right.

2032
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:46,550
And I, and I would have to
agree with that. That's, that's,

2033
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:49,940
that's starting to happen. Yeah.
That's a scary fucking thing.

2034
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:52,610
And that they might have
ruined their country.

2035
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:57,470
They might have to bail because
it could get worse. I mean,

2036
02:00:57,471 --> 02:00:59,180
there was another
earthquake just last week.

2037
02:00:59,181 --> 02:01:03,470
There was a 7.3 off the coast of
Japan. Yeah. Yeah. It was another one.

2038
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:06,210
It didn't cause a tsunami,
but it could have, I mean,

2039
02:01:06,230 --> 02:01:09,950
all it takes is the plates go
this way instead of that way,

2040
02:01:09,951 --> 02:01:14,060
and then the water's coming.
Yeah. And if it does,

2041
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:15,523
they're fucked.

2042
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:19,560
Yeah. That's it. You know there's a, there
was a beer that a friend of mine had it.

2043
02:01:19,561 --> 02:01:23,670
Uh, it is local so she plays
and I went in and was like, Hey,

2044
02:01:23,671 --> 02:01:28,470
can I get the ads? Some of that? He
goes, no. I said, I said, what happened?

2045
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,230
They sit all of the earthquake.
So that's there.

2046
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:35,610
That stopped production and particularly
because no, it's gone. The family's gone.

2047
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:39,000
The beer has gone, the
building's gone. They're gone.

2048
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,870
Gone, gone. Like never
coming back. Yeah. Yeah.

2049
02:01:44,871 --> 02:01:47,660
You see some of the damage
that that by the way,

2050
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:51,380
that ain't shit compared to some of the
fucking tsunamis that they know have hit

2051
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:53,210
different parts of the world.

2052
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:57,500
That's why I always laugh whenever I
drive by Malibu. How's the Malibu today?

2053
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,280
And I was driving by and I
was looking at these houses,

2054
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,280
they have perched over the ocean
and I was like, sleds, boy,

2055
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:07,750
there's no guarantee that's
going to be there to wild.

2056
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:10,160
Those are just sleds with,

2057
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,620
they're basically playing a long extended
game of musical chairs and they know

2058
02:02:15,621 --> 02:02:18,620
for sure one day and the music's going
to stop and their houses are going to

2059
02:02:18,621 --> 02:02:22,410
have for sure go flying out into the
ocean. But when the Michigan man,

2060
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:26,050
all the snow, you'd always have, you
know, he could do bobsledding stuff.

2061
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:31,100
Can I just slid down the hill? And
that was, when I see those houses,

2062
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:34,730
that's all I can think of is sledding in
the winter. Yeah, she can. Well they'll,

2063
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:36,140
they'll get a raised one day.

2064
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:38,840
I guess if you're like way
up a one of those bluffs,

2065
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:41,960
you probably got a pretty good shot of,
not of,

2066
02:02:41,961 --> 02:02:43,730
not falling completely in the ocean,

2067
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:48,350
but those things have massive landslides
too. There was a couple of years ago,

2068
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:51,470
there was a news report where these
people were waking up in the middle of the

2069
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:51,471
night,

2070
02:02:51,471 --> 02:02:55,670
these horrible cracking noises and they
realize that their houses were sliding

2071
02:02:55,671 --> 02:03:00,530
off the side of this hill down into
this valley and it just gives out,

2072
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:00,861
you know,

2073
02:03:00,861 --> 02:03:04,790
you decided to put a foundation and
the ground that decided to not be there

2074
02:03:04,791 --> 02:03:08,780
anymore. Right. And it all
just didn't. Giant, huge, 30,

2075
02:03:08,781 --> 02:03:13,781
40 acre chunks just slides down and
takes these $5 million houses with it.

2076
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:20,360
And that's the fear. It then at worth $5
million anymore. Not Anymore. If I may,

2077
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:25,190
I think you're correct. And I think even
if she wanted to reclaim that land, boy,

2078
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:27,550
it's tough to pinpoint where
your house used to be. Yeah.

2079
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:30,590
Good luck with that survey. Yeah. Yeah.

2080
02:03:30,591 --> 02:03:33,530
Those dudes with the sticks
looking through that hole. Yeah.

2081
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:36,470
They're going to have to do a lot of
measuring. That was me in the military.

2082
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:40,080
Did you do that? That's what I did.
What'd you do in the military? Uh,

2083
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:42,560
we put in grid coordinates for,
uh,

2084
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,960
like the tank batteries
to pull in and you know,

2085
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:47,990
if you're gonna if you're going to shove
a big missile in a tube and launch it

2086
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:48,900
somewhere,
he had Kevin,

2087
02:03:48,910 --> 02:03:53,120
he had to know where you are and
to know where it's going basically.

2088
02:03:53,121 --> 02:03:55,910
So that's what we would do with people.
Put the survey points.

2089
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:00,560
What branch of the military army, how
long were you in for? Three. Three years.

2090
02:04:00,561 --> 02:04:02,810
Well, six years total. What year was this?

2091
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:08,150
82 to 85 reserves from 85 to Aka.
That's you buy boom,

2092
02:04:10,610 --> 02:04:14,870
you handsome fast out of wig.
It's just real, you know.

2093
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:20,690
Did you get anything out of being
in the military? Yeah. Discipline.

2094
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:26,900
Yeah. Just, you know, just again,
just being, being responsible. Uh,

2095
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:30,770
response ability.
The ability to respond.

2096
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:35,770
Yeah. People that have gone
through that. Um, it's a, it's,

2097
02:04:35,771 --> 02:04:38,150
it's very interesting to see.
I

2098
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,160
had a friend who was a real lazy and Kinda
shiftless and never got anything done

2099
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:48,120
and then went away,
went to bootcamp,

2100
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:53,220
came back and this motherfucker
always folded his napkin after that,

2101
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:57,540
sat up straight and got shit
done. And I was like, wow,

2102
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,680
they turn this dude around.
Like they're really did. I mean,

2103
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:05,850
I wouldn't recommend it today because
joining today you have a high likelihood

2104
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:09,630
of either being forced to assassinate
someone for the government or finding

2105
02:05:09,631 --> 02:05:11,970
yourself in a position where
you really wouldn't want to be.

2106
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:14,880
And people are shooting at, you
know, that don't like Americans.

2107
02:05:14,881 --> 02:05:19,140
And unless it's your calling, I wouldn't
really recommend it, but God damn,

2108
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:22,410
for some people it really is a,
a game changer.

2109
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:28,060
I agree. Um, yeah. And you know, not all,

2110
02:05:28,061 --> 02:05:32,890
not everyone can make it through it. It's
a lot of guys, it kind of washed out,

2111
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:35,770
you know, during that
whole, uh, basic training.

2112
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:40,210
What made you join College Fund
for Art School? Really? Yeah.

2113
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:41,361
Well,

2114
02:05:41,361 --> 02:05:43,850
you're pretty convinced that we weren't
going to go to war during those times

2115
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:48,650
lately. I was like war,
you know, I didn't,

2116
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:53,120
I just didn't believe it.
And then, uh, I got, uh,

2117
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:57,980
I got appointed to go, I got this
through long process, but uh, uh,

2118
02:05:58,190 --> 02:05:59,480
basically it got handed a,

2119
02:05:59,481 --> 02:06:02,960
an opportunity to go to west point by
going to the preparatory school for a year

2120
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:05,470
and uh,
got to the end.

2121
02:06:05,471 --> 02:06:07,790
Like when I finally got my
appointment to go to west point,

2122
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:12,620
they said basically you have to forfeit
your army college fund to go to art

2123
02:06:12,621 --> 02:06:16,610
school. And I didn't really go
into be a career military person.

2124
02:06:16,611 --> 02:06:20,930
I kind of went into get college fund so
I can go pursue the arts. But you know,

2125
02:06:20,931 --> 02:06:25,450
but you're being, again, I was being, my
behavior is being reinforced as far as my,

2126
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:29,540
the way I was excelling as
in, in um, in the military.

2127
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:34,700
Um, so it was very tempting to go, I
could be an officer, let's do that.

2128
02:06:35,470 --> 02:06:37,970
And then you get, you know, I got to
that moment where I had to like add them,

2129
02:06:37,971 --> 02:06:38,870
make that decision.

2130
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:43,900
In that moment you have basically I had
like three hours to check the yes box

2131
02:06:43,941 --> 02:06:44,091
then.

2132
02:06:44,091 --> 02:06:49,091
Except my appointment or check the no
box and go back into the regular army and

2133
02:06:50,721 --> 02:06:55,450
they go back to and go to art school and
I chose, I chose art school. All right.

2134
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:59,600
And I, if I had not done
that, I would have provided,
I made it through west point,

2135
02:06:59,601 --> 02:07:02,120
which is not a guarantee.
If I'd have made it through west point,

2136
02:07:02,121 --> 02:07:04,700
I would have been in the first
Gulf war as a lieutenant.

2137
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:09,960
Wow. That's fucking crazy. Golf for one,

2138
02:07:09,961 --> 02:07:12,240
I think they call it.
I had a friend who,

2139
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:15,540
he's a cop and he was in the army reserve,

2140
02:07:15,541 --> 02:07:20,541
the army reserve for 20 years and had
less than a month to go till he was out

2141
02:07:22,231 --> 02:07:26,280
for 20 years and they shipped him
to Iraq for a year and a half.

2142
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:28,793
Come again.

2143
02:07:29,010 --> 02:07:34,010
He was in the reserves and the reserves
during the Iraq war or after September

2144
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:39,190
11 they just started sending people
over there. You were under contract.

2145
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:42,100
That's it. It does. It didn't
matter if you had a month ago.

2146
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:46,900
During that month you were assigned a
year and a half tour of Iraq and he went

2147
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:49,930
not just once. He went and came
back and they sent him again.

2148
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:55,800
They sent him twice and he did three years
in Iraq when he had less than a month

2149
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:58,180
ago. And there was nothing
he could do about it.

2150
02:07:58,181 --> 02:08:02,320
His whole life was thrown into
chaos. You, it was his relationship.

2151
02:08:02,321 --> 02:08:06,730
His job is everything
gone. Yep. Sorry, you,

2152
02:08:06,731 --> 02:08:11,050
you live in Iraq now. You, you're
over there. You're a soldier. I mean,

2153
02:08:11,051 --> 02:08:14,680
he is a fascinating thing to watch.
Like,

2154
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:17,570
well at least he made you a
free life. He got lucky. Yeah.

2155
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:21,440
He came back different though. I'll
tell you that. He came back, uh,

2156
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:26,320
you could tell he had seen some shit.
There's no avoiding that. I mean, he,

2157
02:08:26,321 --> 02:08:31,030
uh, he saw combat duty
and wasn't planning on it.

2158
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:34,330
So thought he was getting out, thought
he was going home, thought reserve,

2159
02:08:34,331 --> 02:08:39,190
met reserve, you know, thought,
thought 30 days meant 30 days. Nope.

2160
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:42,700
No,
it means to one and a half year tours,

2161
02:08:42,701 --> 02:08:47,560
or at least all in total was somewhere
around three years. The beach.

2162
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:51,760
Well, we don't have water, but we got Sam.

2163
02:08:53,190 --> 02:08:54,070
Yeah,
I dunno.

2164
02:08:55,150 --> 02:08:59,700
I guess there's good to be gotten
from almost everything, but uh,

2165
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:03,390
but for you at least it was a
positive. It's dyed dodge, you know,

2166
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:08,190
quite metaphorically and literally
dodged a bullet. Yeah. Wow.

2167
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:13,140
That must be something you think about
often. But you know, I could see,

2168
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:18,330
you know, I could see how
I could've excelled at that
and done well for, you know,

2169
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:21,040
done my part in that setting.
Uh,

2170
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:25,620
I have an aptitude for it and I have a
lot of my friends are law enforcement and

2171
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:30,280
a military, so, uh, I get
along with him. Well, you know,

2172
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:34,050
I also have all my crazy liberal
friends that I get along with. Well,

2173
02:09:34,051 --> 02:09:36,540
so I think I just would have been,
if it would've,

2174
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:38,460
it was a path that I would've chosen,

2175
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:40,920
I would've just done
whatever I could do with it.

2176
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,800
The law enforcement friends,

2177
02:09:42,801 --> 02:09:47,570
I bet understand your friendship with
the crazy hippies and liberals more than

2178
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:52,460
the crazy liberals. Understand your
real relationships with law enforcement.

2179
02:09:52,461 --> 02:09:54,440
Absolutely. And that funny. Yeah.

2180
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:02,750
Yeah. God bless him. God bless
him. All the open minded liberals.

2181
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,030
Yeah.
Yes.

2182
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:07,670
There's not that many of those are there.
Well it boils down to it.

2183
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:09,860
There's a lot of aggressive progressive's.

2184
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:13,870
Yeah. And I, I noticed
that. Yeah. And you know,

2185
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:15,730
coming from that background of being,
you know,

2186
02:10:15,731 --> 02:10:19,630
supposedly like the Liberal Democrat,
it's pretty amazing.

2187
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:22,870
Well, they have this idea and they think
that it's right and they think that they

2188
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:26,710
should, uh, violently, uh, tried to, uh,

2189
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:31,930
support that idea. You know, whether or
not other people have that idea or not,

2190
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,110
they think that their ideas

2191
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,620
correct and their ideas on
the right side of history.

2192
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:40,610
And so it's something to be
something to be violently pursued.

2193
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:45,770
Baboon. Yeah. But boom, I don't
know. I don't know who's right.

2194
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:49,730
I don't think any of them are, the truth
is in the middle somewhere. Right? Yeah.

2195
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:55,340
Listen, man, I've got to go to the
airport and I think five hours. All right,

2196
02:10:55,370 --> 02:10:58,670
so let's wrap this bitch up. I
just, I just came from the airport.

2197
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:01,310
Thank you for doing this, man. I'm
glad you did. I'm glad you did.

2198
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:04,540
You mean you literally pulled right
up the cars out front and then, um,

2199
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:09,430
