1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,710
Mm,

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,830
so why aren't there flying cars?
Just jumping right in.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,040
You don't say hi.
You don't say how I you ready?

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,930
How's the wife and kids buddy?
Man,

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,090
how's life?
How's your book?

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,150
It's been on the times bestseller list 
for how many weeks?

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,790
Oh,
the astrophysics for people in a hurry.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,740
That's one on the.
On the New York Times best.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,190
It was for 67 weeks.
That's pretty intense.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,320
That's,
that's a lot for any book.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,183
Much less for a science book and so that
tells me while all these trump books or 

12
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:39,760
wafting in and out,
this is bobbing like a court,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,653
like a cork on the ocean waves as the 
book of the moment that they're either 

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,923
praises trump or criticized or 
criticizes him come in and off of that 

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:49,984
list.
So this tells me that there is this 

16
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:57,130
unserved hunger that people have.
There's a curiosity that this is serving

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,960
and it's to astrophysics for people in a
hurry.

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,350
That's kind of,
that's very purposefully juxtaposed.

19
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:08,260
It's like neurosurgery in four easy 
steps.

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,940
You know,
if you saw a book with that title,

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,900
you'd have to pick it up.
You wonder what's going on,

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,063
not to kiss your ass again,
but I always say this about you and I 

23
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:17,764
think it's important you make learning 
stuff about astrophysics fun and that's 

24
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,200
what's missing.
You know,

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,660
it's not that people don't like to be 
educated that they don't like to learn.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,760
They just don't want to be bored.
That's a perceptive point because,

27
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,210
you know,
think of the image we have of.

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,060
Let's say you're in a school where most 
people don't go to college.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,340
You're in high school and then last day 
of school comes.

30
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,174
What do people do?
They tossed their papers in the air as 

31
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,320
they run down the steps.
Schools out.

32
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:48,790
No,
but what's the rock song?

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,510
School fall summit.

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,790
Was it forever?
Don't ever.

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,053
Forever ever.
So that attitude must mean the school 

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,643
didn't train you to embrace curiosity.
That learning was a chore and now the 

37
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:06,904
Chores are over.
So I think the educational system needs 

38
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,504
an adjustment.
Forget whether or not you go to college 

39
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:15,550
because you're going to spend more years
not in school than in school.

40
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,800
Even if you do go to college,
what you want,

41
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:20,920
I think are lifelong learners,
lifelong curiosity,

42
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,410
where once you are trained and,
and,

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,283
and,
and your curiosity is stimulated the 

44
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,510
curiosity.
We all had his children.

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,540
Your children don't need to be taught to
be curious.

46
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,463
They are curious to the point of 
destruction of whatever it is they 

47
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:36,131
touch.
Oh,

48
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:38,920
what is this egg on the counter?
What is this glass?

49
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,380
What is this plate?
What's under a rock?

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,700
What happens when I pull a leg off a 
daddy long legs?

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,000
You know they are experimenting with the
world.

52
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,910
We don't think of it that way,
but that's what it is.

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,030
They're all born scientists and I say 
this often,

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,750
you spend the first years of a child's 
life teaching it to walk and talk.

55
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,550
Then he spent the rest of his life tell 
it to shut up and sit down.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,090
It's this,

57
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,880
this is the wrong combination.
So speaking as an educator,

58
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,881
I think a missing component of school.
Is it the teachers?

59
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,630
Is that the curriculum?
I don't know,

60
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,520
but when you get out of school,
you should say to yourself,

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,320
damn,
I want to learn more.

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,300
It's almost universally accepted to 
that.

63
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,880
That's when you're learning ends.
When you get out of college,

64
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:19,714
it's over.
Then you say you're done and if it 

65
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,334
doesn't,
you're ossified in line and that's how 

66
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,823
when the job market shifts,
you're not ready for it because you 

67
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,260
don't know how to think.
You don't know how to learn and it's the

68
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,094
difference in the in the workplace 
between the person who gets an 

69
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,780
assignment because I,
I,

70
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,200
I,
Joey,

71
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,520
Janet,
I need you to do this.

72
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,750
That's not in my job description.
I'm not trained for this.

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,090
That's one kind of person in a 
workplace.

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,060
Another kind of person is a,
here's a new task I need you to do.

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,770
Wow,
I've never seen that before.

76
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,870
Great.
Let me figure it out.

77
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,123
These are two completely different 
species of human being and what the 

78
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,834
world needs more of is like the second 
case where you take a new task and you 

79
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,874
say,
wow,

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,890
I get to learn.
I'm going to learn on my own.

81
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,890
I'll ask people who know more,
you just,

82
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,813
you just embrace the act of learning to 
satisfy your curiosity and I think this 

83
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,820
book is capturing that in the public.
Oh,

84
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,250
it must be doing something.
Yeah.

85
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,280
Yeah.
Sixty.

86
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:16,900
How many weeks?
Sixty seven weeks.

87
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,270
Yeah.
That's a lot of weeks.

88
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,410
Yeah.
Every morning I wake up,

89
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,790
I'm calm,
but I'm really not calm.

90
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,930
I'm saying,
Holy Shit.

91
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,260
Sorry.
You're alive.

92
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,080
I can't.
Can I say,

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,690
Oh shit.
I can say it.

94
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,520
Tyson swears ladies and gentlemen.
And then people think you're a robot.

95
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,400
Now they know.
Oh,

96
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,490
this is great sign.
I think,

97
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,680
and I think your podcast is a great sign
as well,

98
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,660
the success of your podcast and success 
of a lot of science podcasts.

99
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,643
Uh,
uh,

100
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,543
that's an excellent that you noticed 
that there's a rise of science curious 

101
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,054
podcast out there.
Stuff to blow your mind is one that I 

102
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,410
really enjoy.
I really love radio lab.

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,273
They've always got elaborately 
interesting science of annual perennial 

104
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,111
favorite.
Fantastic.

105
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,300
So many.
Probably the best,

106
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,200
right?
Yeah.

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,270
And,
and yours as well and I love chuck.

108
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,170
Nice.
Shout out to chuck.

109
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,223
Chuck.
Chuck.

110
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,390
Chuck.
He's great.

111
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,710
But what you're doing is you're making 
learning interesting and that's why it's

112
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,130
so fun.
It's,

113
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:10,690
it's,
it's,

114
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,700
it's,
there's excitement to it,

115
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,980
and you bring a comedian like chuck on 
with you.

116
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,023
Things get silly,
but they're also curious and you're 

117
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:22,000
getting these experts and everyone's 
talking about these various subjects.

118
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:22,834
And as you know,
not only yourself as an exemplar of 

119
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,674
this,
a standup comedians are some of the 

120
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,010
smartest people in the world.
They have that.

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,800
They have an awareness of that far.
Listen,

122
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,890
come to the comedy store with me to the 
upstage your mind.

123
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,340
Alright,
let me buffer that a serious.

124
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,160
Okay.
No.

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,090
So,
so stand up.

126
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,890
Comedians are perceptive people.
Yes.

127
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,440
And for sure.
And they're aware and they notice things

128
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,274
that you don't notice.
They see the same things you do and get 

129
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,380
to shape it in a way you never thought 
possible.

130
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,290
And then you end up laughing at other 
things at yourself.

131
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,040
Was it your idea

132
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,550
to do your show with standups?
So.

133
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,960
So to what we have there,
there,

134
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,310
there were several of us who created 
this concept and we,

135
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,003
there's a Helen Matzos is one of the 
partners and there's another one who's 

136
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,620
now left,
but um,

137
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,110
uh,
what's his name in a minute,

138
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,890
but there are three of us who David 
Gamble is his name.

139
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:22,970
The three of us got together and applied
for a national science foundation grant.

140
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,170
What we said was there are programs out 
there that serve people who already know

141
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,800
they like science,
but who serves the people who don't know

142
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,760
they like science or better yet the 
people who know they don't like science.

143
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,970
There's nothing for them because they've
already rejected it.

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,073
They're not going to tune in to science 
Friday because they don't like science 

145
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,800
on NPR.
Right?

146
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,120
So what we thought was supposed we bring
in a celebrity,

147
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,120
we've all the pop culture draw.

148
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,283
This is the pop culture scaffold.
We bring in the scaffold and clad the 

149
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,670
scaffold with science because whatever 
the celebrity does,

150
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,533
it doesn't matter.
There's going to be science in that 

151
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,754
person's life.
We had the guy who portrayed Gollum in 

152
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,493
Lord of the Rings,
a lot of Sockeye that suit that he had 

153
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,560
to wear.
Exactly.

154
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,650
So what we did was we,
um,

155
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,850
uh,
so with the interview and we,

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,880
we talked about the technology necessary
to portray Gollum as a light.

157
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,120
He portrayed that live that was not some
law later animation.

158
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,193
He is live and he's got his whole body 
wired up for this and he is that voice 

159
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,070
and he is portraying it.
So,

160
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,110
so whatever it is that you have done 
that you do,

161
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,710
there is some because it's evidence that
science is everywhere.

162
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,360
You're not going to,
you can't say,

163
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,440
Oh,
I'm done with science,

164
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,274
let me sell my textbook and move onto 
other things because practically 

165
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,500
anything else you do has been touched by
science.

166
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,350
And so startalk is a celebration of 
that.

167
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,380
And then it jumps species.
And so now we're on TV now.

168
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,553
All right.
It is a TV show on national geographic 

169
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,310
channel.
Start Talk.

170
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,970
And then since you started this,
by the way,

171
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:01,140
I,
it,

172
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,990
I didn't come here and talk about you.
You started this.

173
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,060
Um,
we're,

174
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,893
we're,
it's our fourth year in a row where 

175
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,560
we're nominated for an emmy for 
outstanding informational programming.

176
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,360
Are you going to keep doing cosmos too 
though?

177
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,070
Because they'll cosmos so,
so.

178
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,120
So I have one week remaining out of like
70 shoot days to finish shooting cosmos.

179
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,020
Possible worlds premiering spring,
2019 is the third installment of Cosmos.

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,070
If you trace the first one to Carl Sagan
back in 1980,

181
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,280
can I use your segment on wolves on how 
wolves became dogs?

182
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh,
showed it to my kids.

183
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,610
And that's right.
You see the little wheel spin and like,

184
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:42,490
whoa.
Yeah,

185
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,180
those,
that's how a dog became a dog or did you

186
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,014
didn't see as I'm sitting at the,
at the campfire and this snowy 

187
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,960
environment and they got wolves walking 
around me.

188
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,260
They're on these fishing wires because 
they are not dogs.

189
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,630
Okay.
They,

190
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,510
they do whatever the fuck they want to 
correct.

191
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,760
And when they look at you,
it's,

192
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,673
it's like,
should I rip his neck out now or later 

193
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,900
when I'm more hungry?
Did Not.

194
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
There's no eye contact with them because
they you don't,

195
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,830
that they don't see you as anything 
other than something that could possibly

196
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,570
eat and so you can't interact with them 
the way you would with ordinary dogs.

197
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
So they're on these fishing,
you know,

198
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,400
high tension fishing wire that you can't
see against the snow.

199
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,593
And they were like hooting and hollering
around me as I described in the name of 

200
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,490
that show is.
And the wolf shall become the shepherd.

201
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,003
Yeah.
My friend did a commercial with a wolf 

202
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,013
and A.
There's this commercial where he's 

203
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,024
running up this mountain and the wolf is
there and at the end of the commercial 

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,470
they had to get the wolf to snarl.

205
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,603
So what the trainer does is he shows the
wolf some meat and then he pulls the 

206
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:49,560
meat away from the wolf and the wolf 
snarls and they're like.

207
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,600
And then the commercials over,
he's like,

208
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,191
no,
no,

209
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,240
is no working after that.
There's no.

210
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,040
You can not going to be near the wolf.
That switch is turned on.

211
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,000
Done.
Yeah.

212
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,370
And it's,
it's crazy.

213
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,820
He's like,
once that thing snarled,

214
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,550
everybody just backed off and the 
trainer let everybody know,

215
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,920
like once I get to this point,
we're done.

216
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,720
Like there's no more and that things 
like,

217
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,560
okay everybody,
we're done.

218
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,193
Fuck Outta here.
All three of these cosmos is the 

219
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:20,820
original one with Carl Sagan,
the one that,

220
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,910
the privilege of hosting in 2014 and 
2019.

221
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Our Co written by Andrew [inaudible] and
she's the widow of Carl Sagan.

222
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,643
Oh Wow.
And,

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,673
but she kind of in his shadow back then,
but she's hugely creative and highly 

224
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:39,430
enlightened and so most of the sort of 
the,

225
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,340
the,
the,

226
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,300
the soul energy,
if you will.

227
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,390
The what makes cosmos distinct from 
other,

228
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,870
from other documentaries where you're 
sort of sitting there learning,

229
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:52,830
you put your thinking cap on your 
learning cap on in cosmos.

230
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,530
It's your feeling cap.
You're not only learning,

231
00:10:55,531 --> 00:11:00,531
you're also feeling the science and its 
relationship to you to civilization,

232
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,330
to the world,
to the universe.

233
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,583
And her infusion of this.
She's a highly scientifically literate 

234
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,650
writer,
producer.

235
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,873
And so I just give a shout out to her.
Just working with her has been a 

236
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:18,000
delight.
Is Cosmos on Apple TV or cosmos?

237
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,823
Cosmos was a after it first after it 
premiered on Fox and then went 

238
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:27,000
internationally.
Annette Geo it then went to Netflix.

239
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,050
So.
But I think this run of Netflix is going

240
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:34,530
to drop until the next one comes in.
I think they want to clear the clear,

241
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:37,560
the landing zone for the next cosmos,
but it went to Netflix,

242
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,290
but is it available for anyone to get 
right now?

243
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,510
Oh,
right now I should be.

244
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,100
I haven't checked.
That's a great question.

245
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,380
I have it all on my dvr and I'm scared 
to delete it.

246
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh yeah.
I have like six percent less space.

247
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,530
That's what everyone's Dvr.
Looks like.

248
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,820
I got all your cosmos is in there.
Yeah.

249
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,070
So thanks.
Thanks for having.

250
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,290
Having them all in there.
Was that Morgan Freeman show?

251
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,150
But uh,
the through the,

252
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:01,460
through the warm warm hall.
Yeah,

253
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:02,700
I got that on there too.
Yeah,

254
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,290
that was great.
That's Joe Rogan thing.

255
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,340
Yeah.
If you didn't have that,

256
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,190
I'd be disappointed.
If I say you're an imposter,

257
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,800
you're a fake.
It's,

258
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,510
it's an opportunity to be entertained 
and learn,

259
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,373
which I think is what everybody misses 
and I think that's what's missing in 

260
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,350
most public education.
People are bored and you take these kids

261
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:24,184
with so much energy and then you make 
them sit still and watch something 

262
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,214
that's not even remotely stimulating by 
a person who doesn't really care to be 

263
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:29,800
there.

264
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,633
Right,
and they know,

265
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,060
they know this,
they know this intuitively,

266
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,450
if not explicitly that the enthusiasm is
absent.

267
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,613
Yeah,
they could feel it and just it's the 

268
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,094
worst way to learn.
It's the worst way and it's so hard to 

269
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,360
escape.
Once you get out of that system,

270
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,373
it takes forever for a lot of these 
people to just get their excitement 

271
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,110
about education back.
You know what I say?

272
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,970
When I address teachers,
we all,

273
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,210
by the way,
I'll do this right now in this room that

274
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,010
we have only three of us,
but let's.

275
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,550
Let's take a show of hands in your life 
with all the teachers you've ever had in

276
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,384
every class you've ever taken.
How many had like a singular influence 

277
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,400
on who and what you became?
Give me a number.

278
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,900
It's going to be,
I'm betting it's five or fewer.

279
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,850
Probably more like three.
Yeah,

280
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,140
for teachers.
What's your number?

281
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,213
Well,
there's the one that I talked about on 

282
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,114
your show the last time I saw you.
Thanks for coming on to start talking 

283
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,320
about pleasure.
Um,

284
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,930
who was a science teacher that I had 
when I believe I was in seventh grade.

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,833
Right.
Told me that if you really want to hurt 

286
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:37,750
your brain,
look up and recognize the fact that that

287
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,970
goes on forever.
That this is infinite.

288
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:42,850
And then just think about what that 
means.

289
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,010
Infinite.
That there really is no end to it.

290
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,733
So how many teachers such as that were 
so influential on you that one guy 

291
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,570
saying that one.
So if you missed one class,

292
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,450
he might be the one.
And what do you got to?

293
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,900
For me it's like two and a half and I've
had scores of teachers,

294
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,603
100 teachers at least.
So what I tell teachers is be that 

295
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:08,920
teacher to your students.

296
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,720
We've all had those teachers be that 
teacher.

297
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,190
And in every case it wasn't because the 
topic was something you knew in advance,

298
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,024
you would like.
It's because their energy for sharing 

299
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:20,134
their passion and love for the subject 
was palpable and it just spilled out of 

300
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:27,610
him and went into course through your 
veins and your arteries and you walk out

301
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,260
of there thinking,
wow,

302
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,330
that was the most interesting thing I've
ever done in my life.

303
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,223
You don't even care what you get on a 
test after that because you got touched 

304
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,733
and you became an enlightened 
participant and that exercise in that 

305
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,300
exploration.
Yeah.

306
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:42,134
It's so hard for them to even get kids 
attention though unfortunately matches 

307
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,033
going on.
Unfortunately that could be in some 

308
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,283
places,
half the energy of the teachers is 

309
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,500
maintaining order.
I think the success of your book,

310
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,334
the success of your show,
your podcast and many of these other 

311
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,813
really intelligent podcasts are showing 
that there's an appetite for this stuff 

312
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,020
out there.
Yeah.

313
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,060
And I'm delighted to be a servant of 
that curiosity and um,

314
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,003
this,
I brought this just because it's not 

315
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,120
even out yet.
This is your earring,

316
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,490
like now live.
This is it.

317
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,370
You realize you were.
Okay.

318
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,100
So this is like a five second delay,
or is that the belief on my ex?

319
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,140
What is the successor to war?
Oh,

320
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,850
this,
this is like another book.

321
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:31,030
I just,
this is coming out in three weeks.

322
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,370
Was this about space for accessory to 
war?

323
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,440
The unspoken alliance between 
astrophysics and the military?

324
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,910
Uh,
yeah.

325
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:41,744
So,
so this other book was astrophysics for 

326
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:46,610
people in a hurry.
If you're in a hurry,

327
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
do not buy this.
People that are.

328
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,520
This is not.
This is not what.

329
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,290
This is not an impulse item at the 
checkout line that says you got this is.

330
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,060
This is all about,
by the way,

331
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,240
we know what role the physicist plays in
war.

332
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,940
The physicist makes the bomb invents the
bomb,

333
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,253
the chemist perfects napalm,
the biologists weaponizes anthrax and 

334
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,074
the astrophysicist,
well we sit at the end of a telescope 

335
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,044
and wait for photons to cross the 
universe and enter our detector and we 

336
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,740
go into conferences and argue about 
them.

337
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,130
So there is no obvious connection 
between what we do and military strength

338
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,850
had Gemini,
a dominance empire building.

339
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,580
It's just not obvious.
That's why the subtitle,

340
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,300
the unspoken alliance,
it's not a secret,

341
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,790
it's just not there.
It's there,

342
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,560
but it's not.
Nobody's talking about it.

343
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,040
Do you realize.
I just give an example.

344
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,160
Okay.
If you needed more reasons to think that

345
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,980
Columbus was a dick.
Okay.

346
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,880
Let me add one to it.
When we were kids and today.

347
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:02,241
Yeah,
I know,

348
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,074
I know,
but actually I do have something smiled 

349
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,260
redeeming to offer about Columbus if you
have the time.

350
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,250
I just want to start off with that.
Do you want me start out with that?

351
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,960
With how you want to do it,
but I'll do the dick part as a dick.

352
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,380
Okay.
So on his third voyage,

353
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,290
he's in,
by the time he have his third voyage,

354
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,243
he had already planted enough Spanish 
flags that Spain had already begun to 

355
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:30,101
set up governments and infrastructures 
in these places that he had a compound.

356
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,780
Yeah.
Basically conquered and so,

357
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,070
so in one of the places I was in the 
book accurately,

358
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:42,650
but I think it's Hispaniola one of the 
island today,

359
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,080
he has to get back.
Is this third voyage?

360
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,921
15.
Oh,

361
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:46,910
3:15.
Oh four.

362
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,040
He's got to get back to Spain.
He doesn't have enough,

363
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,070
not

364
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,190
enough food for his crew,
so he asks the natives,

365
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,623
would you please give us some of your 
stock that you have collected from your 

366
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:00,450
farming?
Now,

367
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,284
this particular group of natives only 
makes exactly the amount of food they 

368
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:08,310
need to tie to the next crop.
They don't have surplus,

369
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,750
so they said,
no,

370
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,400
we don't have surplus.
Sorry.

371
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,133
Columbus knew that one week,
hence coincidentally there was gonna be 

372
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:21,540
a total lunar eclipse with a moon in its
orbit around Earth,

373
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,374
enters earth's shadow.
The full moon enters earth shadow and 

374
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,290
disappears and that the geometry of that
event,

375
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,080
it's just a simple lunar eclipse,
but the geometry of sets,

376
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:34,914
that sunlight passes around earth 
through earth's atmosphere and takes on 

377
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:43,470
sunset colors that Leech into Earth's 
shadow giving the moon.

378
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,030
If you can see it at all,
a deep red amber hue,

379
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,913
almost the color of blood Columbus set,
and he knew about this because he had 

380
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:56,240
read the tables,
the eclipse tables.

381
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,123
All right.
We had known enough about the solar 

382
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:02,760
system at the time to w we we got that.
Okay.

383
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,541
Actually,
back then,

384
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,080
it was just the known world with Earth 
in the middle of the known universe,

385
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,600
but that didn't matter.
The rhythms of the universe were known.

386
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,260
He says to the natives,
if you do not give us food,

387
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,753
my God,
which is more powerful than your God 

388
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,900
will make the moon disappear and it will
turn blood red.

389
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,260
That will happen in one week.
You have one week to comply.

390
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,480
Some of them were skeptical of what you 
can't.

391
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,320
What others said.
We got it to what this guy said.

392
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,760
Look at the ships.
They came in,

393
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,290
their guns,
their power,

394
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,910
their,
their culture.

395
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:39,540
Look what they've got.
Sure enough,

396
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,650
right on cue,
the moon begins to disappear.

397
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,550
According to that,
that is a famous woodcut.

398
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,480
You know you got this.

399
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,513
Oh,
those viewing the video of this as a 

400
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:52,854
famous woodcut and notice the natives 
bowing to him and he stands proudly 

401
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,070
because he knows the science.
He knows the astronomy.

402
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,173
He knew this and so he invokes this to 
dominate people who are not yet 

403
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,510
scientifically literate and within 
seconds of this beginning,

404
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,700
they bring them all the resources he 
wants and he gets out.

405
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,100
We don't know what happened,
you know,

406
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,100
back at the island whether the people 
survive the winter,

407
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,293
but he got back to the island that that 
is one microcosm of a set of ways that 

408
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,980
the universe has been invoked in this.
I'll give you another example.

409
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,814
Los Alamos national labs,
they today as basically since their 

410
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:31,974
inception,
are charged with tracking the nuclear 

411
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:39,120
arsenal of the United States are nuclear
power.

412
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,060
The nukes that would go into nuclear 
weapons.

413
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,180
They think about this.
Do you realize they hire astrophysicist?

414
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,530
I had colleagues work in there.
You know why?

415
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,800
Because there is a room.
There are two rooms.

416
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,410
I mean I'm,
I'm,

417
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,243
I'm simplifying this,
but basically there are two rooms 

418
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:57,250
adjacent to one another and a computer 
between the two of them,

419
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,533
the most powerful computers in the world
and there is code running on those 

420
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:07,171
computers that calculate the energy 
yield of hydrogen fusion.

421
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,600
That's exactly what an astrophysicist 
cares about when stars blow up.

422
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,793
Okay,
the sun is undergoing nuclear fusion 

423
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:20,500
right now and that's how it's making 
energy and when the.

424
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,850
When high mass stars dies,
they explode.

425
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,743
Supernova.
This is a natural thing going on there 

426
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,990
in the universe on the other side,
that's a classified room.

427
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,333
They're calculating yield of hydrogen 
bombs and they have lunch together and 

428
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,063
they compare notes.
The government doesn't always have the 

429
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,114
best people,
but if you hire some of the best people 

430
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,983
to do whatever it is they want and their
calculations happen to relate to a 

431
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:52,090
military project there you have a two 
way street in progress.

432
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,150
Why do you think the Hubble telescope 
that the,

433
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,510
the,
the mirror issues not withstanding which

434
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:00,340
were ultimately fixed when it was first 
launched,

435
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,353
why was that so successful?
There were versions of the Hubble 

436
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:08,911
telescope previously launched by the 
military looking down that,

437
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,800
that the model for that telescope had 
already been conceived and built and was

438
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,640
operating.
Then we say,

439
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,620
oh,
we want one of those.

440
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,170
Okay,
but that's not public that this is going

441
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,180
on.
We designed with the telescope,

442
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,014
gets designed as the benefit of previous
versions of it having been used 

443
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,530
successfully,
but looking down and we look up,

444
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,143
this is the perennial two way street of 
astronomy in the old days and in modern 

445
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:36,724
times,
astrophysics and the invention of the 

446
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,760
telescope.
You haven't said anything yet or are you

447
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,100
just.
You're a good listener.

448
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,420
I'll should I keep.
Just keep talking.

449
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,850
What am I preventing you from 
interrupting?

450
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't worry about me.
Okay,

451
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,180
fine.
Galileo perfects the telescope.

452
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,520
He learned that it had just been 
invented in the Netherlands.

453
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,160
The Dutch were were up opticians.
Alright,

454
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,013
so they invented the telescope and the 
microscope within a couple of years of 

455
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:04,480
one another.
This transformed science.

456
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,120
When did they invent the eyeglass?
The reading class?

457
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,010
The reading class.
I was earlier than that,

458
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:09,844
but I don't.
I don't know when the real advance was 

459
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,480
putting two lenses in line with one 
another.

460
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,720
Sounds trivial in modern times,
but that was a huge leap.

461
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,350
Conceptual leap and what you would 
accomplish and in so doing,

462
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,020
depending on how you curve them and how 
you grind them,

463
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,630
grind the,
the shape of those lenses,

464
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,610
you would get a microscope or telescope 
and and we're off to the races.

465
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:34,240
That's basically the birth of modern 
science as we now think of it and,

466
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,110
and,
and,

467
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,220
and conducted.

468
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:41,290
Because you say to yourself,
my sense is I don't trust them to be the

469
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,690
full record of what's going on in front 
of me.

470
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,860
You pull out a microscope,
oh my gosh.

471
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,260
He got the microscope guy.
He thought he got a drop of pond water,

472
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,860
puts it under his microscope just to 
think to do this.

473
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,203
It's just water.
Why do you think that's something 

474
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:59,180
interesting to do?
He said,

475
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:01,100
I wonder.
He was curious.

476
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:05,730
He puts it under and sees little what he
described as an macules.

477
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,063
Happily a swimming anime macules.
These are like the Amoebas and 

478
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,820
paramecium and Oh,
it is.

479
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,360
And so he writes a heat reports on this 
too,

480
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,540
to the scientific authorities and they 
don't believe in a,

481
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,580
say a bodily one hook.
We think you might have had too much gin

482
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:33,680
before you wrote this.
Why would anyone believe this?

483
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,820
That there's entire creatures,
an entire universe of creatures thriving

484
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,683
in a drop of pond water,
and so the way science works is one 

485
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,690
report does not make it true.

486
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,553
You need verification.
They send people to the Netherlands to 

487
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:48,584
verify as results and there it was,
the birth of microscopy and then they 

488
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,850
looked at everything sells,
you know,

489
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,170
they need vocabulary to describe what 
you're now seeing.

490
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,220
Well,
that was the.

491
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,053
The journey down small than the journey 
went up big and Galileo perfects the 

492
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,080
telescope.
He looks up and says,

493
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,000
Whoa,
I see craters,

494
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,170
mountains,
valleys on the moon,

495
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:13,460
and the sun has spots.
Venus goes through phases.

496
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This became the Corpus of evidence for 
earth going around the sun in Supportive

497
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,520
Copernicus's idea that earth went around
the sun.

498
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,983
My point is,
what was the second thing he did with 

499
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,440
his telescope?
He telephone nothing.

500
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,793
He contacted the Doge of Venice,
invited him to the cocktail hour and 

501
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:35,774
said,
look at what this instrument can do for 

502
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,080
you.
As we look out into the lagoon,

503
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,303
you can identify a ship's intentions,
friend or foe by its flag 10 times 

504
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,400
farther away than you can with the 
unaided eye.

505
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,573
Venice bought a boat load of these 
telescopes in the service of their 

506
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:56,444
military defense and this was a source 
of money to Galileo and now he could go 

507
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:02,504
look at the universe.
This has been a two way street ever 

508
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,540
since people have looked up,
so this is.

509
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,400
This is an accounting of that.
This is it's and and it's it,

510
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,790
it goes on and on.
The first x ray machines for airports.

511
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,193
You're old enough to remember.
Why would they put in because of 

512
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,744
hijackings to Cuba basically that they 
were armed hijackings of airplanes of 

513
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:28,070
American carriers to Cuba and Congress 
said,

514
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,420
we gotta do something about that.
Oh,

515
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,254
by the way,
there's a company in Boston called 

516
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:35,240
American Science and engineering that 
was building an x ray detector,

517
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,343
small enough to put on a satellite to 
observe the universe and x rays at 

518
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:42,594
because no one had zero.

519
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,453
We've used visible light but not extra.
That's a branch or the electromagnetic 

520
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,674
spectrum.
We think if there are black holes out 

521
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,353
there,
their region surrounding them will give 

522
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:54,960
us x rays.
It's a new window on the universe,

523
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,270
and then they said,
oh my gosh,

524
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,160
there's a call for x ray machines at 
airports.

525
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,053
We've got the technology that we've 
perfected to put in a fricking 

526
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,850
satellite.
So the technology for those ones,

527
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:08,400
you walked through the airport initially
came initially.

528
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,930
Yes,
yes,

529
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,790
yes.
There was a two way street.

530
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:12,571
There was,
oh my gosh,

531
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,550
we need this for security.
Oh by God we would.

532
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,870
We were using.
Let's let.

533
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,750
Let's apply that technology to these 
detectors.

534
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,613
Well,
that's been a lot of the stuff with the 

535
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,150
space program.
Right,

536
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:21,984
and a lot of the stuff that they devised
for use on the space station and some 

537
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:27,330
many other technologies have trickled 
their way down into.

538
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,010
That always happens and even some simple
things because people say,

539
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,890
why spend money up there and we should 
be spending it down here.

540
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:37,920
But there's interesting fact here that 
is almost never discussed.

541
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,653
The people who who think about the 
universe and study of the universe are 

542
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:46,710
hugely creative and the creative 
energies cannot be pre-prescribed.

543
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,971
You can go to,
uh,

544
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:48,804
create might,
but I don't know that you'll get their 

545
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:51,840
maximum creativity.
Say,

546
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,210
I need you to invent a cure for cancer 
right now.

547
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,060
Use that brilliance out.
Try.

548
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,130
But the greatest discoveries,
the greatest cures,

549
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,140
the greatest of these comes from a cross
pollination of interest that people have

550
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,393
that where they were engaged because 
they were interest interested just for 

551
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,460
the sake of being interested.
So watch now.

552
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,190
Here's an example.
The space shuttle.

553
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,120
It's a glider when it lands.
Okay,

554
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,990
it's got no engines.
It's got flaps.

555
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,820
There's a little bit of brakes and the 
tires,

556
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:27,030
but that's about it when it comes in.
Okay.

557
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:27,864
How do you make sure the thing that 
stays on track because they kept 

558
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,240
drifting and cross winds and this sort 
of thing.

559
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,960
And so they said,
why don't we groove the road so that the

560
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:37,794
rubber on the road,
the the runway so that the rubber can 

561
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,354
align with the grooves and stay in a 
straight line because rubber doesn't 

562
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,990
slide well when you have doesn't slide 
sideways very easily on crews.

563
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,660
When they realized how effective that 
was,

564
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,363
it's now put on off ramps to freeways.
If there's a freeway off ramp that's a 

565
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:59,940
little tight,
not quite banked well enough,

566
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,700
it's going to be grooved.
Check it out next time.

567
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,380
And you could say,
well,

568
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,600
okay,
that's pretty simple.

569
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:08,280
Low tech solution.
Why didn't we?

570
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,150
Why couldn't we just discovered that on 
our own without the $20,000,000,000

571
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,690
a year space agency called NASA,
but you didn't,

572
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,970
you didn't.
Power tools,

573
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,103
cordless high torque power tools were 
invented to service satellites in orbit 

574
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,423
by NASA because you can't just plug it 
into 120 volt socket when you're 

575
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,420
floating in space.
So the engineer said,

576
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,540
how are we going to solve this problem?
Let's make a high torque power tool.

577
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,130
So now NASA invents the heightened.
Now

578
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,450
that is the only way you're buying a 
power tool today is the,

579
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,373
is the cordless variety,
all construction sites that are looking 

580
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:54,421
for a power outlet for these things.
So why didn't we invent this without the

581
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:55,900
$20,000,000,000
space?

582
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,370
Right?
You didn't,

583
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,040
you weren't,
you didn't think about it.

584
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,001
You said,
oh,

585
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,290
I can plug it in.
This is great.

586
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,410
You're not even thinking what you need.
So yes,

587
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,050
there are all of these applications,
but,

588
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,080
but I don't think that's a good reason 
to do it,

589
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:13,780
but I don't think it's the best of the 
best reasons are my gosh,

590
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,093
don't you want to keep dreaming?
Don't you want to keep looking into the 

591
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:19,000
future?
That would be ideal,

592
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,893
but that's not attractive to people that
are spending tax dollars when it comes 

593
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:24,670
to tax dollars.
People get super pragmatic and they go,

594
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,560
why do we need to go to Mars now?

595
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,393
What we need to do is take care of this 
and pay for that and with a deficit and 

596
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,910
the budget and you know,
so you know,

597
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,883
and that's his budget today is four 
tenths of one percent of the federal 

598
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:43,660
budget.
So if you take a dollar or ten cents,

599
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I will quantify that for it to stay.
Take a dollar bill and imagine that your

600
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:53,650
tax dollar and you can like cut it to 
whatever percentage you want.

601
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,950
So let's cut four tenths of one percent 
off of the edge.

602
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,443
That doesn't get you into the ink.
You're still in the white border around 

603
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:02,614
it already.
Even notice that you can trim that off 

604
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:07,270
the dollar and pay for it and pay for 
it.

605
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,010
So my point is most of the people who 
say don't spend it here,

606
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:12,844
spend it there.
They think NASA has more budget than it 

607
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:17,824
actually does.

608
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,010
They just,
they.

609
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,680
If you asked them,
how much do you think getting,

610
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,820
oh,
10 percent,

611
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,740
five percent.
You know,

612
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,700
several percent.
No,

613
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:25,534
it's one half of one percent.
So if you're going to tell me that if 

614
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:29,464
you can take that four tenths of one 
percent and spend it in these other 

615
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,770
problems and solve them,
I would say,

616
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,180
yeah,
go right ahead.

617
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,014
But is this,
is this where you really want to pull 

618
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:40,354
the money from when it's the only thing 
that God has us thinking about tomorrow 

619
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,810
is just thinking about a future.
Well,

620
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,200
forgot like you,
that's super important.

621
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,400
But for a guy who lives in Cleveland,
who doesn't give a shit about science?

622
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,660
Oh No.
Excuse me.

623
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,850
That's like the person who says,
okay,

624
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,130
I don't need the space program.
Uh,

625
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,993
why do I need this space for Andre?
I have my cell phone and I have the 

626
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,710
weather channel and I know anything I 
need,

627
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,910
you know,
this is,

628
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,570
you're using gps satellites to 
understand where you are on this earth.

629
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,200
You to notice they were grandma's house 
is when you pull it.

630
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,470
It.
Who created what?

631
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,860
Who created spread spectrum technology 
that led the GPS and Wifi.

632
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,990
Who is that heady Lamarr?
Oh,

633
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,080
I didn't know that.
Yes,

634
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,900
the actress.
Nineteen 41.

635
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:23,650
Yes,
she did.

636
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,110
About the underrecognized.
We reminded me of super hot though.

637
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,120
That was the problem.
Nobody cared.

638
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,041
Like,
Hey,

639
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,260
you're smart too.
Yeah.

640
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,300
Yeah.
But yeah,

641
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,460
it would take decades to really realize 
that.

642
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,300
Of course,
GPS is launched by the military and it's

643
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:40,010
now hundreds of billions of dollars 
worth of

644
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,180
the American economy thriving on this 
space application,

645
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,193
but it was a military intent and it was 
to navigate the surface of the earth to 

646
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:54,350
navigate,
and the first Gulf War was the first big

647
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:58,760
use of space assets in the conduct of 
military operations.

648
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,440
I believe in even when hetty Lamar 
created it with another scientist.

649
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,333
The idea behind it was for encoded 
encoded transcriptions are encoded 

650
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:10,760
information during the war.
Well,

651
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:14,780
so that's a big challenge.
How do you encode information?

652
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,733
That's by the way,
the future of this might might come 

653
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,630
from.
It's still not clear.

654
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,570
The jury is still out in their sort of 
opposing views on this,

655
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:24,404
but you've heard about quantum entangled
particles where I can create a pair of 

656
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,474
particles that know about one another 
and now they separated in space and in 

657
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:37,430
time and if you observed that other 
particle,

658
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:40,790
it instantly changes the state of the 
particle back.

659
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,770
The other particle that's back where I 
am,

660
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,690
and by the way that they communicate 
instantaneously faster than the speed of

661
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,370
light.
When you say if you observed,

662
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,880
do you mean that if you observe it with 
anything,

663
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,370
it doesn't matter,
but you have to do something you have to

664
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,180
do?
Yes,

665
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,980
so something has to interact with.
It's not woo woo,

666
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,820
but people.
But you say that people go,

667
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,650
yeah,
I saw that in the secret.

668
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,590
Yeah,
so the problem is the word observe.

669
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,960
People thinks there's a psychological 
thing,

670
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,420
but in physics is got nothing to.
With measurement,

671
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:13,970
it's a measurement thing and so in other
words,

672
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,643
if there's a.
If there is an electron city in the 

673
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:18,710
middle of this table and all the lights 
are out,

674
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,500
I can say I think there's an electron 
here.

675
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,220
Let me find out,
and the moment I turn on the lights,

676
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,570
the light interacts.

677
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,330
Photon interacts with electron and kicks
it somewhere else.

678
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,730
So the more I try to measure its 
position,

679
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:35,590
the less I know it's position.
So because you need to,

680
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,900
the measurement requires an interaction 
with it and on.

681
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,843
In the quantum scale,
interactions changed the state of the 

682
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,870
experiment that you're conducting.
We know this,

683
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,630
we've quantified it.
We don't like it,

684
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,720
but we deal with it.
And in the act of dealing with it,

685
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:55,721
you can exploit that fact for other 
purposes we exploit quantum craziness to

686
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,920
birth the into the the information 
technology revolution.

687
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:01,754
There is no creation,
storage or retrieval of information 

688
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,490
without an exploitation of the quantum.
So,

689
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,324
and by the way,
the quantum was discovered in the 

690
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,630
quantum physics as a branch of physics 
was discovered in the 19 twenties.

691
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,980
If you weren't around back then and your
tax buddies don't like paying taxes,

692
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,000
you,
what would you have said?

693
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,440
Why are you spending government money 
on,

694
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,720
on,
on,

695
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,440
on the Adam and on molecules.
And you can't even see them.

696
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,650
What good is it all?
I kinda would work.

697
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,460
I just cared about my would adams,
right?

698
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:34,220
Here I am.
You have to shove that where your,

699
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,400
where your tax dollar is.
And so it would look like you're wasting

700
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,790
your own time and everybody else's 
money.

701
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,300
It would take decades,
five decades,

702
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,613
four or five decades before we had 
realized what role that would play in 

703
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,760
computing this creation,
storage and retrieval of information.

704
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,743
And by some measures,
it's a third of the world's GDP is 

705
00:35:56,761 --> 00:36:01,620
traceable to what quantum physics does 
for us on a computing scale.

706
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,900
So anyone.
Yes,

707
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,890
yes.
Well,

708
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,800
I mean,
there are ways to do it.

709
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,690
There are certain industries that would 
still be there without computing,

710
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,370
but they're made more efficient with it.

711
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,623
Okay.
So ups tracks all of their trucks with 

712
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,600
gps and with a computing devices that 
invokes the quantum.

713
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,260
But ups predates the use of this,
these tools.

714
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,333
But you can look at profits relative to 
their efficiencies that are enabled by 

715
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:28,224
these technologies as well as entire 
fields that didn't exist before 

716
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,720
computing.
You add all that up.

717
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,750
It's a stunning fact.
And my only point is that you,

718
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,543
if you want today to say,
why study this when we have these other 

719
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:47,700
problems while I do,
all I do is take you back to the cave.

720
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:48,391
And let's say,
all right,

721
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:51,300
we're in a cave and there's a mountain 
over there in the valley.

722
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:53,390
And I tell you,
I told her that the Cape,

723
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,580
uh,
I tell the tribe leaders,

724
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,160
I want to explore that mountain in that 
valley.

725
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,250
No,
we can't afford to send you out there.

726
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,250
Now we have to solve the problems first 
before anyone leaves the cave.

727
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,893
We laugh at that.
That's an absurd claim to make in 

728
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,200
caveman days.
I don't know if anyone did it,

729
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,034
but that's a crazy thought because their
solutions to your problems that might 

730
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:22,584
exist and time has demonstrated,
likely exist by leaving the cave that 

731
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,000
you can then discover.
So for me,

732
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,740
x voices,
not just space,

733
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,620
all the frontiers of the unknown 
biology,

734
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,970
chemistry,
Ai,

735
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,643
you know those frontiers,
and then you can cross pollinate them 

736
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:41,304
and transformed civilization.
Then the last example I give and then 

737
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,740
I'll shut up because I want to hear you 
talk to me.

738
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,493
I got.
I don't say I want to hear you interact 

739
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:52,170
with what I'm telling you.
Here's one.

740
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,180
You Ready?
Okay.

741
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,900
My physics professor in college study 
the universe,

742
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:58,734
love the universe,
study gas clouds between stars and 

743
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:02,820
studied.

744
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,460
How would you detect a gas cloud if it's
not radiating light?

745
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:06,780
Well,
they give off radio waves,

746
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,023
right?
And he figured out what kind of radio 

747
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:10,404
waves they give off and why,
and in this he gained expertise in the 

748
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:14,604
nucleus of the atom and he discovered 
that the nucleus can resonate depending 

749
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,350
on the mass of the nucleus.
It will,

750
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,363
which means,
depending on what Adam it is on the 

751
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:28,140
periodic table,
it will resonate slightly differently.

752
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,770
When exposed to the same electromagnetic
field,

753
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,203
he discovered a new phenomenon in 
physics called nuclear magnetic 

754
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,843
resonance.
It would then take a clever medical 

755
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:41,770
technologists to say,
wait a minute,

756
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,250
if you can distinguish one heavy Adam 
from another,

757
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,200
let me make a machine out of that,
put your body in it,

758
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,210
and I can then distinguish one kind of 
tissue from another.

759
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,310
And thus was born the magnetic resonance
imaging the MRI,

760
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,263
arguably the most potent tool in the 
arsenal of modern medicine where I can 

761
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:09,580
diagnose a condition in your body 
without cutting you open first.

762
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,953
That is based on a principle of physics 
discovered by a physicist who had no 

763
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:14,674
interest in medicine by the way,
that the real title should be nuclear 

764
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,940
magnetic resonance imaging.
But that's the other end word.

765
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:25,750
You're not.
Some people don't like nuclear,

766
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,793
what?
They're less likely to go inside the 

767
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,103
machine if there were nuclear was on it,
but my point is that was a cross 

768
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:36,730
pollination of ideas with clever people 
on their frontiers.

769
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,073
Looking over the fence at discoveries 
that are being made is how we got the 

770
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:42,484
microwave oven.
That was an invented by 

771
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,773
thermodynamicists microwaves.
This is a world war two attempt to 

772
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:52,960
communicate using microwaves and they 
found out some guys,

773
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:55,720
chocolate bar melted in the microwave 
field and they said what?

774
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,573
What happened there?
And they did some more tests and of 

775
00:39:58,211 --> 00:39:59,044
course the water molecule and other 
molecules common in food respond to 

776
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:03,880
microwave.

777
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,880
It vibrates them ferociously and so you 
put food in our microwave cavity.

778
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,520
The water content of the food vibrates.
Friction cooks the food.

779
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,120
There's still people today who say,
oh nucleus,

780
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:24,470
because they think it's so fast and they
might still have no fear.

781
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,750
It's just friction.
Okay,

782
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:29,584
friction it.
Everybody's scared that it fucks up the 

783
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:32,590
food.
Well,

784
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,700
does it?
No,

785
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,930
it's just,
it just heats.

786
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:35,950
The water,
gets scared.

787
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,360
The Woo people do.
Okay,

788
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:39,940
so here's the thing.
There's certain foods that don't respond

789
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:43,930
well to the flipping of the water 
molecule and one of them ways like bread

790
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,380
products gets hard.
Yeah,

791
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:48,990
it gets chewy and leathery and only if 
you overdo,

792
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,863
if you overdo,
you gotta do it just right and you're 

793
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,820
still good.
If you overdo it,

794
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,500
it can get loud.
That's kind of it.

795
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,393
I'm trying to think.
You wouldn't grill a steak in a 

796
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:56,560
microwave.

797
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,060
You would heat up the meat uniformly and
that's.

798
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,290
That's all it would do.
A cooks bacon pretty fast,

799
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,690
but it's a mess and it splatters all 
over.

800
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:07,600
So you pick the foods that are best for 
that situation.

801
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,000
As you would pick the foods best you 
wouldn't.

802
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,210
You wouldn't put toast in an oven at 350
degrees to bread to make toast.

803
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,260
We have toasters for that.
Right?

804
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,930
So different things in your kitchen.
Do things best.

805
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,420
You wouldn't make ice cream in your,
you know,

806
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,240
in your,
in your toaster oven,

807
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,810
but people are afraid of microwaves.
The one thing that they're afraid of,

808
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,673
it's not.
It's not that they're afraid of 

809
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:31,990
microwaves,
that they're afraid of things.

810
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,030
They don't understand that your precise 
now

811
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,620
this,
they're afraid that something's going to

812
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:38,240
happen to their food that makes it less 
good.

813
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,070
Correct.
And it's just,

814
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,993
it's,
it's not the not knowing that people 

815
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:43,844
fear.
My wife's friend's mom will not eat 

816
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,220
something that comes out of a microwave.
Really.

817
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,250
She quotes that as part of what makes 
her healthy.

818
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,310
Drinks a lot of water.
She refuses to eat microwave food.

819
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,910
The whole life is around not using 
microwave.

820
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,400
She won't eat anything that comes out of
a microwave.

821
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,400
I'm glad that she doesn't.
She'll.

822
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,540
She can live a long,
happy life as such.

823
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,950
She,
her reheat food.

824
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:08,180
Old School.
Okay.

825
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:10,130
One of the hardest thing is reheating 
was on you.

826
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,840
If you don't have a microwave.
A true.

827
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,490
That's like impossible.
You're gonna Cook it again.

828
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,960
Got To cook it again.
Yeah,

829
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,870
that's a really good point.
So I think microwave ovens were invented

830
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:18,704
for leftover lasagna and yeah,
just eat a bowl of pasta just in 

831
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:22,700
general.

832
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,280
Yeah,
soup soup is good.

833
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,530
Yeah.
So you don't have to worry about it.

834
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:29,060
It's not doing anything to it.
It's not.

835
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,630
Not Sucking any nutrients out or adding 
any nuclear radiation.

836
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,060
Correct.
It has nothing to.

837
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:38,990
With radiation in the normal sense,
other than electromagnetic radiation.

838
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,853
It's already light from the bald.
We tend to use radiation in the context 

839
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:47,150
of stuff that would hurt you.
So that would be radiation.

840
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:50,870
Have high enough energy to hurt you and 
microwaves are not in that category.

841
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,500
I never even thought about what 
microwaves do until this conversation.

842
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,490
Really?
Yeah.

843
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,433
Yeah.
So it's a certain frequency of 

844
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:57,914
microwaves that beautifully pairs with 
the water molecule and it vibrates it 

845
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,633
brilliantly,
so it doesn't work for completely dried 

846
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,101
things.
Yeah.

847
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:09,380
That's why if you put something that has
no water in it,

848
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:11,960
it's not really very useful to have beef
jerky.

849
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,050
It's there's still some moisture in it.
Correct.

850
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,890
It's why it eats the food and not the 
plate.

851
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,933
The plate gets hot.
It's not because the microwave oven 

852
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,750
heated the plate is because the food's 
hot food and the food.

853
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,390
That's why I can usually pick it up at 
the hand.

854
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,570
You can put food on a paper plate.
That's right.

855
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,640
It doesn't burst into flames and burst 
into flames.

856
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,180
This is crazy.
Joe,

857
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,490
what is the difference between MRI and 
Fmr?

858
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,310
Oh,
so an FMLA claim.

859
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:44,144
Total expertise here,
but I'll tell you the little I know the 

860
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:46,934
MRI,
they put you in there and you're 

861
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,524
stationary and then they make this map 
of whatever part of the body they're 

862
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,420
studying is typically your head.
All right?

863
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,543
Uh,
but you can do it on your joints and 

864
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:56,114
other parts of your body that might 
require this level of three dimensional 

865
00:43:58,641 --> 00:43:59,474
analysis and it's a three d map of 
what's going on in the park that they 

866
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:05,264
surveyed.

867
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,450
And so you look at it slices through 
that section.

868
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,640
So you might see in Mris of your brain,
of your skull and they take slices.

869
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,643
You as they slices go through,
you see like the eye socket come in and 

870
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:19,940
then go out again or the the nose 
cavity.

871
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,180
And you can look at it in all three 
dimensions,

872
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:27,290
front to back side to side a up to them.
So.

873
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,960
So depending on the sophistication of 
the machine,

874
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,890
F MRI is they are looking at your brain 
while you were thinking.

875
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,500
So time is now an active coordinate of 
what's going on and they're measuring it

876
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,690
as they're talking to you about.
So they say,

877
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,553
Oh,
think of the ice cream Sundae with a 

878
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:46,104
cherry on top,
but think of a naked person who you'd 

879
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:52,140
want to have sex with.
Stands for function,

880
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:53,100
functional,
right.

881
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:53,934
And so it's basically a real time 
observation of what's going on in your 

882
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:58,550
head.

883
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,383
Evict a person.
There was a woman in India and it's 

884
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:05,610
really highly criticized case,
but she was convicted of a crime,

885
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,473
I believe it was murder because she had 
functional knowledge of the crime scene 

886
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,953
and the arguments against it where like 
if you're going to be accused of a 

887
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:16,314
crime,
clearly you're going to study the 

888
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,680
evidence,
you're gonna talk to a lawyer,

889
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:21,270
you're going to go over some things.
You're going to be,

890
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,820
I don't know if MRI is that precise.
Yeah.

891
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:28,740
They don't think it is very disturbing 
that this was used in court.

892
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,900
It's like,
do you remember when these Italian,

893
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,930
um,
geologists were.

894
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,213
I think they were tried because they 
should have known about an earthquake 

895
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,910
before it happened.
And then scientists had to say,

896
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,280
hey guys,
this is not how it works.

897
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,910
Like this shit can just happen.
That's so.

898
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,291
No,
I don't.

899
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,580
But that's what I do know.
Let me share a couple of things with you

900
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:54,414
that I've thought deeply about recently.
There are three kinds of truths in the 

901
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:02,130
world because we're in like a three.
Let me.

902
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,750
I'll give you three.
Okay.

903
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,110
The Rudy Giuliani kind.

904
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,160
Okay.
So you ready?

905
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,680
True isn't always true.
I know.

906
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,830
So let me try to unpack that.
Okay.

907
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,500
Alright,
you ready?

908
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,820
Okay.
Alternative facts.

909
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,760
I do something called an objective truth
and objective.

910
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,640
Truth is something that is true whether 
or not you believe in it.

911
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,253
And the methods and tools of science are
uniquely conceived to seek out and 

912
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:28,344
establish objective truths.
And this I'm in referring to the 

913
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:36,561
invocation of the scientific method.
No one scientific result result research

914
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,003
result is true until it is verified by 
other people's research results using a 

915
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:44,904
different experimental method with 
different wall current from another 

916
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,890
country.
When your competitor says,

917
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,900
I think you're wrong,
let me show how you're wrong.

918
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,853
And they reproduce your experiment and 
get the same result when you have 

919
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:56,904
generally the same results emerging that
is a newly discovered objective truth 

920
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:04,300
about the natural world.
And when you have objective truths,

921
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:09,301
they're not later shown to be false.
That's an objective truth.

922
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,970
Then you have personal truths.
These are truths that you hold dearly.

923
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,740
Jesus is your savior.
Mohammed is the final prophet on earth.

924
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,090
You know Abraham is your.
These are your personal truths.

925
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,650
There's a heaven.
You're going to.

926
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,023
No one is going to take that from you.
Not In a free country where freedom of 

927
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:30,400
expression

928
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,690
and speech and religion is protected.
That's a personal truth.

929
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,763
The problem here is you can't convince 
someone else of your personal truth 

930
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,000
without some act of persuasion and in 
the limit and active violence.

931
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,620
MMM,
okay.

932
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,540
In the limit and the limit.
This,

933
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:50,374
I get holy wars.
So I have this personal truth and I 

934
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,950
require that you share my personal truth
provides.

935
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,590
That's a recipe for disaster and not 
unbelief.

936
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,070
Because the people who hold the belief 
will tell you that it's the truth.

937
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,740
So I don't want to take that usage of 
the word away from them.

938
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,290
Okay,
so you're giving them a good definition.

939
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:12,880
I'm giving them the word truth,
but modifying it to say personal truth.

940
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,730
That's correct.
I'm not going to.

941
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,420
If they've used it that way for 
Millennia,

942
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,780
I'm not going to.
Okay.

943
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,240
They they feel that is true and it's 
true in their bones.

944
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:26,380
I'm simply saying that because it's your
personal truth,

945
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:31,450
you cannot require that someone else 
share it and in this country,

946
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,493
because the United States,
because God is not mentioned in the 

947
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,800
constitution itself,
a controversial thing in it's day by the

948
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:43,330
way actually God has mentioned,
but in a very insignificant way that the

949
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:47,860
constitution is a Godfrey document and 
because it's a Godfrey document,

950
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,070
it protects your expression of religious
face because it means the government has

951
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,480
no say in who and what you believe or 
why.

952
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,920
If the constitution said,
mentioned God and Jesus,

953
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:03,671
well,
there it is.

954
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:07,150
There's Christianity built into the 
fabric of the country and if you want to

955
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:09,700
be some other religion,
you're gonna have a hard time because we

956
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:10,534
can set laws against it.
This is why so many religiously 

957
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:14,674
persecuted people came to the United 
States to escape their country where 

958
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,414
they could not practice their religion a
little differently or a lot differently 

959
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:25,000
from what was going on in their homes,
in their homeland.

960
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,373
So the.
Is it a problem though to to call it 

961
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,210
truth,
I would rather not call a truth,

962
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,290
but I.
I'm,

963
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,610
I'm a big word guy and I respect what 
happens to words.

964
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't always like it,
but I respect it and so I'm going to say

965
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,760
there is an objective truth,
which is true whether or not you believe

966
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:44,200
it.
There's your personal truth,

967
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,980
which is true to you.
Third Truth is a political truth.

968
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,623
Political truth is something that is 
true because it has been incessantly 

969
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:53,764
repeated it,
and then you just believe it at that 

970
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:01,080
point on one of those.
Okay.

971
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,970
What's Hillary Clinton's first name?
It's crooked,

972
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
or first name is actually hillary.
Okay.

973
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,103
I thought it was crooked Hillary.
This is was incessantly repeated in the 

974
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:16,930
trump campaign and that.
That's an absurd example of it,

975
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,530
but,
but,

976
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,363
but the point is if you keep saying,
if you keep saying that the New York 

977
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,373
Times is fake news,
it just keeps saying that eventually 

978
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:26,704
people believe it and it becomes a 
political truth because the politicians 

979
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:33,014
repeated it,
so it's a political truth that people 

980
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,970
believe it or it's a political truth 
because people believe it.

981
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,620
Which one is it?
So again,

982
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:40,460
you're,
you're,

983
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,673
you're trying to,
you trying to preserve the true 

984
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,540
fundamental meaning of the word truth 
and I've just given up on that.

985
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,690
Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris had 
infuriatingly frustrating podcasts where

986
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:56,450
they went over the meaning of the word 
truth for more than an hour.

987
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,040
And I,
like I said,

988
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:58,874
you can do that.
And philosophers like arguing and 

989
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:02,870
debating the meaning of things.
For me it's harder.

990
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,880
People are using the word.
That's the meaning.

991
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,460
I'm,
I,

992
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,210
I concede that.
Well,

993
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,240
we can see those things.
Why I don't call myself an atheist.

994
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:14,843
It's why you can look up the dictionary 
definition of atheist and it kind of 

995
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:22,580
applies to me,
but what is the definition of atheist in

996
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:23,414
practice?
It is what leading atheists do and it's 

997
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,250
their conduct and their behaviors,
what they say,

998
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,390
and it's,
it's,

999
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,253
it's their attitude that is what an 
atheist is today because they're the 

1000
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:38,861
most visible exemplars of that word and 
most of their conduct either don't agree

1001
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:42,290
with or simply don't engage in.

1002
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,430
What don't you agree with?
I don't debate religious people and tell

1003
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:48,590
them they're idiots.
I don't know.

1004
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:51,510
That doesn't work.
It's whether or not it works.

1005
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:53,660
I just not.
It's not in me to do that.

1006
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:59,050
I don't purge myself of words that have 
religious foundations in them.

1007
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,093
I once in my facebook,
I had a friend going up in orbit to 

1008
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:06,980
repair the Hubble Telescope,
one of the astronauts and I said,

1009
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,880
uh,
Godspeed.

1010
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,080
And then I gave the astronauts name 
people wrote in,

1011
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:14,090
in the threads that I thought you were 
an atheist.

1012
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:17,480
How could you say Godspeed and atheist 
got angry with me and I said,

1013
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,250
okay.
First of all,

1014
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,660
this phrase is deeply historical in the 
space program.

1015
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,020
When John Glenn was launched,
the headline was Godspeed John Glenn.

1016
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,050
Every mission where we send human beings
into space somewhere,

1017
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,410
there's that reference in the NASA fancy
word means I'll tell you,

1018
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,200
I'll tell you what it means.

1019
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,040
Please do.
Okay,

1020
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:39,801
so.
Oh,

1021
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:42,590
by the way,
I'll get to that in just one minute.

1022
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,960
The atheist who are arguing that I was 
using Godspeed as a phrase,

1023
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,820
they all have used the phrase goodbye.
Haven't they see you later?

1024
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,740
Goodbye.
What does that word come from?

1025
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,810
It's from God.
Be With you.

1026
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,090
It's a contraction of those three words.
Oh,

1027
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,093
and why would you say this?
You would say this to someone leaving 

1028
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:07,490
the city wall where it's dangerous.
Okay.

1029
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,630
Back when you had city states,
you're going to you.

1030
00:53:09,631 --> 00:53:14,540
You're a good God,
be with you to bring protection for you.

1031
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,490
Between one city,
one in crowds.

1032
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,740
Look out for you.
So now what is the source of danger?

1033
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:25,250
If you're going to space,
it's not alien space muggers.

1034
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,543
It is the fact that you space marauders.
It's the fact that you have high speed 

1035
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,720
and high speed is the source of 
essentially any death of anything that's

1036
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:37,554
in motion.

1037
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,520
If you were a part of that,
I'm a disaster.

1038
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,760
So Godspeed is like a space equivalent 
to God be with you.

1039
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,220
Is that really the origin?
I'm just saying.

1040
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,520
What did they say that before there were
space travel.

1041
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,350
Did they say Godspeed?
I don't know the actual origin of space.

1042
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:57,430
Travel of the term.
Uh,

1043
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,273
I don't know how far back it goes,
but I do know it became common after 

1044
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:04,140
John Glenn because they're not going to 
say it to Yuri Gagarin because they were

1045
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,780
there all atheists in,
in the Soviet Union,

1046
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,650
but here in America,
in America,

1047
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,280
Godspeed John Glenn and I respect that 
tradition.

1048
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,713
And so I said that and then they jumped.
So if atheist or jumping on me for 

1049
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:19,584
having said that,
clearly I'm not an atheist and asked me 

1050
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,630
my favorite Broadway musical of all 
time.

1051
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,640
What's your favorite?
Jesus Christ superstar.

1052
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,460
So,
and I,

1053
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,080
and I still use BC and add in my 
writings.

1054
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,490
Okay.
I still don't use bce.

1055
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,470
I don't use VC.
Alright.

1056
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,880
Oh see even you copying the Tude right 
there,

1057
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,760
right?
I saw your faith.

1058
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:47,970
You got the camera.
Do you see as interesting.

1059
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:49,530
It's interesting,
I'll tell you why.

1060
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,760
Okay.
First of all,

1061
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,310
it doesn't make any sense.
The current era,

1062
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:54,990
2000 years ago,
I'm good at telling you.

1063
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,280
So Bca,
as you know,

1064
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,730
stands for before common era and ce 
stands for common era.

1065
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:05,090
So this is d irreligious of filing a,
D and B NBC.

1066
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:06,933
Yet,
and of course they referenced the same 

1067
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,390
calendar.
Okay,

1068
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,350
well who invented the calendar?
We all currently use in modern society.

1069
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,333
It's called the Gregorian calendar.
It was invented by the Catholic church 

1070
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,633
by Jesuit priests in the 15 eighties,
assigned by Pope Gregory to fix the 

1071
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:24,290
problems in the calendar because I'm 
sorry,

1072
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,220
I'm screaming at you here.
You can scream.

1073
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:26,821
Okay,
crazy.

1074
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,260
I got to calm down.
I'll bring him coffee.

1075
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,363
The Julian calendar put forth in ancient
Rome had one modification to previous 

1076
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:39,990
calendar.
It had a leap day.

1077
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Okay.
It had to leap day and okay.

1078
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,120
Leap Day is how often?
Every four years.

1079
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,540
This was good because what are we trying
to track?

1080
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,260
We're trying to.
Earth goes around the sun and so we say,

1081
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:57,150
all right,
how long does that take?

1082
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:58,320
Well,
it takes a year,

1083
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,723
but it turns out we're not actually 
tracking how long it takes earth to go 

1084
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:06,471
around the sun would tracking how long 
it takes earth to repeat its seasons and

1085
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:07,884
the repeat the year that corresponds to 
our seasons is slightly different from 

1086
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,540
the year that corresponds to how long it
takes to go around the sun,

1087
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,303
slightly different,
and that difference was not recognized 

1088
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,773
in the early calendars and that 
difference accumulated so that by the 

1089
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,390
year 15,
84,

1090
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,840
the vernal equinox,
the first day of spring,

1091
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:33,430
did not occur on March 20.

1092
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:38,430
First it occurred on March 10th.
It shifted from the calendar date.

1093
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,770
That's what happens if you don't match 
the cycles of things.

1094
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,080
And the pope said,
we're not having any of this,

1095
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:48,040
especially since Easter might land on 
Passover and we're trying to distinguish

1096
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:51,100
ourselves mightily from the Jews.
So let's fix this.

1097
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,233
The Jesuit priests got to study this.
They looked at the cycles of the 

1098
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,720
heavens,
the sun,

1099
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:56,830
the moon,
the stars,

1100
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:00,250
and they came up with a new calendar,
the Gregorian calendar,

1101
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,410
a modification to the Julian calendar.
You know,

1102
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:06,620
what they have to do to invoke at that,
to take 10 days out of the calendar to,

1103
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,650
to jumpstart,
to put,

1104
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,773
uh,
the first day of Spring Back on March 

1105
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:13,480
21st.
And this happened in October 15,

1106
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:14,314
84.
Why has there been 10 days out of the 

1107
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,790
calendar that.
So now how much rent do you pay?

1108
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,190
They had to like,
invent amortized rent.

1109
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,453
Yeah,
because you're going to pay for three 

1110
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:24,844
weeks and you know,
20 days instead of 30 that they have to 

1111
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:28,390
figure that out.
Okay.

1112
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,560
Point is this was hard earned and the 
whole world uses this calendar.

1113
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:34,930
It is the most accurate calendar ever 
devised.

1114
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,270
Yes.
I'll tell you what.

1115
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,410
Okay.
You asked.

1116
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,920
So watch what happens.
The leap day overcorrected the calendar.

1117
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,250
It overcorrected overcorrect yes.
Yes.

1118
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:50,340
So you need to leave here.
So No.

1119
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,850
So the leaf days,
every four years,

1120
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:52,923
that one day,
every four years was slowly putting too 

1121
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:57,850
many days into the moments into the 
year.

1122
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,073
Okay.
The Gregorian calendar figured this out 

1123
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,653
and he didn't put 10 extra days since 
the Julian calendar to the Gregorian 

1124
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,370
count.
Ten extra days.

1125
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,650
First Jumpstart,
get rid of the 10 days,

1126
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,630
now everything's lined up again.
Okay.

1127
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,820
Now how do you prevent this from 
happening again?

1128
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,973
Because it overcorrect how long do you 
have to wait to remove a leap day that 

1129
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:23,250
you would otherwise put in?
Okay,

1130
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,660
okay.
That's every hundred years.

1131
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,450
Oh,
so every hundred years.

1132
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,590
That would be a leap day.
You remove the leap day.

1133
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,190
Now it turns out that under corrects it 
by an even smaller amount.

1134
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,353
Okay.
So how long do you have to wait before 

1135
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:48,430
you have to put a leap day back in every
400 years.

1136
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:53,850
Oh God.
So the year 2000 was a century year,

1137
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,120
which normally would not have a leap 
day,

1138
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:02,170
except it's a century year.
Evenly divisible by 400.

1139
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,970
So they put the leap day back in and 
everybody on February,

1140
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:07,803
almost everybody,
everybody except the astronomers on 

1141
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:10,384
February 29th in the year 2000 set.
It's just a leap year because it's 

1142
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:15,340
divisible by four.
No,

1143
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:16,973
it is a rarely.
Pierre is a century year divisible by 

1144
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:21,334
four.

1145
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,003
That corrects it back and so now you 
have a stable calendar for tens of 

1146
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,533
thousands of years.
I got to give props to the Jesuit 

1147
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:34,070
priest.
I'm not going to say no.

1148
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:34,904
I'm taking the Christianity out of this 
reference because they figured out the 

1149
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:40,010
calendar that we all use and it's a 
fucking awesome count.

1150
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,853
Sorry to drop an F bomb.
But I had so I'm not just because some 

1151
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,450
atheist are telling me that God had 
everything in the universe that to.

1152
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,220
I'm not.
I'm not doing that.

1153
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,323
I'm going to say they came up with this 
calendar for the reasons were because 

1154
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:55,790
they didn't want to confuse it.
With Passover.

1155
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,773
The motivation is whatever it is,
but the science is is good and so there 

1156
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:01,760
it is.
So intercessory to war,

1157
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,700
where we go back many centuries,
the editor said,

1158
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:05,534
well,
we should use bcg because there's a 

1159
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,123
liberal forward.

1160
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,180
I'd say I am not using BC and see get.
And by the way there was no year zero.

1161
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,283
You know why there's no year zero?
Because the Romans came up with the 

1162
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:19,310
calendar and they counted using Roman 
numerals.

1163
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,240
Roman numerals don't have a zero.
It was not yet invented.

1164
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:26,550
They didn't have a zero.
No.

1165
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,643
So it went from one BC to add one BC 
before Christ and his anno Domini in 

1166
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,120
Latin,
the year of our Lord.

1167
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,360
Wow.
Now,

1168
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,740
of course in,
in Islam and in China,

1169
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:43,430
and in a and Hebrew cultures,
uh,

1170
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,283
Israel in particular,
they have access to the Chinese 

1171
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:48,320
calendar.
The Muslim calendar,

1172
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,560
Muslim of course,
dates to Mohammed Chinese calendar dates

1173
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:56,561
to actually a planetary alignment in 
4,700

1174
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:58,020
BC.
They don't,

1175
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,560
they use a different system where they 
use a different system.

1176
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:03,740
That's fine.
And the Hebrew calendar dates too,

1177
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,510
like the beginning of the universe as 
interpreted in the,

1178
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,453
in the Torah.

1179
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,553
So they have access to those.
But when the conducting international 

1180
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:12,794
business,
we just simply use the Gregorian 

1181
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,680
calendar,
just get over it,

1182
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,963
but use it in China.
Do they use it constantly and 

1183
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:19,814
consistently or do they alternate 
between the Gregorian calendar and 

1184
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:22,900
something else?
I don't.

1185
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,733
I'm not a Chinese expert,
but from what I know of China and my 

1186
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:28,220
friends and colleagues that for 
conducting business,

1187
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,323
the world's business is conducted in on 
the Gregorian calendar with a 12 month 

1188
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:36,770
calendar with the,
with the year as referenced by everybody

1189
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:39,830
else and does it have to be done that 
way in terms of like is there.

1190
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:44,060
Has anyone ever done a study on possibly
creating a more effective,

1191
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,073
more accurate calendar?
It doesn't invoke leap years and the 

1192
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,124
problem is the length of the day does 
not cut evenly to the time it takes 

1193
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,904
earth to go around the sun,
so they'll always be fractions of days 

1194
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,460
that you're accumulating and now what do
you do with them?

1195
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:04,070
You wait until your accumulated day and 
you put it in or take it out.

1196
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,150
What did the mind.
This is not this lunar cycle calendar,

1197
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,120
but it was an accountant who is based on
Venus and so yeah,

1198
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:11,954
that a really good calendar.
It was overstated that it was like 

1199
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,480
really accurate calendar.
Overstate,

1200
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,720
overstate.
It was good.

1201
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,440
Better than anything that came before 
it.

1202
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:20,150
Not as good as the.

1203
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,701
No,
no,

1204
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:21,210
no.
It's good.

1205
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,340
Green County people love old shit 
though.

1206
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,100
They do and they want to believe that,
especially people who,

1207
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:29,430
you know,
want to believe the people 5,000

1208
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:33,270
years ago somehow knew more about the 
university that we do to just know why.

1209
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,670
Is that why they wanted to believe that?
I think,

1210
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,850
I don't know.
For me,

1211
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,040
that's one of the great puzzles of,
of life.

1212
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,263
Why do people want to believe that the 
Egyptian somehow had some access to the 

1213
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:47,521
universe?
Well,

1214
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:48,930
they knew some money.
They cool.

1215
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,130
They definitely knew how to some 
incredible shit horse,

1216
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,010
but that,
that I don't want to take that away from

1217
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:57,570
him.
Doesn't the physical,

1218
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,673
just the presence of these incredible 
buildings leave the possibility that 

1219
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:05,100
maybe they had some knowledge that we 
lost.

1220
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,190
Lost knowledge is a real thing.
I don't want to belittle or diminish the

1221
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,330
significance of real knowledge.

1222
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,640
We forgot how to draw in perspective.
You know,

1223
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:17,220
from ancient times had to be 
rediscovered in the,

1224
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,330
as I understand from the artists had to 
be rediscovered in the renaissance.

1225
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,490
Uh,
the archway,

1226
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,730
the Roman arch had to sort of be 
rediscovered.

1227
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,410
Okay.
So,

1228
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,570
yes.
Yes,

1229
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,630
you can lose knowledge,
but if you look at the knowledge we have

1230
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,350
gleaned using the methods and modern 
methods and tools of science that go far

1231
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:38,184
beyond our five senses in our access to 
the world to say that somehow they knew 

1232
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:46,800
something that we don't using our tools.
That's just false.

1233
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,740
Sorry.
That's just.

1234
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,833
It's just not possible,
but we know the physiological limits of 

1235
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,350
your ability to know what's going on 
around you and then people say,

1236
01:03:57,351 --> 01:03:59,760
Oh,
I have a sixth sense fine,

1237
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,730
but as a scientist I have dozens of 
senses.

1238
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,013
Okay.
I can measure things that your five 

1239
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:05,820
senses can't.

1240
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,860
I can measure the magnetic field around 
you,

1241
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:10,650
the electromagnetic field,
how much microwaves are coursing through

1242
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:12,930
your body.
Now we have no sensors for this.

1243
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,240
I can see auras.
Fine.

1244
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,240
I can see other things that are 
affecting your body.

1245
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:21,720
Now I can tell you if ionizing radiation
is passing through you,

1246
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:23,760
I've geiger counters that can do that.
You can't.

1247
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:24,683
Oh,
you'll find that you will eventually 

1248
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:29,870
learn whether you were exposed to 
ionizing radiation because you're.

1249
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,640
You'll get cancer of your organs and 
your limbs fall off.

1250
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,563
All right.
I can see that we know far more today 

1251
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:36,950
perhaps at any.
No,

1252
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,650
not even perhaps than at any other time 
in conceivable history.

1253
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:41,484
Yes,
but it is possible that they knew some 

1254
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:46,710
things like how to build a pyramid.
Yes.

1255
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,050
That we really just don't understand 
today.

1256
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,730
I don't know what it means to not 
understand how to build a pyramid.

1257
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:54,770
Today we,
we have,

1258
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,560
we have 150 story building,
so we are thinking about pyramid stuff.

1259
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,960
I can tell you this.
Do you know whether it's the first thing

1260
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:04,200
that was built by humans ever?
No.

1261
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,330
No.
The only part of the sentence.

1262
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,143
I love your enthusiasm.
My sentence only barely came out of my 

1263
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:16,701
mouth.
The tallest thing humans built after the

1264
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:20,170
pyramids.
I think it's a building in Dubai.

1265
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,570
No.
So in other words,

1266
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,540
tell this thing after the pyramids.
Oh,

1267
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,800
right.
After w.

1268
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,280
What is the next hottest thing we built?
Stable structure after the pyramids.

1269
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,830
What?
The Eiffel Tower?

1270
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,740
Yes.
18.

1271
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,790
Whatever.
The 89.

1272
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,331
18,
Saturday,

1273
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:40,150
late 18 hundreds in Paris.
The Eiffel Tower.

1274
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,463
Huh?
That was the first stable structure we 

1275
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:47,410
built as a civilization that was taller 
than the pyramids,

1276
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,800
so the Egyptians knew how to.

1277
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:51,743
They knew architecture.
They knew no one's taken that away from 

1278
01:05:55,241 --> 01:05:56,074
them,
but to claim they have some secret 

1279
01:05:57,731 --> 01:05:59,470
knowledge of the functionings of the 
universe.

1280
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,910
No,
no.

1281
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,160
Well people love saying that kind of 
stuff.

1282
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,510
Yeah,
it makes for great tv,

1283
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,373
but the fact that they didn't have steel
and the fact that we're dealing with at 

1284
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,860
the very,
very most recent 2,500

1285
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:16,630
BC and they built.
You just have to be more ingenious,

1286
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,420
more innovative than we otherwise would 
have to be.

1287
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,490
Yeah,
and how do you move the blocks?

1288
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:25,000
How they make stone Henge?
Those rocks are nowhere in the region.

1289
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,523
They were carted from sub with.
They found a place where those rocks 

1290
01:06:28,601 --> 01:06:32,920
were a would have been mined,
removed,

1291
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,800
and yeah,
those are some big ass rocks.

1292
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,053
Yeah.
As are the ones that's not less 

1293
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:42,030
impressive because they're just big.
Like what the.

1294
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:42,864
The thing about the pyramids,
it's so impressive as the precision and 

1295
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:46,480
the sheer numbers.

1296
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,540
2 million I best 600,000
stones.

1297
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:54,370
Our best understanding of Stonehenge is 
that it's a functioning observatory that

1298
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:58,390
can actually predict eclipses.
So do I go,

1299
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,880
I just got to bitch slap.
They're not impressive,

1300
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,970
impressive lined with the summer 
solstice,

1301
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,930
but they have their holes that are not 
stones,

1302
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:15,790
but they're 56 holes,
which is three times the Cerros,

1303
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,633
which is the cycle of eclipses of the 
matching of the orbits of the Sun and 

1304
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:22,670
the moon in the sky.
The pants or the sun and the moon in the

1305
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,010
sky and when they match up,
you get into clips.

1306
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,190
Is there is an eclipse observatory guy 
named.

1307
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,093
That's absolutely what it is.
There's a book published and in the 19 

1308
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:36,311
seventies by guy named David Dawkins,
Richard Dawkins was another one of these

1309
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,700
hawkings written Richard Hawkins,
Richard Hawkins,

1310
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,980
hawking,
hawking hockings.

1311
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,200
Damn what I'm doing.
Damn well.

1312
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:51,350
We've got our top crack researchers here
just to look up.

1313
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,240
The title of his book was Stonehenge 
decoded.

1314
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,010
Just look up the title of that book.
Anyhow,

1315
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,063
uh,
it's highly convincing and we all were 

1316
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:58,710
all there with it.
There's no,

1317
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,553
it's essentially just a study of the 
position of the stones in relationship 

1318
01:08:02,751 --> 01:08:05,180
to the where the.
Okay.

1319
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:06,260
Gerald,
Gerald Hawkins.

1320
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:07,070
Thank you.
Here we go.

1321
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,270
Yeah.
Stonehenge decoded.

1322
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,673
So he,
I visited Stonehenge as a kid at age 15 

1323
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:15,860
on an expedition and he was expedition 
head.

1324
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,590
Oh Wow.
So how lucky for you.

1325
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,473
Yeah,
it was,

1326
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:22,010
it was good.
And that stuck with me,

1327
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,873
which is why I named this phenomenon in 
Manhattan where the sun sets along the 

1328
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,940
stress on your instagram.
Yeah.

1329
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:29,780
Yeah.
So,

1330
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:30,643
so I named that Manhattan Henge sort of 
hearkening back to my early days 

1331
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,433
thinking about the alignment of the sun 
and structures that we might build 

1332
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,653
because so twice a year for those 
viewers or listeners who don't know 

1333
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:43,993
twice a year to Manhattan street grid,
which is not perfectly aligned north 

1334
01:08:47,631 --> 01:08:49,580
south,
that Manhattan Street Grid,

1335
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:50,763
uh,
will the sun will set exactly on the 

1336
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:55,490
grid and in grid and what's up there.

1337
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,990
Now,
that image,

1338
01:08:56,991 --> 01:08:57,824
what's not obvious is that picture is 
taken along a street that is itself 

1339
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:07,190
three miles long.
And then you're crossing a,

1340
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,163
uh,
the Hudson River and then there's New 

1341
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,440
Jersey on the other side,
so people try to zoom in on it.

1342
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,274
But really what you really should do is 
zoom out from it and then you get the 

1343
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,240
vanishing point on itself.
All those are zoomed,

1344
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,190
zoomed in.
Um,

1345
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,570
let's go to.
Yeah,

1346
01:09:23,571 --> 01:09:25,520
that one looks more like,
like my photo.

1347
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:27,980
I go back to that other one.
Yeah.

1348
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:28,800
See,
so,

1349
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,220
so that's on 34th street,
the one you see now.

1350
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,160
And then you get this sparkling effect 
that happens twice a year.

1351
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,760
That sort of crazy wild light effect.
Yes.

1352
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:40,250
It looks photoshop dolls.
Yeah.

1353
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,323
Good.
There's an image on his instagram that 

1354
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,820
is linked on my instagram,
the most recent photo.

1355
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:47,920
Okay.
There we go.

1356
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,690
Oh,
there's you with the sound selfish.

1357
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,670
So come on down the Afro though.
Yeah,

1358
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,440
that's wrong.
That was my first cell phone.

1359
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,490
I was a 14 for.
Let me see.

1360
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,540
It was 19,
probably 1974.

1361
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,990
Wow.
So I would have been 15.

1362
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:07,640
I think I've been 14 or 15 year.
Path of curiosity was set back.

1363
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,470
It goes back very early,
right?

1364
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,150
Uh,
but that's not the one we're looking for

1365
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:12,530
here.
Let's go on that one.

1366
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:17,531
Thinking it is.
So that is another one where the guys go

1367
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,380
back to all of them into rivers.
Wild.

1368
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,200
Zoom back out to you see all the 
pictures.

1369
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:23,600
They're like,
go to the bottom left.

1370
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,500
There you go.
Okay.

1371
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:29,860
That might be the first ever Manhattan 
Henge photo out from A.

1372
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,603
I took that too.
And it got published in 2002 before 

1373
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:36,710
September 11th.
This is July.

1374
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:38,420
I took it before September 11th,
right,

1375
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:42,500
right.
And then I had a means to publish it and

1376
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:43,423
right then the notice that it's a green 
light and traffic is ready to knock me 

1377
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:50,780
over.
So no one is in the streets doing this,

1378
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:51,614
but now are tens of thousands of people 
that pour into the streets on these 

1379
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,243
days.
We post what day you're getting 

1380
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,760
Manhattan hinge from the American Museum
of natural history.

1381
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:00,710
My Day job.
And then that goes out.

1382
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:01,544
The press gets it and tens of thousands 
of people spilling into the street 

1383
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:07,670
blocking traffic.
And if you think of all the ways traffic

1384
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:09,660
gets blocked in your day.
Yeah,

1385
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,980
is all it was too many of

1386
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,910
them.
You by yourself.

1387
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:16,050
It's interesting.
It's great.

1388
01:11:16,051 --> 01:11:17,340
Yeah.
So that's what it has become.

1389
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,570
Holding up phones and it's all because I
went to stonehenge.

1390
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,900
Yeah.
So it's a,

1391
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,790
it's also a,
an observatory.

1392
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:28,200
Was it you that name?
This damn check you out coins.

1393
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,073
Coins.
I say coin minted Manhattan hinge 

1394
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,753
because the buildings are like hinges.
The hinges of stone as a vertical stone 

1395
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,290
is a vertical structure.
And if you made a stone,

1396
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:38,124
it's a stone henge why isn't it possible
to construct a calendar that doesn't 

1397
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:45,330
have leap years?
What you would have to do,

1398
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,223
you could do it,
but what would happen is it means you 

1399
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:50,850
care more about the year than you do 
about the day.

1400
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,613
So what would happen is you would 
celebrate the new year at like three in 

1401
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:58,440
the afternoon.
Uh,

1402
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,723
right.
And then the next year you'd celebrate 

1403
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:05,631
it at like 12 minutes after three in the
afternoon and then 20 minutes you would,

1404
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:07,523
you would,
it would sort of move through your 

1405
01:12:09,571 --> 01:12:14,571
calendar and then that means you cared 
more about the year that you care more.

1406
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,910
About the two,
I say that right.

1407
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,043
You,
we always want to celebrate new year's 

1408
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:22,980
on midnight.
And by the way,

1409
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,800
New Year's is celebrated in 24 time 
zones.

1410
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:27,900
Not all at the same time.
So it's interesting.

1411
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:32,930
Everyone thinks of that as a moment yet.
It's really a calendar event.

1412
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:36,660
It's a talk event.
It's celebrated over 24 hours.

1413
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,680
Yeah.
If you're in Thailand,

1414
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:39,630
it's 14 hours difference.
So therefore,

1415
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,790
if you were to do an astrophysical 
physically,

1416
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:42,923
you would know the exact moment where we
returned in our orbit and everybody 

1417
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:49,890
would celebrate that instant in.
That would be.

1418
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,860
So then the whole world was celebrate 
the new year at the same time.

1419
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,760
That means you value it differently.
It's not a midnight celebration.

1420
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,740
It's a,
you could do that.

1421
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,630
I can.
Less so celestial.

1422
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:02,070
Yeah.
Huh.

1423
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,530
So that would be the only way.
Yeah,

1424
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,393
that's the only way [inaudible] a day 
doesn't cut evenly into the year that 

1425
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,200
those two have nothing to do with one 
another.

1426
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,600
There's no reason why that would have.
So we,

1427
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,830
we,
we,

1428
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:15,570
um,
so in other words,

1429
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,433
let me say it another way,
just because you're looking like you're 

1430
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,620
like,
you're,

1431
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:23,130
you're looking off in space here.
So there's new year's.

1432
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:28,230
Okay,
let's count 365 days when we do that.

1433
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,460
We are not at the same place we were 
when we left.

1434
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:36,960
Celebrated New Year's Day,
New Year's Eve.

1435
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,333
Okay.
We're not at the same place in our 

1436
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,800
orbit.
A revolution around.

1437
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,510
You rotate on an axis.
You revolve around something else.

1438
01:13:44,511 --> 01:13:46,470
Since I was two words,
how you use those two words.

1439
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:50,100
So we're not in the same place,
but we celebrate new year's anyway.

1440
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,620
Well,
when will we be in the same place?

1441
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:56,070
A quarter of a day later.
Six hours.

1442
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,030
So we would celebrate the next new year 
at 6:00

1443
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,540
AM.
Nobody's willing to do that.

1444
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,660
That was really the end of the next new 
year at noon,

1445
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,670
the next few year at six PM.

1446
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,910
And then the next few years kind of 
aligns back again.

1447
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,540
Well that's the leap day.
That's the fourth year we have put in.

1448
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:16,450
Oh See.
So it's our love of the day.

1449
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,343
Yes.
That keeps us fucked up with the world 

1450
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,060
when it comes to the year.
Yeah,

1451
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,450
yeah.
Wow.

1452
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:25,283
You pick one and then that's how.
That's how you do it and what do the 

1453
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:30,070
minds based it on the moon?
Right.

1454
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:31,503
I didn't get a cycle.
I didn't study their calendar as deeply 

1455
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,344
as I should have and wanted to.
Especially back in 2012 and everyone 

1456
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,161
said,
oh,

1457
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:39,994
the Mayan calendar runs out,
so therefore that's the end of the 

1458
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:42,130
world.
I was thinking,

1459
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,900
I was thinking it was the end of the war
because the mindsets are the mindsets.

1460
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,320
That was back when.
You know,

1461
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,400
before that had happened,
it was George Bush was president in 2007

1462
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:58,360
and everybody was thinking,
Jesus,

1463
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:59,223
this is.

1464
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,810
This is going to be the end of the.
So what?

1465
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:04,180
So every decade there's somebody 
predicting the end of the world.

1466
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:05,023
Sure.
I'm actually quite entertained by this 

1467
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,440
exercise.
Do you remember when they had billboards

1468
01:15:08,441 --> 01:15:11,470
all around la?
Just a few years that that's a different

1469
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:15,730
end of the world.
That's a guy with a radio podcast church

1470
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:16,943
there,
and then the underworld didn't come and 

1471
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:21,130
so they pushed it forward.
So that's,

1472
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,080
it's entertaining.
We live in a free country.

1473
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,943
It's evidenced that we live in a free 
country where freedom of speech is 

1474
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:30,670
protected and you can practice any 
religion you want,

1475
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,743
right?
That's a.

1476
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,593
and uh,
they didn't learn much science in 

1477
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:35,860
school.
That's a part of it.

1478
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,320
That's part of the fact that you have 
this in our world.

1479
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:41,500
I don't mind it actually.
I find it entertaining,

1480
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:46,950
but it becomes an issue if people such 
as that gain power over legislation over

1481
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:48,814
the rest of us,
because this would count this as a 

1482
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:51,244
personal belief.

1483
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,233
It's your personal belief.
The world is going to end on October 

1484
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,220
19th in the year.
That's your,

1485
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,970
you,
you're fine.

1486
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,000
Right?
But if you now create laws that require,

1487
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:01,834
I go with that.
You just impose your personal belief on 

1488
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:09,181
me.
And your personal belief is not true for

1489
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:10,900
everyone.
It's only true for you.

1490
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,341
Yeah,
that's a problem.

1491
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:13,174
Right?
And an objective truth is true for 

1492
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:15,160
everyone.
So if you're gonna have,

1493
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,053
if you're going to have governance,
you're going to want a base governance 

1494
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:19,714
on what is objectively true because it 
would apply to everyone the independent 

1495
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:24,364
of your belief system.

1496
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,600
Yeah,
I agree with that.

1497
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,520
And by the way,
there are.

1498
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:34,900
There are.
There are things that we're not sure are

1499
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:35,734
true yet that we're still researching.
That's not what I'm talking about as an 

1500
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:43,180
as an objective truth check.
Your truth had been verified by multiple

1501
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,610
scientific studies,
not just one study.

1502
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,790
This was the problem with the 
cholesterol study.

1503
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,003
This is a cholesterol study that said 
everybody on the course to drop their 

1504
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:53,800
cholesterol levels.
Okay,

1505
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,680
saying it would be good for your heart 
and all the rest of this,

1506
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,903
because a series of countries were 
studied where they have longevity and 

1507
01:17:01,031 --> 01:17:01,864
low heart,
low heart disease and low cholesterol 

1508
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:05,800
intake.
That study happened to leave out France.

1509
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,980
It happened.
It just wasn't in the study and a couple

1510
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,640
of other places that have high 
cholesterol intake but don't have higher

1511
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:17,660
heart disease.
So that study was flawed,

1512
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,303
but it was hard to replicate it because 
it went over many years and it was 

1513
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:24,680
thousands of people and so everyone just
jumped on it.

1514
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,510
You don't have a scientific truth and 
this.

1515
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,393
This is a general problem with medical 
results because the press is waiting at 

1516
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:32,954
the,
at the,

1517
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,590
at the Journal Editors Office,
Oh,

1518
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:39,710
here's a new study that shows that this 
gives you cancer.

1519
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,150
Oh,
that must be true.

1520
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:41,984
And outcomes the headline,
because you want to be the first to 

1521
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:43,694
report it,
and then that gets emblazoned in 

1522
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,360
people's heads and not everyone reads 
the followup.

1523
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:51,200
No one could duplicate that study,
no one.

1524
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,530
So there's a flaw.
We don't even know what the flaw is.

1525
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:56,870
We know that no one else could get those
results.

1526
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,190
So it goes in the dustbin of scientific 
research.

1527
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,173
Most research in any journal of the 
moment will ultimately shown to be 

1528
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:09,200
wrong.
That's the bleeding edge of science.

1529
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:10,853
It's a.
it's a great place to be because you're 

1530
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:12,944
in the.
You're in the trenches and you don't 

1531
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:15,014
know what is true.
You can't look up in the back of the 

1532
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:20,810
book what the answer is to double check.
You don't even know what the question is

1533
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:23,860
to ask half the time.
Oh,

1534
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,890
but that's very frustrating for people 
that don't get it.

1535
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,540
Correct,
but it's exciting.

1536
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:33,250
It's exciting for the scientists.
It's exciting to knowledge period that's

1537
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,333
constantly expanding and growing,
but it's a very frustrating for people 

1538
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:39,140
that really don't have the time and you 
know,

1539
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:42,890
maybe he did get some outdated nutrition
knowledge or they need an answer,

1540
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:43,490
right?
No,

1541
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,360
they need an answer,
right?

1542
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,500
Yeah.
Right now.

1543
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,050
And religion in many ways gives you 
answers right now.

1544
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:49,013
Yeah.
Without the need to sort of have to 

1545
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,163
research it or to go on the frontier.
The lack of education and the lack of 

1546
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,323
the lack of curiosity about it.
It's one of the scariest things about 

1547
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,030
new generations of kids.
Right?

1548
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,070
Like when the new generations are coming
up,

1549
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:06,050
if they know less than the generation 
before,

1550
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,520
that's when we really start to freak 
out.

1551
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,503
That would be a problem.
Although I have good confidence in the 

1552
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:14,450
30 and under gender because that 
millennial,

1553
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,660
I will have to be.
I think millennials have only ever known

1554
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:21,560
the Internet and devices.
So what would they say?

1555
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,483
Recent,
but my son is a millennial and he's 

1556
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:25,880
like,
my kids are millennials,

1557
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:28,490
so they're twentyish.
So 30 is a little old,

1558
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,490
so 25 and under I think are the 
millennials.

1559
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:33,380
Yeah.
But 30 when they were 10,

1560
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:34,340
the Internet was around.

1561
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:35,203
I know,
but they need a different marketing 

1562
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:37,580
terms so you can market to them 
differently.

1563
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,320
Yeah.
So to me,

1564
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,840
I would put them in the same bin just as
you were thinking there,

1565
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,310
but,
but they,

1566
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:47,390
they have a different relationship to 
science and technology.

1567
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,583
Of course they're not,
they don't fear the science or the 

1568
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:50,894
technology.
They embrace it because it has shaped 

1569
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:54,560
the civilization that is enabled their 
social life.

1570
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,880
It has been through this.
Like one of the things that I tweeted,

1571
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:01,430
I think it was from scientific American 
yesterday,

1572
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,350
maybe it was yesterday,
that,

1573
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,150
uh,
it's a little bit misleading,

1574
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,373
but one of the things they said is only 
64 percent of millennials have a strong 

1575
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:11,670
belief.
These things,

1576
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,370
these coasters are terrible.
They look great,

1577
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:17,760
but then things stick to the made of 
metal.

1578
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,310
A metal coaster.
Yeah.

1579
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,750
What the hell is that?
Sticks?

1580
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,613
Yeah.
That's the issue sticks when it gets 

1581
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:27,570
moisture.
You know about this,

1582
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:29,340
where you flip this over and tip it 
over.

1583
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:32,850
And then what happened on that?
Never do that.

1584
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,470
What?
Yeah.

1585
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,640
Oh,
because of the pressure.

1586
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,160
The air pressure.
It is okay,

1587
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,820
but don't do it.
I don't trust your science.

1588
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,580
Your objective truth is 64 percent of 
millennials are not,

1589
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,573
uh,
or only 64 percent are convinced that 

1590
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:54,630
the world is a ball.
The world is a circle.

1591
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:56,080
That.
What is it?

1592
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:56,923
Is Fear.
Roid?

1593
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,003
Is that what it's called?
Oh,

1594
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,913
mean,
I'd like to see how that question was 

1595
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:00,923
asked.
Because if they know that we are ablate 

1596
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,340
and the thing is asking,
is Earth a ball?

1597
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:05,881
They'll say,
no,

1598
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:09,300
we're going blatant ball or a slightly 
wider below the equator than,

1599
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:10,350
uh,
than at the equator.

1600
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:12,720
So we're a pear shaped,
oblate spheroid,

1601
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,380
but it's not a pair that you would find 
normally if you found that period.

1602
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,420
But like this is fucking pair that 
shaped like a ball.

1603
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,180
So the,
these distinctions,

1604
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,043
these differences in measurements are so
small that if you found it on the 

1605
01:21:24,991 --> 01:21:26,430
ground,
you would say there is a perfect sphere.

1606
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,510
Right.
Let me tell you how,

1607
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,760
how good a sphere it is.
All right.

1608
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:30,594
Do you ever see the schoolroom Globes 
that the geographic Globes and you rub 

1609
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:36,470
your finger over in Nepal and you get 
the.

1610
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,791
Yeah.
Yeah.

1611
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:40,580
And you get the rockies.
Oh,

1612
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,970
that is a gross exaggeration of reality.
Yes.

1613
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,420
Do you realize if you took earth with 
all of its mountains,

1614
01:21:48,421 --> 01:21:49,254
valleys,
and hills and rep and shrunk it down to 

1615
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:51,444
the size of a cue ball,
it will be smoother than any qubole 

1616
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:54,184
ball.
Every machine?

1617
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:57,580
Yes.
Yes.

1618
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:01,220
Think about it.
Think about this job.

1619
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,020
Really chill.
Listen to me.

1620
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,610
You Ready?
Okay.

1621
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:06,983
Uh,
do you know the deepest part of Earth's 

1622
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:08,634
crust?

1623
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,060
No.
The Marianas trench off the coast of the

1624
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:14,730
Philippines in the Pacific Ocean.
That's the deepest,

1625
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,670
deepest part goes six miles down.
Okay.

1626
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,301
Oh,
okay.

1627
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:19,920
So.
Okay.

1628
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:22,370
I was thinking of the depth.
Sorry.

1629
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,211
No,
no,

1630
01:22:23,211 --> 01:22:26,220
no.
Just access to the deepest part of verse

1631
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,990
crest.
The lowest point on her surface.

1632
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:31,020
The Marianas trench right off the coast 
of the Philippines.

1633
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:36,320
The highest point on earth surface.
The tip of a k,

1634
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:39,630
one k,
one or k two,

1635
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,010
which is Japan.
I think it's k one.

1636
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,730
Why would you name the tallest peak?
K Two.

1637
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,370
It's good to point.
I'm just,

1638
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,120
I'm not a mountain climber,
but I'm,

1639
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,760
I'm just thinking.
Okay.

1640
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:53,530
With.
It's the Himalayan mountains in Nepal.

1641
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,600
Okay.
Isn't it in Nepal?

1642
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:56,920
I think it is.
Yeah.

1643
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,240
Yeah.
Okay.

1644
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,390
So now let's say how high up is that was
28,000

1645
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:03,670
feet,
so it's like five miles up.

1646
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:05,263
Okay.
Right.

1647
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:07,293
The distance between the lowest point on
earth surface and the highest point on 

1648
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:17,380
earth surface is 11 miles.
That's here to the comedy store.

1649
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,990
That is less than the length of 
Manhattan.

1650
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,200
Oh yeah.
We are 8,000

1651
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:24,580
miles in diameter.

1652
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,510
And those two points are very far 
separated from one another.

1653
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,093
If you are cosmic giant and you came up 
to earth and you rub your finger over 

1654
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:39,990
earth's surface,
it would feel as smooth as a cue ball to

1655
01:23:39,991 --> 01:23:41,730
you.
Wow.

1656
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:42,960
In fact,
in this,

1657
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,093
in this book,
I have a whole chapter called on being 

1658
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:47,760
round,
which is all about.

1659
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:51,840
This is all about our perception of what
is round and what is not.

1660
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,320
I had asked you to debate one of them 
flat earth guys.

1661
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,851
No,
I don't.

1662
01:23:55,851 --> 01:23:56,730
I can't.
I know.

1663
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:57,603
I know.
We talked about it and we're gonna have 

1664
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:01,470
them on skype.
Not what we do is,

1665
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:05,970
and I think this is a diabolical plot so
that the next time we can ship people en

1666
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:06,804
mass into orbit,
they all want to be the first in line 

1667
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:09,330
because they know we're going to send 
them.

1668
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:10,823
So if they can see the round earth,
they're going to be the first ones in 

1669
01:24:12,121 --> 01:24:15,050
space just so they can stop annoying the
rest of.

1670
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:19,070
I don't think you're correct.
I think you're correct,

1671
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:19,933
but everything's a diabolical plot.
I do have people that have met that 

1672
01:24:22,351 --> 01:24:23,184
don't believe because they.
The problem with youtube videos is that 

1673
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:28,523
it's a problem with a lot of things,
but one of the things about being 

1674
01:24:30,481 --> 01:24:33,900
unchecked,
why you are discussing things is you can

1675
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:35,190
say things,
you can use,

1676
01:24:35,191 --> 01:24:36,024
big words,
you can sound articulate and smooth and 

1677
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:42,660
you can do it and a very professional 
looking manner or do it passionately,

1678
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:43,933
passionately,
convincingly charismatically and you 

1679
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:48,683
your unchecked,
but if you did that in front of an 

1680
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:54,180
expert and you showed them that along 
the way,

1681
01:24:54,181 --> 01:24:55,020
they go,
stop.

1682
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,280
That's not true.
Stop.

1683
01:24:56,281 --> 01:24:59,070
That's not how it works.
Let me show you why this is incorrect.

1684
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:02,730
Let me show you how you could prove that
this is incorrect or objective truths,

1685
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:03,653
but this is not happening to render your
argument invalid so people don't have 

1686
01:25:06,421 --> 01:25:09,300
any education and then they watch one of
these youtube clips.

1687
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:13,320
They start actually believing that this 
stuff makes sense because it's unchecked

1688
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,630
and I would say it's not about whether 
they've had education.

1689
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,613
It's about whether the education they 
had teaches them skepticism of 

1690
01:25:19,951 --> 01:25:22,710
information and teach them how to 
inquire.

1691
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:28,050
You realize it's just as intellectually 
lazy to believe everything you see as it

1692
01:25:29,221 --> 01:25:33,150
is to deny everything you see.
Yes.

1693
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:38,180
Why should someone know automatically 
that earth isn't flat yet?

1694
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:39,924
I tell them in the next breath that the 
entire universe was once a small as a 

1695
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:43,704
marble,

1696
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:48,310
right?
Both of those sound equally preposterous

1697
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:49,743
except one has evidence to back it and 
the other does not and very strong 

1698
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,980
scientific theoretical and experimental 
underpinnings.

1699
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,323
So when you are trained to inquire,
you don't either believe everything 

1700
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:06,290
outright or reject everything outright.
You're trained to ask questions.

1701
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:11,450
You trained to probe deeper than the 
layer of information that comes to you.

1702
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:15,460
That's what should be taught in school 
and it's not you.

1703
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:19,970
They give you a book and say,
learn this and you'll get tested on it,

1704
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,313
and then when you're done,
learn this isn't also there's a problem 

1705
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:28,580
with being inexorably connected to your 
first belief to you.

1706
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,980
When you have an idea and it's in your 
head,

1707
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:31,993
it's very difficult for people to shake 
that idea and they start arguing that 

1708
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:34,934
idea.
That idea becomes a part of their 

1709
01:26:35,781 --> 01:26:36,614
identity and they dig their heels in 
deeper when an opposing view is 

1710
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,380
presented to they connect themselves to 
these ideas.

1711
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,370
It is who they are.
Right?

1712
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:45,343
Right.
And so I try not to base my character 

1713
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:54,560
profile on something that is not yet 
verified as objective truth,

1714
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:58,040
and that's a very good thing to do.
It's one of the reasons why I don't have

1715
01:26:58,041 --> 01:27:03,041
tattoos on my body and stretching my 
face.

1716
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,630
Go on.
Uh,

1717
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:12,850
one of the reasons is there's nothing I 
am so sure about that.

1718
01:27:14,211 --> 01:27:16,760
I want to put it indelibly on my skin 
with no,

1719
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:17,570
no,
not.

1720
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:22,310
Let me say it differently.
There's nothing I value in my mind,

1721
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:23,150
body,
and soul.

1722
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:28,151
So much in this moment that I want to 
indelibly etched it on my skin because I

1723
01:27:28,971 --> 01:27:33,971
want to leave room for me to have a 
possibly more enlightening thought later

1724
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,990
that would override whatever was my 
decision in that moment.

1725
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:42,770
And since I count myself among the 
lifelong learners,

1726
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,200
I'm learning stuff all the time.

1727
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,180
They say,
wow,

1728
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,390
that's good.
I didn't know that.

1729
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:51,643
That's even better.
What's something you've learned 

1730
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:54,770
recently?
You went,

1731
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,840
ah,
okay.

1732
01:27:56,841 --> 01:27:57,770
Let me,
let me think.

1733
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:01,760
Uh Hm.
Okay.

1734
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:04,070
Here's something I learned recently.
I think I knew this when I was a kid,

1735
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,590
but if you're playing basketball and 
you're shooting,

1736
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,780
okay,
and you say,

1737
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:09,710
oh,
that didn't go in.

1738
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:10,341
Oh my gosh.
Well,

1739
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:10,911
you know,
the rim.

1740
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:12,320
They should maybe make the room a little
bigger.

1741
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:13,154
Iq score more often.
Do you realize two basketballs can fit 

1742
01:28:17,571 --> 01:28:21,070
exactly side by side through the opening
of a basketball hoop.

1743
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:24,950
Really?
Yes.

1744
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,450
I guess it makes sense to basketballs.
Tough squeeze.

1745
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,303
No,
it's not a cosmically mind blowing 

1746
01:28:31,371 --> 01:28:34,760
moment,
but that gives you perspective.

1747
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:39,761
Next time you watch a basketball game,
it's how these guys can fly from the,

1748
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,690
from the foul line in a,
in a,

1749
01:28:43,691 --> 01:28:48,691
an airborne slam dunk and not miss 
because the area of this opening is four

1750
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:54,620
times.
You do the math.

1751
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,930
It's four times as large as the ball 
itself,

1752
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:57,783
right?
Because of the different positions that 

1753
01:28:58,551 --> 01:29:01,650
could be in multiple positions and they 
can do it,

1754
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:06,420
so it's not that that's easy to 
accomplish,

1755
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,673
but knowing this,
you realize how much easier it is to 

1756
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:13,140
score.
Then you might have otherwise thought,

1757
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,510
I wonder if basketball,
so that was a recent.

1758
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,760
That was a recent revelation.
That's a good revelation.

1759
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,673
Yeah.
I wonder if basketball players 

1760
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:21,990
occasionally practice with a smaller 
hole.

1761
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,210
I think about this all the time.

1762
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,043
I said if I was a basketball player,
you don't want to practice with a 

1763
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:28,230
heavier ball saying yes because that 
then you would.

1764
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,980
That would throw you off your.
Your practice in a bigger ball.

1765
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,350
They use the bigger ball as well.
We use the ball sometimes.

1766
01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:36,030
It's almost as big as,
wait a minute.

1767
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:37,170
Is it heavier?
No,

1768
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:37,650
no,
no,

1769
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:38,160
no.
You don't.

1770
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,150
No,
you don't use a bigger bowl.

1771
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:42,030
It's a thing that I did a long time ago.
I bet they still don't.

1772
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,370
They no longer do it because then your 
grip is different.

1773
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:49,590
The grip of matters.
Where are your two hands go and what you

1774
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:50,424
want to do it.
You use a smaller room and in baseball 

1775
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,860
you throw a faster pitch to give you 
less reaction time.

1776
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:58,530
That pool table that you like a skinnier
bat.

1777
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:01,020
That pool table is a very small pocket 
opening.

1778
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,660
Nice.
Four inch pocket opening as opposed to a

1779
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:05,810
five and a half inch.
That's quite a bit different.

1780
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:06,930
You're doing it,
you're doing it.

1781
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,200
And uh,
so uh,

1782
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:11,230
I would also,
you know,

1783
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,113
growing up,
I played stickball in the street in New 

1784
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:14,783
York and so you're using basically a 
broom handle and so when the first time 

1785
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:23,970
you play baseball officially it's like,
Whoa,

1786
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,313
I've got this huge bat.
And so stick ball players tend to 

1787
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:32,010
transfer very well to baseball when 
you're a kid.

1788
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,173
Yeah.
Because your instrument is bigger to 

1789
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:36,950
read the talent code.
Daniel coyle's.

1790
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:37,843
No,
I'm one of the interesting parts about 

1791
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:42,850
it is Brazilian soccer players,
how good they are and uh,

1792
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:43,723
they,
he attributed it to a different game 

1793
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:47,610
that they play with a heavier ball that 
they do indoors.

1794
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:48,863
It's a small heavy ball and because they
do it in tight quarters and involves 

1795
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:54,263
incredibly fast footwork and movement 
and then these guys take that footwork 

1796
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:03,180
and movement and it translates amazingly
well to an open soccer field.

1797
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:06,630
I wonder if they calculated that because
what you would do is,

1798
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:07,464
let's say the ball weighs twice as much,
then it would only go half as far when 

1799
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:12,600
you kicked it,
so then you make a field half as large.

1800
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:16,530
I don't think they did.
Then you can reproduce almost all of the

1801
01:31:16,531 --> 01:31:17,364
dynamics of the soccer game.
I think it was based on just trying to 

1802
01:31:20,521 --> 01:31:22,970
play a game and like how far are you 
going to call it in over?

1803
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:23,873
If it's the boss twice as heavy,
you throw throat half as far the field 

1804
01:31:26,641 --> 01:31:27,860
has half the size,
right?

1805
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,740
Then you have a mini game.
Basically you do it right.

1806
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:33,750
That makes sense that there's a whole 
fun exercise you can do,

1807
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,773
uh,
playing sports on other planets with 

1808
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:36,990
different grounds.
It's very,

1809
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:42,020
very fun thing to do if you're a Dork,
you know,

1810
01:31:43,341 --> 01:31:43,740
it's funny.

1811
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:48,210
Occasionally I'll tweet something and 
people say Dork and I say,

1812
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,290
yeah,
thanks for the compliment.

1813
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:51,590
Okay.
Nerd.

1814
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:54,990
Is he a bad dad used to take dork as 
well.

1815
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,600
You'd get wedgies to the nerds.
Um,

1816
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:59,890
well the nerds would also be the that 
were like,

1817
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:04,930
but now endured is like you can be a 
science nerd and people like it.

1818
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,920
That's a goal.
Yeah.

1819
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:08,460
I'm an old movie nerd.
You can say that.

1820
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,510
Or movie geek.
Yeah.

1821
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:13,120
Taken Dork,
Dork and nerd.

1822
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,590
Yeah,
they tell you,

1823
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:15,443
I must,
I must have told you this last time I 

1824
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:20,620
was on your show when I was a kid.
I was bigger than other kids.

1825
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:25,540
I was always one of the tallest kids in 
the class out of 30.

1826
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,673
So I was bigger than others in the day 
and I was also physically fit and 

1827
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:35,740
physically active,
athletic.

1828
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:40,180
But I was squarely in the Geek camp.
Okay.

1829
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:44,320
I had my slide rule back in the day,
walking down the car door

1830
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,633
know you were also wrestling with.
I was captain of my high school 

1831
01:32:48,301 --> 01:32:49,134
wrestling team,
so I was a geek person who could 

1832
01:32:52,321 --> 01:32:53,880
actually kick your ass.
Okay.

1833
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:54,893
And I saw how my fellow Geeks,
because that's the community that I 

1834
01:32:57,631 --> 01:32:58,464
associated with card carrying were 
treated by the football quarterback and 

1835
01:33:01,591 --> 01:33:04,620
the popular kids and the kids who are 
all beautiful.

1836
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:05,573
And the ones who,
and I imagined my future as a superhero 

1837
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,760
defender of the Geeks so that you put up
a little bat,

1838
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,113
sigma,
whatever Geeks they gonna put a few 

1839
01:33:19,201 --> 01:33:23,610
digits of Pi and I come flying in and 
there's a Wedgie in progress,

1840
01:33:23,611 --> 01:33:28,611
right?
I would just land and I'd grab the bully

1841
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,970
and rip them off the encounter.
And I've just saved the day.

1842
01:33:32,971 --> 01:33:35,490
This is my superhero.
Is the football players,

1843
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:35,930
right?
No,

1844
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:39,720
always because there's.
I think they're rewarded for violence,

1845
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:40,650
for violence.

1846
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:42,430
They also have brain damage.
We,

1847
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:43,343
as we've come to discover how fucked up 
is that you find another high school 

1848
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:46,584
kids,
right?

1849
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:50,640
Literally across the board.
The majority of people who play football

1850
01:33:50,641 --> 01:33:54,480
have cte right in as far down as seventh
grade.

1851
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:57,190
Yeah.
What you set?

1852
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,530
Remind me that's t stands for chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy.

1853
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:05,100
C and Sephora,
dot dot,

1854
01:34:05,101 --> 01:34:10,101
dot and cephalopathy both say like Mike 
Tyson on monotherapy.

1855
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:14,700
So let me tell you that story about 
Christopher Columbus.

1856
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,800
Please.
So the Dick Story,

1857
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:21,270
I already told you the Dick Story.
Now let me tell you just something else.

1858
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,140
Okay?
Okay.

1859
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:27,140
I think him coming to America was the 
most significant thing to ever happen in

1860
01:34:30,061 --> 01:34:30,894
our species.

1861
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:32,483
Whoa.

1862
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:38,560
Silence.
Not Internet porn.

1863
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,950
Porn in another medium.
Right.

1864
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:46,420
Wow.
Yeah,

1865
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,633
so yeah,
Internet porn is just a matter of 

1866
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:51,220
degree.
Not a matter of yes.

1867
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:53,240
Does it exist or does it not?
Okay.

1868
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:56,790
I think it was the most significant 
event to happen in our space.

1869
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,190
Kind amazing.
When you stop

1870
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,070
and think about the fact that at that 
point in time,

1871
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,353
other than the native Americans who 
lived here who were living a nomadic 

1872
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:10,031
tribal existence,
very few people that had the wheel,

1873
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,163
that had firearms,
that had all these things that had 

1874
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:17,000
already been achieved in the rest of the
world had made their way to this place.

1875
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:18,200
So then watch,
okay,

1876
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:20,240
here's how it worked.
Right?

1877
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,433
So you're going to hear.
So I presume that you have some 

1878
01:35:23,691 --> 01:35:27,440
skepticism of this claim as most people 
would,

1879
01:35:27,441 --> 01:35:30,600
especially the Columbus haters who are 
out there right now.

1880
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:32,840
I don't really have any skepticism about
it to be honest with you.

1881
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,183
Let me,
let me describe to you why I think this 

1882
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:36,890
was true.
Okay.

1883
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,140
And then you can tell me whether you 
agree or not.

1884
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:41,490
All right.
Uh,

1885
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:42,453
we're hunter gatherers.
We haven't settled down yet that early 

1886
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,353
humans.

1887
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:52,640
And we're basically wandering.
We're following the herds.

1888
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:56,000
All right.
And then the ice age hits.

1889
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,000
Well,
what is an ice age?

1890
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,193
And Ice Age means it is so cold that 
when the moisture evaporates from the 

1891
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:07,640
oceans,
goes to the clouds,

1892
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,790
the clouds go over the land,
it doesn't rain,

1893
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:16,270
it snows,
and the snow falls and then it stays.

1894
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:23,450
So the water that had lifted up from the
ocean does not return to the ocean.

1895
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:28,070
It accumulates on the land.
And this accumulation,

1896
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,240
when it's significant and sustained,
we call glaciers.

1897
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:38,440
Glaciers is not itself a snowfall.
It is compressed snow.

1898
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,393
It's basically changed state into this,
this ice river that flows very slowly 

1899
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,173
back to the ocean,
but the oceans are getting drained 

1900
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,530
faster than they're getting replenished.
So during the ice age,

1901
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:55,364
the ocean levels dropped.
Exposing the Bering Strait Land Bridge 

1902
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:06,140
between Asia and what is now Alaska.
Basically North America,

1903
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:10,820
our ancestors who come out of Africa go 
into Europe.

1904
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:15,530
Some state others kept wandering,
some stayed low above the Mediterranean.

1905
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:18,350
Others went high,
they populate Asia,

1906
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:21,980
they keep walking because there's land 
bridge there.

1907
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:24,620
They don't even know it's a bridge.
It's just more land,

1908
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:25,813
so they walk and they enter North 
America and from there there's kind of 

1909
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:30,650
only way you can go with south.
At that point,

1910
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:34,700
the weather gets a little better.
The Ice Age ends,

1911
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:40,450
the glaciers melt back into the oceans.
The oceans level,

1912
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,660
ocean levels rise.
Closing.

1913
01:37:43,661 --> 01:37:44,710
The landbridge

1914
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:51,170
stranding a branch of the human species 
for 10,000

1915
01:37:54,181 --> 01:37:55,014
years.
Those humans who made it across that 

1916
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:00,750
landbridge and spread out into North 
America,

1917
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:01,643
Central America,
South America have only a few families 

1918
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,960
as their parent genetic genetic origin.
Okay,

1919
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,580
Ollie,
it's like that.

1920
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:15,503
Some research says is like eight family 
lineages populated the entire north and 

1921
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:22,080
South American continents.
Then the land bridge breaks.

1922
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:24,900
Now you have Europe,
Asia,

1923
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:27,630
Africa,
and North and South America,

1924
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:28,663
and they know nothing of one another.
Two separate branches of the human 

1925
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:35,910
species.
The Vikings,

1926
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:38,090
not withstanding,
maybe they found came over.

1927
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,250
They didn't.
That even if they did,

1928
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:43,980
their influence was near zero relative 
to the Europeans.

1929
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,780
So we're talking about influence here.
This is a branch had this continued.

1930
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:53,610
This is how you speciate this is why the
species on Australia,

1931
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,100
that's why you have mammals there,
but they have pouches,

1932
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,870
right?
No other mammals do that.

1933
01:38:57,871 --> 01:39:01,260
They split off and they evolved their 
own way.

1934
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,170
Okay.
So 10,000

1935
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:08,530
years is not enough to grow three heads 
or you know,

1936
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:12,510
12 fingers,
but our species is separate.

1937
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:17,660
Now Columbus crosses the Atlantic,
makes contact with humans.

1938
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:21,450
This is the first time that has happened
in 10,000

1939
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:22,284
years.
We have rejoined two branches of the 

1940
01:39:25,891 --> 01:39:26,724
human species.
We are now one common genetic group and 

1941
01:39:34,591 --> 01:39:35,424
that genetic crossbreeding and that 
continues to this day we fly to any 

1942
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:41,790
corner of the world and mates.
Okay.

1943
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:44,460
And the mating already began 
immediately?

1944
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:45,673
Yes.
There were diseases that Columbus 

1945
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:47,154
brought to North America.
Much written about that less written is 

1946
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:54,420
that he brought syphilis back to Europe,
first cases of syphilis in 14,

1947
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:56,640
92.
Whoa.

1948
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,880
And then it skyrocketed from the native 
Americans.

1949
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:01,800
What did they have?
No problem with it?

1950
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,693
Well,
I don't know the details of how the 

1951
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:05,394
physiology of the natives have dealt 
with that or whether it mutated and 

1952
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,570
there may people know that I'm not among
them.

1953
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:14,110
That's fast.
But if just look at,

1954
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,640
you look at the graph of syphilis,
syphilis cases in Europe.

1955
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:18,743
It all began in 1492 when he came back.
So what I'm saying is this was a hugely 

1956
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:25,224
significant event,
the rejoining of the branches of the 

1957
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:30,180
human species.
But yeah,

1958
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:31,230
no,
I would imagine that,

1959
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:33,720
that makes sense.
That is the most important event.

1960
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,070
And by the way,
native Americans,

1961
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:36,490
you know,
it's famous,

1962
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:39,720
infamous problem with metabolizing 
alcohol.

1963
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,250
Okay.
With native Americans,

1964
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,510
you know,
what else has that problem?

1965
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,850
The Chinese,
they do.

1966
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:46,860
Yes,
yes,

1967
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:49,260
yes.
So it's an Asian issue.

1968
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:52,440
Well,
so who stayed in?

1969
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:57,610
So you look at who populated north and 
South America after the,

1970
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:58,840
you know,
before the land bridge,

1971
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,600
whoever was right at the edge of Asia,
then the land bridges so,

1972
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,740
so,
so Asians and and North American and,

1973
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:07,583
and the natives of north and South 
America have more in common with each 

1974
01:41:11,261 --> 01:41:12,094
other because of this than most other 
pairs or groups you might grab around 

1975
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:16,480
the world.

1976
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:20,890
But my point is obviously we,
there's a lot to blame Columbus for,

1977
01:41:20,891 --> 01:41:23,500
but he just happened to be the guy who 
did it first.

1978
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,110
Europe was coming to the new world no 
matter what,

1979
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:29,830
everybody was trying to find a faster 
trade route to the indies.

1980
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,710
And so if,
what if it wasn't Columbus,

1981
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:34,420
it would have been arnold mednick,
whatever.

1982
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:38,350
It doesn't matter.
Somebody did that and the rest is,

1983
01:41:38,351 --> 01:41:39,280
as they say,
history.

1984
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,623
Wow.
So personally I think the most 

1985
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:44,710
significant thing to happen in our 
species.

1986
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,640
Otherwise we'd still be two stranded 
branches of humans.

1987
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,753
It would be fascinating though,
like Australia stranded to see what 

1988
01:41:53,771 --> 01:41:57,190
would happen if this has gone on for 
hundreds of thousands of years,

1989
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:59,020
have 100,000.
That would have been a different story.

1990
01:41:59,080 --> 01:41:59,913
Right,
and your immunities would be different 

1991
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:03,300
to your.
Yeah.

1992
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:04,323
Oh,
well that's the big concern about 

1993
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:05,614
aliens,
right.

1994
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:08,560
One of the big concerns is that there's 
some sort of a virus,

1995
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:13,600
the pickup from somewhere.
I think that's harder to accept.

1996
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:15,140
So for example,
um,

1997
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,520
what are the chances that a oak tree 
would catch whooping cough?

1998
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:23,500
Not so good.
Not so good.

1999
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:24,753
We're two different species,
so viruses tend to be very species 

2000
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:28,780
targeted.
Yeah.

2001
01:42:28,781 --> 01:42:31,480
But what about now?
They can't jump species.

2002
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,980
Sure.
They can jump species,

2003
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:33,814
but.
So there's a jump mammal to mammal 

2004
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,140
doesn't vertebrate invertebrate Britain,
but.

2005
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:40,480
So yes,
that can happen,

2006
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,673
but the more different the life form is,
it is sensible to suppose that the less 

2007
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:48,430
likely you're going to share the same 
diseases,

2008
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:49,383
that's all.
But NASA regardless has safeguards in 

2009
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:56,671
place in the event that that happens.
So it's a,

2010
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:59,230
it's called a planetary protection 
program.

2011
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,500
In Ethics Code is a whole division of 
Masco.

2012
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,823
It's protecting earth from bugs that 
could be coming from space on our own 

2013
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:10,540
spaceship that we bring back and it 
protects destinations from us.

2014
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:15,310
There's a certain sterilization levels 
that we invoke the Cassini spacecraft.

2015
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,970
We plunged that back into Saturn in its 
death.

2016
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:22,330
When we were done with it and ran out of
money.

2017
01:43:22,331 --> 01:43:24,790
We're done with it plunged into Saturn 
to vaporize.

2018
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:26,470
We didn't leave in an orbit around 
Saturn.

2019
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:27,304
Why?
Because it might have crashed into one 

2020
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:30,454
of Saturn's moons that might have life 
and if someone had sneezed on the 

2021
01:43:35,141 --> 01:43:35,974
spacecraft before it got launched,
we don't want to contaminate the life 

2022
01:43:38,621 --> 01:43:40,990
that we are later gonna one day want to 
study.

2023
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,340
So that's why.
So we plunged it into Saturn.

2024
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,190
That's why that is why,
because they were worried about,

2025
01:43:48,191 --> 01:43:52,190
let me be in hitting Europa.
Once it's dead and you can't track it or

2026
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,810
guide it anymore.
Then it's a.

2027
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,420
it's a while.
It's a wildcard.

2028
01:43:55,930 --> 01:44:00,410
It might hit a Europa is jupiter and 
enceladus.

2029
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:03,770
There are other moons that have sort of 
ocean water,

2030
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:04,604
the water worlds basically.
And so the concern is that we would 

2031
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:10,940
introduce life.
Suppose we did it crashed and then we go

2032
01:44:10,941 --> 01:44:13,640
back later and find life and it has dna 
just like here,

2033
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,650
but it wasn't our life that we 
contaminated with.

2034
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:19,550
Is that what you don't want to confuse 
the future science of it.

2035
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:21,050
So that's,
that's the plan.

2036
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:24,170
Can you even watch a science movie like 
science fiction movies?

2037
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:25,550
I know he had a real problem with 
gravity,

2038
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,120
but.
Right.

2039
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:29,900
So let me set the record straight here.
Okay,

2040
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:31,820
let me.
Let me just go on record.

2041
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:32,713
Okay.
Okay.

2042
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:38,480
I've been deeply misunderstood with my 
comments on movies,

2043
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:40,760
deeply misunderstood,
deeply,

2044
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:44,810
deeply,
and so I've just stopped.

2045
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,930
When was the last time you saw a movie 
comment in my twitter stream?

2046
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,600
They haven't.
You haven't?

2047
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:53,420
I've kind of just stopped.
Wasn't the Matthew mcconahey movie?

2048
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,570
Did you comment on that one?
That one.

2049
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,520
Oh,
interstellar interstellar.

2050
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,020
That's the last one I commented on in a 
big way.

2051
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:00,980
Right.
And you're done.

2052
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:02,653
I'm done.
Because people then thought I was just 

2053
01:45:05,481 --> 01:45:06,570
being nitpicky.
Oh,

2054
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:07,413
D one.
It's not fun going to the movies with 

2055
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:10,320
you.
God.

2056
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,453
Let that.
Tyson will just say that can never 

2057
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:14,510
happen.
And so,

2058
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:19,750
so my intent was my intent did not match
how people received my intent.

2059
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,613
My intent is,
here's an observation that I think if 

2060
01:45:25,221 --> 01:45:26,054
you understood this,
it would enhance your appreciation of 

2061
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:29,450
the movie.
Let me give an example.

2062
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:30,710
Please do star wars.

2063
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:31,543
The force awakens they've got was at.
That's the one that introduced a bb 

2064
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:38,013
eight.
Okay.

2065
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,330
Is that the most recent one?
No,

2066
01:45:39,331 --> 01:45:39,620
no,
no.

2067
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,453
It's just like for movies ago now,
because I've lost track because there's 

2068
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:44,850
another one.
So the one that introduced BBA,

2069
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,713
cute.
As cute as ever fell a cute little 

2070
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:49,520
fellow.
And in there they have the,

2071
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:52,460
like the,
the updated deathstar.

2072
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:53,890
Right.
Okay.

2073
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:57,140
Remember the old death star?
It has enough power to destroy a planet.

2074
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:58,910
And that's devastating.
This one,

2075
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:05,200
it can suck energy out of a star so that
the star no longer exists.

2076
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:11,680
Then it could take these energy beams 
and killed six planets at once.

2077
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:14,960
It's no longer just a one planet killer.
Six or eight,

2078
01:46:14,961 --> 01:46:17,660
whatever the number was.
It was like high single digits.

2079
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:19,340
Okay.
Well,

2080
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:24,341
I did the math on this and I tweeted and
I said first,

2081
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:27,620
okay,
if you take all the energy from a star,

2082
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,070
you become a star,
but let's know.

2083
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,880
Maybe they've got a containment 
mechanism.

2084
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:33,980
I'll give it to them.
It is the future after all,

2085
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:35,293
I don't think it's the future,
but will that long time ago in a galaxy 

2086
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:38,470
far,
far away.

2087
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,620
It's another,
another,

2088
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,650
another universe of civilizations.
Okay.

2089
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:45,920
But they have lightspeed and we don't.
So it's the future of our technology.

2090
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:49,550
Even if it's the past of our time.
Ooh,

2091
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:50,543
Ooh,
Ooh,

2092
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:51,693
oh.

2093
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:58,020
So you do the calculation and I forgot 
the number,

2094
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:58,854
but I got.
I calculated how much energy is stored 

2095
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:05,961
in a star that's enough energy to 
explode a thousand planets.

2096
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:09,990
Oh my gosh.
They are underrepresented.

2097
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,260
The energy that it sucked out of the 
host Atar out of the store.

2098
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:14,633
And I thought this could have been more 
bad ass than even they came up with in 

2099
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,110
this movie.
That is the nature of my comments.

2100
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,270
Not Real.
Could this happen?

2101
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,520
Could it not happen?
Let me give you a perspective.

2102
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:27,120
Okay,
well wait,

2103
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:27,953
so,
so 20 percent of people just get pissed 

2104
01:47:30,841 --> 01:47:31,674
off.
Eighty percent really like it and they 

2105
01:47:33,511 --> 01:47:36,360
want more,
but that 20 percent they,

2106
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:41,630
they cut me no slack and I'm only doing 
this for people to enjoy and if I,

2107
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:46,560
if I have that level of hate mail,
I don't need to continue it.

2108
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,630
So I just basically stopped.
I just,

2109
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:52,440
I'll have these thoughts to myself,
but I don't have the urge to share them.

2110
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,453
I still have the thoughts.
I got to teach you the art of post and 

2111
01:47:56,941 --> 01:47:58,740
drop.
Okay.

2112
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,240
This is what you do.
You post something,

2113
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:03,680
know people are going to get mad.
You drop your phone and you walk away.

2114
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:07,800
You got to learn how to do that,
man.

2115
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:09,270
You can't be reading those fucking 
comments.

2116
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:11,120
It's dealing with too many human beings.
No,

2117
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:12,240
I get that.
I get that.

2118
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:14,670
But,
but you don't because you still changing

2119
01:48:14,671 --> 01:48:16,240
your behaviors.
Morons.

2120
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:17,970
Here's my rebuttal,
your rebuttal,

2121
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,150
my rebuttal.
Okay.

2122
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:22,740
If you're watching a movie that takes 
place in 1958,

2123
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:27,300
it's a period piece and there's a car 
from 1960.

2124
01:48:27,450 --> 01:48:28,680
Oh yeah,
that'd be crazy.

2125
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:31,050
And someone who's a car expert points 
that out and say,

2126
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:32,670
Hey,
he's an expert.

2127
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:33,504
That's pretty good.
Do you complain that the person noticed 

2128
01:48:35,961 --> 01:48:36,794
that?
No.

2129
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,780
You praise their expertise.
I get mad at the movie.

2130
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:40,643
If you get mad at the movie,
if you're watching a Jane Austin period 

2131
01:48:43,381 --> 01:48:44,214
piece and it's 1870,
whenever they took place and someone 

2132
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:51,930
gets out of the carriage with tie dye 
bell bottoms,

2133
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,620
you would cry foul.
That would take you up.

2134
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:55,453
I'm exaggerating there.
Obviously it could be a top hat instead 

2135
01:48:56,911 --> 01:48:59,010
of a derby.
He would cry foul.

2136
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,053
If you wear a costume designer and we 
would all be impressed by that level of 

2137
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:09,291
knowledge that you exhibited.
I am bringing a level of science to bear

2138
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,343
on a movie that is no different from 
anybody else's expertise who is out 

2139
01:49:13,981 --> 01:49:17,220
there that we have praised for that 
invocation.

2140
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:22,020
Yet people are not granting me that 
latitude to make those comments.

2141
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:25,020
I don't like these generalizations.
I don't know,

2142
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:27,600
but I don't like you.
You're saying people are not doing this.

2143
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:31,440
No.
A small vocal minority that are assholes

2144
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:33,920
and those are the people that you're 
altering your behavior for.

2145
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:34,943
That's what I think is ridiculous about 
this because my idols people and enjoy 

2146
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:38,304
it.
When are you talking about gravity and 

2147
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:40,343
the fact that hair wouldn't do that and 
the space stations weren't that close 

2148
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:45,060
together and see it in the sky.

2149
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,540
My work.
Right?

2150
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,393
Right,
but.

2151
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:51,090
But it's assholes.
No,

2152
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:54,160
I my tweets or offerings,
they're not,

2153
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:58,180
but I'm not a problem.
That's the problem.

2154
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:00,130
The only problem is you're reading 
responses.

2155
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:01,690
No,
you're doing is wonderful.

2156
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:06,070
One educating people.
Twenty percent freak out is high for the

2157
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:08,280
fuck is 20 percent listening.
Amy.

2158
01:50:08,281 --> 01:50:09,820
I'm believe that's numbers here,
man.

2159
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,070
I'm when it's five percent.
Then I take notice.

2160
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:16,000
When you say 20 percent like what are 
you doing?

2161
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:18,060
Calculations.
You actually do another scan.

2162
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:19,660
100 of them,
20 of them.

2163
01:50:19,661 --> 01:50:20,494
That's just run into 20 assholes.
So 20 assholes out of the millions and 

2164
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,383
millions of people that follow.
You have decided to reach out and and 

2165
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:28,603
Louis,
you're altering your behavior for 

2166
01:50:29,741 --> 01:50:33,460
assholes.
I like those quotes.

2167
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:34,480
I like when you,
when you,

2168
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:36,910
when you break things down,
because I didn't know those things and I

2169
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:38,830
like thinking about like the hair and 
gravity.

2170
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:39,700
I was like,
Oh yeah,

2171
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,713
a fucking shit be standing straight up 
and the only reason why I mentioned 

2172
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:44,560
about here,
because every photo of anybody with long

2173
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:47,200
hair wouldn't happen to you,
but anyone was long here in space.

2174
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:52,380
It standing up on edge.
It's a completely obvious thing that was

2175
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,330
omitted from the filming of gravity.
Yeah,

2176
01:50:55,331 --> 01:50:58,390
but you have to have hair and makeup.
They have to have a reason to exist.

2177
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,520
So.
So what I might do,

2178
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:05,410
I might take a poll.
I might put up by my postal service.

2179
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:08,740
I don't want to force feed curiosity.
Have to listen on your feet.

2180
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:11,710
No one else to feed anybody.
Force feeding anything.

2181
01:51:11,711 --> 01:51:13,780
You pretty offerings out there,
like you said,

2182
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:16,300
does not force feeding.
You're not knocking on someone's home.

2183
01:51:16,301 --> 01:51:17,500
Wake up bitch.
My Shit.

2184
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:20,400
That is true.
I'm not forcing myself on your property.

2185
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,340
Do we get it all?

2186
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:22,323
Put the shotgun down.
You're going to hear me talk about your 

2187
01:51:23,621 --> 01:51:25,000
movie.
This in man.

2188
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:27,070
I said about bb eight.
I said,

2189
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:31,210
first I said bbs way cuter than r two,
d two,

2190
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:35,450
and I use like five a's in the way just 
to just to start a fight because that.

2191
01:51:35,451 --> 01:51:36,550
That's a fun fight.
Right?

2192
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:39,980
Then I said,
by the way are to a bb eight,

2193
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:40,953
a smooth metal rolling spherical ball 
would have skidded uncontrollably on 

2194
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:51,070
sand in the whole movie is moving 
around.

2195
01:51:51,071 --> 01:51:52,870
I'm saying,
right?

2196
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:53,800
Yeah,
it would.

2197
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:57,040
That's why you deflate your touch while 
you deflate your tires to drive on sand.

2198
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,083
That's correct.
Oh,

2199
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:59,620
you can't.
Have you ever tried riding a bicycle?

2200
01:51:59,621 --> 01:52:00,840
And Sandra,
it's impossible to.

2201
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:03,010
Good point.
And imagine that with rubber tires.

2202
01:52:03,011 --> 01:52:05,920
Imagine steel tires.
You're not running on a sand dune.

2203
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:07,730
Holy Gosh.
Oh yeah.

2204
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,180
One of the hardest things you could do 
for talking about getting into shape,

2205
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,420
so it will work.

2206
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:15,750
If you have a hard surface just below 
it,

2207
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:16,833
a dusting of sand,
then you then you can dig into it and 

2208
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:24,880
some resistance to sand then connects to
the hard surface.

2209
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:28,620
So.
So I posted this and people say,

2210
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,473
you're ruining the movie for me.
And then people started this assholes 

2211
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:32,990
again,
who the.

2212
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:36,310
When you say people,
you just listening to assholes,

2213
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,590
smart people going to read that and go,
Oh yeah,

2214
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:40,060
yeah,
this is stupid.

2215
01:52:40,061 --> 01:52:43,290
It would roll around and it gives you 
that fucking thing track.

2216
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,560
But you know,
it's actually happened as a result.

2217
01:52:45,561 --> 01:52:47,840
I think I'm getting phone calls from 
producers.

2218
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,150
Oh,
there's a little bit of science.

2219
01:52:50,151 --> 01:52:52,340
We want to make sure that you don't 
tweet about it.

2220
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,870
You keeping them on point.
As you know,

2221
01:52:56,871 --> 01:52:57,704
I might be most famous among in movie 
commenting for the final scene in 

2222
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:03,980
titanic.
Okay.

2223
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:05,003
If you knew about this,
but what would you say about the 

2224
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:06,900
fucking.

2225
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:10,510
So we know where the titanic sank.
The longitude and latitude.

2226
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,890
Yes.
We know what time of day.

2227
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:16,440
Oh,
so at the p of v,

2228
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:18,170
the point of view of,
of rose,

2229
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,570
and she's looking up deliriously to the 
sky.

2230
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,560
There's only one sky she should've seen.
And it was the wrong sky.

2231
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:28,730
Not only that,
the left side of the sky there was worse

2232
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:29,564
than it was worse than that.
The left side of this guy was a mirror 

2233
01:53:31,161 --> 01:53:33,580
reflection of the right side of the sky.
Did you call jeans?

2234
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:34,910
Because I called her,
I didn't know.

2235
01:53:34,911 --> 01:53:37,460
Replaced back in 1996.
I saw it when it first came out.

2236
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,750
I noticed instantly and because I know 
the sky,

2237
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,610
this is what I.
Okay,

2238
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,633
so no reply.
Five years later I bumped into him at a 

2239
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:51,020
meeting a NASA hosted a meeting with 
some explorers and some scientists.

2240
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:53,390
I brought it up to him and he says,
well,

2241
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:55,213
at the time I was not overseeing 
postproduction and that's when we added 

2242
01:53:57,471 --> 01:53:57,710
that.

2243
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:01,730
So I'm immaturely wanting them to grovel
at my feet for forgiveness.

2244
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:04,610
I wanted them to,
but that's not what happened.

2245
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:08,690
So then five years after that,
I brought it up again when I bumped into

2246
01:54:08,691 --> 01:54:10,910
him and then he said,
you know,

2247
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,613
last I checked the titanic,
titanic has earned more than a billion 

2248
01:54:15,141 --> 01:54:15,974
dollars worldwide.
Imagine how much more it would have 

2249
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:23,351
earned if I'd gotten the sky correct.
That's a stupid answer from an asshole.

2250
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,800
It was as it should be tweeting,
you know,

2251
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:28,310
so.
So that is an asshole.

2252
01:54:28,311 --> 01:54:29,530
And listen,
let's wait.

2253
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,670
That's an ego answer,
but it's not the end of the story.

2254
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:34,100
So.
So that was okay.

2255
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:36,740
I have nothing more I can say here 
because he's right.

2256
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:37,731
Okay.
No,

2257
01:54:37,731 --> 01:54:39,210
he's not.
He's right now.

2258
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,063
He made it a lot of money and it 
would've made the same amount of money 

2259
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:44,810
with the correct.
That's true.

2260
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:47,180
But that's not the point.
But he's crazy fucked up,

2261
01:54:47,181 --> 01:54:49,060
bitch.
You fucked up.

2262
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,810
You fucked up.
Don't say how much money.

2263
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:54,230
A week later I got a phone call so high,
I forgot his name.

2264
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:55,064
Johnson.
Hi John.

2265
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:56,360
How can I help you?
Is this the dot types?

2266
01:54:56,370 --> 01:55:01,370
I said yes.
He said I work post production for James

2267
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,593
Cameron.
He's producing a director's cut where 

2268
01:55:04,851 --> 01:55:08,660
he's adding new footage and he tells me 
you have a sky he could use.

2269
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:16,640
So this centennial release of titanic 
released in April 2012 w dot the w.

2270
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,750
Oh yeah,
that's right.

2271
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:26,830
Yes.
So how'd you pick up that?

2272
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:27,803
There was a April 2012.
I feel like you and I had this 

2273
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:31,700
conversation because we might have,
we might have.

2274
01:55:31,701 --> 01:55:34,900
I just put this in context now it's got.
So uh,

2275
01:55:34,950 --> 01:55:36,930
so he actually put in.
So he did come through my.

2276
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:41,120
So here's what happened.
Seth Macfarlane calls me up and said,

2277
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:42,403
I'm making a movie about a talking teddy
bear and I need to know the sky over a 

2278
01:55:47,371 --> 01:55:52,371
town outside of Boston in 1985 on 
Christmas eve looking north,

2279
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,760
northeast.
You've got a sky.

2280
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:58,460
I say,
I'll get back to you.

2281
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,333
Half hour later I sent him the sky.
That was the sky that the kid wished on 

2282
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:06,110
to forward where Ted came to life.
Wow.

2283
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:11,010
So Ted had the correct Scott and titanic
did not.

2284
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:15,360
So correcting these Ted one,
titanic zero on that.

2285
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:16,343
Right?
So the point is that people started 

2286
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:19,493
thinking about it and I,
the highest compliment I ever got was a 

2287
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:23,453
Andy Weir who wrote the Martian.
He said to himself while he was writing 

2288
01:56:27,301 --> 01:56:28,740
the novel,
he said,

2289
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,753
because he's an engineer,
so he has the fluency and he's also 

2290
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:35,340
knows how to write a.
he's a write creatively.

2291
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:39,210
He said,
if Tyson we're looking over my shoulder,

2292
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:41,970
what would he,
would he tweet about this or not?

2293
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:47,550
And so that put them on notice to make 
sure that his calculations were accurate

2294
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,133
and the Martian is one of the most 
entertainingly accurate explorations of 

2295
01:56:52,891 --> 01:56:55,980
how to invoke science to not die that 
there ever was.

2296
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:57,113
So for me,
that was a very high compliment and it 

2297
01:56:58,471 --> 01:57:01,500
was kind of worth it.
All of the naysayers that to know that,

2298
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:02,580
that uh,
Andy,

2299
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,650
we're came through on that.

2300
01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:06,990
Yeah.
So why stop?

2301
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,553
I don't know.
Maybe you.

2302
01:57:08,670 --> 01:57:12,000
Maybe I'll change.
I think you need to drop.

2303
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:16,280
Just think about it like this post and 
boom,

2304
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,110
walk away,
walk away.

2305
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,620
Go do something else,
man.

2306
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:20,483
You don't need to look at that shit.
You don't need to look at what people 

2307
01:57:22,621 --> 01:57:25,350
are going to say.
Make sure that there's no typos.

2308
01:57:25,351 --> 01:57:26,700
That's always a struggle.
I'm like,

2309
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:27,151
no.
Yeah,

2310
01:57:27,151 --> 01:57:28,110
it is.
Isn't that amazing?

2311
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:28,711
Yeah.
I got fat.

2312
01:57:28,711 --> 01:57:29,411
Thumbs.
Me Too.

2313
01:57:29,411 --> 01:57:30,320
Um,
I,

2314
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:33,000
I care though.
I'm sure you do.

2315
01:57:33,070 --> 01:57:37,950
About what,
how people can think about what I wrote.

2316
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:41,800
If it's a way that I had not considered.
Okay.

2317
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:43,123
I like knowing it.
It makes me a better communicator when 

2318
01:57:45,661 --> 01:57:46,494
I'm in front of an audience.
I'll know what percent will think one 

2319
01:57:48,931 --> 01:57:53,160
way versus another and I can modify what
I'm saying to be more precise and to,

2320
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:54,330
as we say,
in physics,

2321
01:57:54,331 --> 01:57:55,164
to reduce the impedance between the 
signal and the receiver so that there's 

2322
01:57:58,651 --> 01:58:02,310
a better match between the communicator 
and the audience.

2323
01:58:03,030 --> 01:58:03,863
I understand that,
but if you surely have told jokes that 

2324
01:58:06,301 --> 01:58:09,900
people just took the wrong way the right
way,

2325
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:12,350
they just didn't like what I was saying.
Yeah,

2326
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:17,990
but it's surely like you see the word 
cock in a response,

2327
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:20,010
you know that person's an asshole,
right?

2328
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:23,160
There's certain things you just see like
your cook,

2329
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:24,263
like,
okay,

2330
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:26,930
I love to listen to anymore.
Now I know what you are full.

2331
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:28,423
Right?
And you see that like you're stoned all 

2332
01:58:30,231 --> 01:58:34,050
the time staring at the fucking sky 
instead of filling the blank.

2333
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:35,820
Those are just assholes.
Well,

2334
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:38,520
I have pretty thick skin,
so it's not that it upsets me.

2335
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:39,354
It's that I'm here to serve you,
not to piss you off when you're not 

2336
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:44,020
there to serve as an educator.
There's some people,

2337
01:58:44,021 --> 01:58:46,500
I'm an educator there are looking to get
angry.

2338
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:47,883
Maybe I can bring them around,
but you can the arrogance of thinking 

2339
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:54,514
that you could fix 30 plus years of 
worthless shitbag living with a couple 

2340
01:58:58,871 --> 01:59:03,871
of tweets and you know,
something,

2341
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:07,660
I don't even want to take you up on that
challenge because you're probably right.

2342
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:10,390
I'm telling you,
you gotta you gotta walk away.

2343
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:13,390
But for most people,
myself included in those,

2344
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:15,040
most people,
I enjoy those tweets.

2345
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:16,570
So I got one something.
Here's one.

2346
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,433
So I tweeted something and somebody's 
responding to somebody else's tweet 

2347
01:59:20,141 --> 01:59:21,750
said,
um,

2348
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,550
you know,
I don't really like Tyson.

2349
01:59:24,551 --> 01:59:26,380
He's such,
he's so pompous.

2350
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:28,990
Okay.
So,

2351
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:33,190
so I tweeted back to that person and I 
said,

2352
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:36,063
thanks for your note.
Could you please share with me the 

2353
01:59:39,131 --> 01:59:42,970
single most pompous thing you've ever 
seen me do?

2354
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,470
And he wrote back and said,
damn,

2355
01:59:47,471 --> 01:59:52,270
you would have to be reading my tweets.
What you got now you put me on the spot.

2356
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:56,470
I can't think of anything right now,
but overall I really like your work.

2357
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,440
Keep putting nothing forward.
Yeah,

2358
01:59:59,441 --> 02:00:02,040
that happens all the time because people
were just shocked that you respond well.

2359
02:00:02,041 --> 02:00:02,470
Well,
but,

2360
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:03,303
but plus there is people can get into a 
stereotype mode where there's go that 

2361
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:10,020
person is that and therefore everything.
They just decide.

2362
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,280
That's the lead.
Decide they decide.

2363
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,140
Right?
Right.

2364
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:15,550
There,
you can listen to those people.

2365
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:17,440
Too Smart for this.
People said,

2366
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:18,293
look,
the dude wrote a book called it 

2367
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:21,940
astrophysics for people in a hurry.
How pompous is that?

2368
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:23,700
That's not right,
right.

2369
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:28,300
You're a science educator.
I interviewed Onstar talk.

2370
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:31,600
I guess you were one of my guests,
but so too was Katy Perry.

2371
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:33,040
Then you go through.

2372
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,530
People got pissed off because they have 
nothing to add.

2373
02:00:35,531 --> 02:00:38,080
She just popped.
I said she wrote a.

2374
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:38,973
She wrote a song about boning and 
Anglian and I wanted to find out what 

2375
02:00:42,071 --> 02:00:43,210
she was thinking.
Yes.

2376
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,500
This yes.
Her Song,

2377
02:00:45,501 --> 02:00:48,470
she is a line about it,
which you're making love doing it,

2378
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:49,713
so there's always ways you can fuck 
Russell Crowe a few times or what's his 

2379
02:00:52,841 --> 02:00:54,490
name?
Peter's sorry,

2380
02:00:54,491 --> 02:00:56,680
Russell.
I don't yet brand.

2381
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:01,930
What does Russell Peters Russell Recipe.
It is a good friend of mine.

2382
02:01:01,931 --> 02:01:02,320
It's like,
Yo,

2383
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,690
what the fuck?
Sorry Russell.

2384
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:08,200
I don't keep a log.
I just got back from Italy.

2385
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,430
Oh yeah.
I'm very confused.

2386
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,170
I'm my brain's zoning.
A little out of it.

2387
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:15,023
It's just completely out of it.
I'm trying to keep you awake for your 

2388
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:18,073
brand.
Russell.

2389
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,770
She fucked Russell brand.
Say it.

2390
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,220
I didn't know.
I didn't take.

2391
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:23,620
I didn't know any of this.

2392
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:25,630
They were married.
I didn't know this.

2393
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:28,060
So he's like an alien is my point.
It's a very odd duck.

2394
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:28,990
Oh,
I see.

2395
02:01:28,991 --> 02:01:29,710
Yeah,
he's a,

2396
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:31,230
he's a brilliant guy,
but he's,

2397
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:34,520
he's out there and he'd be like one of 
those guys that would be in um,

2398
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:38,670
in men in black aliens that they're 
tracking to,

2399
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:40,640
to remember that scene in the 
headquarters.

2400
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,480
There's a big brides were to cover 
aliens,

2401
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:45,620
aliens,
and they're like,

2402
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:46,454
Michael Jackson was there.
People who just do something a little 

2403
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:50,150
different about them,
you know?

2404
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:51,373
So there's people that really do believe
that the believed that there's aliens 

2405
02:01:54,111 --> 02:01:57,080
amongst us again,
and we learned a free country.

2406
02:01:57,230 --> 02:02:00,160
I'm fine.
But what happens?

2407
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:02,430
Evidence at some point should matter.
But you,

2408
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,273
you find out about like Russian agents 
that have been living in New Jersey for 

2409
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:08,354
like 30 years.
That's the whole premise of the 

2410
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:10,940
Americans,
the Americans.

2411
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:12,740
Yeah.
It's a real story to.

2412
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:16,730
I mean really has happened on multiple 
occasions and so they wonder,

2413
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,230
well,
if the Russians were wanting to do that,

2414
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:21,470
what are the aliens willing to do?
Yeah.

2415
02:02:21,471 --> 02:02:23,240
So just find me one.
Yeah,

2416
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:26,210
maybe there are doing.
Are you open minded to that course?

2417
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:27,360
Oh my gosh.
No.

2418
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:31,430
Who doesn't want to be?
I wish I would love to meet the aliens.

2419
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:34,220
They're going to have technology that we
don't have to compare notes.

2420
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:36,470
I want to.
Oh my gosh.

2421
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,431
Do you,
by the way,

2422
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:42,260
in the movie arrival with the.
Which one?

2423
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:44,900
The arthropod.
All this.

2424
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:45,753
And there's two arrivals.
So there's an earlier rather with 

2425
02:02:46,971 --> 02:02:49,220
Charlie Sheen.
He played an astrophysicist by.

2426
02:02:49,230 --> 02:02:50,720
That's a good one too.
So this one,

2427
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:51,540
uh,
it's,

2428
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,530
you know,
it's like a Septa puss.

2429
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:57,110
Lands freaky things with speaking inc.
Okay.

2430
02:02:57,111 --> 02:02:58,100
Speaking ink.
Right.

2431
02:02:58,310 --> 02:02:59,143
SO,
so they sent the physicist and an 

2432
02:03:02,271 --> 02:03:04,660
anthropologist,
anthropologists a,

2433
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:08,450
a linguist,
and I tweeted,

2434
02:03:08,451 --> 02:03:09,550
I said,
you know,

2435
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:12,180
if aliens come,
I would not send a physicist and link in

2436
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,023
a linguist.

2437
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:14,293
I would Send it up an astrobiologist and
a cryptographer and but then the 

2438
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:27,340
linguists got all upset and they started
piling,

2439
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,680
piling the pile pilot.
She's not a linguist.

2440
02:03:30,681 --> 02:03:32,280
She was a witch.
If it's,

2441
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:35,690
if you're an anthropological linguist or
are they all are.

2442
02:03:35,691 --> 02:03:38,720
But could you just look up the title,
what her profession was?

2443
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:39,790
But anyhow,
so,

2444
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,840
so they all piled on,
piled on.

2445
02:03:41,841 --> 02:03:42,620
But that's,
that's fine.

2446
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:46,130
I will accept because how many linguists
are ever shown in the film.

2447
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:49,970
So this was their time and the sun is a 
big moment so I get it.

2448
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:52,370
That's fine.
But there a couple of things.

2449
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,413
So for example,
there it is making these circles and 

2450
02:03:55,551 --> 02:03:57,950
they're interpreting them but it's 
making them on glass.

2451
02:03:57,951 --> 02:03:59,570
So how do they know?
We weRen't seeing them.

2452
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:01,183
the mirror image of what he was trying 
to communicate that that was not 

2453
02:04:03,621 --> 02:04:04,520
addressed in the film.

2454
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:05,703
But yeah,
I'd want to meet the alienS as they did 

2455
02:04:07,911 --> 02:04:08,744
there.
They bought the military of course that 

2456
02:04:09,501 --> 02:04:10,334
it will be a likely fact,
but because your protection is of 

2457
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:13,933
extreme importance,
but here this happens in all scifi 

2458
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:18,003
movies.
you go up to this thing and you get 

2459
02:04:18,831 --> 02:04:19,664
lifted up against the force of gravity.
At that point I would just put down all 

2460
02:04:22,431 --> 02:04:25,760
my weapons because stuff going on this 
way,

2461
02:04:25,761 --> 02:04:28,370
beyond your understanding of the laws of
physics,

2462
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:29,893
you know,
it's like pulling out your pistol and 

2463
02:04:31,251 --> 02:04:34,830
shooting at the spacecraft.
They crossed half the galaxy to,

2464
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,830
to come to you.
What are you doing?

2465
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:42,000
They are clearly superior to you in ways
that you don't even know yet.

2466
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:43,583
So just find another way to do.
You're talking rather than sending 

2467
02:04:46,261 --> 02:04:47,094
bullets there way.
But isn't that always the case in every 

2468
02:04:49,981 --> 02:04:50,751
film?
I mean,

2469
02:04:50,751 --> 02:04:54,810
it's always part of the narrative is 
that the primitive people fuck it up for

2470
02:04:54,811 --> 02:04:57,440
the advanced civilization that's coming 
here to help us or.

2471
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:58,913
Yeah,
it's never been good for the less 

2472
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:03,150
technologically advanced civilization 
ever,

2473
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:04,380
ever,
ever.

2474
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:06,740
and going on right now.
Currently,

2475
02:05:06,770 --> 02:05:08,100
by the way,
undiscovered tribes.

2476
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,800
Not to sound pluggy,
but this,

2477
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:14,460
one of the profiles here is of captain 
cook.

2478
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:17,050
Uh,
just a quick thing.

2479
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:19,410
I visited Hawaii only a couple of times 
in my life.

2480
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:22,070
One of the times I saw don ho show.
Yeah.

2481
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:24,600
Oh my gosh,
and he was like,

2482
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:28,180
he only sat down.
He was like big and heavy and old and he

2483
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,210
died a couple of decades ago.
But anyhow,

2484
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:31,733
don ho,
he just helps hawaiian stories and one 

2485
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:38,040
of them was about captain cook and pete 
that some.

2486
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:38,871
Someone asks,
well,

2487
02:05:38,871 --> 02:05:41,700
what ever happened to captaIn cook?
You know how he replies?

2488
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:45,570
He says,
nobody's ever seen him.

2489
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:46,523
So people listening,
he's making things like he's picking 

2490
02:05:55,860 --> 02:06:00,240
things out of his team.
Nobody's ever seen captain cook of late.

2491
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:04,380
So it was.
Rumors are that he was eating by pacific

2492
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:06,690
island natives,
but that happened to a lot of pirates.

2493
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,553
So watch what happens.
So the british send captain cook to the 

2494
02:06:10,651 --> 02:06:11,484
south pacific.
Why will you look at his marching 

2495
02:06:14,341 --> 02:06:14,910
orders?
It's,

2496
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:15,743
oh,
there Is what's called a transit of 

2497
02:06:16,771 --> 02:06:20,460
venus that's going to take place visible
only from the south pacific.

2498
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:21,863
This is where earth in our orbit and 
venus's in orbit are such that when 

2499
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:25,973
venus passes between us and the sun,
it actually is exactly between us and 

2500
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:30,630
the sun.
You can watch it,

2501
02:06:30,631 --> 02:06:33,540
move the circle,
move across the sun surface,

2502
02:06:33,541 --> 02:06:36,620
and did they look at it through a device
to device filters?

2503
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,680
We were fine.
okay,

2504
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:38,843
so if you measure that,
you can learn the exact scale of the 

2505
02:06:42,691 --> 02:06:43,524
solar system.
So you learn deep scientific knowledge 

2506
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:48,810
about how far away the planets are and 
how far away the sun is from the earth.

2507
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,230
It was not known with precision before 
that measurement was made.

2508
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,900
So captain could goes on this voyage to 
do this.

2509
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:57,120
Well,
that's a pretty expensive voyage.

2510
02:06:57,810 --> 02:06:58,441
Oh,
I'll wait,

2511
02:06:58,441 --> 02:07:01,110
flip over the marching orders.
Oh,

2512
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:03,000
open the envelope.
Oh,

2513
02:07:03,001 --> 02:07:07,590
while you're there,
use these new navigation techniques that

2514
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:08,424
use the sun,
moon and stars and map every coastline 

2515
02:07:11,521 --> 02:07:15,210
you find and bring that information back
to us.

2516
02:07:16,290 --> 02:07:17,123
Within 10 years of captain cook,
navIgating the south pacific as well as 

2517
02:07:20,671 --> 02:07:24,870
the northern coast of of Australia and 
New Zealand.

2518
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:25,823
Within 10 years,
britain took control over those 

2519
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:31,410
coastlines became part of the british 
empire,

2520
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:36,070
had gemini at its finest on

2521
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,130
the premise that he's observing 
something about the universe,

2522
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:43,000
but there was a tandem role that he 
played.

2523
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:44,283
I did not know they knew that much about
the cycles of the planets that they 

2524
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:49,474
could be there.
They knew accurately they could be part 

2525
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:55,630
of the motivation.
Part of the motivation of knowing any of

2526
02:07:55,631 --> 02:07:59,380
this was navigation around the globe was
navigation.

2527
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,390
How are you going to know where you are 
on earth?

2528
02:08:01,391 --> 02:08:02,224
You can get your latitude.
That's just the altitude or the height 

2529
02:08:04,001 --> 02:08:04,834
of polaris,
the north star above the horizon and 

2530
02:08:06,631 --> 02:08:08,110
measure that at night.
You can wait that long.

2531
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:11,140
Where do you know where you are in 
longitude?

2532
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:13,240
Ships would,
would be shipwrecked.

2533
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:14,523
Millions of dollars worth of commerce 
would be at the bottom of the ocean 

2534
02:08:19,181 --> 02:08:20,980
because they didn't know where coastline
was.

2535
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:23,100
And the only way you can measure 
coastline,

2536
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:27,040
it's if you have good navigational tools
and tactics which involves,

2537
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:28,480
uh,
an accurate chronometer,

2538
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:32,440
a timekeeping device for your pre and 
knowing what the sun,

2539
02:08:32,441 --> 02:08:34,270
moon and stars are doing in your sky.

2540
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:39,960
So the astronomer In that day was 
crucial to the mapping of the earth.

2541
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:43,120
And whose mapping?
Or is it just geologists for fun?

2542
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:43,983
No,
it is nations wielding power over 

2543
02:08:47,951 --> 02:08:51,420
regions beyond the,
beyond their own coastlines.

2544
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:54,040
And that's.
I have a quote here.

2545
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:58,960
That's where this quote comes from.
I got a guy from 17 whenever I got here,

2546
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:01,330
1757,
James Ferguson,

2547
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:04,120
17,
57.

2548
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:08,050
Here's this quote of all the sciences 
cultivated by mankind.

2549
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:13,320
Astronomy is acknowledged to be and 
undoubtedly is the most sublime,

2550
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:14,493
the most interesting and the most useful
for by knowledge derived from this 

2551
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:19,624
science.
Not only the bulk of the earth is 

2552
02:09:22,751 --> 02:09:25,210
discovered,
but are very.

2553
02:09:25,211 --> 02:09:26,044
Faculties are enlarged with the grandeur
of the idea as it conveys our minds 

2554
02:09:30,161 --> 02:09:34,140
exalted above their low contracted 
prejudice.

2555
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:37,030
If I got a drop of a michael now,
here you go,

2556
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,260
boom.
Drop that mic.

2557
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:43,180
so notice he lists mapping the earth 
first,

2558
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:47,260
then he talks about how it exalts and 
our grander.

2559
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,900
So,
uh,

2560
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:52,810
yeah,
it's an exercise in dominance,

2561
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:56,740
in hegemony,
in power under the guise of studying.

2562
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:58,373
Well,
it's not so much,

2563
02:09:58,450 --> 02:10:00,660
it's just they co,
they did it together.

2564
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:04,390
If they matter to one another,
another part of it,

2565
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:05,253
part of it.
And they using a sextant for all this 

2566
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:10,390
sub sexton help.
There's an octet a little earlier.

2567
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,990
Uh,
the and the,

2568
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:16,690
the muslims used an astrolabe okay.
That you'd got,

2569
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:18,850
by the way,
what's the number?

2570
02:10:18,851 --> 02:10:23,851
it's a third or two.
I forgot that the fraction around a half

2571
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,293
of all stars that have names in the 
night sky have arabic names because in 

2572
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:32,650
the golden age of islam a thousand years
ago,

2573
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,040
navigation was

2574
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,710
a big deal.
And they navigated using astrolabes,

2575
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:38,450
which is sort of the,
the,

2576
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:42,770
the islamic counterpart to the sextant 
and the [inaudible] that were used.

2577
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:44,860
What does the rest of europe asked her?
Electrolytes.

2578
02:10:44,861 --> 02:10:45,561
A cordial.
Oh.

2579
02:10:45,561 --> 02:10:46,610
Then they're,
they're works of art.

2580
02:10:46,611 --> 02:10:47,990
They're brass,
they're etched.

2581
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:50,420
There was riding,
I'd sell them.

2582
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:54,110
You can buy replica is what?
You're not going to get original fine.

2583
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:55,070
Astrolabe.
Yeah.

2584
02:10:55,210 --> 02:10:56,420
Yeah.
What that looks like.

2585
02:10:56,450 --> 02:10:57,350
Oh yeah.
So,

2586
02:10:57,650 --> 02:10:58,130
uh,
there's,

2587
02:10:58,130 --> 02:11:00,080
there's a thing that hangs down.
There are different,

2588
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:04,190
a disc that you can replace depending on
where you are on earth to be,

2589
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:08,960
to know where you are more accurately.
So this is all navigation so that it was

2590
02:11:08,961 --> 02:11:13,130
almost like chips for a gps device.
They're gorgeous.

2591
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:15,920
They're completely gorgeous.
Wow.

2592
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:16,993
What the fuck.
And you'd carry them with you on that 

2593
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,640
somewhere you'd go.
Okay.

2594
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:20,570
Aliens have been.
Yeah,

2595
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:21,050
yeah,
exactly.

2596
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:24,660
If you didn't otherwise know your 
history and look at the size of that,

2597
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,890
that's about the size of a um,
a heavyweight,

2598
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:33,200
a champion's buckle.
Buckle belt.

2599
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:34,730
Buckle.
is that thing doing?

2600
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:36,140
So,
yeah,

2601
02:11:36,141 --> 02:11:38,740
it depends on where you are wondering 
when you're saying.

2602
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:41,010
So this is,
we're talking about this was,

2603
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,400
you know,
a thousand years ago said you know,

2604
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:46,310
this 700 years ago,
600 years ago,

2605
02:11:46,311 --> 02:11:50,750
five or the ottoman empire is spreading 
their influence and they've got,

2606
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:53,030
they've got astrolabs.
So this is islam.

2607
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:54,083
You don't even learn about this in 
school because you only hear about the 

2608
02:11:56,091 --> 02:11:57,680
rest of europe,
christian europe.

2609
02:11:58,670 --> 02:12:01,480
So this mess.
Incredible looking device.

2610
02:12:01,481 --> 02:12:03,560
Yes.
and these are dials that turn,

2611
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:04,453
it looks like under a tattoo.
It doesn't even look like there's a 

2612
02:12:08,121 --> 02:12:10,310
rhyme or reason to it with all the 
clause and everything.

2613
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:12,820
It completely looks like art.
It looks like some bizarre.

2614
02:12:12,830 --> 02:12:14,480
Looks like an alien.
Yeah.

2615
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:16,490
So again,
if you're only listening,

2616
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:20,450
just just google astroland astrolabe and
then look at any of them.

2617
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,860
That's a primitive and more primitive 
one.

2618
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:24,660
They're simpler one.
Um,

2619
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,150
and so that's 16.
Oh,

2620
02:12:26,151 --> 02:12:26,660
two.
So.

2621
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:27,493
Oh no.
So that one that has the spirit of an 

2622
02:12:29,361 --> 02:12:31,690
astro lay,
but I don't know that if they would have

2623
02:12:31,691 --> 02:12:35,430
called that an astrolabe the others,
they,

2624
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:39,350
they go way back.
And so the,

2625
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:42,080
the most decorated ones are the ones 
from the middle east.

2626
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:43,723
Anyhow,
the point is gps is no different from 

2627
02:12:49,101 --> 02:12:51,150
the navigation tools in,
in,

2628
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:52,113
in concept,
from the navigation tools that captain 

2629
02:12:54,171 --> 02:12:55,004
cook invoked for britain to then take 
control over all the south pacific that 

2630
02:12:59,751 --> 02:13:01,400
they did.
It is,

2631
02:13:01,401 --> 02:13:06,401
where are we and do we know this 
information with precision and so,

2632
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:08,443
and what happens if an enemy force takes
out our gps and we have so much 

2633
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:15,890
dependent on it,
what are we going to do?

2634
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:20,540
We've got people now worrying about 
working on using navigation by pulse.

2635
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:23,660
Ours can't take those out because those 
are cosmic.

2636
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:25,093
They're sending highly timed pulses that
reach earth in different places on the 

2637
02:13:29,121 --> 02:13:31,980
sky and by measuring you

2638
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,980
can end the time delay between one and 
the other.

2639
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:36,323
You can actually localize yourSelf on 
her surface with extremely high 

2640
02:13:39,121 --> 02:13:41,790
precision and without any use of 
satellites.

2641
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:43,763
That's the future of navigation where 
you were insulated from a rogue nation 

2642
02:13:47,281 --> 02:13:50,300
that might want to take out your 
satellites hole size pulsars.

2643
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,620
And by the way,
the trump space force,

2644
02:13:52,650 --> 02:13:53,483
you know the many,
the whole lot of trump haters out there 

2645
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:57,473
and,
but if you want to hate trump 

2646
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:01,800
rationally,
you want to not hate them no matter what

2647
02:14:01,801 --> 02:14:02,634
he said.
You want to evaluate statement by 

2648
02:14:03,871 --> 02:14:05,250
statement what he says,
right?

2649
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,630
That's what you want to do.
He says,

2650
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:08,130
I want a space for us.
Well,

2651
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:09,660
let's think about that.
Okay?

2652
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:13,410
In the Second world war,
there was the air force,

2653
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:16,890
except they were not their own branch.
they were part of the army.

2654
02:14:16,891 --> 02:14:17,724
It was called the army air force,
and then we realized that command and 

2655
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:20,994
control in the air needs different kinds
of soldiers though because they have to 

2656
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:25,200
be pilots.

2657
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,180
It's a different kind of decision 
making,

2658
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:28,163
different kinds of tactical.
I'm actually actions you would have in 

2659
02:14:31,381 --> 02:14:32,214
the in the theater of operations and so 
it was sensible to spawn off a new 

2660
02:14:36,661 --> 02:14:39,210
branch of the military called the air 
force.

2661
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:41,910
No one today would question whether that
was a good idea.

2662
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:47,880
Today.
You should know that operations in space

2663
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:48,714
in the vacuum of the universe is a 
different regime that you're operating 

2664
02:14:53,671 --> 02:14:56,680
in from moving through the air,
your hardware,

2665
02:14:56,681 --> 02:14:58,120
it looks different.
your,

2666
02:14:58,150 --> 02:15:00,570
your strategies are different.
Your decision,

2667
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:04,980
your command and control is different,
so it's not a credit.

2668
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:05,833
Just because it came out of trump's 
mouth doesn't make it a crazy idea that 

2669
02:15:08,311 --> 02:15:10,500
you might want a space for us.
In fact,

2670
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:11,334
I had proposed the space for us in 2001 
when I was on a commission appointed by 

2671
02:15:16,141 --> 02:15:21,060
george w dot bush to explore the future 
of the United States space.

2672
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:23,460
Aerospace industry.
A commission of 12.

2673
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,980
So I put it on the table.
We have air force generals,

2674
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:26,913
they're former members of congress,
people from lockheed martin and people 

2675
02:15:31,981 --> 02:15:32,640
said,
well,

2676
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:37,640
the air force is currently overseeing 
space United States space command,

2677
02:15:37,891 --> 02:15:39,750
so everybody was happy with it and so 
I'm fine.

2678
02:15:39,751 --> 02:15:40,270
I said,
okay,

2679
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:41,103
let's not worry about it if everybody's,
but as if as long as this needs of our 

2680
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:45,863
presence in space grows,
but more importantly the size of our 

2681
02:15:48,961 --> 02:15:52,080
assets,
as long as that continues to grow,

2682
02:15:52,890 --> 02:15:55,860
what else would the military do beyond 
protecting your borders?

2683
02:15:55,861 --> 02:15:58,200
They would protect your assets and our 
space.

2684
02:15:58,210 --> 02:15:59,043
Assets by day,
day by day are growing by leaps and 

2685
02:16:02,341 --> 02:16:03,174
bounds.
So as not assets meaning like satellite 

2686
02:16:05,441 --> 02:16:07,410
satellite station and the value of 
those.

2687
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:08,273
It's not just the cost of the satellite 
is the value that's at the satellite to 

2688
02:16:10,681 --> 02:16:11,514
you,
right?

2689
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:12,980
The,
uh,

2690
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:13,813
the military is now creating a whole 
other gps system that will be exclusive 

2691
02:16:16,711 --> 02:16:17,544
to them and then they're going to see 
the current gps to an and what have we 

2692
02:16:21,361 --> 02:16:25,320
done with gps?
This hard earned engineering and physics

2693
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:28,560
and orbital mechanics.
What have we done with the gps?

2694
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:32,530
We now use it to find out who you want 
to mate with.

2695
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:34,780
Oh,
someone's in your area.

2696
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:37,960
This is tinder.
This is grinder that says,

2697
02:16:37,961 --> 02:16:42,850
show me mateaBle people within 20 square
blocks of where I am.

2698
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:45,200
that's a gps on grindr.

2699
02:16:48,830 --> 02:16:50,020
I did look up.
The definition of mate,

2700
02:16:50,021 --> 02:16:53,620
mate implies you're making a baby.
Who are you going to have sex with?

2701
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:54,580
Fun.
Yeah.

2702
02:16:55,210 --> 02:16:56,043
Yeah,
so so that has a certain economic value 

2703
02:16:58,961 --> 02:17:01,030
to society and sodas,
uber,

2704
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:02,013
so to all the things that sodas,
ups tracking their trucks so it's not 

2705
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:06,514
the cost of the satellites,
the value of the satellite to our 

2706
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:10,270
economy.
You'd want that protected.

2707
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:12,990
Make sense?
Is there a space for us currently?

2708
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:13,853
Like is it real?
Are they recruited as United States 

2709
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:17,350
space command,
so anybody who was a general,

2710
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:18,213
if we make a space,
they're generals in the air force 

2711
02:17:19,601 --> 02:17:20,434
overseeing space command,
so if you're going to make a space 

2712
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:25,120
force,
you would offload,

2713
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:26,253
you would offload the space activities 
of the air force space command to this 

2714
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:30,663
us space command primarily to the space 
force and then add or subtract from 

2715
02:17:35,531 --> 02:17:35,800
that.

2716
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,600
In whatever way is sensible given the 
neat.

2717
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:38,950
If we have a space for it,
you know what?

2718
02:17:38,951 --> 02:17:41,830
I want to see what I want them to 
protect us from asteroids.

2719
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:44,270
How about that for defense program?
That makes sense.

2720
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,123
Okay.
Do you want the government involved in 

2721
02:17:45,581 --> 02:17:46,414
that?
Shouldn't be someone a little bit more 

2722
02:17:47,081 --> 02:17:48,940
thorough.
It's not how it works.

2723
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:50,273
It's not scientists you,
you just made you made a blanket 

2724
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:56,280
antigovernment decision because you're 
just antigovernment guy.

2725
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:57,280
People say,
okay,

2726
02:17:57,580 --> 02:17:58,413
so I'm private.
Enterprise is not good at doing 

2727
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:08,440
expensive things that have never been 
done before.

2728
02:18:08,550 --> 02:18:09,850
Right?
Need government money?

2729
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:12,030
Government government does it first.
Okay.

2730
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:14,920
Right.
Then you learn where the hostels are,

2731
02:18:14,921 --> 02:18:16,380
where the friendlies are,
where the.

2732
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:18,760
What patent did you need to make this 
happen?

2733
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:22,410
then the venture capitalists meeting 
about whether I'm going to make a bucket

2734
02:18:22,411 --> 02:18:23,950
on it,
has some,

2735
02:18:24,190 --> 02:18:26,020
has some,
some teeth in it.

2736
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:27,400
They say,
how much will this cost?

2737
02:18:27,401 --> 02:18:28,234
Well,
we know because the government did it 

2738
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:31,030
and we think we can do it for half that 
price.

2739
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:32,680
Is it dangerous?
Yes.

2740
02:18:32,681 --> 02:18:34,750
The government did this and they lost 
two people,

2741
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:37,390
but we will put protections in so we 
won't have that risk.

2742
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:38,433
What is the return on the investment?
So the government got no return because 

2743
02:18:40,751 --> 02:18:43,060
they didn't.
That wasn't the objective,

2744
02:18:43,061 --> 02:18:45,460
but here's how we can bring them.
So I'll do it second.

2745
02:18:45,461 --> 02:18:46,330
I want to.
At first,

2746
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:48,940
this is how you get the dutch east India
trading company.

2747
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:50,643
They were not the first europeans to the
new world because where's the edge of 

2748
02:18:53,621 --> 02:18:55,120
the earth?
Will you find India?

2749
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:57,880
will you?
It's what you don't know any of this.

2750
02:18:58,910 --> 02:18:59,920
I'm screaming at you.
Sorry.

2751
02:19:00,070 --> 02:19:00,903
You don't know any of this.
Columbus does it first and he can tell 

2752
02:19:03,101 --> 02:19:04,600
you where there's food and where there's
isn't,

2753
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:06,040
where there isn't and where they want to
kill you.

2754
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:06,873
In where they don't,
then you hand that information to the 

2755
02:19:08,861 --> 02:19:09,694
market,
to the mercantilists and they make a 

2756
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:16,660
book after the fact.
So they come in,

2757
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:17,720
they come in,
yeah,

2758
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:21,880
that's how you do it.
That's how modern airplanes came about.

2759
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,550
People were making planes in their 
garage.

2760
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:26,500
The government said this could be a cool
thing.

2761
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:27,643
Let's pay them and have them compete to 
carry airmail new kind of mail mail 

2762
02:19:33,591 --> 02:19:35,630
delivered by air.
Oh,

2763
02:19:35,631 --> 02:19:38,660
that's cool.
So now I make an airplane because I want

2764
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:39,740
their contract.
You say,

2765
02:19:39,741 --> 02:19:40,880
no,
you want the contract.

2766
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:43,100
You make an airplane.
That ca has more cargo,

2767
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:45,950
a better engine.
You're cleverer now.

2768
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:46,784
You just took the contract from me.
Now I make a bigger airplane because I 

2769
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:50,271
said,
oh,

2770
02:19:50,271 --> 02:19:52,670
I see what he did there,
but now I can improve on that.

2771
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:54,770
No,
wait a minute.

2772
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:55,970
I don't need to carry mail.

2773
02:19:56,870 --> 02:20:01,870
I can carry people.
And thus is born commercial airport,

2774
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:03,853
airplane government basically bankrolled
it as did as did a prize money for 

2775
02:20:10,071 --> 02:20:14,450
accomplishing certain achievements like 
lindbergh.

2776
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:15,613
No one talks about the fact that there 
was cash money available to him for 

2777
02:20:18,441 --> 02:20:23,060
having done a flowing across the 
atlantic solo first cash money.

2778
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:24,170
No.
Yeah,

2779
02:20:24,170 --> 02:20:25,300
I did it for the money.
Yeah.

2780
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:28,160
As most of them did fly the longest,
the highest,

2781
02:20:28,161 --> 02:20:28,994
the fastest.
Each of these had money associated with 

2782
02:20:30,861 --> 02:20:33,770
it.
So this drove the marketplace.

2783
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:34,993
It was not whether you could make a 
product out of it initially because you 

2784
02:20:38,671 --> 02:20:39,504
got to get over the early humps.
You got to get through to get to know 

2785
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:47,680
what it is that works and what doesn't.
So is there a plan with the space for so

2786
02:20:47,681 --> 02:20:51,620
like are they gonna make space weapons 
and space ships.

2787
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:54,800
There's a treaty in 19 sixties to which 
we are signature.

2788
02:20:55,230 --> 02:20:57,470
Okay.
And I talk about intercessory to war.

2789
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:58,790
It's again,
I hate.

2790
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,090
I feel so bad doing this plugin.
No,

2791
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:02,690
I feel so.
Let me hold it.

2792
02:21:02,810 --> 02:21:03,050
No.
Yeah,

2793
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:03,830
you can.
You hold it?

2794
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:05,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2795
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:07,130
I just feel.
But,

2796
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:08,053
but it's,
it's the unspoken alliance between 

2797
02:21:12,290 --> 02:21:15,390
astrophysics and the military.
You look beautiful with that.

2798
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:20,480
Primarily because there is a bow and 
arrow here being shot by sagittarius.

2799
02:21:20,570 --> 02:21:24,810
That became a weapon on a missile at a 
10.

2800
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,090
You're a bone arrow guy.
Oh yeah.

2801
02:21:28,970 --> 02:21:30,270
Last I checked.
Yeah.

2802
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:33,080
You've got to fricking bone our in the 
back room here.

2803
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:35,080
Yes.
What are you afraid of?

2804
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:39,860
Practice when the zombies come either 
run out of bullets.

2805
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:40,873
Tommy som.
I'm pulling that sorta check from 

2806
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:43,490
walking dead.
Oh,

2807
02:21:43,491 --> 02:21:44,540
excuse me.
The best weapon.

2808
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:45,374
Everybody runs out of bullets.
Zombies are slow and her weapon is in 

2809
02:21:47,481 --> 02:21:49,650
fact this.
Totally.

2810
02:21:49,810 --> 02:21:50,643
Yeah.
So what was I saying before I 

2811
02:21:52,851 --> 02:21:57,770
interrupted myself,
a nurse who's who's paying attention out

2812
02:21:57,771 --> 02:21:58,170
there?

2813
02:21:58,170 --> 02:22:01,550
Weapon asteroids,
weaponizing space.

2814
02:22:01,551 --> 02:22:02,384
So there's the outer space treaty,
a treaty for the peaceful uses of outer 

2815
02:22:05,241 --> 02:22:08,990
space and it was in 1967.
There's some modification since then,

2816
02:22:08,991 --> 02:22:09,824
but that's the basic one and we are 
signature to it and so are the other 

2817
02:22:12,471 --> 02:22:13,304
major countries of the world and we just
break out of the paris accord break out 

2818
02:22:16,311 --> 02:22:20,780
of that god damn space pussy shit.
It's a beautiful document.

2819
02:22:20,850 --> 02:22:21,683
It tries to be very forward looking.
If there's an astronaut from another 

2820
02:22:24,501 --> 02:22:25,334
country who is at risk,
then you will go to help them without 

2821
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:30,720
question.
It's very kumbaya.

2822
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:33,330
Okay,
so one of my sort of.

2823
02:22:33,331 --> 02:22:37,050
Now that I'm old and tired and I just am
a realist,

2824
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:38,273
it's why should we promise to not kill 
each other in space when we are not 

2825
02:22:44,671 --> 02:22:48,670
successful at doing that here on earth 
and we don't even promise tonight.

2826
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:51,020
I promise to do it here on her.
Yeah.

2827
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:53,430
Who are we to say,
oh,

2828
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:55,020
well we'll kill each other.
AnyBody in space,

2829
02:22:55,021 --> 02:23:00,021
we'll all hold hands,
but I don't have that much confidence in

2830
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,890
human conduct.
I'm.

2831
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:06,360
I become cynical over my years and I'm 
angry.

2832
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:10,770
Demonstrate to me that on earth you know
how to not kill one another,

2833
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:14,910
then I'll believe your space treaty.
So what I'm saying here now,

2834
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:18,510
given that there is a treaty that says 
you can't put heavy weapons in space,

2835
02:23:18,810 --> 02:23:20,490
as I detail in one of the.
Oh by the way,

2836
02:23:20,491 --> 02:23:25,170
I have a coauthor on this.
I started doing this 12 years ago and it

2837
02:23:25,171 --> 02:23:26,004
was like,
I will never finish this for a thousand 

2838
02:23:27,650 --> 02:23:28,770
years.
I brought in a coauthor office,

2839
02:23:28,771 --> 02:23:29,604
lang who is a longtime editor of my 
essays that I've written for natural 

2840
02:23:33,841 --> 02:23:35,850
history magazine.
Just give a shout out to my coauthor how

2841
02:23:35,851 --> 02:23:36,540
does that work?

2842
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:39,420
So in this case,
sort of takes your stuff and stitches it

2843
02:23:39,421 --> 02:23:41,700
together.
In this particular case,

2844
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:45,440
there are lots of ways we collaborated.
Um,

2845
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:46,523
some of them I just dictated entire 
chapters to her and but leaving out 

2846
02:23:51,181 --> 02:23:56,181
certain details that would require a 
nitty gritty of sort of research just to

2847
02:23:56,371 --> 02:23:59,970
get the right numbers in the right year 
and the commander and the write this,

2848
02:23:59,971 --> 02:24:03,360
but I know broadly how it happened in 
what sequence.

2849
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:06,300
And so then she would take that and 
shape that into a chapter.

2850
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:08,400
Other places I would say,
you know,

2851
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:10,380
this happened,
this happened and that happened.

2852
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:11,453
She would say,
well that wouldn't fit the narrative as 

2853
02:24:13,141 --> 02:24:13,974
it's coming together.
Let's drop the middle one and take the 

2854
02:24:15,631 --> 02:24:16,920
other two.
And I say great.

2855
02:24:16,921 --> 02:24:19,410
So I'd write that up and she would 
stitch it.

2856
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:23,790
She would grafted is a better word into 
the rest of what was going on.

2857
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:24,953
So this is,
even though there are places here where 

2858
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:28,590
I speak in first person,
it's actually,

2859
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:31,260
it's a co written project.
It's not ghost written,

2860
02:24:31,261 --> 02:24:33,420
it's not.
I'm just putting my name,

2861
02:24:33,421 --> 02:24:34,380
but somebody else wrote.
I mean,

2862
02:24:34,390 --> 02:24:35,041
I,
I write,

2863
02:24:35,041 --> 02:24:37,620
I know how to write.
So we're co authors on this,

2864
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:39,030
but thanks for asking.
That was good.

2865
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:40,710
Um,
so,

2866
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:44,100
uh,
so here's a problem that we detail here.

2867
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:47,100
People say I don't want weapons in 
space.

2868
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:48,893
Okay?
There's nothing more useless than a 

2869
02:24:50,491 --> 02:24:53,250
space weapon relative to earth's 
surface.

2870
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:54,870
Okay?
If you're in space,

2871
02:24:54,871 --> 02:24:56,370
you're in orbit.
The think it through.

2872
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,240
If I use your skull here,
that's okay.

2873
02:24:58,270 --> 02:24:59,460
Cool.
Okay.

2874
02:24:59,510 --> 02:25:00,800
If this is earth,
okay?

2875
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:04,620
Everything more spherical here.
I guess not.

2876
02:25:04,621 --> 02:25:05,770
I'm using your skull.
So.

2877
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:07,290
Okay.
Alright.

2878
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:08,920
So this is earth.
Okay.

2879
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:13,110
And I've got a satellite in orbit around
the earth and I say,

2880
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:15,060
okay,
I'm going to weaponize the satellite,

2881
02:25:15,061 --> 02:25:17,280
put a bomb in it,
and I want to drop over some city.

2882
02:25:17,281 --> 02:25:18,114
Some,
some bad person wants to make that 

2883
02:25:19,651 --> 02:25:20,480
decision.
Right?

2884
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:21,660
Well what's the city when it.
Well,

2885
02:25:21,661 --> 02:25:24,070
it's up here somewhere.
So you to it halfway there.

2886
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,933
So you gotta well no,
it's not just that these are not very 

2887
02:25:27,851 --> 02:25:28,684
high above the planet and so you have to
like change the orbit to align it so 

2888
02:25:32,531 --> 02:25:35,590
that it goes over your target 
satellites.

2889
02:25:35,610 --> 02:25:36,443
Don't go over every spot on earth.
The only go over the orbit that had 

2890
02:25:39,281 --> 02:25:40,950
print preset for it.
Okay,

2891
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:43,113
we can already destroy a city with an 
intercontinental ballistic missile and 

2892
02:25:46,511 --> 02:25:47,410
we can aim that.

2893
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:50,830
We can aim a miSsile to any place on 
earth.

2894
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:51,843
it'll get there in less than 45 minutes 
and destroy the whole city with nuclear 

2895
02:25:57,191 --> 02:25:59,050
weapons.
We can already do that.

2896
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:03,370
There is no advantage to putting nixon 
space if that's your objective.

2897
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:08,380
Not only that supposedly is a rogue 
satellite and it's messing with you.

2898
02:26:08,381 --> 02:26:11,590
It's beaming energy particles at you and
you want to take it out.

2899
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,110
how are you going to take it out?
You're going to destroy it.

2900
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:16,720
Oh,
now you break it into a million pieces,

2901
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:20,170
a thousand pieces.
Now each piece is moving 18,000

2902
02:26:20,171 --> 02:26:22,930
miles an hour and put your own 
satellites at risk.

2903
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:26,500
That's the modern equivalent to in the 
first world war when they said,

2904
02:26:26,530 --> 02:26:27,363
oh,
we have a good idea because we can't 

2905
02:26:28,481 --> 02:26:30,100
shoot them in the,
in the trenches,

2906
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:33,010
let's get them out.
So they have the mustard gas.

2907
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:36,310
Oops,
the wind changed directions and all of a

2908
02:26:36,311 --> 02:26:41,170
sudden you become a victim of your own 
weapon such as what happened in space.

2909
02:26:41,290 --> 02:26:44,530
If you go in and start exploding 
satellites out of orbit.

2910
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:50,520
So war in space is a differenT thing.
It's not what you think it would be.

2911
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:55,510
What would they do?
So the outer peaceful use of outer space

2912
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:59,890
treaty allows you to have defensive pr 
things in space,

2913
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:03,010
not offensive for defensive purposes.
It allows that.

2914
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,340
So treaty aside though,
yeah,

2915
02:27:05,370 --> 02:27:06,310
what?
What could you do?

2916
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:07,420
Could you.
I mean,

2917
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:10,510
could you have a rogue state?
Could take out our gps satellites.

2918
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:11,373
Okay,
but when render the military blind and 

2919
02:27:12,671 --> 02:27:14,050
then you won't be able to pick up your 
uber.

2920
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:15,790
He won't have anyone to have sex with 
tonight.

2921
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,640
That's the range of stuff that gps 
applies to.

2922
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:21,280
Right?
And so it'll affect our economy,

2923
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:22,133
it'll affect our security.
And then our navy can't talk to the air 

2924
02:27:24,911 --> 02:27:27,040
force,
the air force can't talk to her and that

2925
02:27:27,041 --> 02:27:27,874
would Be bad.

2926
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:30,133
Armies up wars are no longer fought just
by how many soldiers have you lined up 

2927
02:27:33,611 --> 02:27:38,611
at the at the border.
It's what have you done strategically to

2928
02:27:38,801 --> 02:27:43,801
render your opponent a to just to render
it,

2929
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:48,880
to weaken your opponent or render them 
incapable of fighting you.

2930
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:54,030
This is why the attacks on September 
11th worked because we had a policy that

2931
02:27:54,341 --> 02:27:58,450
if someone wants to hijack a plane,
you follow their instructions.

2932
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:00,093
You do not deny them their requests 
because the assumption was that if you 

2933
02:28:05,231 --> 02:28:06,064
deny the request,
they will start harming people and if 

2934
02:28:08,291 --> 02:28:11,620
you follow the requests,
it will delay when they harm them.

2935
02:28:11,650 --> 02:28:14,470
If they harm them at all and maybe 
everyone will end up Safe.

2936
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:19,030
It was not in the game plan that they 
would crash the plane on purpose.

2937
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:22,610
Okay,
so September 12th,

2938
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:26,540
you will never again be able to do that 
to the american plane.

2939
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:29,990
Forget the extra x rays that we're 
doing.

2940
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:33,080
A pilot will never relinquish the 
cockpit ever again,

2941
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:37,070
no matter who they're torturing in the 
back of the back of the plane,

2942
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:38,503
no matter what they're doing,
even if it's shooting people one by one 

2943
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:42,650
because the plane going down takes 
everybody out.

2944
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:48,610
So that was a pretty easy door to close 
literally and figuratively,

2945
02:28:50,390 --> 02:28:51,223
but no one saw it coming.
You know what drives me crazy when they 

2946
02:28:54,351 --> 02:28:55,184
put that drink cart [inaudible] the 
hallway to protect the pilot when they 

2947
02:28:59,271 --> 02:29:00,500
opened,
I asked him about that.

2948
02:29:00,501 --> 02:29:01,334
So it's just to delay you a fraction of 
a second to give them a chance to go in 

2949
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:07,170
and lock the door.
Right.

2950
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:07,910
It's,
it's,

2951
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:10,580
you have to get through them and the 
flight attendant,

2952
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:14,000
that takes an extra second.
You can't just run in.

2953
02:29:14,001 --> 02:29:17,180
Plus they don't even allow you to stand 
in the aisle while that's happening.

2954
02:29:17,210 --> 02:29:18,650
They'll tell you to sit down.
You sit down.

2955
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:19,250
Correct.
Yeah.

2956
02:29:19,250 --> 02:29:20,083
So you have to get out of your thing,
charged the cart and get through the 

2957
02:29:24,681 --> 02:29:25,514
cart and the flight attendant who will 
be fighting for their life at this 

2958
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:28,880
point.
Okay.

2959
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:32,510
And because the plane is everything,
right?

2960
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:34,790
Yeah,
I've seen that opening.

2961
02:29:34,791 --> 02:29:35,990
No,
you can get through there.

2962
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:39,880
Those ladies ain't gonna.
Stop man.

2963
02:29:40,970 --> 02:29:43,470
Nobody.
Who really is physically.

2964
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:45,530
Joe rogan has already thought this 
through.

2965
02:29:45,870 --> 02:29:50,090
Another thing that my mind does,
the point is you can,

2966
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:52,000
I would never do it.
Of course you don't.

2967
02:29:52,001 --> 02:29:52,430
I,
I,

2968
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:53,263
I thought about that,
but I thought to myself the plane that 

2969
02:29:55,551 --> 02:29:58,040
way because I was like,
I witnessed a September 11th for blocks,

2970
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:02,070
six blocks away from a six walking 
blocks for digital.

2971
02:30:03,150 --> 02:30:05,150
No,
because that was my view is blocked from

2972
02:30:05,151 --> 02:30:06,440
the south.
So,

2973
02:30:06,441 --> 02:30:09,440
but I have a camcorder,
footage of the explosion,

2974
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:11,970
big explosion I've ever seen.
Um,

2975
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:15,350
and by the way,
one thing I noticed is that there was no

2976
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:16,253
shockwave.
I might've been the closest to 

2977
02:30:17,941 --> 02:30:21,260
scientists to the event.
So I was,

2978
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,273
all I could do was apply every bit of 
physics that I know there was no 

2979
02:30:24,490 --> 02:30:25,730
shockwave.
I said,

2980
02:30:25,731 --> 02:30:26,564
well,
how can we have an explosion in no 

2981
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:27,953
shockwave?

2982
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:31,820
And I later learned if you had to kind 
of make a deflagration wave,

2983
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,880
if you atomize fuel and then you spark 
it,

2984
02:30:35,390 --> 02:30:38,510
then the flame moves across the fuel.
It's not a,

2985
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:39,583
it's not a shock wave,
it's just a deflagration wave and 

2986
02:30:41,391 --> 02:30:45,800
therefore there's no shockwave and so 
windows are not blown out a quarter mile

2987
02:30:45,801 --> 02:30:46,634
away as they were in Oklahoma city with 
the giant bombed with him today to 

2988
02:30:51,030 --> 02:30:53,090
timothy mcveigh.
A read.

2989
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:55,190
Why am I bringing this up?
Um,

2990
02:30:57,170 --> 02:30:59,330
what was I talking about?
September 11th,

2991
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:01,330
the plane.
Oh,

2992
02:31:01,330 --> 02:31:02,390
uh,
oh yeah.

2993
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:03,313
So here's something I calculated.
I said if I was in a seven 67 and we're 

2994
02:31:06,051 --> 02:31:11,051
about to crash into a building.
If I was in the last row of the plane,

2995
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:18,430
how much time would elapse before the 
front row crumbled

2996
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:23,160
and it met me in the back row

2997
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:27,460
given the speed of the plane going into 
the building.

2998
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:29,440
Five hundred miles an hour.
Well,

2999
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:31,180
that's probably slower than that by 
then.

3000
02:31:31,181 --> 02:31:32,014
I would say closer to 400.
I mean it's a known speed and I don't 

3001
02:31:34,511 --> 02:31:35,344
know it,
but I don't think it was is because you 

3002
02:31:36,041 --> 02:31:40,140
can't turn at that highest speed and it 
had to like turn around and an ame,

3003
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:44,200
I have to say it's about a second less 
half a fraction of a second.

3004
02:31:44,810 --> 02:31:46,810
It's a fraction.
So the question is tiny,

3005
02:31:46,890 --> 02:31:47,723
how long does it take a plane to go its 
own length when it's going at 400 miles 

3006
02:31:52,091 --> 02:31:53,570
an hour.
That's the thing.

3007
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:54,080
Second.
Yeah.

3008
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:56,200
It's a fraction of that.
So it's like that's it.

3009
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:57,063
You can't even process that.
So I figured the deaths were pretty 

3010
02:32:00,371 --> 02:32:01,270
quick.
Wow.

3011
02:32:01,970 --> 02:32:03,370
Yeah.
It's basically instantaneous.

3012
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:05,560
You are.
You are pulverized.

3013
02:32:06,530 --> 02:32:11,530
A pile of goo.
I think they're planning on making space

3014
02:32:11,701 --> 02:32:13,870
ships that can shoot down another space.

3015
02:32:13,870 --> 02:32:15,340
Ships.
So here.

3016
02:32:15,341 --> 02:32:17,860
So any space wars would not be war 
between space and earth.

3017
02:32:17,890 --> 02:32:22,090
It would be between stuff in space that 
that's all stuff in space,

3018
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:23,170
space,
space,

3019
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:24,990
space,
space to space.

3020
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:26,733
Here's another question.
What are you gonna do with all that 

3021
02:32:27,791 --> 02:32:29,440
stuff that's just floating around up 
there?

3022
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:30,693
The debris.
HoW about another task of a space for 

3023
02:32:32,721 --> 02:32:33,554
it?
So why don't you clean up space for it 

3024
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:35,253
so that we can have tourism and not risk
our lives by a paint chip or going 

3025
02:32:39,850 --> 02:32:44,850
18,000
or bolt or a nut moving at 18,000

3026
02:32:45,911 --> 02:32:47,710
miles an hour.
That'll put a hole straight through you.

3027
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:50,410
Right?
So yeah,

3028
02:32:50,411 --> 02:32:52,870
I would like to see the portfolio of a 
space force,

3029
02:32:52,930 --> 02:32:53,763
if there is a space for us,
broadened the scope of that to include 

3030
02:32:57,820 --> 02:32:58,653
protecting us from asteroids and 
figuring out a way to clean up the 

3031
02:33:01,781 --> 02:33:04,000
debris of space.
Is there a concept in place?

3032
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:06,920
No,
no,

3033
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:08,300
no.
Boy,

3034
02:33:08,301 --> 02:33:11,300
when you look at that map,
and I know the map is not the scale,

3035
02:33:11,301 --> 02:33:14,030
but it shows you the known satellites in
space.

3036
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:15,163
Oh,
well There it's to scale in the sense 

3037
02:33:16,491 --> 02:33:18,590
that they're there.
There's that many,

3038
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,330
many options.
Does this relative distance too,

3039
02:33:22,570 --> 02:33:23,403
but they have a lot.
You can see their orbital line so it 

3040
02:33:24,891 --> 02:33:27,800
feels crowded,
but it's so crazy when you look at it,

3041
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:28,663
it's just like,
like it's just littered and we're 

3042
02:33:30,921 --> 02:33:33,230
continuing to launch new things up there
and I joke,

3043
02:33:33,231 --> 02:33:36,080
I say one of the reasons why we've never
been visited by aliens.

3044
02:33:36,590 --> 02:33:39,530
It's because they came to her.
What is all that junk?

3045
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:40,393
What?
Oh crap.

3046
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:42,800
We're not risking our love.
Let's go to another planet.

3047
02:33:43,220 --> 02:33:46,040
They didn't know the map of where 
everything was and they had to calculate

3048
02:33:46,041 --> 02:33:47,150
their income.
Forget it.

3049
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:48,650
They'll just take it off.
It's not worth it.

3050
02:33:48,670 --> 02:33:49,430
Yeah.
I mean,

3051
02:33:49,430 --> 02:33:50,263
when you're on your way in,
you have to think about it going around 

3052
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:56,060
and visiting another planet that had a 
civilization and they left a lot of crap

3053
02:33:56,061 --> 02:33:56,990
in their atmosphere.

3054
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:00,200
Well,
those,

3055
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:01,280
that's not the debris.
That's.

3056
02:34:01,281 --> 02:34:03,080
Those are the satellites.
So,

3057
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:05,630
uh,
if you thought that is debris.

3058
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:06,290
No,
you got it.

3059
02:34:06,290 --> 02:34:07,790
So,
so the,

3060
02:34:07,791 --> 02:34:09,800
the air force tracks debris as does 
nasa.

3061
02:34:10,490 --> 02:34:15,490
They both tracked debris and sometimes 
launch windows of a spacecraft.

3062
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:20,260
Pieces of shit that's floating around.
That's crazy.

3063
02:34:20,261 --> 02:34:22,840
You scrolling through all that fast as I
can.

3064
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:28,690
That is so nuts were so crazy.
We've only been doing this for 60 years.

3065
02:34:28,850 --> 02:34:32,230
So you track it right?
What was the last first satellite for,

3066
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:33,730
for shallow sputnik.
Excuse me?

3067
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:37,770
What year was too far away from you slap
you?

3068
02:34:37,890 --> 02:34:38,880
Oh,
sorry.

3069
02:34:40,170 --> 02:34:41,740
Was it sputnik?
October fourth,

3070
02:34:41,741 --> 02:34:43,240
1957.
Fifty seven.

3071
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:46,750
The first artificial.
Anything in orbit around the earth.

3072
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:48,480
And on that day too,
it's still up there.

3073
02:34:48,481 --> 02:34:51,790
There was only one thing,
one thing only then only.

3074
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:55,000
Wow.
From 57 to 2018.

3075
02:34:55,370 --> 02:34:56,890
So at 60 years.
Wow.

3076
02:34:57,100 --> 02:35:00,250
One thing that's crazy,
and now how many things?

3077
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:03,290
Well,
there's getting the countless debris.

3078
02:35:03,291 --> 02:35:04,124
There's hundreds of active satellites.
There's thousands if you include the 

3079
02:35:06,731 --> 02:35:07,564
dead ones and thousands of.
So we have no way to clean it up or 

3080
02:35:12,030 --> 02:35:14,110
maybe some big vacuum one day,
I don't know.

3081
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:16,240
But yeah,
space vacuum.

3082
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,393
They'd have to be valuable.
You could probably sell space debrIs if 

3083
02:35:21,791 --> 02:35:23,320
you brought it back to earth.
Yeah.

3084
02:35:23,321 --> 02:35:24,550
People are dumb.
They'd buy it.

3085
02:35:26,090 --> 02:35:27,700
wants the space to put your house on the
hill.

3086
02:35:27,701 --> 02:35:30,070
Yeah,
I won't put this over here.

3087
02:35:30,071 --> 02:35:32,140
Speaking of debris,
speaking of debris,

3088
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:33,463
uh,
there was this asteroid that collided 

3089
02:35:35,771 --> 02:35:37,180
with earth,
uh,

3090
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:41,740
over a chai being in the soviet union in
Russia,

3091
02:35:41,741 --> 02:35:44,290
sorry,
just near the siberia.

3092
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:48,430
In the ural mountains just on the coast 
of siberia than the border of siberia.

3093
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,080
That was visible to everybody in broad 
daylight.

3094
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:53,943
And you had to avert your eyes when it 
happened and they felt a shock wave and 

3095
02:35:56,591 --> 02:36:00,580
the shockwave broke windows and sent 600
people.

3096
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:02,230
Nearly a thousand people to the 
hospital.

3097
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:04,780
What happened?
Well,

3098
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:07,310
because they saw the light and they 
came.

3099
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:10,540
They got up from their table and went to
the window to see what had happened.

3100
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:12,453
There's a time delay between the 
shockwave and the light because light 

3101
02:36:15,941 --> 02:36:16,774
travels fast and sound travels slow,
so we'll go to the windows in the shock 

3102
02:36:19,871 --> 02:36:22,720
wave hits and it blasts broken glass 
into their face,

3103
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:24,003
so it's a big bandaid collision that we 
had people all needed basically 

3104
02:36:29,291 --> 02:36:30,101
bandaids.
Okay.

3105
02:36:30,101 --> 02:36:30,934
No one died,
but nearly a thousand people were 

3106
02:36:32,771 --> 02:36:35,320
injured,
so at an auction,

3107
02:36:36,220 --> 02:36:41,220
but that actually exploded and pieces of
it were recovered at an auction.

3108
02:36:41,681 --> 02:36:43,810
I purchased a piece of that media.
Right,

3109
02:36:43,990 --> 02:36:44,823
but you're also purchased some of the 
shards of glass that the shock wave had 

3110
02:36:49,931 --> 02:36:50,764
broken.

3111
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:52,750
What do you do with this shit?
I've got it.

3112
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:54,020
It's just a habit.
I'm a.

3113
02:36:54,040 --> 02:36:57,370
I'm a part of.
It is a shot across our bow.

3114
02:36:58,420 --> 02:37:01,510
That's what that one died,
but it's a warning.

3115
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:02,373
There's no better way to be warned then 
to have a bandaid cover your injuries 

3116
02:37:06,971 --> 02:37:10,930
that could have vaporized you or 
rendered your species extinct.

3117
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,943
What's crazy is the ones that don't even
make impact and still do devastating 

3118
02:37:14,381 --> 02:37:15,214
damage.
Yes.

3119
02:37:15,570 --> 02:37:16,580
Yes.
That didn't,

3120
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:18,160
that one didn't touch earth.
Right,

3121
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:19,940
right.
It incinerated 10,000

3122
02:37:19,941 --> 02:37:22,430
square kilometers of forest.
We'll get that honk.

3123
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:24,440
Holy shit.
Yeah.

3124
02:37:24,441 --> 02:37:26,360
So February 15th,
2013.

3125
02:37:26,361 --> 02:37:29,260
And uh,
there was a haze over a half.

3126
02:37:29,261 --> 02:37:31,910
A ton of little rock was a thousand 
pounds.

3127
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:32,843
Oh yeah.
That's just a piece that made it 

3128
02:37:34,311 --> 02:37:35,144
through.
Is it iron or the actual piece would 

3129
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:41,990
have been a about the size of this room.
So a small home.

3130
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:43,070
wow.
So,

3131
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:44,300
but yeah,
that's amazing that,

3132
02:37:44,301 --> 02:37:46,220
that small rug.
Go back up to that again.

3133
02:37:46,221 --> 02:37:48,190
Please look at the size of that.
That's not that.

3134
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:48,591
No,
no.

3135
02:37:48,591 --> 02:37:52,910
That's what's left over.
Most of it is a vaporized on that,

3136
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:54,880
on the explosion as it came through the 
atmosphere.

3137
02:37:54,881 --> 02:37:56,750
Right.
But they're saying that that piece of it

3138
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:57,703
weighs a thousand pounds a.
Do they give it the weight of it over a 

3139
02:38:02,001 --> 02:38:03,030
half ton?
Yeah.

3140
02:38:03,230 --> 02:38:03,680
Oh,
we have to.

3141
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:04,513
Yeah.
Thousand pounds.

3142
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:07,760
That's crazy that,
that rock is that fucking have.

3143
02:38:07,770 --> 02:38:08,540
Yes.
So,

3144
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:09,373
so yes.
Well I have to read that to know for 

3145
02:38:12,531 --> 02:38:14,360
sure,
but I think it was an iron meteorite.

3146
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:15,283
I'll tell you something.
I have a knife that was made out of a 

3147
02:38:18,471 --> 02:38:20,390
piece of media or as do I though the 
beautiful.

3148
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:22,400
Oh yeah,
that's a kitchen knife that I use.

3149
02:38:22,490 --> 02:38:23,840
Oh,
see how mine is like a.

3150
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:28,170
It's like a crocodile dundee knife.
That's not a knife.

3151
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:30,950
That's a knife,
but it's waiting.

3152
02:38:30,970 --> 02:38:33,770
I want to make a or get someone to make 
a handle for it.

3153
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:34,633
It's just the.
It's just a metal that would be within 

3154
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:40,610
kitchens for.
It's a forged metal with the blade,

3155
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:43,790
but then you get a pearl handle attached
to the base of.

3156
02:38:43,791 --> 02:38:44,624
Oh yeah.
So it's going to handle this an it's an 

3157
02:38:48,021 --> 02:38:53,021
unadorned piece of metal that would 
become a know the knife sharpening.

3158
02:38:56,930 --> 02:38:58,340
oh yeah.
Where's the fucking handle?

3159
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:02,270
there is a metal hand.
Have you ever seen a kitchen?

3160
02:39:02,271 --> 02:39:03,104
Knives?
The metal goes all the way down in down 

3161
02:39:05,090 --> 02:39:08,360
the center of the handle and you'll 
screw wooden handles on the side.

3162
02:39:08,361 --> 02:39:09,194
So you just need the.
And I just need the wood or the or the 

3163
02:39:11,590 --> 02:39:13,070
patent.
It would be pearl,

3164
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:15,110
you know?
Yeah,

3165
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:18,010
yeah.
I got handed revolver,

3166
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:19,653
pearl,
pistol,

3167
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:21,140
you know,
so.

3168
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:22,313
So yeah,
it's a part of history and it's a 

3169
02:39:24,291 --> 02:39:29,291
reminder that if you want to think about
the future of civilization,

3170
02:39:29,330 --> 02:39:32,410
you have to include a defense plan 
against asteroids,

3171
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:34,640
the dinosaurs,
dinosaurs.

3172
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:36,073
I bet if they could,
they would have had a space program to 

3173
02:39:39,411 --> 02:39:41,000
not go extinct.
No shit.

3174
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:43,253
Thinking now,
is there anything that we're doing now 

3175
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:50,810
other than occasionally looking up?
Yeah.

3176
02:39:50,811 --> 02:39:53,480
We're looking with monitoring and 
cataloging them.

3177
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:55,130
Yeah,
but we don't really know what to do.

3178
02:39:55,140 --> 02:39:56,630
if it happened,
the day would come,

3179
02:39:56,660 --> 02:39:57,411
well,
we know what to do.

3180
02:39:57,411 --> 02:39:59,480
There's nothing funded.
We have their engineering conferences.

3181
02:39:59,481 --> 02:40:03,690
How would you deflect an asteroid?
How would you destroy us to see one in a

3182
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:08,240
one way and commit 100 percent?
Just kiss your ass goodbye.

3183
02:40:08,350 --> 02:40:09,290
that's it.
We would.

3184
02:40:09,360 --> 02:40:10,193
We would have the power to tell you when
you would die and what part of earthy 

3185
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:12,840
would hit.

3186
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:13,673
So there's people that have very 
delusional ideas about what we can and 

3187
02:40:16,081 --> 02:40:18,030
can't do with asteroids and that drives 
me crazy.

3188
02:40:18,460 --> 02:40:19,293
No,
it's not that we know how to defeat the 

3189
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:22,320
scene.
The engineering plans,

3190
02:40:22,321 --> 02:40:23,850
they look very good,
but there's nothing in place,

3191
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:25,920
right?
Because there's project sentinel you can

3192
02:40:25,921 --> 02:40:27,180
look it up,
that is,

3193
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:28,103
has tasked themselves with organizing 
world governments to protect earth from 

3194
02:40:31,801 --> 02:40:32,634
species killing asteroids and you need 
the world because you don't know in 

3195
02:40:35,821 --> 02:40:36,654
advance until it's discovered what part 
of earth it's going to hit and if it's 

3196
02:40:39,691 --> 02:40:43,650
going to hit in the indian ocean and if 
indian,

3197
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:44,760
if,
if,

3198
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:45,643
um,
the surrounding regions don't have a 

3199
02:40:47,551 --> 02:40:48,384
space program or are there countries 
that do have a space program going to 

3200
02:40:51,661 --> 02:40:52,494
sit idle?
Know what you want to do iS you want to 

3201
02:40:54,661 --> 02:40:59,661
have a fund and every country pipes in a
little bit of their gdp and then or,

3202
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:02,020
or whatever,
uh,

3203
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:04,830
you know,
you measure it however you want.

3204
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:06,810
Whatever you think is fair,
do it the way,

3205
02:41:07,090 --> 02:41:08,700
uh,
the way,

3206
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:10,440
uh,
the un does it.

3207
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:13,440
OkaY.
So there's attacks of the world relative

3208
02:41:13,441 --> 02:41:14,274
to your wealth.
And then that money pays to save the 

3209
02:41:16,111 --> 02:41:16,944
world when we find such an asteroid that
that's how you at the sentinel project 

3210
02:41:20,281 --> 02:41:22,230
sentinel is,
is,

3211
02:41:22,310 --> 02:41:23,670
uh,
has thought this through.

3212
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:27,300
So if they're engineers and scientist,
ample time,

3213
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:28,433
there's possibility,
there's a possibility that they could 

3214
02:41:30,061 --> 02:41:32,700
actually implement some of these plans.
it's all about how much time you have,

3215
02:41:32,730 --> 02:41:35,840
because what you want to do is go out 
and nudge it a little bit,

3216
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,073
a little bit.
you just have to give it a sideways 

3217
02:41:39,210 --> 02:41:42,420
velocity relative to its path towards 
earth.

3218
02:41:42,490 --> 02:41:43,323
If you do that early enough,
the sideways velocity sort of 

3219
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:52,110
accumulates like a ship turning slightly
over the ocean of the course of time.

3220
02:41:52,111 --> 02:41:53,580
It'll deviate quite a bit.

3221
02:41:53,610 --> 02:41:56,010
Correct.
So that angle grows.

3222
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:58,410
It's the same angle,
but it spreads out.

3223
02:41:58,610 --> 02:42:01,770
And if the ocean example is perfect,
there's a perfect analogy.

3224
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:05,040
So if you do that early enough,
you do it enough so that it misses earth

3225
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:07,290
and it's still out there to harm you in 
another day,

3226
02:42:07,291 --> 02:42:09,570
but it won't render you extinct on that 
passage.

3227
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:13,530
How much time do we need today?
Uh,

3228
02:42:13,531 --> 02:42:17,910
if I would say we could probably get 
something built in 10 years.

3229
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:23,150
Oh geez.
What I'm looking for a month.

3230
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:26,130
And that's.
Oh no.

3231
02:42:26,131 --> 02:42:27,870
Oh my gosh.
So a year.

3232
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:28,793
If we have a year,
the good thing about species killing 

3233
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:33,840
asteroids is that they're large and 
visible.

3234
02:42:34,390 --> 02:42:37,040
WhAt about city killing?
Ones them slip through.

3235
02:42:37,130 --> 02:42:41,040
They'll slip through,
but most of earth's surfaces,

3236
02:42:41,041 --> 02:42:45,170
not city,
so it'll probably hit the ocean or land,

3237
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:46,050
but yeah,
If it does,

3238
02:42:46,051 --> 02:42:46,890
it would take out a city.

3239
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:49,340
The whole city gone.
Yeah.

3240
02:42:50,150 --> 02:42:53,220
Yeah.
There's a branch of government part of,

3241
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:55,290
I don't know if it survived the trump 
changeover,

3242
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:56,243
but it's a,
it's part of a homeland security were 

3243
02:43:00,030 --> 02:43:05,030
worries about devastation to a region 
where the grid is taken out as well.

3244
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:12,040
So you can't bring emergency services 
that bring either food,

3245
02:43:12,041 --> 02:43:13,990
water,
medicines,

3246
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:15,293
uh,
any other form of transportation or 

3247
02:43:16,391 --> 02:43:17,224
communication.
How much thought is there to putting in 

3248
02:43:18,881 --> 02:43:22,060
a more robust grid?
Uh,

3249
02:43:22,370 --> 02:43:24,220
I,
yeah,

3250
02:43:24,221 --> 02:43:26,230
what you would need is,
that's a good point.

3251
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:27,213
So you need a grid that can sort of,
a rewire itself rapidly to then bring 

3252
02:43:33,011 --> 02:43:36,430
power to a region that's what you would 
need.

3253
02:43:36,460 --> 02:43:39,550
And it would ditch sorta doing that now 
making a grid,

3254
02:43:39,610 --> 02:43:43,010
sort of a lightening proof,
you know,

3255
02:43:43,140 --> 02:43:43,973
a power surge proof.
I grew up in New York city where there 

3256
02:43:47,081 --> 02:43:50,380
were a couple of very famous blackouts 
when in 1966 and other in.

3257
02:43:50,530 --> 02:43:52,630
When was it?
Nineteen 78 I think.

3258
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:55,450
And uh,
it was like,

3259
02:43:55,451 --> 02:43:57,730
whoa,
how should this,

3260
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:01,390
how is this even allowed?
You don't have a backup plan.

3261
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:02,283
Yeah.
You have a way to rewire this to 

3262
02:44:03,281 --> 02:44:07,210
redirect the electricity.
So yeah,

3263
02:44:07,570 --> 02:44:08,403
you'd need that and you'd want that.
And I thought the new grid is supposed 

3264
02:44:11,381 --> 02:44:13,210
to have those kinds of protections built
into it,

3265
02:44:13,330 --> 02:44:14,980
but I don't know enough about it to 
comment.

3266
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:19,570
It is one,
one impact.

3267
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,080
Oh yeah.
One big one takes out the grid.

3268
02:44:23,170 --> 02:44:26,020
It takes out the grid.
And then what do you have?

3269
02:44:26,021 --> 02:44:27,870
Solar power you place?
Uh,

3270
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:30,940
we just put in solar panels.
Yeah.

3271
02:44:31,610 --> 02:44:35,260
You live in a place that's obviously we 
have a place in the country escape to.

3272
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:36,183
Yeah.
It's a good move to have that escape 

3273
02:44:37,241 --> 02:44:38,074
spot.
Yeah.

3274
02:44:38,110 --> 02:44:41,050
You have a place in upstate New York on 
long island?

3275
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:41,913
Yeah.
I used to think of it as an escape 

3276
02:44:42,821 --> 02:44:46,170
because we thought of getting after 
September 11th.

3277
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:47,141
Got it in.
Oh,

3278
02:44:47,141 --> 02:44:48,460
three.
Oh,

3279
02:44:48,461 --> 02:44:49,330
two,
something like that,

3280
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:54,700
but now it's just a good place for me to
refuel and through a lot of good writing

3281
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:57,150
there and this sort of thing.
Look out for ticks and oh,

3282
02:44:57,210 --> 02:44:58,043
oh my god.
Long island's overwhelmed with lyme 

3283
02:44:59,591 --> 02:45:00,424
disease.
They got a new tick apparently that 

3284
02:45:01,660 --> 02:45:04,540
prevents you from eating meat,
vegetarians,

3285
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:05,433
bread that think it's called the lone 
star tick and it prevents you from 

3286
02:45:11,471 --> 02:45:14,020
eating the meat of mammals.
Yes.

3287
02:45:14,090 --> 02:45:17,200
If it makes you allergic to alpha,
galactose,

3288
02:45:17,201 --> 02:45:18,970
is that what it is?
It's alpha gao.

3289
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:21,550
Another great radio podcast.
Yeah,

3290
02:45:21,570 --> 02:45:24,700
I detail I think the vegans and 
vegetarians,

3291
02:45:24,701 --> 02:45:25,870
I think.
Yeah,

3292
02:45:25,871 --> 02:45:28,490
I think they still eat fish.
Yeah.

3293
02:45:28,990 --> 02:45:32,440
Chicken eater mammal can't eat red meat.
It's something in red meat.

3294
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:33,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

3295
02:45:33,731 --> 02:45:36,530
So that's one of the challenges,
right?

3296
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:39,460
But damn ticks,
they are everywhere.

3297
02:45:39,790 --> 02:45:41,770
And we looked at it the other day.

3298
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:42,603
There's,
because I have quite a few friends that 

3299
02:45:43,721 --> 02:45:45,760
have lyme disease and it's something you
do keep for life.

3300
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:48,490
And uh,
quite a few friends,

3301
02:45:48,730 --> 02:45:52,840
like seven or eight and I think at this 
point that have devastating lyme disease

3302
02:45:52,841 --> 02:45:55,780
and it's all east coast people.
They were making love in the brush,

3303
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:57,220
like what are they doing?
Walking around,

3304
02:45:57,250 --> 02:45:58,450
going for a hike.
You know,

3305
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:01,090
I'm a city person,
so even though I moved to the country,

3306
02:46:01,860 --> 02:46:05,260
I go for a hike on my deck.
You don't go anywhere.

3307
02:46:05,330 --> 02:46:05,981
No,
no.

3308
02:46:05,981 --> 02:46:09,180
Sit back just a little on the deck.
Pay,

3309
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:12,290
but you're out there in the gorgeous 
country.

3310
02:46:12,291 --> 02:46:14,000
don't you want to go wander around a 
little bit?

3311
02:46:14,430 --> 02:46:18,050
No,
it's honestly not a thought.

3312
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:20,360
My wife was from Alaska has those 
thoughts all the time,

3313
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:23,900
but the power of ticks overwhelms her 
power of curiosity.

3314
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:25,640
Those are powerful people in Alaska.

3315
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:27,500
That's a different type of their.
Their,

3316
02:46:27,550 --> 02:46:29,150
their,
their bread differently.

3317
02:46:29,151 --> 02:46:30,290
Oh,
they're strong.

3318
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:31,513
Those people can survive and then they.
They have a sentence to say unity up 

3319
02:46:34,701 --> 02:46:35,534
there.
It's really interesting that unity I 

3320
02:46:36,711 --> 02:46:41,690
think comes from the fact that they're 
all in the same risk factors together.

3321
02:46:41,720 --> 02:46:43,200
Yup.
And if,

3322
02:46:43,460 --> 02:46:44,293
if,
if you and I have the same things that 

3323
02:46:45,141 --> 02:46:46,760
can kill us,
that makes us friends.

3324
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:47,983
It's also they're overwhelmed by nature.
It's like they're overwhelmed by both 

3325
02:46:51,170 --> 02:46:55,820
its beauty and just the sheer evidence 
that you're insignificant.

3326
02:46:55,821 --> 02:46:58,110
I would say they're not overwhelmed.
They are wellmed,

3327
02:46:58,560 --> 02:46:59,393
but who's the right amount of wealth?
I have a buddy of mine who lived up 

3328
02:47:03,201 --> 02:47:04,034
there.
A grizzly bear killed a moose in his 

3329
02:47:04,941 --> 02:47:08,420
driveway who like what?
Right.

3330
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:10,430
That's the kind of stuff in the 
driveway.

3331
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:14,100
They had to be careful like getting out 
of the house because the bear had cashed

3332
02:47:14,101 --> 02:47:15,590
the moose when we first went up there.

3333
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:20,590
My brother in law,
my wife's sister's husband kept a loaded

3334
02:47:21,381 --> 02:47:22,214
shotgun over their bed so that when the 
door starts rattling in the middle of 

3335
02:47:26,901 --> 02:47:27,734
the night,
the gun is in his arms reach and that 

3336
02:47:34,941 --> 02:47:35,930
was good.
That was good.

3337
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:37,850
Yeah.
Those fucking things.

3338
02:47:37,870 --> 02:47:39,720
You ever seen one in real life?
I mean,

3339
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:42,430
zoo captive.
Not a real one.

3340
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:44,820
Real one because there's a look.
They go,

3341
02:47:44,830 --> 02:47:45,330
no,
no,

3342
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:45,741
no,
no.

3343
02:47:45,741 --> 02:47:49,220
we've visited denali park,
but I saw it's 500 yards away.

3344
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:52,610
It's not any closer than that.
Denali park,

3345
02:47:52,611 --> 02:47:54,860
they're a little bit habitualized to.
Right.

3346
02:47:54,980 --> 02:47:57,140
No,
that was pretty wild.

3347
02:47:57,560 --> 02:48:00,170
Oh,
denali park it with jellystone park.

3348
02:48:00,171 --> 02:48:02,480
I'm thinking of something different.
Do you think in a jellystone park,

3349
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:04,160
denali park is,
um,

3350
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:07,130
where we're,
what is that near what part of Alaska is

3351
02:48:07,131 --> 02:48:08,630
that near?
It's got.

3352
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:10,600
It's got mount mckinley,
denali,

3353
02:48:10,940 --> 02:48:11,990
the mountain in it.

3354
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:13,521
So.
Oh,

3355
02:48:13,521 --> 02:48:14,930
so where is it?
It's uh,

3356
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:15,800
I forgot,
uh,

3357
02:48:15,801 --> 02:48:16,634
geographically,
but that's not near the brooks range 

3358
02:48:19,230 --> 02:48:20,540
right now.
I couldn't tell you.

3359
02:48:21,010 --> 02:48:22,490
I'm not,
I'm not a mountain range.

3360
02:48:22,750 --> 02:48:23,583
The sheer size of Alaska.
When you actually look at it over the 

3361
02:48:26,541 --> 02:48:29,390
United States superimposed at you?
Oh yeah.

3362
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:30,760
What,
what to know.

3363
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:34,280
Another one with another one besides of 
africa relative to the United States.

3364
02:48:34,281 --> 02:48:35,340
We've done that anytime.
So.

3365
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:36,910
Excellent.
Everything fits in there.

3366
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:38,990
Everything fits in.
He was like five.

3367
02:48:38,991 --> 02:48:42,900
United states can literally.
Everything fits in there.

3368
02:48:42,901 --> 02:48:44,990
It looks like most of the world that's 
in there.

3369
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:46,960
United states plus europe,
asia,

3370
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:48,180
China,
China.

3371
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:48,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

3372
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:50,930
It's fucking crazy.
It's a giant place.

3373
02:48:51,440 --> 02:48:54,680
But what's really interesting about 
Alaska is how few people there.

3374
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:55,720
RighT?
You know,

3375
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:58,550
I mean it's such a low density 
population density,

3376
02:48:58,551 --> 02:48:59,384
so light,
but,

3377
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:01,790
but anchorage is a really cool city.

3378
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:02,840
Like if you go there,
you're like,

3379
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:04,670
oh,
this is a cool ass town,

3380
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:06,800
nice people.
But if you go there in the summer,

3381
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:09,360
bring some things to cover your eyes.
Oh,

3382
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:12,090
because when you go into bed at night,
you're going to bed during the day.

3383
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:12,953
Yeah,
yeah.

3384
02:49:13,220 --> 02:49:14,053
Yeah.
So,

3385
02:49:15,290 --> 02:49:17,280
so,
but my wife said in the winter when they

3386
02:49:17,281 --> 02:49:19,020
go to school and dark,
it's not nighttime,

3387
02:49:19,021 --> 02:49:21,300
it's dark.
They don't use night and day.

3388
02:49:21,330 --> 02:49:23,070
It's just dark and light.
Yeah.

3389
02:49:23,071 --> 02:49:24,600
Because it's the only light for a few 
hours.

3390
02:49:24,601 --> 02:49:26,190
Yeah.
So that's light then it's dark.

3391
02:49:26,460 --> 02:49:28,260
She ever see that movie?
Um,

3392
02:49:28,390 --> 02:49:31,770
was it called 30 days of night?
Vampire movie about Alaska?

3393
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:32,930
No.
Yeah,

3394
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:35,250
the vampires came to.
It was actually pretty fun.

3395
02:49:35,251 --> 02:49:37,560
One vampire movie in my landlord,
vampire movies,

3396
02:49:38,130 --> 02:49:43,130
I have nothing against them.
They just don't let smart homes don't,

3397
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:44,653
can't put that.
I don't see the romance of getting 

3398
02:49:46,561 --> 02:49:47,394
bitten in the neck.

3399
02:49:47,550 --> 02:49:48,980
Well,
to stop romance.

3400
02:49:48,981 --> 02:49:50,710
It's scary actually.
I think the,

3401
02:49:50,711 --> 02:49:51,420
the,
the,

3402
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:56,280
the uh,
what's the other series?

3403
02:49:57,580 --> 02:49:58,670
Underworld.
The underworld series.

3404
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:00,480
I've seen a few of those,
those like those,

3405
02:50:00,481 --> 02:50:02,220
those are fun.
Those are the dumbest ones.

3406
02:50:03,570 --> 02:50:05,360
The ones that the twilight fans make fun
of.

3407
02:50:05,650 --> 02:50:06,483
Oh no,
I just liked the fact that there's a 

3408
02:50:08,521 --> 02:50:10,640
lead woman kicking ass.
Women.

3409
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:13,560
Those guys.
Women who can go ahead do your show.

3410
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:16,890
I love when you put on your little show.
We love when women are winning.

3411
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:18,270
Yay.
Kick ass.

3412
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:19,193
No,
it's just fun.

3413
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:22,260
He must love alien.
The original alien.

3414
02:50:22,490 --> 02:50:23,310
Yeah.
That's good.

3415
02:50:23,310 --> 02:50:27,030
Talked about ripley from aliens weaver.
She's original female movie.

3416
02:50:27,031 --> 02:50:28,390
Bad ass.
Well,

3417
02:50:28,410 --> 02:50:29,243
no,
they go before her and I just reminded 

3418
02:50:30,301 --> 02:50:31,790
myself of this.
Uh,

3419
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:35,190
uh,
is it barbara rig barbarella?

3420
02:50:35,370 --> 02:50:36,510
No.
Barbara rig,

3421
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:37,793
because her name,
she was the woman in the original 

3422
02:50:41,131 --> 02:50:43,680
british series.
The avengers.

3423
02:50:44,130 --> 02:50:45,390
Oh yeah,
that's true.

3424
02:50:45,390 --> 02:50:48,330
But that was hokey,
like wait,

3425
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:49,173
but she was wearing black leather and 
new martial arts and kicked ass wasn't 

3426
02:50:54,421 --> 02:50:59,421
believable but whatever was believable.
Like when she's shooting that thing,

3427
02:51:01,291 --> 02:51:02,620
like if you buy like,
look,

3428
02:51:02,621 --> 02:51:03,454
she's throwing gasoline on this.
This to me is like to you when you're 

3429
02:51:08,971 --> 02:51:13,950
making fun of the mistakes that they 
make in these movies about space.

3430
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:14,903
This shit drives me crazy that people 
just flip and peoples through the air 

3431
02:51:17,941 --> 02:51:21,740
and then they fly off buildings.
Stop.

3432
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:24,600
You're driving me fucking crazy.
Just like I have a tweet.

3433
02:51:24,670 --> 02:51:26,380
I'm thinking,
should I post it now?

3434
02:51:27,620 --> 02:51:28,453
Not too long.
I got to take one of those dangerous 

3435
02:51:30,061 --> 02:51:31,470
guys.
It doesn't put a case on your phone.

3436
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:36,560
You have the fucking gape in your back,
on your phone.

3437
02:51:36,601 --> 02:51:39,750
Your lock screen is the stonehenge of 
manhattan.

3438
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:45,990
Manhattan henge.
No case on your phone.

3439
02:51:46,030 --> 02:51:47,170
So you're a risk taker,
right?

3440
02:51:47,570 --> 02:51:50,550
No.
So you can think of it as risk taking or

3441
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:54,120
when I got the phone,
because I admire how thin this is,

3442
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:58,350
right?
I'd like technology serving me.

3443
02:51:59,070 --> 02:52:00,840
Okay.
So what I do when I got the phone,

3444
02:52:01,140 --> 02:52:03,690
I said,
let me do this with it.

3445
02:52:04,770 --> 02:52:05,990
Flip around.
Yes.

3446
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:08,890
And I reminded myself,
why do,

3447
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:10,240
uh,
in,

3448
02:52:10,270 --> 02:52:11,103
in the military cadets,
why do they twirl their gun of what 

3449
02:52:14,321 --> 02:52:15,154
possible value is this in combat?
Why do they do these things with their 

3450
02:52:18,461 --> 02:52:19,294
gun?
And then I realized you're not supposed 

3451
02:52:20,861 --> 02:52:24,730
to drop your gun ever,
ever.

3452
02:52:25,450 --> 02:52:27,730
So if you twirl the gun and you don't 
drop it,

3453
02:52:27,820 --> 02:52:31,810
it means stuff can happen to you in 
combat and it is always attached to your

3454
02:52:31,811 --> 02:52:33,270
body.
So,

3455
02:52:34,130 --> 02:52:37,750
so when I got my phone I said,
let me just do this.

3456
02:52:39,970 --> 02:52:41,920
Okay,
let me just do this.

3457
02:52:41,921 --> 02:52:46,921
If I pick up the phone and dropped it,
jesus christ.

3458
02:52:47,831 --> 02:52:52,630
So when you do that,
then you never drop your phone.

3459
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:53,733
So it's not that I'm a risk taker is 
that I've changed my risk to make it so 

3460
02:52:58,511 --> 02:52:59,344
low that it essentially won't happen.
And you've got apple care to get apple 

3461
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:05,530
care.
I know you didn't know.

3462
02:53:05,531 --> 02:53:07,720
Of course I'll get applicants know 
you're a risk taker first.

3463
02:53:07,730 --> 02:53:09,820
I fixed my own damn computer.
Second.

3464
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:11,500
How are you going to fix your own damn 
phone?

3465
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:12,363
If the screen breaks,
you're going to get in there with a 

3466
02:53:14,140 --> 02:53:16,200
screwdriver and pop that bitch out.
Put the new one,

3467
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:18,090
the key word,
the key phrases there.

3468
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:21,370
If the screen break going to drop it.
So that's correct.

3469
02:53:21,710 --> 02:53:24,400
I also carry relatively expensive 
fountain pens.

3470
02:53:25,150 --> 02:53:27,400
What happens with that?
I never lose them.

3471
02:53:27,850 --> 02:53:29,290
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

3472
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,080
If you always lose your pens and meat,
you're not spending enough money,

3473
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:33,640
right?
Like sunglasses.

3474
02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:35,680
Exactly the same pair of sunglasses.
NoW,

3475
02:53:35,681 --> 02:53:36,514
for a record number of times the medical
cost you $200 to get a fucking lose 

3476
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:42,460
them.
They're just my favorite ones for free.

3477
02:53:42,670 --> 02:53:44,590
Shout out the skeleton sunglasses.
Oh,

3478
02:53:44,591 --> 02:53:46,690
skeleton optics,
zeiss lenses,

3479
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:47,833
zeiss.
Powerful fucking invented the 

3480
02:53:49,841 --> 02:53:50,674
planetarium projector.
Did they realize they did make some bad 

3481
02:53:52,361 --> 02:53:52,930
ass?
19,

3482
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:55,870
23,
may 23.

3483
02:53:57,750 --> 02:54:00,130
But uh,
I'm at the same sunglasses now.

3484
02:54:00,131 --> 02:54:01,870
I think you're doing well here.
Six months.

3485
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:03,580
He's fat.
Stupid fingers.

3486
02:54:04,020 --> 02:54:06,520
So once you,
once you get that,

3487
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:08,093
then it doesn't drop.
So it's not that I'm a risk taker is 

3488
02:54:09,821 --> 02:54:10,654
I've changed the risk.
So that is low enough so that it is on 

3489
02:54:14,711 --> 02:54:17,380
par or on par with other risks that you 
take routinely.

3490
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:18,580
I smoke a lot of pot.
Dude,

3491
02:54:18,610 --> 02:54:19,420
this is going to drop.

3492
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:22,710
I keep doing this.
Also the things,

3493
02:54:22,810 --> 02:54:25,660
if you pick up the phone with one hand 
and it's upside down,

3494
02:54:26,250 --> 02:54:29,890
you hold it in places where the center 
of gravity flips it,

3495
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:32,770
but you also have some sort of a skin in
the back.

3496
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:34,210
It's just,
it's just.

3497
02:54:34,211 --> 02:54:36,970
It's a sector of van gogh's.
Starry night.

3498
02:54:37,640 --> 02:54:38,530
Yeah,
but it's not.

3499
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:40,900
There's no texture to this.
It's just a slippery.

3500
02:54:41,860 --> 02:54:44,010
It's slippery like,
oh,

3501
02:54:44,011 --> 02:54:45,970
it's a.
It's definitely more texture.

3502
02:54:47,180 --> 02:54:49,950
Feel that that's slicker.
It's complicated,

3503
02:54:49,951 --> 02:54:50,784
but it's not wise there,
but my point is that snow white and the 

3504
02:54:52,570 --> 02:54:53,403
friction scientists,
you should recognize this friction is 

3505
02:54:56,111 --> 02:54:56,860
good.
Yes.

3506
02:54:56,860 --> 02:54:57,693
I mean isn't that one of the things that
they decided to do to asteroids to 

3507
02:54:59,560 --> 02:55:00,393
change their path,
spray some goo on them and it will 

3508
02:55:02,591 --> 02:55:06,590
literally cause more friction in the air
and caused them to deviate slightly from

3509
02:55:06,591 --> 02:55:08,180
their path,
which over a long period of time.

3510
02:55:08,180 --> 02:55:09,990
I don't know where you just pull that 
out of your ass.

3511
02:55:10,060 --> 02:55:12,200
Just that moment.
That moment.

3512
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:13,093
No,
I've read that and maybe it was some 

3513
02:55:15,441 --> 02:55:18,080
dummy who wrote it and either vacuum of 
space.

3514
02:55:18,140 --> 02:55:18,973
There is no friction,
so some shit they could put on the wig 

3515
02:55:22,440 --> 02:55:23,273
if it's traveling,
isn't there something they could put on 

3516
02:55:25,491 --> 02:55:29,390
that would aerodynamically change its 
path in the vacuum of space?

3517
02:55:29,391 --> 02:55:30,980
There is no aerodynamics.
Okay.

3518
02:55:30,981 --> 02:55:33,590
So it's moving by the time it hits her,
it's atmosphere.

3519
02:55:33,620 --> 02:55:35,000
It's too late.
So it ha.

3520
02:55:35,150 --> 02:55:35,983
So it's,
there was a coding that they were 

3521
02:55:37,941 --> 02:55:38,774
planning on putting on some aspect of,
would it be the act of putting the 

3522
02:55:42,411 --> 02:55:43,244
coating on it?
So what you would do is you may be 

3523
02:55:44,511 --> 02:55:45,344
thinking of,
there's a coating you can put on an 

3524
02:55:45,981 --> 02:55:50,981
asteroid that differently absorbs 
sunlight relative to the other side.

3525
02:55:52,090 --> 02:55:54,590
Uh,
so it causes the spin that can,

3526
02:55:54,860 --> 02:55:56,180
that can create a net.

3527
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:01,880
A vector of motion is spray.
Any asteroids can protect the earth from

3528
02:56:02,751 --> 02:56:04,120
space rock threat.
Okay,

3529
02:56:04,130 --> 02:56:06,590
so there you go.
That sounds like some click baity shit.

3530
02:56:07,890 --> 02:56:10,980
That's some click bait shit.
Okay.

3531
02:56:11,330 --> 02:56:14,620
Change the amount of sunlight reflected,
but you would,

3532
02:56:14,660 --> 02:56:16,340
you would not do that to the entire 
rock.

3533
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:19,730
you do it to a part of the rock 
potentially nudging and away from earth.

3534
02:56:19,740 --> 02:56:24,620
And the accumulated push provided by 
many thermo photons as they radiate from

3535
02:56:24,621 --> 02:56:25,540
the app.
Wow.

3536
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:27,770
You asteroid surface.
Holy shit.

3537
02:56:27,990 --> 02:56:28,823
Yeah.
Yeah.

3538
02:56:29,240 --> 02:56:30,560
See,
I didn't think that through very well.

3539
02:56:30,561 --> 02:56:34,070
And somehow you added a key jelly to 
this.

3540
02:56:39,370 --> 02:56:44,040
I'm trying to flip this phone still on 
my friend andrew santinello.

3541
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:47,360
He carries this pitch around case free 
and I admire him.

3542
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:52,190
He's braver man than I do.
I sent you a list of topics.

3543
02:56:52,191 --> 02:56:53,011
Did we hit all of them?
Yeah,

3544
02:56:53,011 --> 02:56:53,844
we hit all of them.
We didn't hit innovation in other 

3545
02:56:56,830 --> 02:56:57,650
categories.
No.

3546
02:56:57,650 --> 02:56:58,431
Here's one.
Oh,

3547
02:56:58,431 --> 02:57:01,050
we never even got the cars.
Cars.

3548
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,540
Why?
They'll never be flying cars.

3549
02:57:02,580 --> 02:57:03,141
Yeah,
man,

3550
02:57:03,141 --> 02:57:03,450
I.
Man,

3551
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:05,400
I started with this please.
Okay.

3552
02:57:05,450 --> 02:57:08,990
Since we're two hours and 40 minutes in,
does that allowed?

3553
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:09,831
Oh my gosh.
Yeah,

3554
02:57:09,831 --> 02:57:10,664
we're flying.
No,

3555
02:57:10,700 --> 02:57:13,340
but people don't have full three hours.
Do they?

3556
02:57:13,730 --> 02:57:14,810
Oh,
we do it all the time.

3557
02:57:14,870 --> 02:57:17,330
Really?
Are you Sure?

3558
02:57:17,390 --> 02:57:18,650
100 percent.
Yeah.

3559
02:57:18,800 --> 02:57:20,330
This is not you sure?
Yeah.

3560
02:57:20,331 --> 02:57:22,130
Average podcast right now.
Average.

3561
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:23,190
Really?
Yeah.

3562
02:57:23,270 --> 02:57:26,240
Dude,
I'm honored to bleach your average.

3563
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:27,313
The ones we've done.
We've all been like close to three 

3564
02:57:28,761 --> 02:57:29,594
hours.
Okay.

3565
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:30,860
Here you go,
here you go.

3566
02:57:31,110 --> 02:57:32,420
A ding.
Oh,

3567
02:57:32,660 --> 02:57:33,470
oh,
it's rude.

3568
02:57:33,470 --> 02:57:34,303
Okay,
so let me.

3569
02:57:34,370 --> 02:57:36,200
I flipped it.
I turned that goddamn switch on.

3570
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:41,320
Okay,
so let's go back to flying cars.

3571
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:42,583
Let's go back to why anyone would want a
flying car in the first place because 

3572
02:57:45,621 --> 02:57:46,580
they're an asshole.
Okay?

3573
02:57:46,670 --> 02:57:48,580
Go here and stuck in traffic.
So here at edison,

3574
02:57:48,590 --> 02:57:49,700
everybody.
So let's watch.

3575
02:57:50,450 --> 02:57:52,520
Let's say there was only one road,
okay?

3576
02:57:53,150 --> 02:57:53,983
Okay.
There was the width of your car and 

3577
02:57:56,391 --> 02:58:00,110
you're driving on this road and the cars
behind you.

3578
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:02,100
The you could go

3579
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:05,340
on that road is the speed of the slowest
car on the road,

3580
02:58:05,560 --> 02:58:06,630
right?
It makes sense.

3581
02:58:06,810 --> 02:58:09,330
Yes.
This is travel in one dimension.

3582
02:58:10,230 --> 02:58:11,063
That sucks.
What you really want is travel in two 

3583
02:58:13,771 --> 02:58:18,120
dimensions.
So you take the road and why didn't it?

3584
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:22,080
Let's make two lanes,
two lanes in one direction.

3585
02:58:22,250 --> 02:58:23,730
We can have two of the other way as 
well.

3586
02:58:23,731 --> 02:58:26,050
This doesn't matter here you have two 
lanes,

3587
02:58:26,051 --> 02:58:31,051
so now I can go around you your slow ass
car.

3588
02:58:31,950 --> 02:58:35,160
Okay?
But then that's fine.

3589
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:38,670
This was a great improvement on one 
dimensional travel.

3590
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:41,790
Now it's two dimensions.
Okay.

3591
02:58:42,240 --> 02:58:43,073
I can shift left or right as well as 
move forward or backwards to move and 

3592
02:58:50,281 --> 02:58:53,250
the more lanes you have,
the more two dimensional that is.

3593
02:58:53,850 --> 02:58:54,960
Okay.
The four.

3594
02:58:54,961 --> 02:58:56,310
Oh,
five here in los angeles.

3595
02:58:56,550 --> 02:58:59,340
What is it?
Six lanes each is 12 fricken lanes.

3596
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,533
Okay.
You are fully exploiting the two 

3597
02:59:02,761 --> 02:59:07,440
dimensionality of travel,
but you still have so many cars that you

3598
02:59:07,441 --> 02:59:10,620
say to yourself,
I want to bypass this traffic.

3599
02:59:11,850 --> 02:59:14,310
If you went from one dimension to two 
dimensions,

3600
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:19,460
bypassing is just another lane,
but now all 12 lanes are plugged and you

3601
02:59:19,771 --> 02:59:20,604
want to bypass it.
So you're thinking I need to travel in 

3602
02:59:22,651 --> 02:59:26,910
another dimension.
I want to travel in the third dimension.

3603
02:59:27,870 --> 02:59:31,140
If I do that,
I can bypass all these cars.

3604
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:34,030
I want a flying car.
Yeah.

3605
02:59:34,140 --> 02:59:38,340
Okay.
Well the point is we already have flying

3606
02:59:38,341 --> 02:59:41,570
cars.
They called helicopters.

3607
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:43,890
The helicopters originally invented for 
that.

3608
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:45,720
They called helicopters.

3609
02:59:47,820 --> 02:59:51,750
They're noisy.
They have to create a downward thrust of

3610
02:59:51,751 --> 02:59:56,751
air equal to its own weight.
If you're gonna have a flying car,

3611
02:59:57,060 --> 03:00:00,990
that's what it's going to have to do.
TheY're noisy.

3612
03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:02,203
They're.
They completely disrupt the terrain 

3613
03:00:05,011 --> 03:00:05,844
wherever they fly.
So the issue is not that you want a 

3614
03:00:09,871 --> 03:00:10,704
flying car,
you want to travel in that third 

3615
03:00:12,931 --> 03:00:14,150
dimension,
[inaudible].

3616
03:00:14,640 --> 03:00:16,700
We already do that.
How do we do that?

3617
03:00:16,820 --> 03:00:19,800
Called tunnels.
They called bridges.

3618
03:00:20,640 --> 03:00:21,473
When you have a huge intersection,
you don't move people through one 

3619
03:00:24,901 --> 03:00:27,270
another.
You build the,

3620
03:00:28,380 --> 03:00:32,730
you build one road over the other,
you build one road under the other,

3621
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:33,833
you are exploiting three dimensions so 
that traffic can go in perpendicular 

3622
03:00:39,691 --> 03:00:40,524
directions simultaneously.
That's what the flying cars would have 

3623
03:00:43,831 --> 03:00:44,664
given you.
But we do that at intersections because 

3624
03:00:48,541 --> 03:00:49,374
it would be impossible to move 12 lanes 
of traffic through an intersection that 

3625
03:00:52,681 --> 03:00:57,090
crossed another freeway.
New york city has done this.

3626
03:00:58,560 --> 03:00:59,393
We do

3627
03:01:00,370 --> 03:01:02,170
the New York.
The you're in the streets,

3628
03:01:02,171 --> 03:01:05,390
there's too many cars you can't move.
Let's move in.

3629
03:01:05,391 --> 03:01:08,770
The third dimension,
let's build a subway.

3630
03:01:09,370 --> 03:01:12,370
This sounds like a guy who's trying to 
sell me something,

3631
03:01:12,630 --> 03:01:16,180
telling you better than a flying car.
I'm just like,

3632
03:01:16,181 --> 03:01:18,100
listen man,
that flying cars bullshit.

3633
03:01:19,560 --> 03:01:21,000
You could buy a flying car.
The new.

3634
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:23,980
I want you to appreciate moving in the 
third dimension.

3635
03:01:24,410 --> 03:01:29,410
So New York city subway system moves a 
billion people a year and they all go in

3636
03:01:30,281 --> 03:01:34,300
the third dimension beneath the ground 
through tunnels,

3637
03:01:34,420 --> 03:01:36,910
tunnels that are layered on top of one 
another.

3638
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:37,953
Well,
the New York city subway system is 

3639
03:01:38,651 --> 03:01:40,180
amazing.
How doubt about.

3640
03:01:40,230 --> 03:01:42,760
I couldn't move that many people.
It's great,

3641
03:01:42,790 --> 03:01:45,940
but it's not as good as a flying car.
It's not as cool as a flying car,

3642
03:01:46,150 --> 03:01:49,810
but it's as effective as a flying car.
The flying car,

3643
03:01:50,660 --> 03:01:51,760
personal flying car.

3644
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:54,700
Just have to get in line.
You'd have to get on the subway.

3645
03:01:54,701 --> 03:01:57,540
You don't have to have a token,
you'd have to go through the turnstile.

3646
03:01:57,740 --> 03:02:01,060
You have to deal with some guy who's 
ruBbing his body up against yours,

3647
03:02:01,410 --> 03:02:02,740
you know,
flying cars.

3648
03:02:02,741 --> 03:02:03,574
So you just fly around.
I'm just saying it's like a boat 

3649
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:07,383
tunnels,
but for the air and bridges are flying 

3650
03:02:09,551 --> 03:02:12,370
cars.
Beautiful thing about a boat is you just

3651
03:02:12,371 --> 03:02:14,110
go wherever you want to go.
Now here's the thing,

3652
03:02:14,200 --> 03:02:15,033
it's kind of,
you don't have to call air traffic 

3653
03:02:16,121 --> 03:02:17,440
control.
I was turning left.

3654
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:18,423
I would take it to another dimension.
Not someone will have to know where the 

3655
03:02:20,231 --> 03:02:22,360
hell you're flying.
Car is going just the same way.

3656
03:02:22,361 --> 03:02:24,910
Traffic rules that are in the street you
want,

3657
03:02:24,911 --> 03:02:28,330
there's not as it is with boats.
And you know,

3658
03:02:28,331 --> 03:02:29,760
what happens if a car failed?

3659
03:02:30,150 --> 03:02:32,440
False.
It's just on the ground.

3660
03:02:32,441 --> 03:02:35,620
At your stops flying.
Car fails.

3661
03:02:35,830 --> 03:02:36,860
You're dead,
right?

3662
03:02:36,970 --> 03:02:37,960
Okay.
So,

3663
03:02:38,570 --> 03:02:39,403
uh,
I want to add another dimension to this 

3664
03:02:40,361 --> 03:02:41,194
conversation.
Oh,

3665
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:42,610
are you ready?
On moscow's tunnels.

3666
03:02:42,670 --> 03:02:43,503
Okay.
Ready?

3667
03:02:43,510 --> 03:02:44,710
Exactly.
Exactly.

3668
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:46,720
So watch,
here's a desk in front of me.

3669
03:02:47,290 --> 03:02:48,160
Okay?
Uh,

3670
03:02:48,161 --> 03:02:50,560
I,
it's a physical desk and I have a lot of

3671
03:02:50,561 --> 03:02:54,190
sheets of paper and,
and so I lay them side by side.

3672
03:02:54,430 --> 03:02:56,440
I tiled the desk with all my sheets of 
paper.

3673
03:02:56,640 --> 03:03:01,270
Then there's no desk surface left.
I ran out of two dimensional space.

3674
03:03:02,310 --> 03:03:06,550
If I want to store more pages on my 
desk,

3675
03:03:06,610 --> 03:03:09,490
what do I do?
I get one of those organizers.

3676
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:11,373
I've just introduced a third dimension.
So now I could have pages in another 

3677
03:03:17,441 --> 03:03:18,274
dimension sitting above the page that 
was previously occupying another place 

3678
03:03:22,841 --> 03:03:26,440
that I couldn't have put another sheet.
That's three dimensions?

3679
03:03:26,590 --> 03:03:27,600
Yes.
Okay.

3680
03:03:28,270 --> 03:03:29,103
If we were two dimensional people,
we would wonder what happened to that 

3681
03:03:32,051 --> 03:03:35,500
sheet of paper because we have no access
to that third dimension.

3682
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:39,160
It was just left our universe at this 
point.

3683
03:03:39,161 --> 03:03:41,620
I'd be trying to back out of the 
showroom and I'd say,

3684
03:03:41,621 --> 03:03:42,454
thank you,
but I'm going to go to the flying car 

3685
03:03:43,241 --> 03:03:44,074
place so now watch,
but look at how much you've increased 

3686
03:03:47,501 --> 03:03:50,380
your storage by introducing another 
dimension.

3687
03:03:51,490 --> 03:03:56,490
Now imagine a fourth spacial dimension.
We don't have access to that,

3688
03:03:57,320 --> 03:03:58,153
but we're now filling all three 
dimensions and afforded missional 

3689
03:04:01,170 --> 03:04:02,030
creature will say,
well,

3690
03:04:02,031 --> 03:04:05,480
just put it up in this direction will be
the fourth dimension.

3691
03:04:05,481 --> 03:04:06,314
In that regard,
you can't imagine it because our brain 

3692
03:04:09,981 --> 03:04:12,240
evolved in three dimensions.
We haven't.

3693
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:16,200
We can describe it mathematically.
Maybe a wormhole in pasadena,

3694
03:04:16,820 --> 03:04:21,820
downtown la,
so our storage needs would be come.

3695
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:26,030
You can open the door,
put it through this portal to the fourth

3696
03:04:26,031 --> 03:04:26,864
dimension and closed the door and look 
on the other side of the door and 

3697
03:04:29,091 --> 03:04:32,570
nothing would be there.
Yeah,

3698
03:04:33,470 --> 03:04:36,070
just the way on the surface of the desk.
If you live in the service desk,

3699
03:04:36,170 --> 03:04:38,660
so it opens a door,
they put the paper through the door,

3700
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:40,280
close the door,
and you look around and say,

3701
03:04:40,281 --> 03:04:41,114
where did it go?
I have no idea because you can't even 

3702
03:04:42,921 --> 03:04:43,754
see.
You can't even imagine that third 

3703
03:04:44,781 --> 03:04:47,750
dimension.
We cannot imagine a fourth dimension,

3704
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:49,873
but if the world one day gets so crowded
that even three dimensional space has 

3705
03:04:54,711 --> 03:04:55,544
traffic,

3706
03:04:56,890 --> 03:04:58,990
access to a fourth dimension would 
greatly help that.

3707
03:04:59,830 --> 03:05:01,750
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

3708
03:05:01,780 --> 03:05:05,760
Good luck with that.
Getting people to step through ice.

3709
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:06,693
What is this jamie?
Some flying thing that just came out 

3710
03:05:08,711 --> 03:05:09,461
last.
Oh,

3711
03:05:09,461 --> 03:05:11,250
look at this thing.
That cgi.

3712
03:05:11,260 --> 03:05:12,093
That part seemed cgi,
but it's actually flying over grass 

3713
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:16,570
that's moving and look at this thing.
What is it?

3714
03:05:16,571 --> 03:05:18,070
Solar powered.
I don't know.

3715
03:05:19,210 --> 03:05:20,200
Huh?
The trailer,

3716
03:05:20,201 --> 03:05:21,820
like showing it,
describing it,

3717
03:05:21,821 --> 03:05:24,410
but didn't have sound.
Does it make sound note?

3718
03:05:24,470 --> 03:05:26,980
It looks like it looks like a human 
sized drone.

3719
03:05:27,130 --> 03:05:28,720
Yes,
that's exactly what it looks like.

3720
03:05:29,170 --> 03:05:30,610
Okay.
What about something like this?

3721
03:05:30,760 --> 03:05:31,593
What about something like this with 
really powerful magnets all inside the 

3722
03:05:35,501 --> 03:05:36,334
outer edge,
so it repels against other drones to an 

3723
03:05:39,031 --> 03:05:41,910
a maglev flying car.
So if you get so close like,

3724
03:05:42,970 --> 03:05:43,803
oh,
I see it will be like a forcefield each 

3725
03:05:45,341 --> 03:05:45,730
other.

3726
03:05:45,730 --> 03:05:46,730
Oh,
so it'd be like.

3727
03:05:47,050 --> 03:05:49,300
It'd be like a bumper cars.
Yes.

3728
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:50,710
But with.
With cushions.

3729
03:05:50,711 --> 03:05:51,690
Yes.
Yeah,

3730
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:54,640
yeah.
Some sort of electromagnetic force field

3731
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:56,013
that everyone agrees that you don't have
the ones that are attracted to each 

3732
03:06:00,161 --> 03:06:00,994
other but are opposed by the way you see
how big that human north human sized 

3733
03:06:04,460 --> 03:06:06,700
drone it.
Have you ever heard how loud a drone?

3734
03:06:06,701 --> 03:06:08,080
it fucking loud.
You can't.

3735
03:06:08,081 --> 03:06:09,640
You can't even have a conversation.
Yeah.

3736
03:06:09,641 --> 03:06:11,890
I got an asshole in my neighborhood.
Flies on around you.

3737
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:12,733
That's what shotguns are for you.
I wish I had never fired a gun in my 

3738
03:06:14,591 --> 03:06:16,270
life.
The first time I've ever used one.

3739
03:06:16,271 --> 03:06:17,104
It's to shoot the drone that's going to 
be looking through my window at my 

3740
03:06:20,351 --> 03:06:21,370
apartment.
Oh yeah.

3741
03:06:21,371 --> 03:06:22,990
This is fucking asshole in my 
neighborhood.

3742
03:06:22,991 --> 03:06:23,824
He flies all over people's yards,
but I can't uncork they already think 

3743
03:06:28,001 --> 03:06:28,834
I'm crazy.

3744
03:06:30,490 --> 03:06:33,340
Still play.
And if I shoot it with a bow and arrow,

3745
03:06:33,341 --> 03:06:34,720
I'm not sure I'll hit it.
By the way,

3746
03:06:34,721 --> 03:06:37,060
did that video have a sound accompanying
with it?

3747
03:06:37,061 --> 03:06:37,900
Has some.
Some,

3748
03:06:37,960 --> 03:06:38,793
a little bit.
There's music and some description of 

3749
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:40,833
music,
but it's not the actual sound of those 

3750
03:06:41,441 --> 03:06:43,780
propellers.
But they have on their webpage here that

3751
03:06:43,781 --> 03:06:47,470
it's quieter than a car on a freeway.
What is quieter than electric car?

3752
03:06:47,670 --> 03:06:51,760
Nor at 150 feet away.
Measured at a 150 feet.

3753
03:06:51,850 --> 03:06:55,180
That's incredible because it's about the
same as far as a car.

3754
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:56,213
Well it says don't count.
So they're counting that as an electric 

3755
03:06:58,561 --> 03:07:00,300
car though.
Oh,

3756
03:07:00,301 --> 03:07:00,930
they are?
Yeah.

3757
03:07:00,930 --> 03:07:02,860
Yeah.
Gasoline cars bottom.

3758
03:07:02,870 --> 03:07:05,700
But what is that about?
Cars today are not in top.

3759
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:07,170
Wait,
just to be energy consumption.

3760
03:07:07,171 --> 03:07:09,270
I don't know if theY're using the same 
icon to represent.

3761
03:07:09,271 --> 03:07:11,100
See,
they're using the same electric electric

3762
03:07:11,101 --> 03:07:11,450
car.

3763
03:07:11,450 --> 03:07:13,010
So it's the sound of an electric car.
No,

3764
03:07:13,080 --> 03:07:13,890
no.
There's no engine,

3765
03:07:13,890 --> 03:07:14,723
but no,
don't get deceived there because that's 

3766
03:07:15,541 --> 03:07:16,550
energy consumption.
See,

3767
03:07:16,570 --> 03:07:19,190
energy consumption uses the same icon 
for electric cars.

3768
03:07:19,191 --> 03:07:21,210
It does for gasoline car.
And then down.

3769
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:23,160
No,
see it says noise.

3770
03:07:23,340 --> 03:07:25,230
It shows highway.
Just car.

3771
03:07:25,231 --> 03:07:27,920
It doesn't tell you what dba.
Yeah,

3772
03:07:28,150 --> 03:07:33,150
there's no way 76 dba sound because 
electric cars far quieter than a regular

3773
03:07:33,571 --> 03:07:34,404
car.
The all you hear is the drone of the 

3774
03:07:35,461 --> 03:07:36,061
tires.
So.

3775
03:07:36,061 --> 03:07:38,190
but what happens is above a certain 
speed,

3776
03:07:38,400 --> 03:07:39,233
the,
the aerodynamic noise is greater than 

3777
03:07:42,780 --> 03:07:44,570
the.
So it'll landing airplanes.

3778
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:45,480
So here's,
here's what you do.

3779
03:07:45,481 --> 03:07:48,690
You live in la,
go to the in and out near lax,

3780
03:07:49,050 --> 03:07:51,340
which is right near a landing strip.
Okay?

3781
03:07:51,480 --> 03:07:54,960
Yeah.
And listen to the sound of the planes as

3782
03:07:54,961 --> 03:07:56,640
they come,
as they come in for a landing,

3783
03:07:57,270 --> 03:08:00,150
most of that sound is airfoil noise,
not engine noise.

3784
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:01,950
A.
Yeah.

3785
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:05,280
Which is why you can pretty much still 
maintain a conversation.

3786
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:06,293
You're old enough.
We remember a plane would fly overhead 

3787
03:08:08,911 --> 03:08:12,450
in a city and you'd have to halt your 
conversation until it finished.

3788
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:13,680
Why?
What happened?

3789
03:08:15,150 --> 03:08:15,983
Engines got quieter and quieter,
which has enabled people to build real 

3790
03:08:19,261 --> 03:08:23,280
estate closer and closer to airports and
not have not have a sound problem.

3791
03:08:23,340 --> 03:08:25,170
It's poor folks,
but they didn't happen overnight.

3792
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:27,240
it was slow and steady.
No kidding.

3793
03:08:27,470 --> 03:08:28,380
Yeah.
I never.

3794
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:29,233
I forgot her foil noise.
I forgot that you had to stop talking 

3795
03:08:32,671 --> 03:08:33,504
when I remember it effect a shea stadium
in New York city near near laguardia 

3796
03:08:38,101 --> 03:08:38,934
airport.
The announcers had to stop and he told 

3797
03:08:41,461 --> 03:08:42,270
my plane,
flew over it.

3798
03:08:42,270 --> 03:08:43,103
They could.
That's when the mets won the world 

3799
03:08:46,261 --> 03:08:47,094
series in 1969.
Mayor lindsay redirected the airport 

3800
03:08:51,721 --> 03:08:53,910
traffic to not fly over the world series
games.

3801
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:54,993
Why?
I thought that was a bad ass move of 

3802
03:08:56,401 --> 03:08:57,390
him.
Of his mayor.

3803
03:08:57,391 --> 03:08:58,820
Lindsay.
Yeah.

3804
03:09:00,060 --> 03:09:02,820
I completely forgot how loud planes you 
used to be.

3805
03:09:02,821 --> 03:09:03,870
correct.
And now they're.

3806
03:09:03,900 --> 03:09:05,630
Now they're,
it's a sound.

3807
03:09:05,631 --> 03:09:08,220
It's in the,
in the noise of the street.

3808
03:09:08,490 --> 03:09:11,070
You don't even stop and notice it.
You didn't even pay attention to all.

3809
03:09:11,071 --> 03:09:12,720
You barely hear.
You barely hear it.

3810
03:09:12,930 --> 03:09:16,200
And so next time you're at a runway when
it's landing,

3811
03:09:16,201 --> 03:09:17,034
it's much noisier.
Taking off because it's got a gain 

3812
03:09:18,211 --> 03:09:19,890
altitude,
but coming down,

3813
03:09:20,150 --> 03:09:22,320
it's.
Most of that sound is glider noise.

3814
03:09:22,500 --> 03:09:25,210
And evidence of this is,
uh,

3815
03:09:25,310 --> 03:09:25,990
is,
is,

3816
03:09:25,990 --> 03:09:27,930
uh,
the noise of air going over the air foil

3817
03:09:27,931 --> 03:09:30,540
of the fuselage.
If you do,

3818
03:09:30,720 --> 03:09:34,350
you know the moment they deploy the 
landing gear,

3819
03:09:35,100 --> 03:09:38,160
next time you're in an airplane,
when they say we are clear for landing,

3820
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:39,353
just listen,
listen to the ambient sound of the 

3821
03:09:41,101 --> 03:09:41,934
plane.

3822
03:09:42,510 --> 03:09:43,343
Then listen to the sound after they 
deploy the landing gear for three times 

3823
03:09:47,101 --> 03:09:47,934
as loud,
it ramps up hard part because of the 

3824
03:09:49,531 --> 03:09:52,920
sound of the air going around something 
is not aerodynamic.

3825
03:09:53,050 --> 03:09:56,150
A fricken wheels.
Oh yes.

3826
03:09:57,280 --> 03:09:59,260
Yeah.
I just never.

3827
03:10:00,070 --> 03:10:02,200
For whatever reason,
I never remembered that.

3828
03:10:02,230 --> 03:10:05,920
Airplanes used to be louder.
I think about all the time.

3829
03:10:05,950 --> 03:10:10,240
So why can't I have a flying car?
You want the drone flying car?

3830
03:10:10,390 --> 03:10:11,201
Yeah.
Yeah.

3831
03:10:11,201 --> 03:10:12,370
So you need.
You wouldn't want it.

3832
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:15,400
That would look ugly if two of those 
collide and in the sky.

3833
03:10:15,430 --> 03:10:18,450
But what about my magnet theory?
Now?

3834
03:10:18,730 --> 03:10:22,540
Now it's got to have more power to lift 
the weight of the magnet solar pro.

3835
03:10:26,110 --> 03:10:29,830
Plus he gets some testosterone infused 
guy who doesn't want to let you ahead of

3836
03:10:29,831 --> 03:10:30,664
them to bump you.
That kind of break the propeller and 

3837
03:10:33,011 --> 03:10:35,140
then you both fall out of the skus.
Sky rage,

3838
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:36,003
sky rage.
There's a lot of dirage we know it'll 

3839
03:10:38,681 --> 03:10:39,514
do.
It'll cull the herd of testosterone 

3840
03:10:40,931 --> 03:10:41,830
driven men.
Okay.

3841
03:10:41,831 --> 03:10:42,664
But what if they do it,
but the only way they work is through 

3842
03:10:44,711 --> 03:10:49,240
like the same sort of tesla system that 
allows them to have automated cars.

3843
03:10:49,340 --> 03:10:50,170
Auto.
Yeah.

3844
03:10:50,170 --> 03:10:54,630
Know if you have automated cars,
you don't need flying cars because first

3845
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:57,040
of be too many of them.
There'll be fewer cars on the road.

3846
03:10:59,380 --> 03:11:01,210
How do you figure that?
Oh my gosh.

3847
03:11:02,350 --> 03:11:04,680
Automated cars.
Fewer cars in the us.

3848
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:05,890
How so?
How so?

3849
03:11:05,950 --> 03:11:07,150
How so?
Because,

3850
03:11:07,240 --> 03:11:11,920
because what your second greatest asset 
your car.

3851
03:11:11,921 --> 03:11:12,754
Most people,
second greatest asset spends 90 percent 

3852
03:11:14,441 --> 03:11:15,400
of his time doing nothing.

3853
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:21,960
You drive to work and it's parked.
You come home and it's parked 90 percent

3854
03:11:21,961 --> 03:11:23,420
of his time doing nothing.
Okay.

3855
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:26,250
I come to work 10 minutes after you a 
half hour after you.

3856
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:28,560
An hour after you.
I'm using your car.

3857
03:11:28,590 --> 03:11:31,200
You ain't using my card.
I'm telling you right now.

3858
03:11:31,260 --> 03:11:34,230
You're not using my car up.
No one's using the race car.

3859
03:11:34,231 --> 03:11:36,210
I forgot this is la.
Did you go to New York?

3860
03:11:36,220 --> 03:11:41,150
Happen for people where they steal your 
car is a utility rather than a.

3861
03:11:41,650 --> 03:11:44,350
Something to try to get chicks with on 
the street corner.

3862
03:11:44,370 --> 03:11:45,030
Oh,
stop.

3863
03:11:45,030 --> 03:11:46,910
He will try to get chicks in New York 
too.

3864
03:11:46,911 --> 03:11:49,620
Don't do enough with the cars.
There's a lot of people that do.

3865
03:11:49,680 --> 03:11:51,180
Nobody has cars,
but if you do,

3866
03:11:51,181 --> 03:11:53,280
you're a baller.
You got one of them spots.

3867
03:11:53,281 --> 03:11:55,980
It cost you a thousand bucks a month,
baby.

3868
03:11:57,870 --> 03:12:00,440
I've seen some fancy cars and I've been 
in New York system.

3869
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:01,590
Fancy guns,
but that's not.

3870
03:12:01,860 --> 03:12:03,450
It's not.
It's not 100 percent.

3871
03:12:03,451 --> 03:12:04,530
It's not 100 percent.
Yeah,

3872
03:12:04,531 --> 03:12:07,910
but that's just that one stupid spot 
where you still own the car,

3873
03:12:08,100 --> 03:12:11,190
but you'll be delegate relegated to a 
lane where you won't be able to drive as

3874
03:12:11,191 --> 03:12:12,024
fast as the automatic or consider that.
If you're in a self driving car and it 

3875
03:12:15,421 --> 03:12:16,254
wants to change lanes,
it communicates that to other self 

3876
03:12:18,211 --> 03:12:21,030
driving cars near it and have self 
driving cars tell you to fuck off.

3877
03:12:21,230 --> 03:12:26,230
You have a program like that.
Joe rogan upload rude russian bot call.

3878
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:32,850
It's not letting anybody in the joe 
rogan upload.

3879
03:12:32,990 --> 03:12:33,823
I feel like it wouldn't change anything 
if there's automated cars and los 

3880
03:12:37,711 --> 03:12:38,760
angeles.
I really do.

3881
03:12:39,030 --> 03:12:39,863
I don't think.
I don't think there'd be any less 

3882
03:12:40,861 --> 03:12:41,694
traffic.
They're going to make a lane that'll 

3883
03:12:42,901 --> 03:12:43,734
take automated cars and it will go 120 
miles an hour and watching everybody 

3884
03:12:47,010 --> 03:12:51,340
with their wasted horsepower in their.

3885
03:12:51,400 --> 03:12:53,840
In their inactive trapped,
stuck in traffic.

3886
03:12:55,010 --> 03:12:55,843
I was tweeting,
I was in la and I was in like a prius 

3887
03:12:57,560 --> 03:12:58,393
and we passed a lamborghini doing 40 
miles an hour and that was just seemed 

3888
03:13:04,021 --> 03:13:09,021
so embarrassing to the lamborghini.
Doing 30 miles.

3889
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:10,670
How are we doing?
Forty miles an hour.

3890
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:12,970
We pass the lambert.
No,

3891
03:13:13,250 --> 03:13:15,830
it was like,
why do you have a lamborghini?

3892
03:13:15,860 --> 03:13:17,930
Because there's sometimes when there's 
no one on the road,

3893
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:20,573
not from what I've never seen.
Just kind of got a lamborghini drive 

3894
03:13:24,181 --> 03:13:28,910
late at night and the lamborghini is the
peacock feathers as best as I can.

3895
03:13:28,911 --> 03:13:29,960
Judge.
You ever driven one?

3896
03:13:30,440 --> 03:13:31,273
No.
Two wonderful marvel of engineering and 

3897
03:13:33,771 --> 03:13:34,604
science and she'd appreciate it.
A good thing goes zero to 62 and a half 

3898
03:13:37,761 --> 03:13:39,350
seconds.
You're still burning gas.

3899
03:13:39,740 --> 03:13:40,910
oh,
you don't like gas?

3900
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:43,640
Not if I don't have to.
You prefer electric.

3901
03:13:43,641 --> 03:13:45,980
Like if you had a car,
if you lived in it for whatever reason,

3902
03:13:45,981 --> 03:13:48,330
the planetarium decided,
look neil,

3903
03:13:48,450 --> 03:13:49,580
you're the best ever.

3904
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:51,500
And we opened up the most amazing spot 
ever.

3905
03:13:51,501 --> 03:13:53,630
it's in los angeles,
California.

3906
03:13:53,910 --> 03:13:57,270
We'd love you to relocate and start,
have a car.

3907
03:13:57,450 --> 03:13:58,283
I,
if I was forced to relocate and I had 

3908
03:14:00,621 --> 03:14:01,454
only one car,
I'd get an electric car will probably 

3909
03:14:03,771 --> 03:14:05,800
attempt to get a prius or a tesla.
Would you go?

3910
03:14:05,810 --> 03:14:06,643
Definitely tests.
Uh,

3911
03:14:06,650 --> 03:14:07,483
yeah.
You wouldn't want like their 

3912
03:14:09,810 --> 03:14:11,160
performance.
Slice of cheese.

3913
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:14,200
what is the biggest prius?
I'm just saying.

3914
03:14:14,230 --> 03:14:15,063
I know it's an important Car that set a 
lot of other manufacturers into motion 

3915
03:14:19,450 --> 03:14:20,570
to,
you know,

3916
03:14:20,920 --> 03:14:23,750
there's a dynamic to shitbox.
It is a dynamic.

3917
03:14:23,870 --> 03:14:28,070
That's one thing happens and the drive 
something else that makes that happen.

3918
03:14:28,550 --> 03:14:31,340
But when you plug your car into the 
wall,

3919
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:34,730
you're not asking yourself,
I wonder where this power comes from.

3920
03:14:34,910 --> 03:14:38,840
It could come from any one of a dozen 
sources like hydro.

3921
03:14:38,841 --> 03:14:42,890
It could be a pet solar panels or tidal 
energy.

3922
03:14:42,891 --> 03:14:46,220
It could come from nukes,
it could come from oil or coal,

3923
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:48,470
come from any of them.
what about clean coal?

3924
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:49,730
Have you heard about this?
Clean coal.

3925
03:14:49,731 --> 03:14:52,700
The president's been tweeting about it,
clean coal,

3926
03:14:52,701 --> 03:14:54,100
all capital letters.
I'm like,

3927
03:14:54,110 --> 03:14:55,990
whoa,
I didn't know about that.

3928
03:14:55,991 --> 03:14:57,470
I thought it was just fucking cold.

3929
03:15:00,880 --> 03:15:04,430
Cold feet tweet is so here's my point,
if you can.

3930
03:15:04,490 --> 03:15:08,840
If you can power things with the choice 
of a dozen sources of energy,

3931
03:15:09,110 --> 03:15:11,990
then those sources of energy compete 
with one another for your business.

3932
03:15:12,890 --> 03:15:14,540
As the price of oil goes up,
he say,

3933
03:15:14,630 --> 03:15:16,400
I'm not going to generate power with 
oil,

3934
03:15:16,910 --> 03:15:20,630
going to use the and I have a wind farm 
and I come online.

3935
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:24,710
I want to sell you my wind energy and I 
and you're the power company.

3936
03:15:24,711 --> 03:15:25,544
You buy my wind energy.
You send that power to the wall outlet 

3937
03:15:27,830 --> 03:15:28,663
and you charging your car.
Don't know and don't care where that 

3938
03:15:31,641 --> 03:15:32,930
energy came from.
Whoa.

3939
03:15:34,160 --> 03:15:37,880
There's a book called turning oil into 
salt.

3940
03:15:38,360 --> 03:15:40,790
Look it up so we caN mention turning oil
into salt.

3941
03:15:40,820 --> 03:15:43,220
Correct.
Why would you want to do that?

3942
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:48,560
There was a day when salt was a 
strategic commodity.

3943
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:50,160
There was no other known

3944
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:55,160
way to preserve food from the autumn 
harvest to the spring set of crops.

3945
03:15:56,100 --> 03:15:58,410
So food got salted.
Okay.

3946
03:15:58,411 --> 03:15:59,244
Yeah.
uh,

3947
03:15:59,250 --> 03:16:00,300
that's the,
there's the book.

3948
03:16:00,301 --> 03:16:01,980
What's the woman's name?
A gal left and,

3949
03:16:02,010 --> 03:16:03,120
and koren.
Okay.

3950
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:07,710
So I'm now describing the thesis of that
book.

3951
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:10,050
Okay.
Turning oil into salt.

3952
03:16:10,290 --> 03:16:13,230
So here's what you do.
So we have soft.

3953
03:16:13,830 --> 03:16:17,910
If I took away your assault reserves,
you would starve over the winter.

3954
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:20,690
So everybody knew where their salt came 
from.

3955
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:23,790
Everybody knew how much their salt cost.
Do you know,

3956
03:16:23,820 --> 03:16:24,653
do you realize that grant general grant 
destroy the salt reserves or the 

3957
03:16:28,861 --> 03:16:29,694
southern confederacy knowing that that 
would force them faster to surrender 

3958
03:16:36,031 --> 03:16:38,910
because they wouldn't have food reserves
to last through the winter.

3959
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:40,793
I,
growing up net did not understand the 

3960
03:16:42,331 --> 03:16:43,740
phrase,
you are the salt of the earth,

3961
03:16:44,800 --> 03:16:46,620
so it gives you high blood pressure.
What do you,

3962
03:16:46,660 --> 03:16:47,160
what do you mean?

3963
03:16:47,160 --> 03:16:50,350
The salt to their stop saying that.
That's not true.

3964
03:16:50,790 --> 03:16:51,990
Sodium does.
No.

3965
03:16:52,050 --> 03:16:52,883
Yeah,
it doesn't really have too much right 

3966
03:16:53,790 --> 03:16:54,623
now.
Yeah.

3967
03:16:54,690 --> 03:16:55,360
Nope.
Yeah.

3968
03:16:55,360 --> 03:16:57,640
But let's get that in a minute.
Let me finish the thing.

3969
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:01,860
So they give them something wrong with 
you for that to happen.

3970
03:17:01,890 --> 03:17:04,540
Um,
so there's,

3971
03:17:04,680 --> 03:17:06,940
whether it's chronic or not that I agree
with you there.

3972
03:17:07,150 --> 03:17:09,460
If you're chronic high blood pressure,
it's not just this right?

3973
03:17:10,110 --> 03:17:10,943
But I can increase my blood pressure now
by not peeing and taking and ingesting 

3974
03:17:15,541 --> 03:17:17,880
salt by not paying.
Why would you not pay?

3975
03:17:18,030 --> 03:17:19,890
Well,
because you retain the water and it gets

3976
03:17:20,250 --> 03:17:21,083
pumped through.
This is what the salt as you retain the 

3977
03:17:21,991 --> 03:17:22,824
limit.
And it let me get back to the soccer 

3978
03:17:23,890 --> 03:17:25,980
talking about.
Okay.

3979
03:17:26,220 --> 03:17:28,320
So,
so I said,

3980
03:17:28,321 --> 03:17:29,760
salt of the earth.
Why is that a Compliment?

3981
03:17:29,761 --> 03:17:30,594
I remember thinking to myself,
but there was a day when salt really 

3982
03:17:32,851 --> 03:17:33,540
mattered.

3983
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:34,680
Okay.
All right.

3984
03:17:34,950 --> 03:17:37,460
So,
um,

3985
03:17:37,890 --> 03:17:41,340
so what happens?
the 19th century,

3986
03:17:41,370 --> 03:17:46,370
we figured out how to can foods.
Ooh,

3987
03:17:46,500 --> 03:17:48,660
you can have berries and put them.
We Can.

3988
03:17:48,661 --> 03:17:49,494
Then we seal.
You can make preserves the name of the 

3989
03:17:52,591 --> 03:17:55,500
food is what it is.
It's preserved.

3990
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:56,843
Okay.
So now we this another way to protect 

3991
03:17:59,161 --> 03:17:59,994
yoUr food,
to have it last through times when you 

3992
03:18:02,851 --> 03:18:06,090
don't have crops.
Wait a minute.

3993
03:18:06,240 --> 03:18:08,130
Refrigeration,
get we have electricity.

3994
03:18:08,720 --> 03:18:11,760
You can refrigerate.
Wait a minute,

3995
03:18:12,480 --> 03:18:13,313
I can now fleece food.
I got a half dozen ways I can eat over 

3996
03:18:20,011 --> 03:18:20,844
the winter and only one of them is salt.
So now salt has lost its strategic 

3997
03:18:27,390 --> 03:18:28,980
value.
Lost his mojo,

3998
03:18:29,150 --> 03:18:31,080
lost his mojo.
It's still there.

3999
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:34,000
We still eat salted foods as well as you
know,

4000
03:18:34,100 --> 03:18:36,330
over for flavor.
But it's a different thing.

4001
03:18:36,331 --> 03:18:37,860
Culture,
it's a different thing now.

4002
03:18:38,190 --> 03:18:40,380
It's a matter of choice,
not a matter of necessity.

4003
03:18:40,890 --> 03:18:42,600
A lot of great foods came out of that.
You know,

4004
03:18:42,601 --> 03:18:43,434
the salted pork and the bacon and the 
very tasty foods came out of that 

4005
03:18:47,140 --> 03:18:48,280
movement.
Okay.

4006
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:52,810
So right now when you buy salt,
do you know where it came from?

4007
03:18:52,870 --> 03:18:54,640
No,
unless you get hawaiian salt,

4008
03:18:54,730 --> 03:18:58,330
that should get gourmet salt from foods.
You just buying morton salt.

4009
03:18:58,331 --> 03:18:59,530
Do you know where it came from?
No.

4010
03:19:00,010 --> 03:19:01,960
Do you remember how much it costs?
No.

4011
03:19:02,470 --> 03:19:04,990
It's too cheap for eve viewed even.
Remember that?

4012
03:19:05,170 --> 03:19:08,440
Okay.
If you're going to turn oil into salt,

4013
03:19:09,460 --> 03:19:11,770
what you're doing is you're turning 
energy into salt.

4014
03:19:13,210 --> 03:19:14,043
That's the value of a plug in the wall.
Design a car that can run on five 

4015
03:19:18,461 --> 03:19:19,294
different kinds of energy than oil has 
to compete with the other kinds of 

4016
03:19:22,631 --> 03:19:23,320
energy.
Oh,

4017
03:19:23,320 --> 03:19:24,153
I see what you're saying.
So have an engine that's a works on 

4018
03:19:26,501 --> 03:19:27,810
hydrogen,
correct?

4019
03:19:27,940 --> 03:19:28,280
Yeah,
yeah,

4020
03:19:28,280 --> 03:19:28,751
yeah,
yeah.

4021
03:19:28,751 --> 03:19:30,990
Hydrogen fuel cells.
Uh,

4022
03:19:31,080 --> 03:19:31,913
batteries.
So they have hybrids now that work on 

4023
03:19:33,851 --> 03:19:35,410
two different things.
It's a start,

4024
03:19:35,411 --> 03:19:40,411
but my point is if you do that,
then we no longer fight wars for oil.

4025
03:19:42,530 --> 03:19:43,363
Oh,

4026
03:19:44,900 --> 03:19:48,440
what do we fight for now?
Maybe you don't fight for freedom.

4027
03:19:48,690 --> 03:19:49,670
How about freedom,
bro?

4028
03:19:50,300 --> 03:19:54,800
Freedom isn't free.
Freedom isn't free.

4029
03:19:54,860 --> 03:19:57,290
We just did three hours.
Three hours.

4030
03:19:57,300 --> 03:19:57,800
Holy

4031
03:19:57,800 --> 03:19:58,633
crazy.
How time flies by astrophysics for 

4032
03:20:02,691 --> 03:20:04,010
people in a hurry.
That's.

4033
03:20:04,011 --> 03:20:08,870
This is old and it's all one on the New 
York times bestseller list.

4034
03:20:08,871 --> 03:20:11,670
Crazy fact.
Seven 67 weeks.

4035
03:20:11,671 --> 03:20:12,504
Six to seven weeks.
The unspoken alliance between 

4036
03:20:14,931 --> 03:20:18,530
astrophysics in the military.
It's not even to walk.

4037
03:20:18,531 --> 03:20:20,630
And of course you can preorder it,
but it's not out yet.

4038
03:20:21,130 --> 03:20:23,630
They'd like it if you pre order so they 
know how to print in the thing.

4039
03:20:23,660 --> 03:20:25,580
I got it.
I got greasy hands.

4040
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:28,640
If you're not in a hurry,
I'm learning some things that you're not

4041
03:20:28,670 --> 03:20:29,503
looking.
I'm reading.

4042
03:20:30,200 --> 03:20:32,180
Don't buy this book if you're not in a 
hurry.

4043
03:20:32,181 --> 03:20:33,110
Yeah,
this is a.

4044
03:20:33,140 --> 03:20:35,310
This is a long form book.
Yes.

4045
03:20:35,360 --> 03:20:36,710
Gentlemen,
you got to do some thinking.

4046

There's no pictures I just checked.

4047
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:44,270
tyson.
Ladies and gentlemen.

03:20:49,630 --> 03:20:54,630

The inside channel.

4051
03:20:54,921 --> 03:20:58,040
I might have a and cosmos.
Look for cosmos in the spring.

4052
03:20:58,220 --> 03:20:59,760
Beautiful date isn't announced yet.

4053
03:20:59,780 --> 03:21:01,010
