1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,380
Very optimistic.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,181
Speaking ignorance.

4
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,014
Can I show you this?

5
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,183
What is it?

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,641
What is this?

7
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:07,761
What?

8
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:07,921
What?

9
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:08,150
What?

10
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,983
Explain what we're watching.

11
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,980
I'm not really sure.

12
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:12,080
It's some sort of patriotic musical.

13
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,771
It's called,

14
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:14,000
that's America to me.

15
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,140
Look it up on Youtube.

16
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,680
Okay,

17
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,513
so

18
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,651
can you see it?

19
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:18,900
Okay?

20
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,733
Yeah.

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,780
Mom and dad and Apple Pie.

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,750
Baseball Games and pig Nixon is a real

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,520
go see this guy by work demands
sing the song looks like Don Frye.

24
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,640
Fuck the kid with Down's syndrome.

25
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,210
Eh?

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,280
Oh my goodness.

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,890
I want to talk to that
dude about the universe.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,480
Wow.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,313
Oh,

30
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,630
just to help her fellow man.

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,810
Not afraid to give her all,

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,831
oh my God.

33
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,090
That through karate kicks this.

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,760
This is the most insane thing
I've ever seen in my life.

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,010
These people for the iTunes folks,

36
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:36,581
I'm very sorry.

37
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:40,960
These people wearing the stars and stripes
shirts and they're standing in front

38
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,910
of a big stars and
stripes thing that says,

39
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:43,744
America,

40
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,400
this is straight and Saturday.

41
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,061
It's insane.

42
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:53,000
I've never seen anything like it.

43
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,450
These people probably can't
wait for this song to answer.

44
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,830
They can just go fuck each other.

45
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,030
I bet they just snort math and fuck the
shit out of each other and then they get

46
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:01,864
mad.

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,280
They're so repressed.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,391
Oh Jesus.

49
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,320
I can't believe I did that.

50
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,070
Jesus.

51
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,790
Why?

52
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,630
We'll have the devil tell me,

53
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:07,701
well,

54
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,120
this is the last time is the last time.

55
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,400
And then they just meet in the same thing.

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,470
You just get brain surgery.

57
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,161
It's like at each other.

58
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:19,300
Pregnant should should modes
in each other make new retards.

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,210
This is all what we were talking about,

60
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:25,451
man.

61
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:28,680
This should happen to the Greeks who
have it to the Romans and having to

62
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,514
everybody.

63
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,840
Eventually the fucking tribe gets watered
down to the point where there's so

64
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,900
many of these fuckheads that people want
to pay attention to them and even want

65
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,700
to elect one of their own to
be the queen of the world.

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,191
You know,

67
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:41,881
people like that.

68
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,240
Look at it.

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,110
Look at the size of that audience,

70
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,231
man.

71
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,550
There were thousands
of people as last time.

72
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,200
You had a thousand people
for your fucking show.

73
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,220
It's been a long time.

74
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,083
Exactly.

75
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,161
It's ridiculous,

76
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:50,431
man.

77
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,050
You need to work that church angle shit.
