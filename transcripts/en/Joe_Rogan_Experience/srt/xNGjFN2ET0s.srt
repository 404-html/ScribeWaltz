00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,520
Five,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,353
four,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,253
three,

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,243
two,

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,330
one d Brennan Shab.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,160
What's up doe that texting people?

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,431
No,

8
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm reposting your posts,

9
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,503
man.

10
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,520
People didn't talk about that,

11
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:14,810
bro.

12
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,350
You gotta be on top of
that social media count,

13
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:16,710
Bro.

14
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,543
I'm trying man.

15
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,173
What's up?

16
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,310
How are you brother?

17
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,180
I'm good man.

18
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,440
This is a big weekend.

19
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,340
Big Ufc weekend.

20
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,460
Each weekend that just engaging and Eddie
Alvarez fight first team all violence.

21
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,180
Yeah.

22
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,330
That's like a,

23
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,470
that's the one I'm thinking about.

24
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,470
Maybe more than even the title fight.

25
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,061
Uh,

26
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:36,481
yes.

27
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:40,380
There's a few more than the title
fight that it's exciting to me though.

28
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:40,980
Is it?

29
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,191
Yeah,

30
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:41,341
it's,

31
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,660
I know it's not that much to you.

32
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,553
I like it.

33
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,150
It's not that I don't like it.

34
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,990
I like,

35
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,621
I like it,

36
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,020
but I love Francis and over him.

37
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,231
Yeah.

38
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,870
And I love gay g Alvarez.

39
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,321
Yeah.

40
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:52,730
Yeah.

41
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,460
I agree.

42
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,671
You don't,

43
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,720
Alvarez is an underdog.

44
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,020
I like his shot as an underdog.

45
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,980
Wow.

46
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,870
Cause I think it's incredible.

47
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,400
As much as I love gauging,

48
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,510
I should root for more.

49
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,250
I do root for them
because we were from the,

50
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:05,611
you know,

51
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:06,420
from Daenerys word,

52
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,961
my old team,

53
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,794
stuff like that.

54
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,690
I've trained a ton with
them back in the day.

55
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,300
I just feel like at a certain level that
stand in Bang Leonard Garcia type of

56
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,340
style it at the upper echelons,

57
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,330
it can get you in trouble.

58
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,610
And if Eddie Alvarez
wants to play that game,

59
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:21,444
he's going to lose.

60
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,980
But he has the skill set to,

61
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,120
you know,

62
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,320
to win by decision.

63
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,431
Outsmart them,

64
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,840
not play that meathead game.

65
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,270
See,

66
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,760
ah,

67
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,990
this is where I disagree.

68
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,590
I don't think that Justin kg
really plays a meathead game.

69
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,390
I think he plays a will game.

70
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,950
I think he's skillful.

71
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,870
But when,

72
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,090
when there's an opportunity to get
someone to do a battle of wills,

73
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:43,980
he's more confident in his will.

74
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,690
And I think at the upper echelon,

75
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,290
you can't play that game because think
about the other guy's at 55 play that

76
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,850
game with Tony Ferguson could be running
on it goes to play that game with Ed

77
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,270
Barboza.

78
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,103
Mm.

79
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:55,861
Yeah.

80
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,150
But I want to see that.

81
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,320
No,

82
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,100
don't get me wrong.

83
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,290
No,

84
00:01:59,290 --> 00:01:59,361
no,

85
00:01:59,361 --> 00:01:59,491
no.

86
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:01,110
He's a fan favorite for sure.

87
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,400
I love gauging.

88
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,360
Absolutely love them.

89
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,620
I think at a certain level
you can't play that Chin down.

90
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,300
So filling those boats or you can
name a guy who's done it successfully.

91
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,970
Well it's all can we can't say Santina no.

92
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,940
So it's only him and he
hasn't faced the top guys yet.

93
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,391
Correct.

94
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,150
We're going to see what he's capable of
doing or whether or not he's capable of

95
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:22,920
switching it up if he has to.

96
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:27,921
But he's been able to survive 18
professional fist fights in world.

97
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,621
First of all,

98
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,660
17 of those are in world
series of fighting.

99
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,020
It's true.

100
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,530
Well first,

101
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,383
right?

102
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,710
The count a little.

103
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,300
You can not compare to the UFC.

104
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,810
No,

105
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,020
the Michael Johnson fight was the first
big that one counted and he got tagged

106
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,411
in that fight.

107
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,130
He got tagged.

108
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,270
You get lit up a little bit.

109
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,100
He got tagged and Michael Johnson,

110
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,460
uh,

111
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,850
eventually succumbed to the
violence cause he played his game.

112
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah.

113
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,810
Yeah.

114
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,810
Well at some point talking so much
shit to each other before that fight.

115
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,540
It was so like gates,

116
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,960
you just dragged him into a war.

117
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,530
What gate fee and I don't think a lot of
people realize is he's an all American

118
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,350
wrestler,

119
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,890
north,

120
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,760
northern Colorado.

121
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,430
Like that dude can wrestle
and he's athletic too.

122
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:03,700
Yeah,

123
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,140
we just,

124
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,651
he's this guy.

125
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,484
I'm good man.

126
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,680
He just wants to start an animal.

127
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:07,840
He refuse to go backwards.

128
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,471
That's sole thing.

129
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,161
It's an ego thing.

130
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,540
He doesn't want to take a step back,

131
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,900
which can get you in trouble I
think at only at a certain levels.

132
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,091
Again,

133
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:14,591
getting in trouble.

134
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:14,921
It's made them,

135
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,230
this got them this far
and he's a fan favorite.

136
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,500
But I think at the upper echelon you,

137
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
it's going to be tough,

138
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,420
but we're going to see how he adjusts.

139
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,050
Save.

140
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,750
He's in there with an Ensign Barboza book.

141
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,181
By the way.

142
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:30,181
They did Barboza and Habib
Bet your ass they did cheat.

143
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,620
Is that the Vegas fine?

144
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,710
Is that December 30th the whole
cards yet Holly Cyborg on the cards.

145
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,470
Nasty,

146
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,931
nasty car.

147
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:45,931
But that Barboza fight is so fascinating
to me because Barboza is so god damn

148
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:46,954
fast.

149
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,640
He's so fast.

150
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,710
He fucks people up with that.

151
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,810
Standup is standup is so crisp.

152
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,660
Norwin one Barboza fought
Anthony Pettis and you Mike Woo.

153
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,350
Yes.

154
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,280
You realize like,

155
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:57,701
wow,

156
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,950
this is some next level striking,

157
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,080
but you know he's vulnerable to cal by
cracked him with a jab member and cowboy

158
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,943
choked him out.

159
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,370
Yeah,

160
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,860
he's lost some kind of key
fights so he hasn't really had,

161
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,400
you know,

162
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,860
if dad Habib shows up
though looking like that,

163
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,061
you know,

164
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,680
he's just got to keep his weight down.

165
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,150
That's,

166
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,570
that's really the main thing.

167
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,180
Like I hope what Daniel
Cormier you said it's true.

168
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,901
Daniel Cormier,

169
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,390
he said that he's got a new nutritionist
and he's got them on point and he's in

170
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,560
the one seventies now.

171
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:23,750
It's,

172
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,600
which is way lighter than
he's ever been before.

173
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:25,841
You know,

174
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,980
this many weeks out of a fight,

175
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,801
I swear to God,

176
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,030
if Tiramisu ruins that,

177
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,790
I'm going to freak the fuck out.

178
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,730
What you really have to be concerned with,

179
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,290
and take this with a grain of salt,

180
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,060
because clearly I'm not a doctor,

181
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,650
but I would imagine that if you've had
not one but two instances where your body

182
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,380
shuts down from cutting weight too.

183
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,730
He had it with the Michael Johnson fight
and then he had it again in the fight

184
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,200
with Tony Ferguson where
we had to pull out.

185
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,320
But they said it was similar
to what happened in the
Michael Johnson weight cut.

186
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,213
Even worse.

187
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:54,970
Yeah.

188
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,803
But even worse.

189
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,980
Yeah.

190
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,280
Well he came in too heavy and he's
trying to drain too much water.

191
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,900
I mean it's as simple as that.

192
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,360
I think how bad it was
if you're from Russia,

193
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,493
from Russia,

194
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,180
he wrote,

195
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,700
fought with one leg and he got so bad
he had to check in with the doctor.

196
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,870
They brought him to the hospital.

197
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,801
I mean he was in,

198
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,030
his liver was shutting down and yeah,

199
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,720
he was,

200
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,331
he's kidneys.

201
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:14,620
Sorry.

202
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:14,950
Yeah,

203
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,880
it's not good.

204
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,691
Whatever it is.

205
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,400
I thought it was his liver to maybe,

206
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,300
maybe it wasn't kidneys.

207
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,140
Um,

208
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,760
but I'd read liver,

209
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,820
but I think I'd read it
from like a teammate talking
about it cause it might not

210
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,650
have been like that has
to do with weight cutting.

211
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,131
It's the kid.

212
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,640
Right.

213
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,520
And that's what fails people right
when they have like real issues.

214
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,270
Okay.

215
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,560
So,

216
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:31,710
Ooh,

217
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,710
smaller meal meat.

218
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,730
That is this weekend.

219
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,211
See,

220
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,320
this is a fight that people
aren't fucking talking about it.

221
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:36,430
No,

222
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,571
no.

223
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,310
The hooch salons on December
30th December 3rd meal.

224
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:39,670
Meek.

225
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,670
It can't make it right because
visa is he out first of all,

226
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:45,611
a meal.

227
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:45,881
Meeks.

228
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:46,271
First team.

229
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:47,104
All body.

230
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,230
How Savvis snitch needs
to snoop around Norway.

231
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,780
Yeah,

232
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,700
he's in the red.

233
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,950
It's all straight viking though.

234
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:58,280
It's get viking DNA that's like,

235
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,391
no,

236
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,710
he's just a natural freak.

237
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,220
Yeah,

238
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,300
this caught but so Zeus,

239
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:02,900
mine.

240
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,310
That's why he's a skinny guy.

241
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,360
Terrifying.

242
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,193
No one wants to fight them.

243
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,830
Nobody.

244
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,850
And no one's talking about him.

245
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:08,740
This is like Taz,

246
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,140
Dan.

247
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,690
Tell does.

248
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,523
Yeah.

249
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,573
Anybody.

250
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,370
Anybody.

251
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,950
Yeah.

252
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,330
So exciting to have him around.

253
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,120
I know he was a sleeper.

254
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,931
He said no one.

255
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,261
I feel,

256
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,350
I feel like this card though has been
kind of under the radar a little bit.

257
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,800
Little bit,

258
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,190
yeah.

259
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,530
A little bit like I
teach on Monday went bro.

260
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,240
You know Francis and Overeem fight
this weekend or day this weekend.

261
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,133
I totally forgot.

262
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,020
Did you see Francis break the
world record for the hardest punch?

263
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,760
I've skeptical hip eyes on that.

264
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,260
Oh,

265
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,093
I knew you were.

266
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm just saying how many
guys have punch that thing?

267
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,880
Have you punched it?

268
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,120
I said thousands of punched it.

269
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,720
Oh,

270
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
I saw that company.

271
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,320
He responds.

272
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Saint Joe's Twitter,

273
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,840
tweeter.

274
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,850
It's actually a competition.

275
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
They do it all over the world.

276
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,760
Did you question the thing?

277
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,090
Oh,

278
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,401
okay,

279
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:52,640
good.

280
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,920
Well we were like how many people have
done it and we found out the tire on

281
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,660
spawn came in second and then has market
and hit her with a left hook to cro.

282
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,494
Cop kick it.

283
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,440
It's a hearts punch.

284
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,220
Okay.

285
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,500
I don't think cro cop's
kicked it the hardest kick,

286
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:06,950
right?

287
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,281
Yeah,

288
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,070
but I'd like to see if Mark Hunt
hit that bitch with a left hook.

289
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,440
Right,

290
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,190
right.

291
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,860
I just need to see some of that stuff.

292
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,810
Like what other heavyweights
hit it because of course,

293
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,270
right.

294
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,100
This is huge,

295
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,890
but he might be the hardest
hitting heavyweight alive.

296
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,420
That's possible too.

297
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,610
I'd like to get car when on that thing.

298
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,010
Car went in his prime.

299
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,430
Even calling right now straight.

300
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,703
Yeah.

301
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,120
She seemed Mitchell and called
out carbon for steroids.

302
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,080
No,

303
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
she owns talking crazy shit.

304
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,743
Of course.

305
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,951
Matt does.

306
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:37,880
His name out there.

307
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,241
Yeah,

308
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,000
he is cause for the belt or
a heavyweight tournament.

309
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,110
You Know Matt spite and Roy.

310
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,710
Yeah.

311
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,460
And then they go,

312
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:43,681
you know,

313
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:44,420
shut a car,

314
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,030
went ass coker to be
an alternate on there.

315
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,060
So he gets hurt and then they
asked Matt about it and he's like,

316
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,250
I mean they need a test
that that fricking guy,

317
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,710
there's no way he's clean and just
one about this whole business.

318
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,690
Like anyone who I fight has to be clean.

319
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:59,780
I doubt Kerwin is so now
Carlin's calling out Matt now.

320
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,340
Careful what you ask for a Maddie.

321
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:01,970
Ooh.

322
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,181
Yeah.

323
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,760
Because even if he's clean it,

324
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,610
good luck.

325
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,630
Those are the owns.

326
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,020
Let's get some just
caveman bone structure.

327
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,520
A lot of anger built up.

328
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,470
You don't want that put back to France.

329
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,221
Break that record.

330
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,060
I need to see who,

331
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,520
what other heavyweights hit
that thing before I celebrate,

332
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,270
right?

333
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,103
Yeah.

334
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,191
Yeah man.

335
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:23,570
How many fucking great guys have
backs given out on in their prime?

336
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,711
That's a big one.

337
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:24,891
I mean,

338
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:25,580
Keynes.

339
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:25,960
Yeah,

340
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,590
it should be one chain's a big one.

341
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,580
Those two guys alone.

342
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,830
So the rumor was Kane fighting at UFC
two 20 in Boston against Cain and steep

343
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:34,260
bay.

344
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,610
Yeah.

345
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,390
That's not happening.

346
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,991
Not Happening.

347
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:36,470
Not Happening.

348
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,303
How do you know?

349
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,803
What do you know?

350
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,710
Tell us.

351
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,850
Tell close sources.

352
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,481
It's not what came.

353
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,020
Won't be ready.

354
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,770
Not Happening.

355
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,250
Steve.

356
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,941
Steve Bay of fight.

357
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,260
The winner if it,

358
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,740
depending if the good of Francis over him.

359
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,880
So what is the sort of,

360
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,151
what's,

361
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,590
what's the issue that's holding them back?

362
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,813
I'm not sure.

363
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,300
I just know you won't be ready to
buy some sort of recovery issue.

364
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,170
Some injury thing.

365
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:58,600
Something.

366
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm just not ready.

367
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,290
Say No bullshit.

368
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,513
Wow.

369
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,361
They chose to,

370
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,910
they have a fight for
that January 20th not yet.

371
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,930
That's really soon.

372
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,591
Yeah.

373
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,610
January 20th yeah.

374
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,510
Isn't that seem soon?

375
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,590
Pretty soon.

376
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,950
Yeah,

377
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,783
definitely sooner.

378
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,820
Two months you,

379
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,280
especially if it's a
heavyweight title fight.

380
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,080
Yeah,

381
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,050
it's less than two months.

382
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,603
That's soon.

383
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,420
Yeah.

384
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,570
And I'm hoping for a big
fight announcement cause
I'm at the Wilbur the night

385
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,181
before.

386
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:22,500
Sir.

387
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,850
What else is on that card already?

388
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,241
Wow.

389
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,810
It's really a well really light.

390
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,140
Really well there.

391
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,120
They're getting around to Urbino Boston,

392
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,700
this Dane,

393
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,451
his hometown.

394
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:34,980
So He's not going to disappoint.

395
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,910
Glace and t bow back in the
house after a pest and hot.

396
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,960
What is he going to look like?

397
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,220
Not like that.

398
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,120
What do you think is going to look like?

399
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,670
Cause he's the freakiest of
the freaks at 155 pounds.

400
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,653
He was,

401
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,360
those days are over,

402
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,491
dude.

403
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,840
He would come into the Octagon,

404
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,800
oh my God.

405
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,843
On fight night.

406
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,271
And you're like,

407
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,180
how the fuck are you 155 in the world?

408
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,470
How the fuck are you?

409
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,304
Not a middle weight.

410
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,250
He's a middle weight.

411
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:00,901
I mean,

412
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,950
I'm not exaggerating.

413
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,780
He looked like a fucking middleweight.

414
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,780
He looked like Paul Harris when
Paul Harris was the middle weight.

415
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,180
He looked like glaze and t ball.

416
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:08,910
It looks when he's,

417
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,743
yeah,

418
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,150
so jacked and skillful.

419
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,290
Hell yeah.

420
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,610
You know he's gonna Bounce bounced.

421
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,620
He's a fucking animal.

422
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,750
So he's got everything going.

423
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,410
But I was disappointed that steeping
Cain wasn't going to go down because I

424
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,270
think if Steve Bay beats cane,

425
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,390
then there's argument for steep pays
the best heavyweight of all time.

426
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,710
If we were to beat Cain,

427
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,860
well if he beats Cain healthy cane,

428
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,580
that's,

429
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,150
see the thing is what we
really need is time machine.

430
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,570
We need to fucking take primetime cane
and stick them in pride with primetime

431
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,900
fader.

432
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,733
Let's find out.

433
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,150
And you got to do it in pride
too because with no commissions,

434
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,600
I don't know what the fuck
they were doing over there,

435
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,800
but I know the result,

436
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,860
if I'm just looking at the result
as a person who's an analyst,

437
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,990
I got to look at prime time fade or as
number one prime time fade or throwing

438
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,400
bombs on Nogueira when he's pinned
against the fucking ring apron Trevor,

439
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,470
that garrison the corner
faders on top of them,

440
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,690
just dropping those casting punches,

441
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,780
those crazy Russian
punches to come like this.

442
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,160
I am just,

443
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,640
Ooh.

444
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,270
That's why it's,

445
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,030
it's difficult when [inaudible]
who's the best of all time?

446
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:15,721
It's like all right,

447
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:19,830
well we go on off pre snitch or are we
going snitch here cause we go golden

448
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:20,664
snitch.

449
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,560
You got steeper yet.

450
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,390
But even if you don't know
who the golden snitches is,

451
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,010
Jeff says Devinsky and again,

452
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:26,844
that's not a,

453
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,850
it's not a bad time.

454
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,860
He's coming on the podcast.

455
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,990
We're working date out
right now and I'm a fan.

456
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,640
I liked the guy he's doing.

457
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:32,821
Yeah,

458
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:33,090
I'm not,

459
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,110
when I say Golden Snitch,

460
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,580
I'm just playing around with four.

461
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,500
Used to be who had the best cheater,

462
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,820
who had the best chemists,

463
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,080
who had the best doctors,

464
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440
the best doctor who had the best guy
that could make you test positive or test

465
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,920
clean rather after the way in.

466
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,980
That's all you had to do
except for looking at him.

467
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,671
He's a guy,

468
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:47,911
you know,

469
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,620
find this weekend where you,

470
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,230
obviously he's done some stuff,

471
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,140
some guarantees life,

472
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:53,530
and he's been,

473
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,460
he's tested hot and just paid the price
and then the golden snitch comes in and

474
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:57,971
his team goes,

475
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:58,600
I dude,

476
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,130
you can't just rely on power.

477
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,230
You'll start using a
technique which you have.

478
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,100
So let's focus on it.

479
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,510
He's doing pretty damn well.

480
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:05,041
Pretty damn well.

481
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,190
He had that one loss before.

482
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:06,900
It's that loss.

483
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,241
Stevie,

484
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,560
he was smoking dudes.

485
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,070
His lost a steep bay.

486
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,430
Wasn't that bad cause he had
steep in a lot of trouble.

487
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:12,930
Definitely.

488
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,571
We actually thought,

489
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:13,930
you know,

490
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,530
in the post fight kicked,

491
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,051
kicked me us,

492
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:17,701
they choked him out.

493
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,300
He tap that myrtle thing.

494
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,950
Guys were stunned.

495
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:21,910
That was a close fight though.

496
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:22,510
Very close.

497
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,291
And then he goes on,

498
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:23,531
you know,

499
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:23,861
beats,

500
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:24,610
we're doomed.

501
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,640
His last fight and now he's
fighting Francis where you know,

502
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:28,960
that's not obviously it's France.

503
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,100
Tough fight fray Frances,

504
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:30,791
the favorite,

505
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,830
but dude over him was the best striker,

506
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,200
most decorated striker of all time,

507
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,820
the heavyweight division like
over and can win that fight.

508
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,391
You know,

509
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:41,410
I broke down in my podcast how many
times over it's been stopped on the last

510
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:42,244
podcast,

511
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,510
last MMA podcasts.

512
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,300
It's crazy in 19 I don't mind,

513
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,480
I think it's like 13 and MMA or somewhere
between 11 and 13 and MMA and an

514
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:54,610
additional three or four and kickboxing.

515
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,150
A lot of stoppage losses.

516
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,931
It's a lot.

517
00:12:58,931 --> 00:12:59,360
But tink,

518
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,540
he's been fighting more than anyone to,

519
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:01,870
yeah.

520
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,940
But if you look at the last few years,

521
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,940
there's an exorbitant amount
of losses by stoppage.

522
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,930
For over him.

523
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,763
Yeah.

524
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,070
Yeah.

525
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,431
It's like,

526
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,170
it's quite a few number of things,

527
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:11,580
right.

528
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,970
It's the all the,

529
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,470
all the wear and tear in the ring.

530
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,180
Then also not being able to do gear.

531
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,661
See,

532
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,440
look,

533
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,610
Ben Rothwell,

534
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,630
Travis Browne,

535
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,090
the big foot silver one
that all of those have,

536
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:22,640
hold on.

537
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,500
Don't let her go back.

538
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,190
Um,

539
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,521
those,

540
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:27,820
all of those happen inside
of a couple of years.

541
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:28,061
Man,

542
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:28,900
it's one year,

543
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,930
but also one year from February of 2013
literally to September of 2014 that's

544
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:39,700
not much time and he's been brutally
knocked out three times in that time.

545
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,640
Well at least two of them are really
brutal to Ben Rothwell fight was like,

546
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,720
he got cracked with a big shot and
dropped and then they stopped the fight.

547
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:47,640
I think at a good time.

548
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,420
It could happen to anybody
that could happen to anybody,

549
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,600
but the big foot fight that wasn't a
regular k o that was goddamn ruthless.

550
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,560
Travis Brown and got him pretty bad
to that front kick to the grill.

551
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,730
Big Foot fight was so interesting
though because it was so obviously post

552
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:04,564
snitch.

553
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:04,990
Yup.

554
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,520
It was just,

555
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,640
he didn't figure it out yet.

556
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:06,851
Ooh.

557
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:11,200
Burrim when he beat Brock Lesner
that was the ubering Securus man.

558
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,260
Never entered an doctor.

559
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,750
Ever Naf fight.

560
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:18,751
When you look across the octagon to 65
maybe 10% body fat jack to the tits check

561
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,074
please.

562
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,230
I'm a health and best
kick boxer to ever fight.

563
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,970
How about Oh Jesus,

564
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:25,804
what does it,

565
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,010
what are you going to do now man?

566
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,570
And then he figures it out though.

567
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,261
You have that.

568
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,210
And then he figured out and
junior dos Santos fight.

569
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,651
Yeah,

570
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:36,370
but and now he'll before backhoe Uber
ream up when his ubering before the golden

571
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:36,790
snitch.

572
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,820
Good luck back in that dude,

573
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,291
that dude,

574
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,660
you're paying the price now I'm a fucking
will turn his back and run out and go

575
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,130
right on and it works.

576
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,161
Hey,

577
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,530
just get the fuck out of
there by any means necessary.

578
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,360
I wonder if he would ever be,

579
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:49,511
you know,

580
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:52,040
that was one of the things that
your own brought about Joe Silva.

581
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,910
He said that Joe Silva told him that he
got a small ring or that it was going to

582
00:14:55,911 --> 00:15:00,860
be a large ring when he fought
Roy big country and it wasn't.

583
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:01,650
It was a small ring,

584
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,121
so he was,

585
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,470
he said that he was upset about that.

586
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,270
I've had that happen before too though.

587
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,490
But again,

588
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm not defending.

589
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,650
Joe Silva have worked
a ton with Joe Silva,

590
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:10,880
obviously all over the years.

591
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,040
It doesn't really work like that.

592
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,821
It really doesn't work.

593
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,120
You can make demands on the cage and
and asked for this and asked for that.

594
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,460
It is what it is and you
might prefer something.

595
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:19,731
They're like,

596
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:20,270
yeah,

597
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,811
maybe.

598
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,540
But Joe Silva's dealing with
so many different dynamics,

599
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,261
the cage,

600
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:24,680
he goes,

601
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:24,891
hey,

602
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:25,581
what's the case?

603
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,031
So am I go,

604
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:26,900
it's a 24 foot.

605
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,111
All right,

606
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:27,530
cool.

607
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:27,671
Yeah,

608
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:28,431
it gets the bigger cage.

609
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,360
You want to fight or not man,

610
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,070
like there's so much going on.

611
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,650
I don't think he purposely
lied to Matt and was like,

612
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,520
it's a big cage.

613
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,270
Take the fight.

614
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,500
But I'm wonder like what fights would
be like if the cage is much smaller,

615
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,780
less technique.

616
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,430
You're going to get a
bunch of gates he fights,

617
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,230
which is in a bad thing.

618
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,030
But if you're a technical guy,

619
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,260
like mitre owned with has,

620
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,700
who's crazy athletic with footwork
or a Barboza or Conor McGregor,

621
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,410
you don't want that small cage.

622
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,930
It limits your resources
and your abilities.

623
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,370
You get smothered and it cuts all your
angles short everything off the off the

624
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:01,881
exchange.

625
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:04,880
Like if you're too close to a cage and
anything off have to exchange a cut and

626
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,320
short,

627
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,680
like you're gonna run into the cage.

628
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,400
So now you can't go back that way because
you won't get out of the way the shot

629
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,270
and you can't go back that way.

630
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,590
So you have like limited
amount of movements that
you can make it the gracilis

631
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,001
paradise.

632
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:15,380
Yeah.

633
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,880
Well it's also a brawlers paradise.

634
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:17,091
Right?

635
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,650
So those two things can be good if,

636
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:18,940
if,

637
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,740
if the fight was done in a
smaller outdoor and could be,

638
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,574
would never lose.

639
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:22,970
Yeah.

640
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,420
I think.

641
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,631
Yeah,

642
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,081
for sure.

643
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:28,220
But I think also one thing that I would
favor is like real high level Muay Thai

644
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,780
guys cause they're clincher.

645
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,021
Yeah.

646
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:30,860
They're always clinching.

647
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,031
And,

648
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,221
and,

649
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:32,840
and going after each other.

650
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,321
You know,

651
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,940
and I think that that style,

652
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:38,260
like the Muy Thai style is not like
a Wonderboy style with their slide.

653
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,230
Now the way of everything,

654
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,700
they're standing right in front of you
and checking things and attacking clinch.

655
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,360
I don't think it would
be better for the sport.

656
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,070
Maybe not better for the sport,

657
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,800
but it would be interesting to
see how it favors certain styles.

658
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,400
And I think that it would favor a
good wrestler with real good Moitai.

659
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,750
I think it would ever be a
real good environment for them.

660
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,980
You think if,

661
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,350
let's say Francis were to just start
over in which listen over to music,

662
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,610
watch his p's and q's or 15 minutes,

663
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:07,370
you need to use this technique
run when you have to.

664
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,990
Even even if people don't like it,

665
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,040
you win by decision.

666
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:10,874
Great man.

667
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,730
But if he doesn't watch the p's
and q's and gets starts by Francis,

668
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,770
you think Francis deserves
a shot right away.

669
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,910
It's Francis Starches and Francis is
the hottest commodity in the heavyweight

670
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,360
division.

671
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,490
So he deserves a shot.

672
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,890
Yeah.

673
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,100
I think Overeem is ranked number one.

674
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,271
No,

675
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,050
he's number one canes.

676
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,883
Not Number one.

677
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,763
No.

678
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,280
Okay.

679
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,570
So He's number one is,

680
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,440
which is crazy for him to take this
fight and for dooms number two.

681
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,180
So no one knows.

682
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,020
And that's really,

683
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,920
that's really nuts.

684
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,100
Cause that fight like that the,

685
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:39,950
those two had,

686
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,890
boy that was as close to fight as you
can get and most people thought that for

687
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,720
doing one.

688
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:44,901
Yeah.

689
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:45,711
I think for doom,

690
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,040
doom,

691
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,290
doom,

692
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,330
heroin got robbed.

693
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,130
No one got robbed,

694
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,980
but it was,

695
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,100
she'll fight for doom.

696
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,080
Heard him and over him.

697
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
Never really hurt for doing.

698
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:53,580
Not,

699
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,690
not the same way.

700
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,010
At least I'm sure he hit him hard,

701
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,100
I thought were doing when the fight
I've taught for doing one to fight too.

702
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I thought that one brown where
he rocked him and hurt him.

703
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:02,880
That should have been,

704
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,190
that was the most significant
moment of the fight for sure.

705
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,330
So how do you not make Francis go
through for doom to get to steepen?

706
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,061
That's interesting.

707
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,980
It's a very good question because
that's a tougher matchup for Francis.

708
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:12,790
Then over him.

709
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,390
It's a very,

710
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,840
something mother felt.

711
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,980
I don't know what's
going on with Steve Bay.

712
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,960
Why don't they have a
challenger for Steve Bay?

713
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,310
Like why is that heavy weight division?

714
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:21,390
It's a bunch of dinosaurs.

715
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,661
Right,

716
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:22,680
but is that what it is?

717
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:22,891
I mean,

718
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,920
cause I had heard that there
was some contract negotiations.

719
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:25,560
Shit going on.

720
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,940
There's,

721
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,773
there's that.

722
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,300
Yeah,

723
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,020
I've heard that.

724
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,880
I know where that Penn's
been sucking on that pen.

725
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:30,341
It's just not,

726
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:30,931
I just put it here.

727
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:32,780
I don't suck on it and I will suck on it.

728
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,623
I'll put on my lip.

729
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,120
I won't suck on a tall Nah man.

730
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,950
Just the tip will suck on it though.

731
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,163
Um,

732
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,450
I lived on the outside.

733
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,330
I know,

734
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,340
I know Steve Bay's ready
to go for February.

735
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Yes.

736
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,270
Yeah.

737
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,290
So they just don't have a car.

738
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,580
They don't have an opponent for him.

739
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,500
Maybe they'll try to do
it for January for Boston.

740
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,041
They're,

741
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,371
they're,

742
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:51,510
they're hoping that,

743
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,290
you know,

744
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,300
Francis in this over him thing work out.

745
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,140
Yeah,

746
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,800
because listen,

747
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,361
I was very mad.

748
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:57,150
It's too soon.

749
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,880
A rematch with Steve Bay for over him.

750
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,030
It's a very interesting fight.

751
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,200
It's very interesting.

752
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,870
Can sell it.

753
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,540
Especially if he beats Francis who
everyone is so high and mighty on.

754
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah.

755
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,690
If you were to get by him,

756
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,740
how can you deny it?

757
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,011
Yeah,

758
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:08,580
it's true.

759
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,570
Frances is just,

760
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:09,920
whew.

761
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,753
Whew.

762
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,810
Whew,

763
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,450
whew.

764
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,290
I'm not on board yet.

765
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,440
I'm terrified.

766
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,740
Have you seen him fight live?

767
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,091
Uh,

768
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:18,924
no.

769
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,380
Nope.

770
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,870
I have not.

771
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,880
Should be illegal and foot

772
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,141
easy.

773
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,100
It's have you seen over in fight?

774
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,741
Have you seen him?

775
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,650
Me fucking Mark Kahn Indo.

776
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,580
The Brock Lesnar fight was probably
the scariest one because I was like,

777
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,110
this guy is the greatest
heavyweight of all time,

778
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,470
but he smashed Rockledge.

779
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,001
Only time I'm like,

780
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:36,391
oh my God.

781
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,470
What if he could do that to Cain
was a superhero where it's like,

782
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,690
ah,

783
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:39,961
fuck,

784
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,940
I don't have the resources
to get on the same shit.

785
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,020
But now that he's off
the shit and he flatline,

786
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,660
Mark Hunt,

787
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,560
that's scary to meet.

788
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:46,920
If they had,

789
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,221
I know,

790
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:47,670
right?

791
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:47,881
What did,

792
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,020
they had no testing though.

793
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:49,620
None.

794
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,230
Zero like he able to make like the,

795
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,670
the testing requirements is
minimal as they were back then.

796
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,120
He able,

797
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,020
he pulled it off.

798
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,640
He tested clean gay day.

799
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,541
Imagine if there was,

800
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,000
God bless.

801
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,950
No fucking Desi.

802
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,090
Like he had a cycle off.

803
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,840
Yeah.

804
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,410
Like what if he's looked
like that cycling?

805
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,930
It looks like that,

806
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,070
but think about this.

807
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,080
Francis is as natural as
fucking coconut water.

808
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,120
That mother fuckers all natural.

809
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,520
Now imagine if he could take something.

810
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,180
Okay,

811
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,110
then what do we do?

812
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,401
No problem.

813
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:21,200
We've got a real problem.

814
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,020
Shred city hits harder than anyone
now and eating fricking plantation.

815
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,620
There's Overeem in the Uber theme days.

816
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,320
Bom Bom browns is no pump though.

817
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,230
Bring up Francis that fine mode.

818
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
The skin prime.

819
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,440
Ooh,

820
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,140
Brene versus prime tank Abbott.

821
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:37,890
Who takes it?

822
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,220
I get the fuck out of
hilarious Sally dear.

823
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,320
You're so silly.

824
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,371
Yeah,

825
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:45,360
he doesn't look the same,

826
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,500
but he doesn't look bad.

827
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,570
Like if he was just a heavyweight fighter
and he was built the way he's built

828
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,640
now you would say he's a powerful guy.

829
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,470
I mean if you see him in his last fight,

830
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,870
pull up the last fight
with him versus Mark Hunt.

831
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,320
I mean,

832
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,600
he definitely doesn't
look like a small guy.

833
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,870
He's still somewhere around
the two 50 something range.

834
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,730
Everyone's body's luge guy.

835
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,890
Literally everyone's
bodies look different.

836
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,430
Yeah.

837
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,900
Everybody's,

838
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,733
they look different.

839
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,050
Eric Silva was a big one
that people kept bringing up.

840
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,621
Like he looks,

841
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:12,840
he's ladies time piece.

842
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,330
Yeah.

843
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,010
And then it just all changed.

844
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,620
You have a see like you look at Alister,

845
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:17,111
they're like,

846
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,000
he's just got more body fat,

847
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,900
more stomach fat,

848
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:21,670
less muscle is a little bit of a guy.

849
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,520
Like he has almost a dad bod
that worked out on the weekend.

850
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,130
I wouldn't say that you said that.

851
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:26,530
Not me.

852
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:26,790
Well,

853
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,060
the fit dad bought though.

854
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:28,481
You know what I'm saying?

855
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,410
Like an active dad.

856
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:29,681
Yeah.

857
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:30,610
I mean he's just,

858
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,110
but what's interesting is that he's
such a fighter that gear or no gear.

859
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,690
I mean he comes to fucking fight.

860
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,110
He comes to kill you because he is the
best technique to look at that fucking

861
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:41,560
chaos.

862
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,220
Oh my gosh.

863
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,053
Flatline mark.

864
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,931
You know,

865
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,530
Mark Cup flew to Vegas to get all this
stuff checked off the brain scan all

866
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:47,800
that.

867
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,940
And what did they say about it?

868
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,340
I'm not sure but,

869
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,100
but he at least made the effort to fly
from Australia to there so he can clear

870
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:54,431
this up.

871
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,080
You get back in the cage because again,

872
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,850
I think for Francis it,

873
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,530
unless he does an argument,

874
00:21:59,531 --> 00:21:59,651
you know,

875
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,800
if he just goes out there and
starches over him in 10 seconds,

876
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:03,221
like all right,

877
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,630
well we've got to figure
out what he's worth.

878
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,590
Let's give him steeper.

879
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,330
But if he doesn't,

880
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,841
man,

881
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:11,090
you could give a mark con that's a great
fight and give them for doom cause you

882
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,080
gotta walk to do some fire cause look at
the fire Steve Bay walked through to be

883
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:14,710
the heavyweight.

884
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,490
It's a good point.

885
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,031
And you know,

886
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:18,160
he really is only beaten our Lawsky.

887
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,300
It's just where we're looking at,

888
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:19,870
um,

889
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,580
at the,

890
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,770
the magnitude of his performances
against guys that were in,

891
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,580
in his league.

892
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,761
You know,

893
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,970
it's like you just see the
magnitude of his impact.

894
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,750
Like he's,

895
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,010
he's a guy that you'd go woo,

896
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,210
who the fuck's gonna stop that?

897
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,070
But they're all favorable.

898
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,020
Matchups Yup.

899
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,581
You know what I'm saying?

900
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,890
It's like your favorite baseball player.

901
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,620
He's only hitting off the pitcher who
we know he can hit home run off of.

902
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,010
When you give them a guy who actually
can so some junk and he's not as good,

903
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:42,281
you know,

904
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,210
or if he hits that guy,

905
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,320
I think he is what he's worth.

906
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,080
Well prime time came when
it showed us what was up,

907
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,771
you know,

908
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,000
a prime time came versus him
where you can get them down,

909
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,590
hold him down,

910
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,090
beat him mind time cane,

911
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,920
you know I,

912
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,190
you know,

913
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,320
I also think Steve Bay right now,

914
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:56,921
he might,

915
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,190
you know he's in his prime,

916
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,080
might be at the end of his prime,

917
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,000
but he's going to,

918
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,970
he's in his prime.

919
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,271
Yeah.

920
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:01,481
Things.

921
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,280
I don't think Steve Bay's at
the end of his prime at all.

922
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,840
I think Steve Bay's right in there.

923
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,271
He's in the,

924
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:07,690
he's right there where he
could get Francis and he's,

925
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,130
I want to see Francis Wrestle.

926
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:09,964
That's all going to see.

927
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,570
But again from sources they said I'm a,

928
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,960
he's a nightmare to take down.

929
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,913
I believe it.

930
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,860
I mean it looks so God damn
strong and the way he hits,

931
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,320
I mean he hits your,

932
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:19,570
your,

933
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,530
your window of opening is so little
and your mistakes are so costly.

934
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,540
Anytime you make a mistake with him,

935
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,730
you just get bombed on so hard.

936
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,380
You're like no buck.

937
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,990
But when you got a guy like
Cain or steep it where they go,

938
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:32,860
I know he got power,

939
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:36,100
I'll put my chest in your
fricking chess for 25 minutes.

940
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,340
I put my head straight and your
chest good like firing off man.

941
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:39,731
Oh,

942
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:40,570
when you do fire off,

943
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:41,404
I'm gonna take you down.

944
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,080
At least keep you busy so you can't
just fire off and not deal with that

945
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,350
combinations on you with constant barrage.

946
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:49,700
Stop and strikes.

947
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,450
Keith,

948
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,730
Keith haring you over and over again.

949
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,600
Ammar fis,

950
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,560
elbows,

951
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,371
punches,

952
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:55,910
punches,

953
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,361
punches.

954
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,194
You never get tired of.

955
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,600
Francis is similar to me as a jds.

956
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,040
He similar,

957
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,730
similar where,

958
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,180
you know,

959
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,013
decent footwork.

960
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,550
I don't think he's athletic as Jds,

961
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:05,420
but good footwork,

962
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,440
power puncher.

963
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,350
But when you get a guy like Steve Bear
Cain who don't play that game on the

964
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,021
outside with the,

965
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:10,970
I just want to get dirty.

966
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,871
You're in some trouble,

967
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:12,190
man.

968
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,950
Well it's going to be interesting to
see if he's in some trouble because you

969
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:17,180
know if he could stop the take down,

970
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,830
if he can keep those guys
standing up with them,

971
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,590
then you're going to see some nightmares
because he's getting better all the

972
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:21,860
time.

973
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,760
The thing about Francis,

974
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,350
he hasn't even really
been fighting that long.

975
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,330
He doesn't have this long crazy record.

976
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,080
No,

977
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,471
not at all.

978
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,400
In the UFC was like,

979
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,230
you might be something special.

980
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,300
Let's come to Vegas and you just
worked out in this sports center.

981
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,290
We inject this bane supplement and
you whatever the fuck it is you,

982
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,630
you don't even want him
to use protein powder.

983
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:40,760
He's worried about testing hot.

984
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Wow.

985
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,680
He takes nothing good.

986
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:43,850
Perfect.

987
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,500
We needed to see what the fuck's possible.

988
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,190
I agree.

989
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,720
What kind of genetics are there out there?

990
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,380
I agree.

991
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,130
He's like,

992
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,641
you know what?

993
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:54,140
We were talking yesterday
about a Bo Jackson Callen
and I were going on about Bo

994
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,170
Jackson.

995
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,810
But there's certain athletes
that in their prime,

996
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:59,870
they just like were just a
notch above everything else,

997
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,760
like just out of the womb.

998
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,180
It was on just a different animal.

999
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,540
They didn't all start at
the same starting line.

1000
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,141
Herschel Walker,

1001
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,580
another good example like freak.

1002
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,300
What's that?

1003
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,010
Now see my prom,

1004
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,610
you,

1005
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,680
we can't put France and
that discussion yet.

1006
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:13,310
Not yet.

1007
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,300
Not even close,

1008
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,570
not even close to there yet.

1009
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:17,404
Some work to do,

1010
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,630
not in this as far as
greatness and accomplishments,

1011
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,493
freakish,

1012
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,330
but as far as like physical freak.

1013
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,310
Yeah.

1014
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,143
I don't know either,

1015
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,500
but Francis scares the shit out of me.

1016
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:28,700
When you watch him hit people,

1017
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,750
it's boom.

1018
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:30,351
You see them go,

1019
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:31,184
oh Jesus.

1020
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,460
He's just so big and so powerful and so
undeniable when he comes moving in for

1021
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,560
the kill is undeniable.

1022
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,940
It very scary guy.

1023
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,920
But you're totally right.

1024
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,790
He's gotta be tested.

1025
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,661
We've seen many,

1026
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:46,310
many guys like him go bust.

1027
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,270
Overeem is,

1028
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:47,520
uh,

1029
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:47,750
he,

1030
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,170
he's a test but Overeem's
a guy where for 15 minutes,

1031
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,200
if Francis lands that fricking bomb of
his and you know over and is probably

1032
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,190
going out because it's
Chin's not the same.

1033
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,680
He's been in so many up and down wars,

1034
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,340
you know,

1035
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,173
and he's um,

1036
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,190
for instance is a naturally bigger man.

1037
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,310
I mean you gotta remember Alster fought
a two oh five before he fought chuck at

1038
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,630
two Oh five used to be real skinny.

1039
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,140
That's right.

1040
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,420
Francis is a big motherfucker.

1041
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,410
He's big.

1042
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,400
I mean he is,

1043
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,690
he's a natural 265 pound man thick dude.

1044
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,380
Yeah,

1045
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,140
that's a dangerous guy because
if in the beginning of the fight,

1046
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,540
especially he's,

1047
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,150
it'd be pushed pressure and he moves
forward and puts pressure and he's like

1048
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,600
real explosive and fast.

1049
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:28,820
But something gets in there,

1050
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,990
something gets in there.

1051
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,440
Here,

1052
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,810
here's the x factor is
over him in the clinch.

1053
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,620
There's no one better than
the heavyweight division.

1054
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,031
It's true.

1055
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:38,480
We haven't seen Frances in the clinch
with a worldclass guy like over him.

1056
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,860
Cause again over and we've,

1057
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,590
we forget cause the demolition
man has been around so long,

1058
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,800
he gets in that clinch,

1059
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,491
those elbows,

1060
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:47,220
those knees best needs in
that a fucking division.

1061
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:47,770
God.

1062
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,500
Yeah.

1063
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,333
Yeah.

1064
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,820
I mean yeah,

1065
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:51,870
that's Fujita one.

1066
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,973
Yeah.

1067
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:53,570
Yeah.

1068
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,870
Those,

1069
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,840
that was horrifying.

1070
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,200
Yeah.

1071
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,260
It was killed a guy who's that
other guy that kickboxer to share?

1072
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:03,261
I think the kickboxer that'd be fought
over and k one where they decided to uh,

1073
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,320
make it so he could only hold one hand
behind the head cause Alster would get

1074
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:08,340
two hands by in your head.

1075
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:09,300
And that was 99.

1076
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,250
Demolition man.

1077
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,270
Just dropped those knees on your chin.

1078
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,920
The funnest file in the car to me.

1079
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,820
Francis over him.

1080
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,870
Just where they go,

1081
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:16,631
the career path,

1082
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:17,464
stuff like that.

1083
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,270
I say,

1084
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,750
um,

1085
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,520
the Gagey Alvarez one is,

1086
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,570
but they're both right up there.

1087
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,760
They're either one.

1088
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,360
Look,

1089
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,280
there's three giant fights in his card.

1090
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,830
The Aldo Holloway fight
is a giant fight for me.

1091
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,940
I want that fine.

1092
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:30,630
I want to see it.

1093
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,280
I liked the fight just if we're going
off all those words saying he did have

1094
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:36,420
issues with his legs.

1095
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,650
That's why he wasn't kicking before.

1096
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,900
I don't buy it.

1097
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:40,561
I really don't buy it.

1098
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:41,100
And if for that,

1099
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,540
if that was true,

1100
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,680
I don't but kept because in his
previous sites and fights after that,

1101
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:48,510
he hasn't been using all of his tools.

1102
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,080
Well,

1103
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,820
I think there's a
strategy for that though.

1104
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:51,960
The Frankie Edgar fight,

1105
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,770
I'm really believed that he didn't use
his kicks because I think he felt like

1106
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:59,520
Frankie was training for those kicks and
he was training to kick take them down

1107
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:00,390
off the leg kicks.

1108
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,530
Everyone kicks though.

1109
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,311
We know all that,

1110
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,560
but he's got damn good at.

1111
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,403
He didn't write.

1112
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,700
He just pleased to me.

1113
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:09,630
He's become very fundamental
in just boxing plant his feet.

1114
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,610
He's gotten away from what
got them to the dance.

1115
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,730
Maybe.

1116
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,460
Maybe or we can go,

1117
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,271
he was hurt if we,

1118
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:15,451
yeah,

1119
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:18,210
if we're basing it on those two
fights and if you have to believe him,

1120
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:20,520
and I'm just going to believe I'm
just for the sake of believing him.

1121
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,700
If he says his leg was hurt,

1122
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:22,380
it makes sense.

1123
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,540
It also makes sense how he
was getting tired quick.

1124
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,850
You got tired pretty quick
in that fight and they did,

1125
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:28,560
which if he had a leg
injury it would make sense.

1126
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:30,000
You wouldn't be able to
push as hard and camp.

1127
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:30,700
And he was,

1128
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,370
he was winning those early rounds.

1129
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,030
There was a huge speed advantage for
all Aldona early in those rounds.

1130
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,710
And then Max Hollywood took over.

1131
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:37,951
Yeah.

1132
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,450
Well Max Holloway measures you,

1133
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,691
you know,

1134
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:42,540
he doesn't burn himself out early
and he's got tremendous endurance.

1135
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,850
He measures you and he
starts putting it on you,

1136
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:45,684
putting it on you.

1137
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,660
What Max is really good
at is distance control,

1138
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,380
really good at movement and distance
control and just not being there.

1139
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,940
It's also adding speaking long.

1140
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Yup.

1141
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,170
And the kill does it in the cut doesn't
kill him for one 45 he's very tall,

1142
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,790
very physically striking.

1143
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,620
Mack truck hits like a truck and
he's just got that thing his,

1144
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,450
you're savage champion warriors spirit.

1145
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,000
You're going to have to kill
him and get him out of the man.

1146
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:09,834
And he's just,

1147
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,760
he's a fascinating guy.

1148
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,710
Cause he's like Hawaiian to the bone.

1149
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,573
Yes or no.

1150
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,410
And you go over to Hawaii,

1151
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:16,681
man,

1152
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:20,370
and he has the next shot
at being like the new Bj,

1153
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,360
Bj Penn.

1154
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,270
Bj Penn is a legend and he's a legend
from the early days and he's alleged and

1155
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:27,600
when he went up to heavyweight,

1156
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,130
fought Leo Machida,

1157
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,370
Bj was up fucking monster.

1158
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,480
And his favorite people.

1159
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:33,670
Yeah,

1160
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,503
a monster.

1161
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,370
So it's going to be a while before
max gets into those lofty grounds,

1162
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:39,181
but he's on his way.

1163
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,014
He's on his way.

1164
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,200
And what's interesting is Bj and Max
are to the nicest guys in the world.

1165
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,711
Super Nice.

1166
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:45,850
They both have that in common.

1167
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,780
And the both from Hawaii.

1168
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:48,040
Both monsters.

1169
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,030
No,

1170
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,930
Matt Max could,

1171
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,270
especially at one 45 because he,

1172
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,760
the Conners never going back there for,

1173
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,371
for Max.

1174
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:54,850
He could,

1175
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,180
he could be a Bj Penn type.

1176
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,591
Yeah.

1177
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:58,170
I wonder if he challenges Connor.

1178
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,600
No.

1179
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,080
If child,

1180
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,190
if Connor comes back,

1181
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:00,520
who knows?

1182
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,360
What did Conor do?

1183
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,980
Did you just get in a brawl in a bar?

1184
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:03,923
Is that real?

1185
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,610
Oh,

1186
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,443
it's so,

1187
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,611
you know,

1188
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:07,690
in Dana White Scrim,

1189
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:08,021
he goes,

1190
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:08,590
listen,

1191
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,730
if it was that big,

1192
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,960
there'd be more video of it.

1193
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,501
Dan Goes,

1194
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:11,750
I,

1195
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,890
I'm Dana's basically saying I'm
skeptical hip that happened.

1196
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,850
People that I know in Dublin and
that are blowing me up or saying,

1197
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:19,030
dude,

1198
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,050
it's real colors,

1199
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,070
a bit of trouble.

1200
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,220
Cause he has a friend from one area of
Ireland that's in this mafia and that got

1201
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,490
beat up by these guys.

1202
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,250
Connor finds out the guys who beat
up his friend are in this bar.

1203
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,710
It's kind of comes in and
beats the hell out of that guy.

1204
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,510
Well that guy's associated with this,

1205
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:34,901
you know,

1206
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,780
pretty intense mafia family over there.

1207
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,400
So now there's a hit out on Connor's,

1208
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:40,590
what they're saying what?

1209
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,350
Yes,

1210
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,490
for 900 gram.

1211
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,620
What now?

1212
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:45,161
How much is that?

1213
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:45,850
It's true.

1214
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,470
How much of it is speculation?

1215
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,333
I'm not sure.

1216
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,960
Holy Shit.

1217
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,360
And cause on my podcast I was like,

1218
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,601
you know,

1219
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,261
I don't know.

1220
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,080
It sounds like a bunch of Hoopla people
just want to be associated then I've so

1221
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:56,950
many people in the middle going,

1222
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:57,610
bro,

1223
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,280
here's the background of the guys that
he's messing with and they've done some

1224
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,420
gnarly shit.

1225
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,010
Like there's a a boxing,

1226
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:07,750
a promotion that they just came in
dressed as like mass men and shut up the

1227
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:08,171
whole thing.

1228
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:08,620
They're like,

1229
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,150
he's dealing with gnarly dudes.

1230
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,943
Whoa.

1231
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,970
But then again,

1232
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,250
I guess in Dublin especially
kind of being who he is,

1233
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,710
you're going to have these associations
with this underground world,

1234
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:18,550
stuff like that.

1235
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,810
We're trying to say about Dublin,

1236
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,470
Bro.

1237
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,303
It's awesome.

1238
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,870
My favorite place I've ever been,

1239
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,071
man,

1240
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,180
that is terrible.

1241
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,500
That's a terrible scene.

1242
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,480
I don't know what to believe.

1243
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:30,130
I don't know the ins and outs of it.

1244
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,611
I don't,

1245
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:30,821
you know,

1246
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:30,891
in,

1247
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:31,421
in Dana,

1248
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:31,961
you against it.

1249
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:32,711
This then is scrum.

1250
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:36,340
It's always fascinating and it does
those scrums because it's all hearsay,

1251
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:37,031
stuff like that.

1252
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:37,690
But then they go,

1253
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,600
you know what's next for county?

1254
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,431
You've got to fight for me.

1255
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:39,670
He goes,

1256
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,510
listen man,

1257
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:40,990
guys,

1258
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,450
$100 million in the bank fighting socks.

1259
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't know if he's ever gonna
get punched in the face again.

1260
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:46,960
Here's $100 million.

1261
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:49,300
So legit point to totally legit point,

1262
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,490
but $100 million can go a lot faster
than you think if you'd like to ball.

1263
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,331
Because here's the thing,

1264
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,680
you don't really get $100 million.

1265
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,760
You get $100 million,

1266
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,380
but then you got to pay taxes,

1267
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,940
you got to pay your trainer fee,

1268
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,900
you've got to pay whatever
you pay your manager CSF,

1269
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,780
Andy,

1270
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,820
he wouldn't have 17 after times.

1271
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,300
Yup.

1272
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,720
Nope,

1273
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,270
nope,

1274
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:08,710
nope.

1275
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,300
So legs,

1276
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,770
hundred Erica in America,

1277
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:15,340
if you make a hundred I mean like
realistically I think it's everything over

1278
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,520
$250,000 a year is taxed 30
35% 8% or something like that.

1279
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:22,661
And then you know,

1280
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:27,280
you've got to think he's got managers and
trainers and agents and when you make,

1281
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,110
here's a question that I
should know the answer to,

1282
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:29,944
but I do not.

1283
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,030
When you make money,

1284
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:31,930
if you're from Ireland,

1285
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:32,830
you make money in America.

1286
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,240
Do you have to pay taxes in America?

1287
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,470
Because I know you have to do that.

1288
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:38,290
If you make money in Canada
can make money in Canada,

1289
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,410
like you'd do gigs Canada,

1290
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,340
you have to pay taxes,

1291
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,530
taxes in Dublin and in
England and Australia when
they come to also have to pay

1292
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,311
those taxes.

1293
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:47,030
When you get home,

1294
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,180
you have to pay your own taxes.

1295
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,740
Yeah.

1296
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,270
So I don't know if you get double taxed,

1297
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:51,290
but there's ways around it.

1298
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,183
So let's say,

1299
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,170
let's say make 60 let's get to six.

1300
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,981
I'm going to say 40.

1301
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:55,250
Okay,

1302
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,710
cool.

1303
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,543
Let's be cool.

1304
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,320
But that's just based off of the fight.

1305
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,980
Now think about as endorsed peaking,

1306
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,920
go through $40 million in three years.

1307
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,900
If you're a complete,

1308
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,700
who's Amania fucking moron?

1309
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,230
If you the same type of
guy that is Conor McGregor.

1310
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,460
I don't know about that
because said we're,

1311
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,980
we're basing off his Instagram,

1312
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,540
which is a persona of him.

1313
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:18,080
Right?

1314
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,020
So you,

1315
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,930
so you see the royals Royces,

1316
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,760
these watches a lot of the stuff.

1317
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,250
You're married a lot of those
Rolls Royce's people give to them.

1318
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,323
They donated,

1319
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,610
he's renting this cause he
was standing on one of them.

1320
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,320
Yeah.

1321
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,601
They're like,

1322
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,434
Bro,

1323
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,300
this day you're shitting on a Rolex.

1324
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,050
But um,

1325
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,890
or Rolls Royce.

1326
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,370
Yeah.

1327
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,203
So I think,

1328
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,280
I don't know if he's that
stupid with his money.

1329
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:37,850
Hmm.

1330
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,683
That's interesting.

1331
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:38,901
Well,

1332
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:39,591
if that's the case,

1333
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:42,500
if he's not really completely balling
out of control and all those Bentley

1334
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:45,290
photos and everything like that is
all just for show and it's part of the

1335
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,850
persona and part of the act.

1336
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,743
That makes sense.

1337
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:47,961
Well,

1338
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:52,580
if that's the case and he just
wants to live like a fairly large,

1339
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,130
he's loving Lord,

1340
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,820
don't get me wrong,

1341
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,250
he's living,

1342
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,300
but he's not Mike Tyson,

1343
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,200
stupid John Jones.

1344
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,190
He's a private jet.

1345
00:33:58,191 --> 00:33:58,670
Stupid.

1346
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,450
Right?

1347
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,021
And he's like,

1348
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,490
can a law that can be borrowed?

1349
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:01,791
Yeah,

1350
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,624
it could be.

1351
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,500
I mean,

1352
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,610
not even saying private jets to,

1353
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:07,300
but if you've got $100 million to
do whatever the fuck you wants,

1354
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:10,370
or what I'm saying is if you want it
to last for the rest of your days,

1355
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,780
well if you just invest it right,

1356
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:11,991
you're,

1357
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:12,824
you're straight.

1358
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,281
See,

1359
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:17,690
the other thing is that the amount
of possibility for him to make money,

1360
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,800
it's so staggering right now that I don't
see that this is going to be the end

1361
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,820
of his career.

1362
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,700
I just do not agree with anybody that
thinks he's not going to fight again.

1363
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,930
I think you're crazy.

1364
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,220
I think he's going to get bored.

1365
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,660
I think he's going to want a challenge.

1366
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,330
I think he's going to realize there's a
tremendous amount of money out there to

1367
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:32,690
be made.

1368
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,501
I'm not crazy.

1369
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,290
Dana White's crazy cause I
think he's going to fight.

1370
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,540
Dana said he doesn't think he's going
to fight against fighting sucks though.

1371
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,463
Those aren't my words.

1372
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,680
I actually think he's going to fight again
for cause I think he's more than just

1373
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,514
about money.

1374
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,640
I think he's more about his
legacy and what what is,

1375
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,290
you know kind of foot mark in the sport
is and I think he knows he has to defend

1376
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,680
that 155 pound title but
then he also knows many pack,

1377
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,130
y'all called him out and he
can go make a quick whatever,

1378
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,870
50 60 million fighting Pacquiao.

1379
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,360
Yeah.

1380
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,840
So there's a lot of opportunities there
but I also know for a fact he has a shit

1381
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:05,510
load of opportunities
in Hollywood as well.

1382
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,800
Nonstop.

1383
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,090
Damn.

1384
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,923
So for,

1385
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,040
he's going to be fine either way.

1386
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,620
As long as he doesn't get
shot by a Dublin gangster,

1387
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,454
he should be fine.

1388
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,693
Yeah.

1389
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,930
Fuck.

1390
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,900
The other thing is,

1391
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:20,540
is GSPs not fighting Whitaker,

1392
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,913
gs.

1393
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,083
Ps,

1394
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,100
the rumor mill from what I hear is he
might want to see if you can cut to 50 f

1395
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,920
to cut to 70 see if he can still get to
70 and do a super fight with Conor that

1396
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,533
Conor.

1397
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,560
See that's what I said.

1398
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,270
I'd said that Connor versus just p
would be the biggest financial boom.

1399
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,380
If I was WME,

1400
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:44,560
I'd be like come,

1401
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,383
that's what they want to do.

1402
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,210
That's in a,

1403
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:49,620
in a dream situation.

1404
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:54,210
That's what all sides would want to have
happen in GSP is taking time off now,

1405
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:58,530
but I know he's going to see if he can
cut the 70 to possibly make that happen.

1406
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,140
They should be able to do it.

1407
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,830
When you think or is he get he is to
thicker than the three musketeers right

1408
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,011
now.

1409
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:07,980
He was thick city and that Bisping fight.

1410
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,030
He was pretty jacked.

1411
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,440
It's a lot of uh,

1412
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,900
Lou must be doing well on the
strength and conditioning.

1413
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,750
Yeah.

1414
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,330
Fucking,

1415
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:14,470
I mean,

1416
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,271
he's a muscular dude.

1417
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:15,991
He's getting older too.

1418
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:17,040
So the way it comes on,

1419
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,073
you know,

1420
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,270
but I wonder what he's doing for
like his weightlifting routine.

1421
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,940
You just have to get super strict also.

1422
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,720
I bet.

1423
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,501
I bet he could do it.

1424
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:26,311
Switch at 70,

1425
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:26,701
if you know,

1426
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,430
he realizes the possibilities on,

1427
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,370
on super fight like Connor because have
you seen the numbers on his fight with

1428
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:32,820
Brisbane?

1429
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,360
No.

1430
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,611
Uh,

1431
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:34,430
I think uh,

1432
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,030
it came in at about eight 65.

1433
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,073
That's not bad.

1434
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,130
Not Great though.

1435
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,260
It's not as good as he could do.

1436
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,520
Well it's not,

1437
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,530
it's not as good as the,

1438
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,910
the paper view.

1439
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,350
Blockbuster stars.

1440
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,130
No,

1441
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,140
but it's not what can
happen for four years.

1442
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:49,681
See,

1443
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:50,161
the thing is,

1444
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,390
and you and I were talking about this,

1445
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,360
is that we both agreed like there's a
lot of fans that are fans now the dental

1446
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:56,190
have a fucking clue who he is,

1447
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,170
at least didn't it before that fight?

1448
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,380
No,

1449
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,710
they came in was Rhonda
Post Rhonda and Post Conner.

1450
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,700
I think Rhonda brought a gigantic group
in and then Connor brought another even

1451
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,900
more gigantic group in.

1452
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,180
And especially the kids
today that are like 18,

1453
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:12,180
19 2021 they have no fucking idea.

1454
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,690
No clue.

1455
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,700
You have to be hardcore
to know who GSPS correct.

1456
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,750
But now they know.

1457
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,950
Now they know he's the
middle weight champ.

1458
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:17,401
Holy Shit.

1459
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,031
He came back.

1460
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,790
People will talk and it'll build it up
and then the next one will be bigger.

1461
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,983
I think.

1462
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,570
See,

1463
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,340
I even if he fought Whitaker,

1464
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:25,560
I don't think it breaks a million.

1465
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,450
Even now think you're,

1466
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:27,780
um,

1467
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,270
you're probably in the ballpark.

1468
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,180
I think it's calmed down.

1469
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,220
It'd be close to a million.

1470
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,680
I think he does fine
around eight 50 to 900.

1471
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,071
Again,

1472
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:35,171
it's,

1473
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,270
it might be a little better.

1474
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,370
Maybe it's an Australia for paper view.

1475
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,590
I think he has to have a,

1476
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,461
a partner,

1477
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,290
a dance partner like
Connor to break a million.

1478
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,100
Hmm.

1479
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,430
Well,

1480
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,400
the Conor fight would be
a million of Connor fall.

1481
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,040
My Mom,

1482
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,510
let me get that straight up.

1483
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,111
Yeah.

1484
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:51,870
Know if Kotler and Jamie Fun
and 2 million and 2 million.

1485
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:52,670
Especially now.

1486
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:52,810
Yeah.

1487
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,820
Anything he does after that.

1488
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:54,420
Floyd Mayweather,

1489
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,253
there's so much,

1490
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,741
you know,

1491
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,310
just hype.

1492
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,300
Everyone sees next move.

1493
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:57,990
It's going to,

1494
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,670
it's going to be biggest UFC of all time.

1495
00:37:59,700 --> 00:37:59,941
Yeah.

1496
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,160
Just for that boy.

1497
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,180
Yeah.

1498
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,040
There's not a lot of like giant matchups
right now that are looming that make me

1499
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,290
excited more than that one does.

1500
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,120
Connor versus GSP is like,

1501
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:12,960
whoa.

1502
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,973
That's like a,

1503
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,491
like,

1504
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:16,800
I want to sit down and think
about that one for a while,

1505
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
but we'll see.

1506
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:20,130
I have thought down and
thought about it and it's,

1507
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:25,020
it's not a s a great fight for Conor
said 70 is not where Connor belongs.

1508
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:29,220
A Smashley with the greatest
welterweight of all time.

1509
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:31,260
Who can grapple his balls off apple,

1510
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:31,921
his balls off.

1511
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:32,880
He gets you to the ground.

1512
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,960
He's gonna fuck you up.

1513
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,140
Fuck you up.

1514
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,280
He's so much stronger.

1515
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,050
George is so big now.

1516
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,400
When I put my arm around him,

1517
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,100
when I was doing the interviews
with them until the Wayans,

1518
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,441
I was like,

1519
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,370
what in the fuck?

1520
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,080
And this is like Wade in rehydrated all
day and then I get to it at like six

1521
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:47,501
o'clock,

1522
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:48,520
which is what they're doing now,

1523
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,481
which is kind of interesting.

1524
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:49,901
But I was like,

1525
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,141
wow,

1526
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,930
he's like 200 pounds plus he's a big boy.

1527
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,111
Yeah,

1528
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,580
he's way bigger than it used to be.

1529
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,030
And they're like,

1530
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,340
everybody thought that Bisping was going
to have this big advantage over them

1531
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:57,971
size wise.

1532
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:01,060
But when you see George George
also has a very long style,

1533
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,770
keeps his weight legs wide,

1534
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,570
bounces around a lot in and out.

1535
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,141
And so he,

1536
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,630
he accomplishes a lot with his,

1537
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:12,430
like his distance and his ability to
close the distance until I though the size

1538
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,330
and reach advantage that Bisping
had just didn't play in it.

1539
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,570
All that being said though,

1540
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:17,050
Biz,

1541
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,100
I mean not Bisbing.

1542
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,790
Um,

1543
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,620
GSP has no business being in the middle.

1544
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,220
Wait,

1545
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,420
that's not the land for him.

1546
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:22,870
Um,

1547
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,630
Robert Whitaker's dangerous
fight for him at one 85 it,

1548
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,250
but it's really the only fight grant.

1549
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,160
He's the champ that's the
size isn't that big of a deal.

1550
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,570
The problem is he's in his prime,

1551
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:34,991
he's young,

1552
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:36,430
hits like a Mack truck and he,

1553
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:36,571
oh,

1554
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:37,420
he's good at everything.

1555
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,231
He's good at everything.

1556
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:41,200
And He fires fucking bombs at your face.

1557
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,480
Like he's trying to take you back there.

1558
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:42,671
Yeah,

1559
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,150
he's,

1560
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,850
he's tactical striking just
to the opening is there,

1561
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,100
it's very interesting with a Whitaker
because he's the smaller guy at 85 in the

1562
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,340
land of the dinosaurs right now in the
land of the giants with Brock cold,

1563
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,740
you got a Uol jock gray,

1564
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,230
all these monsters Weidman's a big boy.

1565
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,220
The of all those lots losses.

1566
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,020
Then you have a guy like GSP who's your
interim champion and then you got Kelvin

1567
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:05,854
that people are talking about.

1568
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,160
We're Kelvin's done undersized guy to
where GSPs on the interim champion.

1569
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:10,180
He's a legit champion.

1570
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,350
Whitaker's the interim champion.

1571
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:11,711
That's true.

1572
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,700
Which is such bullshit.

1573
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,481
It's kind of crazy,

1574
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,314
right?

1575
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:14,890
Yeah.

1576
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,460
So,

1577
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,510
so you have two champions,

1578
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:16,721
right?

1579
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:17,980
But I'm doing such bullshit.

1580
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,880
Is it though?

1581
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,390
Yeah,

1582
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,940
it's bullshit.

1583
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,800
It's bullshit about it.

1584
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,060
Let's take four years off.

1585
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:23,080
You jump the queue.

1586
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,030
You fight a guy that's perfect matchup
for you and you when they got Whitaker

1587
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,500
who've walked through
fucking monster land.

1588
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,240
But in his defense he
couldn't fight that he,

1589
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:33,074
he's injured.

1590
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,970
I know I'm just saying.

1591
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,270
Right.

1592
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:34,551
But they,

1593
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:34,621
they,

1594
00:40:34,621 --> 00:40:37,630
if they could not have made the Whittaker
versus Bisping fight any earlier cause

1595
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,920
Whitaker's need was fucked up.

1596
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,150
I mean he had a PR so there was no
fight to be made other than this in the

1597
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:43,721
middleweight division.

1598
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:48,340
Unless you wanted to have EOL just
fought for the title and last fight.

1599
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,950
Bisping for the real title after
he lost for the interim title.

1600
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,360
That doesn't necessarily make sense.

1601
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:53,710
Everyone forbid we should wait.

1602
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,670
Well,

1603
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,950
I think heaven forbid,

1604
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,830
let's rush it.

1605
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,320
Didn't you enjoy the GSP fight?

1606
00:40:59,770 --> 00:40:59,951
Yeah,

1607
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:00,340
it did.

1608
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,270
So while I'm not a hitter,

1609
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,811
what's the,

1610
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:02,170
uh,

1611
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,750
what's the,

1612
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,220
uh,

1613
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,300
objecting Da.

1614
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,100
There's no object and I'm
just saying as far as,

1615
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,731
to me,

1616
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:07,120
a real,

1617
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,990
the real champion,

1618
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:09,160
85 would be Whitaker.

1619
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,150
I don't see him.

1620
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,590
I don't give GSP that title.

1621
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,410
I do because he knocked out Bisping rot,

1622
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:14,840
knocked out.

1623
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,330
Rockhold it's really simple.

1624
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,430
Rockhold was absolutely
the world champion.

1625
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,950
This plant based thing
absolutely knocked him out.

1626
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:21,341
Correct.

1627
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:22,840
And then he beat Dan Henderson,

1628
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,530
which is,

1629
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,071
which is,

1630
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,690
there's an argument there is a little bit,

1631
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,130
aren't we like it as guys
who are Dan Harris fans?

1632
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:30,040
But let's be real.

1633
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,490
It's perceived the the number one guy
in world at that time to fight from

1634
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,490
[inaudible] to give
Bisbing what he wanted,

1635
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,780
which is a shot at redemption.

1636
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,710
Yeah.

1637
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,780
But he can't fight.

1638
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,630
He won the fight.

1639
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,920
Although Dan thought he won.

1640
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,760
You know,

1641
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,840
I could see Dan definitely
heard it more like God.

1642
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,460
How about Biz means chance.

1643
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:48,890
Yeah.

1644
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,490
Incredible.

1645
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,600
And what Dan said after the fight,

1646
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,770
I wished they judge fights on how
the other guy looks after the fight.

1647
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,290
That's hilarious.

1648
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,570
Because he didn't have a scratch on him.

1649
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,270
His business should go down as the top
three middle weights of all time just

1650
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:02,400
based off doing this with
one fucking eye poodle.

1651
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,111
He has one.

1652
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:03,890
I'm man.

1653
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,420
What he's doing is insane.

1654
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,631
Yeah.

1655
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:07,160
He's got oil in his right eye.

1656
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:07,461
Right.

1657
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:08,650
To keep his resumes.

1658
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,201
Man.

1659
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,370
He's one of the best of all time.

1660
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:11,070
To me,

1661
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,380
retinas are scary shit man.

1662
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,341
Scary Shit.

1663
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:14,690
When that stuff starts calling Shane,

1664
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:17,600
if you look at what Whitaker
has done to become champions,

1665
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,040
it's a little more impressive to,

1666
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,090
well it's a little more impressive
because he'd beat you over Romero and he'd

1667
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:25,330
beat Yoel Romero and I'm fucking
tough fight any beat him after you.

1668
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:28,700
Well we're Merrill hyper extends his
leg and blew his knee out in the first

1669
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:31,460
round and before that he starts Jock,

1670
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:31,490
Ara,

1671
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,960
starched starch,

1672
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:33,794
the starch.

1673
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,791
So it's like,

1674
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,031
you know,

1675
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:36,080
he's walked through the fire.

1676
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:37,240
This same thing with Francisca.

1677
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,790
No.

1678
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,540
You know like you got to walk through
that fireman to me to get there.

1679
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,081
I agree.

1680
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:42,530
So,

1681
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,120
but that's not the world we live in.

1682
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:45,950
But what you got to
make the Bisping fight.

1683
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,721
If I was a,

1684
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:47,990
the UFC automate that fight.

1685
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:50,450
GSP says he wants to come back
and fight Bisbing Bisbing he says,

1686
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,620
I want to get that big payday too.

1687
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:51,940
I go,

1688
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,000
let's make this me too.

1689
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,930
I'm with Ya.

1690
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,680
I'm with Ya.

1691
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,760
I make the fight too.

1692
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:56,683
I make the fight too.

1693
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,370
And what's interesting
is you have these small,

1694
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:58,521
the,

1695
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:02,030
you know the of the smaller guy being
the champion and for Kelvin he doesn't

1696
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:06,740
match up great with anyone fricking six
through one but it does match up great

1697
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:07,574
with the champ.

1698
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,340
So he had to decide what you want to
do with them cause Kelvin can be world

1699
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:13,880
champion 70 not at 85
unless he fights with,

1700
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:14,330
hold on,

1701
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,080
hold on.

1702
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,370
You don't think that
Calvin could beat GSP?

1703
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,770
GSP is not fighting 85 day,

1704
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,930
but he's the champ.

1705
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,030
He did.

1706
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,611
It doesn't matter.

1707
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:23,421
Esp though,

1708
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:24,710
isn't he beat Matt Hughes?

1709
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,530
We should have that conversation
because GSP is going to fight it.

1710
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,780
But wait a minute.

1711
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:28,970
No,

1712
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,970
but she sp is the one 85 pound champ is
competing at one 85 but that's what it

1713
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:35,960
is.

1714
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,793
What do you got here?

1715
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,790
Oh the orders wears Calvin
nine down at number nine.

1716
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,240
Yeah,

1717
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,320
I think he should be a little higher.

1718
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,670
He just knocked out the former champ.

1719
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,840
Michael Bisping who's number two.

1720
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:45,920
That doesn't make any sense.

1721
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,940
I don't care if this was coming
off of a tough fight with GSP.

1722
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:50,661
It's me.

1723
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,520
Definitely probably
hampered his performance.

1724
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:56,110
He should be at seven there's no way
Calvin should be at nine in Bisbing.

1725
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:56,481
Is it too?

1726
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:57,800
That doesn't make any sense.

1727
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,270
Maybe they didn't update it pulled up,

1728
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,370
but you're saying Kelvin's
should be at two that's crazy.

1729
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:01,770
No,

1730
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:01,980
no,

1731
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,211
no.

1732
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:03,044
That's not what I'm saying.

1733
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,110
Know what I'm saying is there's
no way that Bisping should be too.

1734
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,530
If Calvin just knocked him out and
Calvin's nine that doesn't make sense.

1735
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:10,550
What's the point in having ranking?

1736
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:14,240
Kelvin's should be nine
but he [inaudible] be too.

1737
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,100
He should be passed.

1738
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,050
Bisping who?

1739
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,851
That's tough.

1740
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:18,800
What about some body of war
and we just knocked him out?

1741
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:19,191
It doesn't matter.

1742
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,470
The ranking is where are you at right now?

1743
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,510
If a guy beats you in
basketball tournament,

1744
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:23,900
right,

1745
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,261
isn't he?

1746
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,130
Doesn't he move forward?

1747
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,630
I hate in a wrestling tournament.

1748
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,081
It doesn't.

1749
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,570
He move forward yet we don't
look at someone's past and say,

1750
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:30,860
this is who you are forever.

1751
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,910
We look at your present performance.

1752
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:36,510
The last performance and Michael
Bisping hat was against Calvin Gaslin.

1753
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,480
Kelvin beat him in a decisive,

1754
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,870
very clear and dominating way.

1755
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,950
He moves ahead.

1756
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,340
Was that tire.

1757
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,533
Doesn't matter.

1758
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,360
He's ranked higher.

1759
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,940
We all we can go on is the contest itself.

1760
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,060
The contest itself was very obviously
one by Calvin in a spectacular way,

1761
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:56,940
but bang,

1762
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,400
he drops that right jab in and that
straight left hand Asti amazing performer.

1763
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,253
Amazing.

1764
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,500
He's ahead of Bisbing facts.

1765
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,160
Okay.

1766
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,300
Anybody says differently?

1767
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,193
That's fine.

1768
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,010
That's fine.

1769
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,843
You can cry that.

1770
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,930
You can put them ahead of Brisbane.

1771
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,360
However you can't put it at number
two middleweight in the world.

1772
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,630
No,

1773
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,490
I wouldn't because I think
Weidman's in the mix.

1774
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,333
Yoel Romero.

1775
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:16,883
Yes.

1776
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,120
Jock raise a bad matchup.

1777
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:21,030
Luke Rockhold is a
monster of that division.

1778
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,510
Luke Rockhold w if I had
to put money on somebody,

1779
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:25,080
Luke Rockhold,

1780
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,651
Jimmy the champion,

1781
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:26,220
that division,

1782
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:26,880
he could be.

1783
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,820
He very well could be or David
Branch almost took him out.

1784
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,510
Remember that?

1785
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,390
Any branch heard them?

1786
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,383
Luke Rockhold.

1787
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,693
He had him hurt.

1788
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,810
Not that bad.

1789
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,643
I think he had a murder.

1790
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,401
I think he had him hurt,

1791
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,190
but Rockhold showed what a fucking
animal he is and came through it.

1792
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:46,020
But what happens if someone like
Yoel Romero catches him like that?

1793
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,960
What happens if someone
like Robert Whitaker catches
him like that with running?

1794
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,660
My thing is Rockhold is a beast,

1795
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:55,200
but anything can happen in that
division when these guys are that good.

1796
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,730
Even David Branch,

1797
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,400
what I'm saying,

1798
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:57,781
who's not?

1799
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:01,320
If it was a very good fighter and
hadn't lost like five years world series

1800
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:01,630
again.

1801
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,010
Yeah.

1802
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:02,760
Again,

1803
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,520
but gave until he got tired,

1804
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,560
gave Rockhold a very tough experience.

1805
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:08,394
He came down like,

1806
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,791
yes,

1807
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:11,280
he came out and it wasn't
like Rockhold the fight.

1808
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,910
Remember Rockwell had a long ass layoff.

1809
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,450
He's doing the modeling thing.

1810
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,650
If he wanted this sort of matched what
we wanted to sort of money and then that

1811
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,460
long ass left.

1812
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,620
Then you fight this what the middleweight
champion light heavyweight champ,

1813
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,473
the world series and he,

1814
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,220
it's his biggest fight of all time.

1815
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,620
He brings us towards Rockhold record,

1816
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:31,430
weathered the storm that just
took over when the storm took,

1817
00:46:31,431 --> 00:46:32,470
took him down smash,

1818
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,151
smash,

1819
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:33,984
smash them.

1820
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,040
Henzel Gracie black.

1821
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:38,370
My point is that that absolutely he did.

1822
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,200
He definitely warm down to,

1823
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:40,680
he was like,

1824
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,780
it was exhausted by the space.

1825
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,210
You have to,

1826
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:42,611
how long?

1827
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:43,770
About 14 months off,

1828
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,053
which you know,

1829
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,130
now he's one of the most underrated guys,

1830
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:49,140
especially at getting you
down and holding you down.

1831
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:49,531
Look what he did.

1832
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:53,070
A little Yoda Machita look what he did
to Weidman and look what he did to David

1833
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:53,160
Branch.

1834
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,150
Those guys are all very good at the
ground and he smashes and he'd go back to

1835
00:46:56,151 --> 00:46:57,470
the Strikeforce days is his,

1836
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:57,960
uh,

1837
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,380
uh,

1838
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,910
jock ray fights Tim Kenny,

1839
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:00,091
you know,

1840
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:01,530
he's the best of the best,

1841
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,390
but it's definitely been a
savage his entire career.

1842
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,223
But still,

1843
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,600
you still have to realize
Bisbing did knock him out.

1844
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,860
And you know what man?

1845
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:11,490
You're in a division where you're
talking about aton of psychos.

1846
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,590
Like you've got Robert Whitaker,

1847
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:14,630
Yoel Romero,

1848
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,720
Chris Weidman,

1849
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,890
you got GSP.

1850
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:18,300
If he decides to stay in the division,

1851
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,590
but you don't think it will better.

1852
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,010
Okay,

1853
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:20,843
he's a champ,

1854
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,470
but you got it Christa Champ.

1855
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:22,861
You got,

1856
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:26,610
you got these killers and then Luke
Rockhold might be the best out of all of

1857
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:26,760
them.

1858
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,300
Yes,

1859
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,133
but he might not be.

1860
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,213
We really don't know.

1861
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:29,861
I mean,

1862
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:30,880
I'm excited about that.

1863
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,080
I'm excited about them.

1864
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm excited about.

1865
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,450
You look at him on paper.

1866
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:34,631
You Go,

1867
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:34,781
yeah,

1868
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:36,040
Rockhold might be the best of the bunch,

1869
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:36,620
but God damn,

1870
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,810
it's hard to root against Whitaker.

1871
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,730
It's hard to bet against that guy.

1872
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:39,971
They all,

1873
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:40,301
I'm done.

1874
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:41,070
Then it gets Whitaker,

1875
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,290
especially after he stuffed
all the fucking take downs
from Yolo Ramiro with one

1876
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,150
knee on that Whittaker train.

1877
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,620
Just like I'm in the deer and tilt train.

1878
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,400
Yeah.

1879
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,870
80 85 70 of 55 and the
UFC is so goddamn good.

1880
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,090
Right?

1881
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:53,740
So competitive.

1882
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,450
It's the best it's ever been.

1883
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,501
Light heavyweight,

1884
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,520
the worst it's ever been.

1885
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,200
Heavyweight land of the dinosaurs.

1886
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,850
But 55 70 85 pull up data.

1887
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,250
[inaudible] Kumar Uzman fight.

1888
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,420
We should find out that
fights actually been canceled.

1889
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,321
It hasn't been canceled.

1890
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:09,970
He's trying to get as a visa.

1891
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,920
He hasn't fucking Donald
Trump let them in.

1892
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,200
I know you got to do is Jesus Christ.

1893
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:15,990
He's the Viking cause your people.

1894
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,220
Yeah,

1895
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,260
I'm a music fan to that
70 good luck at 70 yeah,

1896
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,991
good luck.

1897
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,401
Get seven.

1898
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:25,360
That's where we're just saying [inaudible]
is fucking terrifying and no one's

1899
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,120
even talking about them cause
there's so many killers and that,

1900
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:28,960
here we go.

1901
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,700
Amil Meek explained status of two 19
fight with Camacho Guzman visa issues.

1902
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,850
So he's just hoping the hope
and they could sort it out.

1903
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,470
But that must be tough
going through training camp,

1904
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,350
either a 10 day thing or take six
months or anything in between.

1905
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:41,681
That's all.

1906
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,450
Doc Office just told me to have patients.

1907
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:45,460
The question is not about if
I'm going to get it or not,

1908
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:48,370
it's just when I get it and
if I can get it in time,

1909
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:49,780
I hope it can.

1910
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,200
You know that's uh,

1911
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,520
I mean it feels like you don't have Susan.

1912
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:56,370
I'm some fucking power
and I'm saying can we get,

1913
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,680
can we just want to make some calls?

1914
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,700
Take somebody out to my boy,

1915
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,280
me into the Goddamn states.

1916
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:01,810
Unrelated but also news.

1917
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,350
What does this,

1918
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:02,460
oh,

1919
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,880
we have tried to get this shake.

1920
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,630
Carlin retired.

1921
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,770
Oh Wow.

1922
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:06,620
It seems like their nose.

1923
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:06,971
No.

1924
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:08,860
Interesting fights and
I'm not getting younger.

1925
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,120
Let me explain.

1926
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,980
Let me just lay my gloves
down right here on.

1927
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:12,200
Oh,

1928
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,033
he did it on Reddit.

1929
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,433
Wow.

1930
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,071
Wait.

1931
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:15,850
Why is he done though?

1932
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,440
Thank you to each and every one of you.

1933
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:22,441
It's odd to be healthy and unable to
compete yet able to compete when so

1934
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:23,674
unhealthy.

1935
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,030
I guess we end.

1936
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,410
I don't know what that means.

1937
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,780
I think you've made a mistake
there with never an oh,

1938
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:32,730
I guess we end with never
knowing what could have been

1939
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,630
somber would be the best
bay to describe the emotion.

1940
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,310
Thank you all for the love,

1941
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,600
the insults and the great times.

1942
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:46,601
I will sync back into the mode of being
a redditor and my quest to become a mod

1943
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:48,464
here.

1944
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,600
He was here.

1945
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,810
He started making a little joke there.

1946
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,810
I am also on the hunt for a large fedora.

1947
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,510
I'm like an eight and a
half and half ass Shane.

1948
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,691
Seriously.

1949
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:00,060
Thank you.

1950
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,020
Often bottom of my heart for being an
amazing if for being amazing and for

1951
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:04,160
making this sport amazing.

1952
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,240
I thought he was retired.

1953
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,101
He was coming back up.

1954
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:07,550
Try and fight.

1955
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,290
Did Bell towards just
tell him no or something?

1956
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:10,531
Yeah,

1957
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:11,950
I think he just put his name in the hat.

1958
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:13,370
You just called out mitre own.

1959
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,900
He lived like two days ago.

1960
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:16,670
He just said he wanted
to fight as the old.

1961
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,541
Here's what it's weird.

1962
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,720
It says it's odd to be
healthy and unable to compete,

1963
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,520
yet able to compete when so unhealthy
mean it's odd that he's healthy now and he

1964
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:26,270
can't get a fight.

1965
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,750
Did they?

1966
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,060
That the commissioner,

1967
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,590
maybe someone told him he can't
fight or maybe belt or was like,

1968
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:31,550
now we're good son.

1969
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,151
Well,

1970
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:35,990
I would never say he couldn't fight in
terms of like the punishment he's taken.

1971
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,540
I mean there's like the junior dos
Santos fight was tough to watch.

1972
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,141
That was a tough one.

1973
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:40,190
That was a tough one to watch.

1974
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,270
He's had some tough fights,

1975
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,130
but I mean a lot of guys have,

1976
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,680
if you're going to let Overeem fight,

1977
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:47,200
how could you not let Shane Carwyn fight?

1978
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,310
Unless it's like the spinal surgery stuff.

1979
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:49,760
Yeah.

1980
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,200
I'm not sure what's going on that but,

1981
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,620
but also he could fight and rise again.

1982
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,120
I would imagine that they would take care.

1983
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,380
Bye Amy Buddy.

1984
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,180
You know that they had an issue with
him where he was getting divorced and he

1985
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:03,230
had some personal issues.

1986
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:06,740
I apparently they were saying and he had
to pull out of their tournament member.

1987
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,633
Yeah.

1988
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,301
He ended up fighting.

1989
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:09,330
They were very upset.

1990
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,570
They were very upset at
all that he backed out.

1991
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:11,721
Yeah.

1992
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:12,470
And they said,

1993
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,850
they said some things about him,

1994
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:14,031
you know,

1995
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:17,210
not having a warrior spirit
or some crazy shit like that.

1996
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,710
Relax rides and shit happen.

1997
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,341
Yeah.

1998
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:19,671
I mean,

1999
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:20,271
not only that,

2000
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:22,330
you don't even have so
many fucking heavyweights.

2001
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:22,521
Yeah.

2002
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:25,340
You're also writing and so it's relaxed
and have Shane Kerwin back the half.

2003
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,630
Shane car went over there
and alarm call courage.

2004
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,200
I [inaudible] him.

2005
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,120
Currcomm wild west

2006
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,170
golden snitch.

2007
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:36,561
Yeah.

2008
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,110
Just full on Mexican.

2009
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,361
Stop.

2010
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,380
What spins?

2011
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,180
Let the party role mix it up.

2012
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:41,871
Especially,

2013
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:43,310
I mean chains in his forties right.

2014
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,173
How old is shame?

2015
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:44,991
Hell yeah.

2016
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:45,920
He's in his forties

2017
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,200
let it roll.

2018
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,780
Let it roll.

2019
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,760
[inaudible] the spot.

2020
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,301
I mean,

2021
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:50,511
look,

2022
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,280
we should have a steroid league.

2023
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,250
We should have a league where some
people are not Daniel Cormier essays for

2024
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:56,710
faces.

2025
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,260
Volk on owes Demir at
UFC two 20 and Boston.

2026
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,273
Ooh.

2027
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,360
Ooh,

2028
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:02,900
wow.

2029
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,100
Breaking news folks.

2030
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,950
Breaking news old's Demir scary,

2031
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:07,411
but there's a,

2032
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:09,740
there's a guy who's got the
quickest rise to the top ever.

2033
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,120
This is my face for that fight.

2034
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,620
You don't care.

2035
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,160
I care.

2036
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,170
I'm lukewarm on it with those DC.

2037
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,070
I love DC and I wish she was a bigger
star and he should be a bigger star and I,

2038
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,180
but you know he's going to be phenomenal
as a commentator and I think he flies

2039
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,210
through those the minute.

2040
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,193
Do you really?

2041
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,560
Yes.

2042
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,350
Easily Think,

2043
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,780
oh Zumiez dangerous for anybody,

2044
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:30,140
man.

2045
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,830
Anybody good luck dealing with DC
when he gets you in there clinch.

2046
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,550
It's true.

2047
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,180
It's true.

2048
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,240
DC's a monster light
heavyweight of all time.

2049
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,380
Not named John Jones.

2050
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,843
Whoa.

2051
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,613
Strong words.

2052
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:43,550
Who's better?

2053
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,383
Nobody.

2054
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,390
He was the heavyweight champion twice.

2055
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,160
Yeah,

2056
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,090
twice beat Guthman.

2057
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,980
He was the head of state
champion Grand Prix.

2058
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,350
Then then think about the
people in that Grand Prix.

2059
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:54,950
Yeah.

2060
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,150
When we did the Josh Barnett,

2061
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,590
Judge Brennan had a broken hand,

2062
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,500
but throw them up in the air and
we did the port Dan Henderson.

2063
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:00,920
How,

2064
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,780
by the way DC,

2065
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,370
how dare you treat our legend like that.

2066
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,350
How dare you take an old,

2067
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,840
whether Dan Henderson
spike him on his head.

2068
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:09,674
You son of a dog.

2069
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,210
I mean he ragdolled.

2070
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,530
I love DC men.

2071
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,330
I liked that fight for DC.

2072
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,740
I'm a owes them air fan.

2073
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:17,090
I think it'd be hilarious
if he has champions.

2074
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,170
It's 700 Twitter followers,

2075
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:22,010
but I think that TC is going
to mop the floor with them.

2076
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:22,880
Interesting.

2077
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,770
Unless it's a bar in Florida
then it's different story.

2078
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,320
I'm just interested in
seeing what happens if um,

2079
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,390
if he gets hit because owes Demir is
very fast and hits very hard and has a

2080
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:34,680
shocking reaction.

2081
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,420
It hit hard.

2082
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,991
Oh for sure.

2083
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:37,351
Rumble,

2084
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:37,831
rumble,

2085
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:38,370
rock them.

2086
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:41,490
Rock the rocks and that overhand
right in the first fight in the head.

2087
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,340
Kicked him in the second week.

2088
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:42,490
Yeah.

2089
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,150
Be really sat him down cause he popped up.

2090
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:45,660
Yeah,

2091
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,830
I'll beat DC is a monster.

2092
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,843
No doubt.

2093
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,390
I'm just interested because I think owes
Demir really does have special power.

2094
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:51,960
You,

2095
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,230
you'll,

2096
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,130
you'll see him hit people,

2097
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:57,610
you like cheeses and according to
everybody that watched him and rumbled

2098
00:53:57,611 --> 00:53:57,861
trained,

2099
00:53:57,861 --> 00:53:59,820
like he was the guy that trained
with rumble all the time.

2100
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:01,330
It's one of the few guys
that want to spar with,

2101
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,203
probably say about it.

2102
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,390
So they went to war.

2103
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,310
Really?

2104
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,550
Hud Watch that.

2105
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,413
Watch that.

2106
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,820
I would watch it and who to have said,

2107
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:09,570
that's one of the reasons
why those to me are so good.

2108
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,430
So it always the like
train with the wrong.

2109
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:11,910
He was like,

2110
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:12,870
everybody's carrying around ball.

2111
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,340
How do not be scared about it?

2112
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:16,040
They're not just knock
each other out every day.

2113
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:16,903
I think they're smart.

2114
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,010
They hit each other just hard enough to
like let each other know they're hitting

2115
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:20,341
each other.

2116
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:20,700
And look,

2117
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,350
you want a valuable sparring partner.

2118
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,970
I mean if you take your toys,

2119
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:24,510
yeah,

2120
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:24,841
look,

2121
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:26,610
it's benefiting the both of them.

2122
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,151
Obviously.

2123
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:28,080
Here's one for you.

2124
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,333
How about rumble ones?

2125
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,930
Come back at heavyweight rumble.

2126
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:33,390
Steep pay for the curve ball.

2127
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,253
Here's the thing,

2128
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,860
you can't really do that because he just
fought as a light every way and then

2129
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,270
quit and said,

2130
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:40,260
I don't want to do this anymore.

2131
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,450
And then he comes back and finds
that a heavyweight and he's back,

2132
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:43,284
bro.

2133
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,480
He said he doesn't like fighting.

2134
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,583
Says

2135
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,590
there's a lot the rest of that a man.

2136
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:50,371
What he say,

2137
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:51,660
I don't like blood but I'm back.

2138
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,480
I mean what happened was that
retirement life ain't fun,

2139
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:54,930
is it?

2140
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,441
It's not.

2141
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:55,951
It's boring.

2142
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:56,740
Right.

2143
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,710
And he knows he can be championed too.

2144
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,480
Like he really does have
championship skills,

2145
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,681
you know what I mean?

2146
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:02,201
He's got,

2147
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:03,180
now he does for sure.

2148
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,950
Unquestionably has enough power
to knock out any human being.

2149
00:55:05,951 --> 00:55:08,220
And P if DC and Jon Jones are out,

2150
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:08,971
yeah,

2151
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:09,900
he's the guy.

2152
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,150
If DC got hit with that upper cut,

2153
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:13,200
that glow over got hit with,

2154
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:13,750
he goes night,

2155
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,660
night to night.

2156
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,250
But those guys are too smart for that.

2157
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,690
They don't fight that style.

2158
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:18,991
Well,

2159
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:19,500
they didn't.

2160
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,010
Yeah.

2161
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,420
Glover was too easy to hit for him.

2162
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,140
But I think he realizes
that anybody in the world,

2163
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,190
I mean he literally,

2164
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,650
he might have to have a hundred percent
chance to beat anybody in the world,

2165
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:29,484
but he might have,

2166
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:29,910
no,

2167
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:30,061
no,

2168
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:30,121
no,

2169
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:30,420
no,

2170
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,440
not a hundred percent chance.

2171
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,490
Do you know anybody in the world?

2172
00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:35,970
But I'm saying he might
have like a 60% chance,

2173
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,770
like in any fight with anybody,

2174
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,380
he could connect with a bomb
and put your fucking lights out.

2175
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,640
He's that powerful.

2176
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,910
So that alone in his head means like
if he fought Jon Jones 60% of the time,

2177
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,990
he might be able to catch John Jones.

2178
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,860
It might be if he caught
John Jones or anybody,

2179
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:54,840
he hits so fucking hard,

2180
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,260
but he definitely froze up
against DC in the second fight.

2181
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,960
He did not look like a guy
who was there to do or die.

2182
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,080
Did he hit that path that
they keep jacking off to?

2183
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,943
Did he hit the,

2184
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,821
I would like to see that.

2185
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,730
I'd like to see that.

2186
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:08,910
I think he hits harder than in Ghana.

2187
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,830
Ghana was a lot bigger than him,

2188
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:11,100
man.

2189
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:11,461
Yeah.

2190
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:13,170
But Anthony Johnson is filled up more.

2191
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,310
He's more explosive.

2192
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,710
Especially with you.

2193
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:20,710
You put Anthony Johnson on that healthy
diet and he's the two 40 empty Johnson.

2194
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,680
He's going to hit like a Mack truck.

2195
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,101
Very interesting.

2196
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:24,791
Cm and heavy.

2197
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:28,600
Where ansys rumble Johnson
black on black power.

2198
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,020
Kaepernick could show up for that bitch.

2199
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:35,450
You got would be rumbles going to have
[inaudible] fight in heavyweight fights.

2200
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,400
Just docile.

2201
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,060
Oh my God.

2202
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,900
He's ready to go.

2203
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:38,081
No,

2204
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:38,200
no,

2205
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:38,471
no,

2206
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:38,550
no,

2207
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,383
no,

2208
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:39,881
no.

2209
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,271
You get them.

2210
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,070
That Russian dude that
looks to choke people

2211
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,230
who lets people now,

2212
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:47,740
now he's a heavyweight.

2213
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:48,574
He's,

2214
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,120
yeah,

2215
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,690
you get him.

2216
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,523
That'd be Brown.

2217
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,660
And that poor soul to put
the Russian has no idea.

2218
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:58,930
I fight black men and
just fucking get starched.

2219
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,390
Yeah,

2220
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:00,310
that'll be interesting.

2221
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,620
It's an interesting guy.

2222
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,110
Let's see what happened guy.

2223
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,870
I want to see what happens.

2224
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:05,704
Give him that guy.

2225
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,880
Give him somebody who's,

2226
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:10,510
you know,

2227
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,090
can we get it?

2228
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,070
Encourages mounts.

2229
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,911
I can get a joke.

2230
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:14,320
The guy's going to come after him.

2231
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,040
The guy's gonna come after him.

2232
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,440
Alexi.

2233
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,273
Holiness.

2234
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,640
Powerful LEXI.

2235
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,563
Yeah.

2236
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,040
Deep in his forties

2237
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,580
same hairlines Brian Cowen,

2238
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:30,510
52 and 11 he's been through the fucking
door ring or you think he gives a fuck

2239
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,180
about how hard rumble hits now?

2240
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:35,014
He'll take that fight.

2241
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,451
You know,

2242
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:38,040
like I'd take foot to the
all day until stricter.

2243
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,030
Fucking write the Boa.

2244
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:40,991
Yeah,

2245
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,010
that would be a fun fight.

2246
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:43,630
You mean beat my hip for heavy weight,

2247
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:43,900
man?

2248
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,210
Who the fuck knows what
if he gets rumbled down?

2249
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,010
What if he gets rumbled down?

2250
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:49,000
We see him in side mount.

2251
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,800
We're going on a rear
naked choke from the side.

2252
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,360
You have run in troll.

2253
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,010
That motherfucker gets hold of your neck.

2254
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,410
Rumbles in trouble if
you get mount on him,

2255
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:56,710
man.

2256
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:56,860
He,

2257
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,000
that guy's a monster.

2258
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,500
He's a monster from the bottom.

2259
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:03,150
I'm sure he choked that dude
out from his back mounted.

2260
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,083
He gave it to him.

2261
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:04,841
Crazy.

2262
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:05,320
Crazy.

2263
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:05,531
Yeah,

2264
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:05,840
he's a,

2265
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,880
he's a squeezer.

2266
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:10,480
There's certain dudes to just can squeeze
your neck and a rum on the first round

2267
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,590
might be the most dangerous man.

2268
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,850
Oh yeah.

2269
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,070
I wonder maybe.

2270
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,620
Look,

2271
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:14,891
I mean,

2272
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:18,550
I don't know how much weight he was
cutting to make two oh five but if he's

2273
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:22,930
really walking around at two 32 35
and that doesn't have to cut anything,

2274
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,130
he might be better at heavyweight.

2275
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,900
So I'm saying let's give
them on that punch meter.

2276
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,270
Got Francis.

2277
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,060
Just give them a good fight
of her doom from overdose.

2278
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,190
We're doing like kill your dreams man.

2279
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,330
Who's a mother fucker?

2280
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,550
Who was a mother fuck is beacon
strike that's on the world.

2281
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:43,384
On the ground.

2282
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:47,440
She's huge and me give a fuck about
the golden snitch cause he never been

2283
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,920
caught.

2284
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,180
That doesn't take anything.

2285
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,600
He had some issues for doom comes hunting
for you and that Jujitsu is just on

2286
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:53,710
another planet.

2287
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,041
Dude.

2288
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:54,430
How about,

2289
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,263
how about,

2290
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,670
how about when,

2291
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,510
what fight was that that backed out?

2292
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:58,721
Oh,

2293
00:58:58,721 --> 00:58:59,470
the black beast.

2294
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,290
We were supposed to
fight Derrick Lewis Fan.

2295
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,101
We were talking about Derrick Lewis,

2296
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:03,880
social media.

2297
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,750
I just had the best.

2298
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:06,700
Might be the best fucking
his instinct fighter.

2299
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,740
Hilarious.

2300
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:09,430
Hilarious,

2301
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,480
hilarious.

2302
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,770
Shout out to Dick Lewis.

2303
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:13,240
Shout out to the black beans.

2304
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,220
Some hilarious shit.

2305
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,653
Fight soon.

2306
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,111
But remember,

2307
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:17,360
Derek,

2308
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,080
who's supposed to fight for doomed
and the like hours for the fight,

2309
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:20,411
that guy,

2310
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:21,244
he can't do.

2311
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,430
So this filled in random homeboy
and he was just happy to be there.

2312
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,710
Walt Harris Harris Business Lock and

2313
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,300
just fucking beautiful transition when
it took us back and then took the arm off

2314
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:35,810
the bat.

2315
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,260
He's teaching his students and
then it's about the arm to show.

2316
00:59:38,261 --> 00:59:39,200
It's fucking easy.

2317
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,760
I'll show you how it was so easy for him.

2318
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:42,470
Uh,

2319
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:46,040
there's a payday then fights
that rush and goes five rounds.

2320
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,970
That's why he won't be ready
to fight Steve Bay in Boston.

2321
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,250
I wonder if he would,

2322
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,450
he might.

2323
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:54,283
Yes.

2324
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,520
Five rounds.

2325
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,610
I don't know.

2326
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:59,360
See to Bora caught him a few times,

2327
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:00,890
but it never got rocked.

2328
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,230
[inaudible] was outclassed.

2329
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:02,710
Yeah.

2330
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,680
He's just not that level yet.

2331
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:04,514
Never got hurt.

2332
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,300
No.

2333
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,320
And uh,

2334
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,010
you know,

2335
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:07,880
if we're doing one,

2336
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:08,930
if he didn't get injured,

2337
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,000
Boston has January,

2338
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:14,510
who knows.

2339
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,660
Talk to him in a couple of weeks.

2340
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,583
How are you feeling bro?

2341
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,330
Especially for a title shot.

2342
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,890
Yeah.

2343
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,350
How are you feeling?

2344
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:20,183
Most probably down.

2345
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:20,880
No,

2346
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,290
he won't fight for the title for this
monster Francis that we're not sure about.

2347
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:25,711
Yeah,

2348
01:00:25,711 --> 01:00:27,690
it all depends on how much
damage he took in that fight.

2349
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,310
He did get leg kicked a few times.

2350
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,091
Didn't get down though,

2351
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:30,420
man.

2352
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:30,601
Yeah.

2353
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:31,350
You know he is.

2354
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:32,310
But did he get hurt?

2355
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,500
Like is there anything
fucked up in his wrist?

2356
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:35,430
His elbow.

2357
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:35,851
Okay.

2358
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:38,570
You know little shit that happens in
a fight that nobody even knows about.

2359
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,380
Training camps.

2360
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,213
Yeah.

2361
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,610
And during a fight as well.

2362
01:00:41,611 --> 01:00:42,444
Right.

2363
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,250
So what else is going on this weekend?

2364
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:44,910
There's those,

2365
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:45,743
those fights.

2366
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:46,920
This Holloway Edgar,

2367
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,090
which is very interesting.

2368
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,760
There is gagey versus Eddie Alvarez.

2369
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:51,541
That's a,

2370
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:51,990
that's,

2371
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,690
that's the one that I'm most
excited to sit udo pedis.

2372
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,190
So who'd,

2373
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,420
oh,

2374
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:55,621
it's,

2375
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:56,910
that's the one I wanted to talk about.

2376
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,050
That's another one.

2377
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:02,520
And Paul Felder and Charles
Olivera for the fs one prelims.

2378
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,020
That's another very interesting one
because all of era just got done.

2379
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:07,590
He was,

2380
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,130
he's fine in 45 to draining
45 and just choked out.

2381
01:01:11,131 --> 01:01:12,270
Bill Brooks remember that?

2382
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:12,900
Yes.

2383
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,490
We'll Brooks having a tough time.

2384
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:15,660
Tough time in the UFC.

2385
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,700
I thought it was gonna do really
well too with spiders caught him.

2386
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,910
[inaudible] he's had a
tough go over in the EOC.

2387
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:21,490
Yeah.

2388
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:21,990
Um,

2389
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:22,650
look man,

2390
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,540
this is the highest level
of the game for sure.

2391
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,160
It's weird cause Brooke,

2392
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:28,770
some tough time you'll see in a lot of
the UFC guys are having a tough time in

2393
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:33,630
Bella toward the different divisions
I think is probably the strongest over

2394
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:33,811
there.

2395
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:35,310
And Bella [inaudible] 70 right now,

2396
01:01:35,311 --> 01:01:37,890
especially with Rory Mcdonald there
I think is as strong as it gets.

2397
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,570
I think you've got Douglas Lema.

2398
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,010
You got Rory Macdonald.

2399
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:41,560
You,

2400
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,540
you got like,

2401
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,400
like a vinegarette Larkin.

2402
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,930
You got Michael Venom page.

2403
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:48,930
You got Paul Daley who just
knocked out Lorens Larkin.

2404
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,390
You got to have a gang
of fucking assassins.

2405
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,160
Uh,

2406
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,360
Paul's the most limited
because of his ground game.

2407
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:54,751
Yes.

2408
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:54,991
You know,

2409
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:58,290
when a guy like Rory gets you down
like he showed how to Pete Paul,

2410
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,020
you know,

2411
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,520
um,

2412
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,353
that's just,

2413
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,250
but if you stand with Paul,

2414
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,740
he's got a chance to idea.

2415
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,350
He's got a chance against anybody
in the world are doing daily.

2416
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:09,970
Verse Marco Been In page
the arguing each other.

2417
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,681
Hate each other.

2418
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:11,850
Hate each are going to do that.

2419
01:02:11,851 --> 01:02:12,420
Yeah.

2420
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,110
That's a great fight.

2421
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:13,920
That's a crazy fight.

2422
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,460
Great fight.

2423
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,010
And you know Roy McDonald wants to
be an alternate and the heavyweight,

2424
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,361
he's out of his fucking mind.

2425
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,100
Crazy tell to him verse,

2426
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:20,490
you know,

2427
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,070
fucking mitre own or something like that.

2428
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:22,621
Yeah.

2429
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:23,610
Those guys are huge.

2430
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:24,300
The huge,

2431
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,020
he's more technical alone but point
doesn't matter how much does he weigh?

2432
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,730
Roy's maybe one 90 95 maybe a
lot of fucking Krispy Kreme.

2433
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:33,950
Yeah.

2434
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:34,783
Yeah.

2435
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:35,840
It's just a bad idea.

2436
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,230
Don't so gangster though.

2437
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,610
Yeah he is.

2438
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,380
But there's some gorillas
in that division.

2439
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,050
Well think if they let Shane and the
thing melts shameless Chael Sonnen.

2440
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,070
Who's going to sanction that?

2441
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:44,610
Fine.

2442
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,320
Yeah,

2443
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,730
he's fine to rampage rampage.

2444
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,020
That seems kind of crazy too.

2445
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,070
It does it.

2446
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,120
That makes more sense to me.

2447
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:51,421
At least.

2448
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:53,970
Rampage is at light
heavyweight and are similar.

2449
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:54,893
That's true.

2450
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,160
But you know,

2451
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:56,730
I dunno,

2452
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,280
I don't know why they made
Matt and Roy on the same,

2453
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,540
the first round I would've,

2454
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,770
I would've put them on opposite sites
around cause we've seen that show.

2455
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,370
See I'll put them on opposite sides.

2456
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:05,971
Well,

2457
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:07,770
I think they wanted that fight to happen.

2458
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:09,210
They wanted that rematch to happen,

2459
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:10,561
you know,

2460
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,850
and I think Mitre on,

2461
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:12,121
right?

2462
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:12,990
Like if I was,

2463
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,970
if I was in the fate or camp,

2464
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:16,980
who's fade or fighting first?

2465
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,023
Frank Mir,

2466
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:19,680
that's a dangerous fight.

2467
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,301
Hell yeah.

2468
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:21,240
It's a dangerous fight.

2469
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,560
Dangerous fight song.

2470
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,730
That's dangerous fight.

2471
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,410
Then he got King Mo,

2472
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:29,460
Ryan Bader especially under non snitch,

2473
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:32,050
like testing well that,

2474
01:03:32,051 --> 01:03:32,170
that,

2475
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:32,700
that whole,

2476
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,810
that whole tournament.

2477
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,200
Yeah.

2478
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,750
It's non snitch like Oh hold up.

2479
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:37,584
So well,

2480
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,460
okay,

2481
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,690
so he got Quinton rampage,

2482
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:41,290
Jackson Shale stone that's at the forum.

2483
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:41,970
So that's the law.

2484
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,340
That's the California Commission
and the strictest fuck.

2485
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,370
But the Mohegan Sun arena,

2486
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,320
mitre and Roy Nelson suspect
and then all state arena.

2487
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,400
What city is that in?

2488
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,410
Use All state.

2489
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:56,244
But if I was,

2490
01:03:56,370 --> 01:04:00,390
if I was fade or I'd only want to do it
in the middle of the Indian reservation.

2491
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:00,631
Yeah.

2492
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:03,570
We're doing to be as
far from the outskirts,

2493
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:03,820
you know,

2494
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:04,540
possible.

2495
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,790
We fight and inclusive casino.

2496
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,210
We're going to move to the virtual center,

2497
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,350
but uh,

2498
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:10,561
but,

2499
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:10,850
uh,

2500
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:11,130
uh,

2501
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,690
juiced up frank or so juiced up.

2502
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,040
Fado that's a dream match.

2503
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,440
Where's that a Allstate arena?

2504
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,140
Chicago.

2505
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:16,973
Chicago.

2506
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,040
They got a good athletic
commission might be fucked.

2507
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,530
They've got to get those doctors
that they brought in for that Acre.

2508
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:26,400
It's moving out of all out
of all the God damn fights.

2509
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:27,870
How does Metro and Roy,

2510
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:30,690
the two guys who've never tested
hot end up in Mohegan Sun?

2511
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,700
Maybe because they knew they didn't
have to worry about them testing.

2512
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:32,901
Yeah.

2513
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:33,090
No,

2514
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,550
but you put fade or in frank and Mohegan.

2515
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:36,231
But what?

2516
01:04:36,231 --> 01:04:37,620
They don't want them to be able to,

2517
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,690
to go fucking hardcore.

2518
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,051
All right then.

2519
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:40,710
You don't want to have fun.

2520
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,543
That's fine.

2521
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:41,971
All right,

2522
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:42,331
Scott,

2523
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:42,811
do your thing,

2524
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:43,644
man.

2525
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,071
Do your thing,

2526
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:44,490
Scott.

2527
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:44,671
You know,

2528
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:45,340
I love you.

2529
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:45,821
Do your thing,

2530
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:46,590
man.

2531
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,030
I would have had that inclusive casino.

2532
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,500
Choose to the Gills all day.

2533
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:49,980
Pride days.

2534
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,720
Whole days.

2535
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:50,890
Right?

2536
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,530
And how's Bobby latching
on that tournament?

2537
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:53,130
That's true.

2538
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,680
Could I get white check congas on it?

2539
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,500
A little boring.

2540
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,020
Bobby Lashley is the one they go age.

2541
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,520
Just,

2542
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,320
um,

2543
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,250
we just can't,

2544
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,630
Bobby,

2545
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,523
come on.

2546
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,823
Just come on.

2547
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,330
Nobody thinks you clean.

2548
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:05,843
Nobody.

2549
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,753
He's never failed.

2550
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,910
Never Mama.

2551
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:09,931
Dude,

2552
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:10,441
what do you think?

2553
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:11,274
Am I clean?

2554
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,061
Boy,

2555
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:12,894
you know you ain't call

2556
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,540
dude bought.

2557
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,880
I would watch Bobby fader,

2558
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,790
Bobby Roy Nelson be sick.

2559
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:19,330
Leave.

2560
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,163
Decided on dude,

2561
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,310
I don't know.

2562
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:21,820
I know,

2563
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,211
I know.

2564
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:23,080
He's got great genetics.

2565
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:23,980
I know he works hard.

2566
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,260
He's skilled as a motherfucker.

2567
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,690
A motherfucker bought stripey
latch snap was a grappling beast,

2568
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,640
but one of the best
wrestlers I've ever seen.

2569
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:35,670
But that is the body of a man
who's been to the Mexican pharmacy.

2570
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,743
How dare you,

2571
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,100
or had someone go for him.

2572
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:39,963
How dare you?

2573
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,670
Or bought it from a dude who went there.

2574
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,760
He got it at the gym.

2575
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:42,971
I mean,

2576
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:43,804
that's just,

2577
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,830
that's just steroid,

2578
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:45,790
but he's never failed.

2579
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,653
Oh my God.

2580
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,250
Fuck ass man.

2581
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,480
That's not even that looks
checkouts guys from promethium,

2582
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,420
those dudes from Promethian said that
those ridiculous bodies that brought the

2583
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:57,700
DNA to earth to make new people,

2584
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,301
those John,

2585
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:01,940
it did pull up one of them dudes for
promethium and put it right by the side of

2586
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:02,170
him.

2587
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:02,650
By the way.

2588
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,550
I love that movie.

2589
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,200
Put them right beside him.

2590
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:06,670
The Prometheans Jack Dude,

2591
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,920
where it looks like the new
teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

2592
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,930
That image he like literally had the body
of one of those Prometheans guys like

2593
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:15,460
right there with the
shirt off by the ocean.

2594
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,480
Bang.

2595
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,380
Make that larger.

2596
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:18,960
Yeah,

2597
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,710
it looks identical.

2598
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,580
He loves beer.

2599
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,090
He's thicker.

2600
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:25,631
For sure.

2601
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:26,110
Jack.

2602
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:26,531
Let's go.

2603
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:27,370
Come on son.

2604
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:28,900
Jesus Christ.

2605
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:29,734
Look at the size of him.

2606
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:29,831
Well,

2607
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:30,191
come on.

2608
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:30,820
He's bigger.

2609
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,600
He's bigger.

2610
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,710
I would say Bobby Lashley.

2611
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,150
Steamrolls that dude from Promeo,

2612
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,920
those guys for jibs huge though,

2613
01:06:36,921 --> 01:06:37,300
bro.

2614
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,720
Steamrolls difference.

2615
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,810
If he's the same size as that guy,

2616
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:41,800
go one more Bobby.

2617
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,790
Lashley fucked.

2618
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:43,390
Fuck.

2619
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,223
Ugh.

2620
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:44,711
That's,

2621
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:46,300
but that's a real human.

2622
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:47,230
But all the other guys,

2623
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:48,760
not Bobby Lashley college pick.

2624
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:49,970
He's always been Jack.

2625
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:50,141
Oh,

2626
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:50,974
I believe it.

2627
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:51,731
I mean,

2628
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:53,590
he's definitely got phenomenal genetics,

2629
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,660
but the idea that there
ain't nothing going on,

2630
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:56,494
but the rent,

2631
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,100
you're out of your fucking
out of your fucking mind.

2632
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,930
You're out of your fucking mind.

2633
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,101
Yeah.

2634
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:03,551
I don't know,

2635
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:03,801
man.

2636
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:05,920
I talked to Jimmy Smith about
where they have him fight.

2637
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:06,701
Yeah,

2638
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:06,881
no,

2639
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:07,960
I know where they have him fight.

2640
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:08,350
Yeah.

2641
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,183
I just,

2642
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,870
I'm giving the guy a break.

2643
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,793
I think he's awesome,

2644
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,240
but I think there's a reality to pride
that made it exciting and made it fun.

2645
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:16,720
Correct.

2646
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,020
You know,

2647
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:17,830
and we're,

2648
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:19,960
I would like to see one
of those things today,

2649
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:22,120
whether it's rising or took the size.

2650
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,221
I,

2651
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:22,600
dude,

2652
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,020
I mean,

2653
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:23,411
again,

2654
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:24,730
phenomenal genetics.

2655
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:26,710
Maybe he really is taken gamma labs,

2656
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,283
but in the live,

2657
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,800
but there's part of me that goes,

2658
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,110
I want to go back to the
old Arsenio hall days.

2659
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,280
Things would make you go,

2660
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,490
well,

2661
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,710
if the size of him up there,

2662
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,310
elbow straps above the left,

2663
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,293
I don't care.

2664
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,590
Go go large on that picture

2665
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,680
was more Joe Timmer,

2666
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:51,514
Bob Sapp.

2667
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,383
Oh my God.

2668
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:57,190
Pops up and it's Prime Bob Sapp and
his prime was not even a human being.

2669
01:07:57,191 --> 01:07:58,810
He was a science project,

2670
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,630
a full on science pain.

2671
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,400
He's been Bob savage versus Nogueira.

2672
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,960
Look at the size of Bobby Ashley.

2673
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,340
Go to Bob Sapp versus Nogueira.

2674
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,290
There's a time where the beginning of
fight Noguera is standing there ready to

2675
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:12,730
find Bob Sapp is standing there.

2676
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:17,450
And Bob's habs gloves look like miniature
gloves because his body is this wide

2677
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,060
and he's like,

2678
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:18,830
cartoon moves in.

2679
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,900
Khartoum my only thing with Bobby,

2680
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:24,650
last few years I've seen guys in the
NFL who aren't hot that looked like him.

2681
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,011
Oh yeah.

2682
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,844
It's possible.

2683
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:26,893
It's totally possible.

2684
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,411
Bobby last,

2685
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:29,960
she's also 40 right,

2686
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:30,650
isn't he?

2687
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:30,870
Yeah,

2688
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:31,080
yeah.

2689
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:31,910
Oh yeah.

2690
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,050
Wrestled blue in the middle of them.

2691
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:33,651
I just let it go.

2692
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,760
Let it happen for the first round.

2693
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:35,810
Like watch it comes out.

2694
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:39,210
Look at the fucking size of the spine.

2695
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,280
Girls Snack.

2696
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,163
Yeah.

2697
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,270
He was so big.

2698
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,650
He was at one point in time,

2699
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:47,690
I think he was 300 plus pounds.

2700
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,920
400 Oh,

2701
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:49,581
I don't know about that.

2702
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:50,330
Was He?

2703
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,230
He was 300 plus pounds with abs
like three 50 or three 75 with that.

2704
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,840
Oh my God.

2705
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,710
They don't teach you that
at any gym in the world.

2706
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,660
Ooh,

2707
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,340
that's so bad for your neck.

2708
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:01,941
Oh dude,

2709
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:05,500
that no girl was had to retire because
of that really is the worse injuries ever

2710
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,343
sustained.

2711
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,640
So what happened to his neck?

2712
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,360
A disc bulging disc.

2713
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:10,310
He had to have surgery.

2714
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:10,790
Like that's,

2715
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,070
that's one of the things that
really fucked them gear up.

2716
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:16,280
It's amazing that he's still
fought and won and won.

2717
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,200
Amazing God.

2718
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:18,341
No,

2719
01:09:18,341 --> 01:09:18,791
Kara Mann,

2720
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:21,430
one of the fucking savage man,

2721
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:24,320
he almost got taken out because
of a fucking head spike.

2722
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:24,920
You know,

2723
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,000
fader was not willing to fight him fader.

2724
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:27,411
I was like,

2725
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:28,244
no thanks.

2726
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:32,180
Like you are allowed to throw those crazy
kicks from when you were on your back.

2727
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:34,390
Then you could kick to the face like he,

2728
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,690
I forgot he got reversed.

2729
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:36,320
Remember that?

2730
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,000
Think of that monster on top of you.

2731
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,990
Jesus.

2732
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:41,240
That much of a bad ass Nokia
is cause you know what?

2733
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,460
Off Fight fricking Bob Sapp,

2734
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,020
even though he's juice to the Gills,

2735
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,580
Bob sat on top of him.

2736
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:48,560
He has his back and
punched him and rock him,

2737
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,810
smashing him.

2738
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,670
Smash city,

2739
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,990
Eh crazy.

2740
01:09:53,991 --> 01:09:55,970
I for struggle city for
big hug right there.

2741
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:57,103
What about this?

2742
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,760
You forget about this fight.

2743
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,890
You forget how big of an old my God,

2744
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:01,490
look at that.

2745
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,450
That's a grizzly bear.

2746
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:06,110
Oof Jesus Christ.

2747
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,600
But if you hit him when he
hit the bully in the face,

2748
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:09,110
they go away.

2749
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,010
Look at this.

2750
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,310
Remember he almost had him in a triangle.

2751
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,220
You've got slammed.

2752
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,171
Yeah.

2753
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:15,290
It's a bad idea to do that.

2754
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,521
Yeah.

2755
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:17,720
The Triangle Slam,

2756
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:20,120
the Ricardo Arona,

2757
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:23,810
rampage Jackson Triangle Slam should
be shown to every kid who wants to hold

2758
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:24,590
onto a triangle.

2759
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,370
Ever.

2760
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:27,500
I need to watch this because this is real.

2761
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,510
Two bonds that some of
the best ever broke.

2762
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,850
The leg locks and everything.

2763
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:32,450
Look at this.

2764
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:32,961
I forgot.

2765
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:33,820
He went to leg loss.

2766
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:34,940
They fought from the best ever.

2767
01:10:34,941 --> 01:10:35,774
Not beat.

2768
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,360
This was a nutty fight.

2769
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:39,081
And again,

2770
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:40,910
this was a fight that
fate or wouldn't take,

2771
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,200
but fader was like,

2772
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:42,491
Nah,

2773
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:42,771
Nah,

2774
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:43,041
Nah,

2775
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:43,410
I don't care.

2776
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,010
What do I shy?

2777
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,380
Understand what he's thinking.

2778
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:45,820
Yeah.

2779
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,240
Even in,

2780
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,450
even though when they won,

2781
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,470
they won a no gear.

2782
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,011
Do the rematch.

2783
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:49,221
He's like,

2784
01:10:49,221 --> 01:10:50,054
dude was spiking.

2785
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,230
I can't with my neck,

2786
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:51,500
man.

2787
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,333
It's too much.

2788
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:53,480
And he was sending to my life,

2789
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,070
my career.

2790
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:55,903
Look at him.

2791
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:56,900
Yeah,

2792
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,830
he was battered.

2793
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,530
But how entertaining is amazing.

2794
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,190
Like,

2795
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:01,401
well,

2796
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:01,941
it's amazing.

2797
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:02,774
But now,

2798
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:03,230
and he,

2799
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,063
I love with this.

2800
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,270
When he hit him with the Granby roll,

2801
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,610
Woo whoop on your backside.

2802
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,140
And when one,

2803
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,091
when he won,

2804
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:11,901
I remember watching it.

2805
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,130
We were going crazy.

2806
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,740
Look at me and Eddie were fucking
screaming at this without an arm bar.

2807
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,753
Beautiful.

2808
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,110
Lemme know when he straightens
it out and Bob taps.

2809
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:24,450
It's like no fucking way.

2810
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,270
But this is not just Jujitsu.

2811
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:26,790
This is lily.

2812
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:27,111
That tap,

2813
01:11:27,111 --> 01:11:27,261
tap,

2814
01:11:27,261 --> 01:11:27,411
tap,

2815
01:11:27,411 --> 01:11:27,561
tap.

2816
01:11:27,561 --> 01:11:30,270
Tap is not just Jujitsu with no Gary.

2817
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:35,271
It's just toughness and just animal spirit
and the toughest kids is his warrior

2818
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:41,250
heart that allowed him to get through
getting spiked on his head like that and

2819
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:46,251
battered and nuts is 350 pound juggernaut
on top of you dropping bombs on you.

2820
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,050
Legend still gets Rushmore.

2821
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,453
Rushmore.

2822
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,510
Fuck man.

2823
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,890
What a crazy time.

2824
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,200
Those pride days where flanking.

2825
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:58,560
What a great plaintiff
was that hockey Bono?

2826
01:11:59,040 --> 01:11:59,640
Yeah.

2827
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,473
Do you know hoists?

2828
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,291
Hoy Speed Aki.

2829
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,730
Bono with an armbar.

2830
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:03,621
How bad ass?

2831
01:12:03,621 --> 01:12:04,740
His voice fucking crazy.

2832
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,720
Oh my God.

2833
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:06,900
Hoists Gracie fought Aki.

2834
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:08,910
Bono with the pants on.

2835
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:10,710
He fought like with g pants I can ride.

2836
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:13,140
He did got Aki bono arm bar.

2837
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:17,760
Look at this size of occupied
Pono Jesus Christ said,

2838
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:18,840
fuck your Kido.

2839
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:19,770
Who,

2840
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,510
that dude is thick.

2841
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,170
This is a Bob Sapp though that
has started to lose his physique.

2842
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,580
Like this is a,

2843
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,310
into his career where
he had been fighting,

2844
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:29,911
you know,

2845
01:12:29,911 --> 01:12:34,500
like you'd only like the levels of juice
that he was on during those days of

2846
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,190
glory.

2847
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,300
Like when he fought Nogueira.

2848
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:38,070
Those are just not sustainable.

2849
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:38,460
No,

2850
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,750
he also hated fighting.

2851
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:39,851
I,

2852
01:12:39,851 --> 01:12:40,800
I have a friend that,

2853
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:41,220
uh,

2854
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:44,520
that shows on those fighter with him
and he used to train with Bob and said

2855
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,170
towards end of his career,

2856
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,460
he wouldn't barely train it all.

2857
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:48,420
You just do it for the payday.

2858
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:49,350
He just walked in the,

2859
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:49,831
yeah,

2860
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:51,480
and he would tap whenever he got hurt.

2861
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,040
He was smart about it.

2862
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:53,281
He like,

2863
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:54,270
he knew he could make money.

2864
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,480
He would go places they'd want to
see people beat Bob Sapp and see.

2865
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,060
He would go and he would
not take much of a beating.

2866
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:00,841
Did in Tokyo.

2867
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:03,000
He was like on the fucking
Wheaties box and stuff.

2868
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:03,601
Used to sell,

2869
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:05,220
like call sorts of merchandise.

2870
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,690
Look at this shit,

2871
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:07,770
stain undies and stuff.

2872
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,820
But do you know what happened?

2873
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:09,720
Do you know the whole story?

2874
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,140
No,

2875
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,530
something happened with k one
where he had a contract that,

2876
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,100
um,

2877
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,390
he was supposed to go out and fight,

2878
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:16,800
but they hadn't given him the contract.

2879
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:17,101
And he's like,

2880
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:17,934
I'm not signing,

2881
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:18,511
I mean,

2882
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:20,400
I'm not fighting without
a fucking contract.

2883
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:21,623
I need my money.

2884
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,230
Legit point.

2885
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,000
And wound up leaving.

2886
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:27,540
There was some sort of a contract dispute
and wound up leaving before the main

2887
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:30,230
event just dipped out as dipped out.

2888
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:30,541
I said,

2889
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:30,991
fuck this.

2890
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:31,500
I'm out.

2891
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,340
I'm not fighting.

2892
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:32,970
And you know,

2893
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:33,360
they're like,

2894
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:33,541
oh,

2895
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:34,010
what?

2896
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,070
That's the year is over.

2897
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:36,170
Like you're done.

2898
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,020
You're done.

2899
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:37,291
I am.

2900
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:37,890
I didn't know that.

2901
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:38,370
Yeah.

2902
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,203
Yeah.

2903
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,043
And um,

2904
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,220
I guess you know,

2905
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:42,390
whether or not,

2906
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,000
I don't know whose stories correct.

2907
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,750
And all I know is a story that I've read
and the store that I had read was that,

2908
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:48,960
you know,

2909
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,471
he was upset.

2910
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:52,290
They hadn't given him the contract yet
and they wanted him to just fight and

2911
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:53,124
deal with it later.

2912
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,670
Yeah.

2913
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,211
Come on,

2914
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:54,690
Bro.

2915
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:54,931
Listen,

2916
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,130
if they can get you to do something,

2917
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,260
it's specially right before I got,

2918
01:13:58,261 --> 01:13:58,560
dammit.

2919
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:58,921
All right.

2920
01:13:58,921 --> 01:13:59,520
Boom.

2921
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,150
Yeah.

2922
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,880
Well when I talked to people that are
Japanese about the way they would do

2923
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:03,571
business over there,

2924
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:04,680
he says really interesting.

2925
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:05,371
He's like,

2926
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:08,010
one of the things that like when
the UFC was talking to pride,

2927
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:11,560
it was really interesting because they
would have these meetings and they would

2928
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:12,850
talk about selling it,

2929
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:13,601
you know,

2930
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:14,770
but they really didn't want to sell it.

2931
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,450
They just wanted you to say
that you wanted to buy it.

2932
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:16,661
They're like,

2933
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:17,290
okay,

2934
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:17,590
good.

2935
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,070
See you later.

2936
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,150
Just nearly stopped.

2937
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:21,070
But then it also pumped up pride.

2938
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,940
Like everybody in the UFC tarted talking
about Vandelay was going to fight chuck

2939
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:25,810
and they are bringing together,

2940
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,250
but these Japanese business,

2941
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,590
when would they were playing
like super high level,

2942
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,870
sophisticated dimensional chess,

2943
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,913
very tight move.

2944
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,840
And then here's the
tightest of tight move.

2945
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:36,310
I'm not happy that they did this,

2946
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,480
but they essentially,

2947
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:40,720
she sold the UFC $60
million worth of nothing.

2948
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,830
They got a,

2949
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:45,880
they got a fucking video library of
fights and they got pride to be out of

2950
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,390
business.

2951
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:50,230
That's what they got for 60 whatever
million dollars they paid because a lot of

2952
01:14:50,231 --> 01:14:51,460
the contracts were no good.

2953
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,060
Yup.

2954
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,370
That's why fade or it
was never in the UFC.

2955
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,060
I mean,

2956
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,140
and the Mark Hunt thing,

2957
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:59,290
they were willing to pay Mark Hunt out
there like we were willing to give you

2958
01:14:59,291 --> 01:14:59,890
your money.

2959
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:00,681
He's ended up fuck that.

2960
01:15:00,681 --> 01:15:01,514
I want to fight.

2961
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:01,950
Yeah.

2962
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,400
UFC didn't want work to fight.

2963
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:04,050
Yeah.

2964
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,300
Yeah.

2965
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,100
I remember when mark first got the UFC,

2966
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,600
it wasn't pretty days.

2967
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:07,931
No.

2968
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:09,830
Humans get submitted by Chris Tuscher.

2969
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,230
Yeah.

2970
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:11,320
He had some rough days.

2971
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,250
Had some rough days.

2972
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,170
Yeah.

2973
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,310
We'll fight and flight by somebody.

2974
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,410
Like in his first Sean.

2975
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,310
Oh,

2976
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:18,760
uh,

2977
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,900
corcal yes.

2978
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:23,410
Sean McCorkle caught him in
the Camorra from his back.

2979
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,290
His first fight in the
first fight in the UFC.

2980
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,100
Submitted them,

2981
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:26,933
submitted them.

2982
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,300
Huge upset.

2983
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,970
And then he had the mccorkells
a funny fucking guy.

2984
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:33,380
He says some ridiculous Shit Online.

2985
01:15:33,381 --> 01:15:33,640
I don't know.

2986
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,140
Is he still alive?

2987
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,273
I haven't heard from him.

2988
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:37,500
It was a funny guy.

2989
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,380
He's was funny at the time.

2990
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:38,891
Him and met,

2991
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:39,611
used to train together.

2992
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:40,391
I think they had to show,

2993
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:41,350
but um,

2994
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:41,951
yeah,

2995
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,330
mark struggled for a little bit there.

2996
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:45,990
And then he had the walk off home
run knocked out of Chris Duchscherer.

2997
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:46,540
Yeah.

2998
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,560
That horrible fight.

2999
01:15:47,561 --> 01:15:48,394
And Denver.

3000
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,090
Oh yeah.

3001
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:49,700
Fuck dead.

3002
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,150
Rothwell Rothwell cause they both
got so tired because the altitude.

3003
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:52,930
Yeah.

3004
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,080
And then I was asking Joe Silva's,

3005
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:54,341
Dude,

3006
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,200
let me fight my hometown.

3007
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:55,451
He's like,

3008
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:57,880
we will never do heavyweights
in Denver again because of that.

3009
01:15:57,881 --> 01:15:58,490
Meanwhile,

3010
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:00,670
they have Ken fight for doom or they have,

3011
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:01,240
um,

3012
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,000
a Mexican Cain fight for
doom and Mexico City,

3013
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:05,920
which is 2000 feet higher.

3014
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:06,690
Bad idea.

3015
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:07,523
The ridiculous.

3016
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,320
So what else is going on in this card?

3017
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:10,690
Is that it?

3018
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,530
Should we just wrap this up?

3019
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,660
I think I've got kind of got fleas.

3020
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:14,051
Hillary.

3021
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:14,201
Yeah,

3022
01:16:14,201 --> 01:16:15,120
you kind of got it covered.

3023
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,450
We kind of got the card covered.

3024
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:16,661
Oh,

3025
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:17,441
the Paul Felder,

3026
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:19,060
Charles Olivera fight it.

3027
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:20,290
Felder's a fucking beast,

3028
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,010
man fit,

3029
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,281
you know,

3030
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:21,701
filters.

3031
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:22,990
Another guy who,

3032
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:23,650
uh,

3033
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,160
and I'm,

3034
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,821
I'm interested to see.

3035
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:25,650
I'm not hating on you.

3036
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:26,680
I'm not saying they can't do it.

3037
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,553
Amisha see,

3038
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:28,151
you know,

3039
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:30,310
I'll see DC DC's been able to do it.

3040
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,413
Um,

3041
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,320
Dominick Cruz,

3042
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,880
he got injured but he
was supposed to fight.

3043
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:34,541
He's out of the fight now.

3044
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:39,100
But guys who were working as analysts
and fighters at a certain level,

3045
01:16:39,101 --> 01:16:41,800
are you going to be able to continue
at the highest level and compete?

3046
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,220
But he's not doing the
animal analysis and not for,

3047
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,280
I think it's going to find
hurt him and I think in,

3048
01:16:46,281 --> 01:16:47,440
in fact it's enough.

3049
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:49,840
So it probably takes his mind
off the training a little bit,

3050
01:16:49,841 --> 01:16:51,940
let them relax and let
some analyze fights.

3051
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,110
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

3052
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,820
And when he did do the commentary,

3053
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:55,654
he was really good at it.

3054
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,591
That's my thing.

3055
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:57,321
He's really good.

3056
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:57,751
It's really good.

3057
01:16:57,751 --> 01:16:58,750
I was really good at it.

3058
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,700
He has a future in it for sure.

3059
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,020
Once he decides to retire.

3060
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,580
Paul could be an amazing commentator.

3061
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,890
I still think he's in his prime.

3062
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,960
I think it's potentials in commentating,

3063
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,090
I think was a hypertension commentating
that he does be in the world champion in

3064
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:11,510
the UFC.

3065
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:12,860
I'm not willing to sign them off yet.

3066
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,180
I'm not signing them off.

3067
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:15,500
He's a phenomenal fighter.

3068
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,540
He's a phenomenal fighter.

3069
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,630
I don't know if he's world champion,

3070
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:18,590
but he's phenomenal fight.

3071
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,160
How crazy would he be versus
Gagey that's a fun fight.

3072
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:23,390
That's a fun fucking fight.

3073
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:24,320
He's an animal.

3074
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,550
Fleets hail are versus gagey would be
maybe like a perfect style matchup.

3075
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,080
Never mad when Cooper fights.

3076
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,210
Now I'm a,

3077
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,480
I'm excited about this fight,

3078
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:32,670
um,

3079
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:36,330
because all of air is very technical
on his feet all over this side,

3080
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,040
the underground,

3081
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,600
he's super technical and he,

3082
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:38,960
you know,

3083
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,201
he,

3084
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:40,430
he's sneaky on the ground,

3085
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:42,510
but he just can't get over that hump yet.

3086
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,221
So much prompts.

3087
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:44,250
He's just going to go over that hump.

3088
01:17:44,251 --> 01:17:47,720
We can't be telling Derek Silva where
there's so much promise and we thought

3089
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:49,940
they're going to be this and
just has an aligned for him.

3090
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,790
The so Hutto pedes fights
a very important fight to,

3091
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,751
very important.

3092
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:54,680
When you look at Pseudo Huda,

3093
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:57,410
when he came off of that
fight with a Wilson Hayes,

3094
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,930
he looked amazing sensation.

3095
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,920
But also what screwed,

3096
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:01,750
not screwed on me.

3097
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,690
It was a good experience.

3098
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:03,471
But when you fought,

3099
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,840
Demetrius Johnson had no seven fight,

3100
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:07,130
mixed martial arts flight sim fight.

3101
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,800
He should not been in
there with Demetrius.

3102
01:18:08,801 --> 01:18:12,110
John is just not ready now we
see a little more well rounded.

3103
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,480
He's a phenomenal power puncher offset.

3104
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,470
You'll ridiculous wrestler a for pedes it.

3105
01:18:17,471 --> 01:18:19,580
It's a tough one for him to take on here.

3106
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,361
Very tough.

3107
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:21,171
And he's a young kid,

3108
01:18:21,171 --> 01:18:21,450
you know,

3109
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,940
pedes is only 24 I think.

3110
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,660
He's very young.

3111
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,351
He's very young.

3112
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:24,610
He's,

3113
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,010
he's,

3114
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,140
he's out of his brother's
shadow now for sure.

3115
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:28,130
He's at his brother's shadow.

3116
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:29,300
Well with a few wins.

3117
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:31,010
His brother's still a
former world champion,

3118
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:32,720
both in strike force and in the UFC.

3119
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:34,010
He's brother just lost again though.

3120
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:35,570
He's lost a bunch.

3121
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,950
He's fighting at a way higher
level up until this fight.

3122
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:41,680
At least this fight is a,

3123
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,630
this is like a world
class level for for pedes.

3124
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:46,910
This is like the most difficult fight,

3125
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:47,350
I think.

3126
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:52,350
100% it's a little too much too soon
I think for pedes and that David Tamer

3127
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:53,204
dude,

3128
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,950
he's fighting against your car
clothes that fuck you see Tamer fight.

3129
01:18:57,951 --> 01:18:59,690
He was the one that
fought Landover not ass.

3130
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,200
Ooh,

3131
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,010
he's nasty.

3132
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:01,611
He's a monster.

3133
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:02,810
He's a fucking savage.

3134
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,291
Savage.

3135
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,660
Kickboxer man there.

3136
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:05,750
That's going to be a following year.

3137
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:06,381
Fucking go.

3138
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:08,160
Cons out of the fight out.

3139
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,740
I'm not sure he got hurt.

3140
01:19:09,741 --> 01:19:11,360
That's a bomber and it is a bummer.

3141
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,530
How about Holly a?

3142
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:17,531
I'm sure it will for
Holly Cyborg tat time.

3143
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:19,790
It's interesting.

3144
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:20,271
I'll tell you what,

3145
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:23,060
nobody has more composed or composure.

3146
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:27,590
Nobody has more composure in
their Instagram videos than Holly.

3147
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,450
She's the most composure.

3148
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:29,931
She's like,

3149
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,190
when she says professional,

3150
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,310
Cyborg's been saying that.

3151
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,210
I haven't been tested.

3152
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:35,961
She's a politician.

3153
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:36,501
I'd actually,

3154
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:37,970
I'd been tested nine times.

3155
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:39,860
She's been tested heat times.

3156
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:45,100
So some of us are out here training
and not worrying about who's fantastic.

3157
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,510
It's so like,

3158
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:48,320
thank you.

3159
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,660
Thank you and have a good thank you.

3160
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:50,780
I'm ready to head kick a pitch.

3161
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:56,270
I love following such in direct
contrast to her fucking back flips.

3162
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:57,170
She's a politician.

3163
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:58,250
Head kicks and shit.

3164
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,120
It's like a politician,

3165
01:19:59,140 --> 01:19:59,320
right?

3166
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,021
Smart man.

3167
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:01,520
Very calm and smooth and,

3168
01:20:01,521 --> 01:20:03,620
and she's like a real all American girl.

3169
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,850
Like you look at Holly Holm.

3170
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:06,050
I mean she got freckles and shit.

3171
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:06,860
She's pretty,

3172
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:11,520
she like an all American head
kicker and beat Cyborg in the tough.

3173
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,390
If it's tough,

3174
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,490
if she beats Cyborg to me,

3175
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,720
she's number one of all time that she'd
beat Ron and her prime right now should

3176
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:20,040
beat Cyborg in her prime.

3177
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,000
What are we doing?

3178
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,190
I know she had those rough logs.

3179
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,480
Shelter where you should take.

3180
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,650
I know.

3181
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:25,981
Listen,

3182
01:20:25,981 --> 01:20:30,510
Misha Tate strangled her and she was
still punching in the air while she was

3183
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:31,590
going unconscious.

3184
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,130
Yeah.

3185
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:36,540
That's how savage Holly Holm as I know
and such a great matchup we should take.

3186
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,180
Did get her and Nisha got her
in the fifth round of a fight.

3187
01:20:39,181 --> 01:20:39,761
She was losing.

3188
01:20:39,761 --> 01:20:43,590
Losing took her back and put
it asleep on should tape fans.

3189
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:44,550
Ooh.

3190
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,070
Yeah.

3191
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:47,790
Fan.

3192
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:48,780
But she's retired.

3193
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:49,710
Yup.

3194
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,320
She want to do anything
about Holly sideboard.

3195
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,073
Yeah,

3196
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,260
but it's that Holly Cyborg.

3197
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:55,971
Yeah.

3198
01:20:55,971 --> 01:20:57,490
I wonder what kind of numbers
that does cause that's,

3199
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:59,010
that's your headline on there right now.

3200
01:20:59,070 --> 01:20:59,590
Because you know,

3201
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:01,050
dump cruises off.

3202
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:01,411
Well,

3203
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:05,400
it's going to show you the
power of a like top flight,

3204
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,560
women's MMA fights and then there's the,

3205
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:08,190
you know,

3206
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,720
there's the cyborg aspect.

3207
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:10,501
Like people tune in,

3208
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,660
she's like a cultural
icon sort of a thing.

3209
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,820
Like people would tune in to see
you like all that cyborg check.

3210
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:15,470
She's scared.

3211
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:15,630
Yeah.

3212
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:17,670
Does it scares either
and it's scary being me.

3213
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:18,760
Not physically scary,

3214
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,600
too scary.

3215
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,030
The way she destroys violent,

3216
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,130
very violent and very technical.

3217
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,660
Her last fight wasn't that violent,

3218
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:27,810
but she wanted to show most
for was fighting a crazy,

3219
01:21:27,811 --> 01:21:30,120
I mean Zam Zam Zam Tonya evenger.

3220
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:31,110
She's,

3221
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,480
she,

3222
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,520
she didn't give a fuck.

3223
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,580
She was throwing me mom,

3224
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:33,900
I don't know.

3225
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,130
I call it my mom.

3226
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,360
She's tough as fuck and mom
bod and also would not go away.

3227
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,460
Like that's that.

3228
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:42,420
If you were watching
like a youtube or a law,

3229
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,350
it wouldn't even be on youtube.

3230
01:21:43,351 --> 01:21:44,190
They pull it from youtube,

3231
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,560
like a live leak outside
of a bar and Kentucky,

3232
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,663
I think worse.

3233
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:48,481
She saw him.

3234
01:21:48,481 --> 01:21:49,440
Chick gets up,

3235
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,580
puts her fucking cigarette
down and rolls up the sleeves.

3236
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:53,491
Flannel shirt,

3237
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:54,450
probably wearing your shirt.

3238
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:58,170
The very shirt you're wearing and just
throws haymakers on some check and she's

3239
01:21:58,171 --> 01:22:02,220
got her by the Gal and she's fucking
drop and Moitai elbows on her,

3240
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,230
but she keeps getting wrong.

3241
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,890
She'd be like the Kimbo slice
of soccer moms in the backyard.

3242
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:09,480
Brawler she's a tough,

3243
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,111
tough woman.

3244
01:22:10,111 --> 01:22:11,910
She's as tough as the same animal.

3245
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:13,470
I enjoyed that fight because of her.

3246
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:13,951
I agree.

3247
01:22:13,951 --> 01:22:14,784
She made the phone.

3248
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,810
She made the fire chief.

3249
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:19,140
She fucking had some whistling
shots swinging by Cyborgs Chin.

3250
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,270
She didn't let him get all for it.

3251
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:22,590
She took it.

3252
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,150
She took it and she was going for it.

3253
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,023
That's off.

3254
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:25,731
Took a fight.

3255
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:26,820
Did a lot of people didn't want,

3256
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,840
no one wants that fight.

3257
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:27,961
Yeah.

3258
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:28,261
I mean,

3259
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:29,880
look at fucking Germane to random.

3260
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:30,181
He said,

3261
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:31,014
Nah,

3262
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,620
I'm good.

3263
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,610
You can keep your title.

3264
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,270
Shuck fighting her if she's
done steroids before it yet,

3265
01:22:35,271 --> 01:22:36,104
but she tests clean now.

3266
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:36,621
I don't care.

3267
01:22:36,621 --> 01:22:36,740
I'm,

3268
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:37,320
I'm not.

3269
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,610
Not recently enough.

3270
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,330
Nope.

3271
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:39,511
No.

3272
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:43,880
You got to get her to test her again like
10 years to every day for 10 years and

3273
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,000
then we'll draw me said,

3274
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:45,834
fuck this.

3275
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,250
I love that Cyborg fight though.

3276
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:47,821
I do too.

3277
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:50,520
But I want you to see what number
is it does see Germane to random.

3278
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,960
He is a very tactical Stryker.

3279
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:54,300
That's why I thought her versus
Cyborg would be interesting.

3280
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,403
I mean Jermaine,

3281
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,130
Jermaine to random,

3282
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:57,000
he fought a man.

3283
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:59,640
That's how crazy scary Cyborg is.

3284
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:05,030
Germane fought a man and k owed
him this video of you can watch it.

3285
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,031
She's like,

3286
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:07,740
I'll fight a man,

3287
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,573
but I don't know if

3288
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:12,730
I just,

3289
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:16,040
I'm off to do randomly just
when you give up the belly,

3290
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,020
say not fuck it.

3291
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:17,530
She just,

3292
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,430
she's too much.

3293
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:19,111
Well I'm,

3294
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:19,710
I'm a,

3295
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:20,980
I'm a fan of her talent.

3296
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,240
She's a very talented fighter.

3297
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,010
She shouldn't have been
shared in the first place.

3298
01:23:24,011 --> 01:23:24,790
I agree.

3299
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,850
Holly beat her and I think she
should have been penalized for sure.

3300
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,410
For at least one of those.

3301
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:30,970
After the bell shot 100%.

3302
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,650
She landed two after the bell shots.

3303
01:23:32,651 --> 01:23:34,030
One of them was devastating.

3304
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,350
Like she really rocked Holly,

3305
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:36,010
beat her.

3306
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:36,850
I think Holly beat her.

3307
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:37,893
I think uh,

3308
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:40,090
you got to take into consideration how,

3309
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:42,070
what scoring system they
were using back then.

3310
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:46,210
Because I do not think that they were
using the new MMA school is also New York,

3311
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,800
his early Day New York.

3312
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:49,720
When I say early
[inaudible] six months ago,

3313
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,700
I think the refereeing,

3314
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,550
I mean I think the refereeing could
have been better because I do think she

3315
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:57,880
should have been penalized for those
shots after the bill and when Holly head

3316
01:23:57,881 --> 01:23:58,480
kicked her,

3317
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,730
that was one of the most
significant moments in the fight.

3318
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:03,310
The other most significant moment of
the fighters and Holly dropped it with a

3319
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:04,060
straight left hand.

3320
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,271
Yeah.

3321
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:07,870
So those are two giant moments in the
fight and they were both on Holly side and

3322
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:09,910
then there was the two
shots after the bell,

3323
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:14,410
which you could conceivably penalize
her for at least one you have to do for

3324
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:14,690
one.

3325
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:15,330
And that's what I thought.

3326
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:16,163
Hold won the fight.

3327
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:16,391
Yeah,

3328
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:16,730
I would agree.

3329
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:17,563
I would agree with you.

3330
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,910
I would agree with you
because other than that,

3331
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,890
Holly did the most damage
in the fight for sure.

3332
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:23,250
But during demanding Germain,

3333
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,730
de Randamie was controlling the action,

3334
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:27,080
the beginning of the
fight until Holly Landa,

3335
01:24:27,081 --> 01:24:30,520
that question Mark Kick
Funko a question mark.

3336
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:31,630
It cause a beautiful kick.

3337
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,410
It's just a beautiful kick.

3338
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:33,840
You know,

3339
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,501
if you're good at it,

3340
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:35,800
if you get that over the top,

3341
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:37,300
like rock holds beautiful at that.

3342
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,450
He's really good at it.

3343
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,880
No one does better than Donald,

3344
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:40,660
but yeah.

3345
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,310
Dollar kind of beautiful.

3346
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,181
I feel like Donald,

3347
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:45,970
when he kind of made that
his thing in the UFC,

3348
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:46,700
yes.

3349
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,261
Per head kick.

3350
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:48,250
Kaos um,

3351
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,210
question mark kicks.

3352
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,100
There's been some other ones in the past.

3353
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,680
I'm trying to remember that video.

3354
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:54,850
I think Justin wren posted,

3355
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:58,720
but ESPN blast it that the wheel kick
that land and knocked that dude out.

3356
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,780
The heel landed right on the dude's chin.

3357
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,010
It's so gnarly.

3358
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:03,341
Oh,

3359
01:25:03,341 --> 01:25:05,920
the one with the dude ducks
down and throws an up.

3360
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:06,754
We'll kick.

3361
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,260
The guy's throwing a head kick.

3362
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,900
There's a black guy in a white guy
and that guy throws her head yes.

3363
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:14,350
And the dude ducks down like almost
like a cartwheel kick and throws like a,

3364
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:14,921
yeah,

3365
01:25:14,921 --> 01:25:16,960
we'll kick up and the shield goes,

3366
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:17,530
oh,

3367
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:18,370
perfect shot.

3368
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,233
My God,

3369
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,590
the way he threw it.

3370
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:21,730
You know what the video is?

3371
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,550
Capitol Eric?

3372
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,610
Yes.

3373
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,810
Well it's almost like that.

3374
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:29,350
But what it's like is like he just knew
where they do its chin was going to be

3375
01:25:29,351 --> 01:25:30,700
and duct himself.

3376
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:33,100
So you know you bend your body,

3377
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:36,580
but it's just very rare that you
see someone landed at that angle.

3378
01:25:36,581 --> 01:25:37,750
Especially with the heel.

3379
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,310
Yeah.

3380
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,850
Was He,

3381
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,570
did it look at this boom.

3382
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,770
Crazy.

3383
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:47,490
It's almost like it's hard to know whether
or not that was like perfectly placed

3384
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:49,840
or just crazy lucky timing.

3385
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,610
I think you'll like watch this,

3386
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,270
watch it again.

3387
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,200
So you see him here,

3388
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:54,034
he's going to give it up.

3389
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:54,670
See,

3390
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,770
but that's not the way did it.

3391
01:25:56,771 --> 01:25:58,210
So it's not a normal path.

3392
01:25:58,211 --> 01:25:58,931
It's really amazing.

3393
01:25:58,931 --> 01:26:01,600
Almost like he almost adapt to
do it when it's straight up.

3394
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:02,140
Once he,

3395
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:02,620
yeah,

3396
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,220
he knew he had was going to be,

3397
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,113
I mean it really,

3398
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,060
you'd have to see him fight more to
see how good he is with his kicks,

3399
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:09,470
but that shit is perfect.

3400
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,190
Let's see that warranty mass the
more time because it's crazy.

3401
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,380
Luckily the look,

3402
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,420
the title amateur MMA fighter,

3403
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:17,430
it's starch.

3404
01:26:17,431 --> 01:26:18,300
His opponents.

3405
01:26:18,301 --> 01:26:19,130
He right here,

3406
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,910
like a taekwondo guy would see the
shifting of the hips and then the shoulder

3407
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,180
moves toward the left and so see that?

3408
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:25,630
Yeah,

3409
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:26,560
I see that right there.

3410
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,321
You see that right there?

3411
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:28,550
That is absolutely.

3412
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:29,390
He's about to spend.

3413
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,090
See the right leg moves
the right leg slides back.

3414
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,140
You're showing your cards
that you don't see it.

3415
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,850
Wonderboy is not going
to shock you to see that.

3416
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:40,130
Now he's showing us
these flashing his aces,

3417
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,670
but he's also doing it in
timing with this left high kick,

3418
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:44,570
which is so brilliant.

3419
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,610
So the the left kick is coming.

3420
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,160
He sees the left kick and he's like,

3421
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:49,731
yeah,

3422
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,260
check this out brow.

3423
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:55,310
I ain't there to the head killed Mrs this.

3424
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:58,010
And then it goes and you know
what I think you did on purpose?

3425
01:26:58,011 --> 01:26:59,450
100% percent.

3426
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:00,530
Oh,

3427
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:04,550
I mean he either improvised in the
moment or he did it exactly like this on

3428
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:04,881
purpose,

3429
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:05,750
like saw it common.

3430
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,670
But either way it's just a perfect shot.

3431
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:12,671
Two to dodge that kick and land
this he kick skillful shit.

3432
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:17,480
Amazing is a head kick and landed a
perfect like crazy 90 degree angle.

3433
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:20,370
We'll kick to the mug
amateur fight I've seen.

3434
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,273
Okay,

3435
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:22,183
that's crazy.

3436
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,400
It's crazy how he saw the
left high kick to like boom,

3437
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:29,780
fucking a BSPN as an
amateur fight in an ESPN.

3438
01:27:29,781 --> 01:27:32,760
I know right now you gotta
you gotta make up for that,

3439
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:35,090
that you got to carry that with you.

3440
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,230
Everybody's looking for the head kick.

3441
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,890
The next ones you can't be grounded.

3442
01:27:37,891 --> 01:27:39,050
Pounded so first thing now.

3443
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:40,183
Yeah,

3444
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:42,560
she's getting married to
a thing really early on.

3445
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:43,290
Right.

3446
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:47,000
Becomes a real problem because real
problem Helia like you're known as like if

3447
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:47,311
gates,

3448
01:27:47,311 --> 01:27:50,570
he just decides tomorrow to
fight like Tyron Woodley.

3449
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,660
I just move around a lot and
get the fuck out of dies.

3450
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:56,901
There's middle riot.

3451
01:27:56,901 --> 01:27:58,760
People would go so crazy.

3452
01:27:59,060 --> 01:27:59,721
Like what if gauge,

3453
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:02,690
you got a title shot against Tyron
Woodley and they both looked mirrored each

3454
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:03,380
other.

3455
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,620
We both like like,

3456
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,470
like what the fuck is going?

3457
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,781
Wait,

3458
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:07,111
wait,

3459
01:28:07,111 --> 01:28:07,441
wait,

3460
01:28:07,441 --> 01:28:07,750
wait,

3461
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,583
wait,

3462
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,080
wait,

3463
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:09,351
wait,

3464
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:09,501
wait.

3465
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:10,011
Oh wait,

3466
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:10,281
wait,

3467
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:10,611
wait,

3468
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:11,300
wait.

3469
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,310
Have you seen how hard your boy,

3470
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:17,120
Colby Covington's getting going
in the paint on Instagram Woodley?

3471
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:17,720
Oh my God.

3472
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,400
Have you seen his recent
one with the sandals?

3473
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,160
He did a black Friday sale.

3474
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:23,400
They sandals mockin and Woodley.

3475
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,553
Wow.

3476
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:25,850
You got to see it.

3477
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,740
I don't care how he's
mocking Woodley was handles.

3478
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,470
You'll see it.

3479
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,090
Okay.

3480
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:29,990
They're not real sandals.

3481
01:28:29,991 --> 01:28:30,411
He's just like,

3482
01:28:30,411 --> 01:28:30,561
Hey,

3483
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:33,080
make sure you get your sitting
to your sandals this Friday.

3484
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:35,930
And it's the sandals of
Woodley saying one thing.

3485
01:28:35,931 --> 01:28:37,220
Why he'll fight Nate Diaz,

3486
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:38,330
but saying another thing,

3487
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:39,590
life won't fight Colby.

3488
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,240
There it is.

3489
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,620
The aerial GSP has duck me.

3490
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:43,760
He just wants money.

3491
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:44,594
Fights.

3492
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,021
Ariel,

3493
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:47,120
I'm not ducking Colby
or anyone that wants 70.

3494
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,430
I want to fight Nate
because it's a money fight.

3495
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:51,703
Um,

3496
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,990
he just seems like he's
saying the same thing.

3497
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:54,500
Yes.

3498
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:54,750
Yeah,

3499
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:55,280
I get it.

3500
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:55,761
I get it.

3501
01:28:55,761 --> 01:28:56,594
Yeah.

3502
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,531
And he just keeps,

3503
01:28:57,531 --> 01:28:58,400
he just wants some money.

3504
01:28:58,401 --> 01:28:59,150
Fight.

3505
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:00,800
I wanna fight nape cause
it's a money fight.

3506
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,673
Yeah,

3507
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:02,790
I get it.

3508
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:03,870
What do you do with Woodley?

3509
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:05,183
Good question.

3510
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,110
You offer him a big fight?

3511
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,000
You know,

3512
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,850
I mean that's what I,

3513
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,300
I'm almost positive it.

3514
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:13,740
Make sure I'm right on this before
I get destroyed on the underground.

3515
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:15,190
But um,

3516
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:16,010
I'm,

3517
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:16,980
I think Dan goes,

3518
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:18,840
we never offered Woodley the Diaz fight.

3519
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:19,540
Oh.

3520
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,600
So he's just trying to get it pretty sure.

3521
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:21,871
Look,

3522
01:29:21,871 --> 01:29:23,940
the real Diaz fight as the other Diaz.

3523
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,133
That's the real key.

3524
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:26,520
Is it nick suspended though?

3525
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:29,040
Let them pay that fucking money back.

3526
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,153
Ah,

3527
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:31,860
Tyron Woodley response to claim.

3528
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:33,990
Nate Diaz fight was
never offered delusional.

3529
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:36,510
Dana constantly demotes me as a fighter.

3530
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,620
Whoa.

3531
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:39,930
In regards to what though Jamie?

3532
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,960
Cause is the claim that Nate Diaz
fight was never offered to him.

3533
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:44,303
Delusional.

3534
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:49,110
Dana did Dana say it constantly demotes
me as a fighter when the job is,

3535
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,510
when the job is to promote his fighters,

3536
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:52,380
especially champions.

3537
01:29:52,381 --> 01:29:52,831
Woodley said,

3538
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:54,930
why would I get in camp?

3539
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:59,490
Why would Nate give a $15 million
purse request if there was no fight?

3540
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:02,940
It's obvious they haven't found
their blockbuster headliner yet.

3541
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,710
This was a reality and they know it.

3542
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,710
The inability to come to financial
terms with Nate killed it.

3543
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:07,981
Oh,

3544
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:08,281
there's,

3545
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:09,360
but there's data going.

3546
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,790
One of our attorneys here
started playing matchmaker,

3547
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:12,624
which is weird.

3548
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:16,230
He said he has a good rapport with the
Diaz brothers and he basically said to

3549
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:16,740
Nate,

3550
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,240
what if you could fight Woodley?

3551
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,231
Me and Sean Shelby.

3552
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:19,621
We're like,

3553
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:21,180
how does he deserve to fight Woodley?

3554
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:25,320
There's no effing list of guys that are
waiting to fight time willy and this

3555
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:25,850
gives a fuck.

3556
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:26,131
Oh,

3557
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:26,490
there is.

3558
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,051
There's a fucking,

3559
01:30:27,051 --> 01:30:27,910
what are you guys?

3560
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:28,863
There you go.

3561
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:29,933
Yeah.

3562
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:30,601
Okay,

3563
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:33,000
so the attorney went out of his way.

3564
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:33,570
The attorney,

3565
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:34,620
the attorney fucked up.

3566
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:39,540
Who's this attorney kind of slap Dick
Attorney tries play in these games.

3567
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,520
That's what I would do.

3568
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:40,710
You.

3569
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,220
I've seen them.

3570
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,270
A bunch of fake attorney,

3571
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,440
quitter Twitter accounts.

3572
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:44,791
I'm an attorney with you.

3573
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:45,181
I've seen it.

3574
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:46,350
I'm interested to know,

3575
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,330
would you be interested
in this last grant?

3576
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:50,400
I know you say you're
retired but not retired.

3577
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:50,700
Are you?

3578
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:51,240
Get back at me,

3579
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:51,770
dude,

3580
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,190
that can ask it on the podcast.

3581
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:54,360
Fuck yes,

3582
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,633
dude.

3583
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:56,670
To me,

3584
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:57,930
his career is a sad story.

3585
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,880
It is the guy that never was,

3586
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,050
well they,

3587
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:02,280
for whatever reason,

3588
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,340
they couldn't work it out
with him and the UFC and Dana,

3589
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:07,620
they had their disagreements
and also his fighting style.

3590
01:31:07,621 --> 01:31:09,930
But for him never to compete.

3591
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,320
They're fighting style is court.

3592
01:31:11,321 --> 01:31:11,851
And Man,

3593
01:31:11,851 --> 01:31:13,140
if you're a fan of fighting,

3594
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:17,430
that style is important because Ben
aspirins shuts motherfuckers down and he

3595
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:20,170
shuts good guys like Lima and Bowel memo.

3596
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,790
We've shut Lima down like
Korotkov shot him the fuck.

3597
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:24,360
Shut them down.

3598
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:28,080
Those are world class
guys shot his ass down.

3599
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:28,711
Such a bummer.

3600
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:29,730
He never gotten the EOC.

3601
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,530
And you know what I gotta be honest.

3602
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:33,900
I think if that same GSP showed up,

3603
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:37,620
that fight Bisbing shows up to
fight astron African beats on Whoa.

3604
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,130
I know.

3605
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:38,910
Crazy right?

3606
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,640
To me asking.

3607
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,473
It's a sad story.

3608
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:41,761
It's a sad,

3609
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:42,480
sad story.

3610
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,140
I agree.

3611
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:43,973
He's um,

3612
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:44,881
my,

3613
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:48,420
if I had one wish to get a guy in
the UFC that's never been in the UFC,

3614
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:51,170
he'd be the guy let me to fade.

3615
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:54,840
Or it's like you already getting the
same in Beltour but he was on just

3616
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,773
[inaudible].

3617
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:56,220
You know,

3618
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:56,791
I get it,

3619
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:57,870
but not this stage.

3620
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,020
At this stage I would say,

3621
01:31:59,220 --> 01:31:59,360
uh,

3622
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,060
without doubt it was aspirin.

3623
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:06,510
I would use my golden ticket if I had
one with Dana to get askern and yeah,

3624
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:07,713
I would too.

3625
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,590
But you know he called Dana
like a fat bald steroid monkey,

3626
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,833
but shit.

3627
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,440
But he's funny.

3628
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,960
But does that mean how many
things has Dana said about guys?

3629
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,830
It's a style thing too.

3630
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:22,600
They're worried that his style is boring.

3631
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,410
I understand that they are
in the business of fighting,

3632
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,780
but I mean I kind of am,

3633
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:29,740
but I've kind of not,

3634
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:31,540
I'm in the business of,

3635
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:35,470
I'm a fan of fighting and I'm
not just a fan of fighting.

3636
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:36,790
Like I like to watch fights.

3637
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:40,120
I want to see what the
fuck really works the best.

3638
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:44,290
And when a guy can do what Ben aspirins
been able to do time and time again in

3639
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:45,850
his career to world class fighters,

3640
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:46,481
take them down,

3641
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:47,141
smother them,

3642
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:48,130
beat the shit out of him.

3643
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:48,910
That's entertaining.

3644
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:50,170
It's not just entertaining.

3645
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:51,580
It's important for the,

3646
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,630
for the art form.

3647
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:57,190
I agree to adapt to that style that you've
got to know that a guy can do that to

3648
01:32:57,191 --> 01:33:01,600
a guy like Lima or it got like course
correct but also been asking can he speaks

3649
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:01,870
well?

3650
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:02,171
Yes.

3651
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:03,640
You can hype the fight up on social media.

3652
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:04,474
He speaks very well.

3653
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,313
Yes.

3654
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,383
Olympian.

3655
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:07,240
He's also an Olympian.

3656
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,080
And how about this?

3657
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:10,810
Floyd Mayweather does not win
fights because this is exciting

3658
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:15,040
to see him lose cause
he's a good trash talker.

3659
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,950
We should start our own promotion.

3660
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:19,100
We really should.

3661
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,860
What should we co in a football field.

3662
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:22,681
God Damn it,

3663
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:23,290
don't you and Eddie,

3664
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:23,831
you're doing that.

3665
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:24,940
I don't do football fields.

3666
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:26,430
Freak party fighting productions.

3667
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:32,230
I think that crazy as he is the
matchmaker and it would definitely be the

3668
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:32,650
matchmaker.

3669
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,240
But first you have to
listen to a 45 minutes,

3670
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,220
seven on the lake in the flatter,

3671
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,170
latest uh,

3672
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,200
false flags.

3673
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:40,390
Come on man.

3674
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:41,710
If we had a sitcom though,

3675
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:42,131
seriously?

3676
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:44,140
Like think about how crazy
different we all are.

3677
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:47,800
If we had a sitcom where there
was like all these characters,

3678
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:49,750
you would want to have
the crazy conspiracy guy.

3679
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:49,881
Oh,

3680
01:33:49,881 --> 01:33:50,460
he doesn't call.

3681
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,260
So one of the best Jujitsu
instructors in the war.

3682
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:53,800
Correct.

3683
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,510
Wizard.

3684
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:57,820
Well validates it wizard guy.

3685
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:58,900
So he's like,

3686
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:01,930
oh all about operation mockingbird.

3687
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:04,720
He's successful so you
can take what he says.

3688
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:05,590
Pretty serious.

3689
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:07,240
But it's also bat shit crazy.

3690
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,940
Batshit crazy and tell you I'm crazy.

3691
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,423
I'm crazy.

3692
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,090
I know.

3693
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:13,901
It's crazy.

3694
01:34:13,901 --> 01:34:14,610
I'm crazy.

3695
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:16,210
But all I'm saying is look into it

3696
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:19,210
then you got Callen.

3697
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:20,170
He's out of his fucking mind.

3698
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:21,213
It's a weird,

3699
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:22,031
weird group of people.

3700
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,440
This is the best dynamic man.

3701
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:24,070
Oh Man.

3702
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:25,450
We haven't done a fight
in painting in a while.

3703
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:25,811
I know.

3704
01:34:25,811 --> 01:34:26,860
We need to do a good one.

3705
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:27,370
I'm the,

3706
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,660
with our big giant ass screen.

3707
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:30,190
We did one with the big giant ass green.

3708
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:30,350
Right.

3709
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:30,741
Just you,

3710
01:34:30,741 --> 01:34:31,480
me and eddy though.

3711
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:31,811
What?

3712
01:34:31,811 --> 01:34:32,350
Um,

3713
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,100
what fights are coming up that we might,

3714
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,350
there's one everyone we want.

3715
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,870
You got here year's show
me what we got here.

3716
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:38,704
Young Dreamer.

3717
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:40,550
We have a,

3718
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,100
there's one

3719
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,710
right after that.

3720
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:46,250
That's what cubs Watson.

3721
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,510
Ooh.

3722
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:49,320
And or Tayga.

3723
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,550
Brian TC,

3724
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,110
Te City Ortega.

3725
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,273
Triangle city.

3726
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:55,570
He's a bad motherfucker.

3727
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,560
I love that guy.

3728
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:57,740
I love his guard man.

3729
01:34:57,741 --> 01:34:58,940
He has one of the best guards.

3730
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,103
That's the one.

3731
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:01,120
That's the one sign.

3732
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:01,680
Don't sign.

3733
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,630
Geosyn Lawler.

3734
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,610
Oh boy.

3735
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,420
December 16 mother fucker.

3736
01:35:07,421 --> 01:35:08,380
I'm in Buffalo.

3737
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:08,920
Everyone's on it.

3738
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:09,760
I'm in Buffalo.

3739
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:10,630
You're in Vegas.

3740
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:11,463
Shit.

3741
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,000
Why are you in Vegas?

3742
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,283
I'm not.

3743
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,401
Oh No,

3744
01:35:15,401 --> 01:35:16,151
I'm in Vegas.

3745
01:35:16,151 --> 01:35:16,750
Uh,

3746
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,450
two weeks ago.

3747
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:17,800
Yeah.

3748
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,580
I'm sorry.

3749
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,480
I'm out of town to that day.

3750
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:20,830
We're all out of town.

3751
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,620
But what's up with that?

3752
01:35:23,621 --> 01:35:25,210
December the December 9th one.

3753
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:27,290
MMM.

3754
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:29,440
When's that Saturday.

3755
01:35:29,441 --> 01:35:30,160
December night.

3756
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:30,993
I'm working.

3757
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,440
Dammit.

3758
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,910
No comedy.

3759
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:33,610
Yeah,

3760
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,110
I'm in like long beach or some shit.

3761
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,053
Long Beach.

3762
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:38,283
Yeah.

3763
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:39,460
Let me tell you exact where I'm at.

3764
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,253
Um,

3765
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:44,110
while you're the long
beach terrace theater.

3766
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,240
Tears stayed in Long Beach.

3767
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:50,170
Guess who's going to be in Boston at the
Wilbur theater on January 19th the day

3768
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:53,280
before UFC two 20 I heard
it's apprenticeship.

3769
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:53,900
Oh,

3770
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:54,350
that's right,

3771
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:55,860
brother in Boston.

3772
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,310
Man.

3773
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:57,190
We're going to be there together.

3774
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,233
Yes.

3775
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:58,930
I'm excited.

3776
01:35:58,930 --> 01:35:59,741
I'm excited too,

3777
01:35:59,741 --> 01:35:59,951
man.

3778
01:35:59,951 --> 01:36:00,521
It's going to be fun.

3779
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:02,320
Weekend tickets just went on sale.

3780
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,960
We'll receive this beautiful place too,

3781
01:36:04,961 --> 01:36:05,794
man.

3782
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,210
You were very funny last night.

3783
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,103
Thanks for killing it.

3784
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,460
Killing it.

3785
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,940
Thanks for working out it too.

3786
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:11,351
