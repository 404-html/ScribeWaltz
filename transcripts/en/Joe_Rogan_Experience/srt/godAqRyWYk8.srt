1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,760
What I was going to say is that the,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,330
the,

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,390
when we were talking about the uh,

5
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,500
needing some sort of a,

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,700
a lesson in how to think
and how to operate the mind.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,650
If the human mind,

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,710
if the human body was the just,

9
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:17,161
you know,

10
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:18,180
just the human experience.

11
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,014
If that was an,

12
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,990
an instrument that you
had to learn to use,

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,590
think about navigating the human life
with the human body and language and think

14
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:34,320
about if you came from somewhere else
and the human body wasn't in the human

15
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,340
experience,

16
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,680
wasn't just a person living a life,

17
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,770
but rather was a ride that
you had figured out how to,

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,640
how to master,

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,670
how to accomplish and that the human
animal with its creative abilities with

20
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,630
disabilities or reach out to people with,

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,160
it's a ability to build
buildings and use electricity,

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,013
all these different things.

23
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,551
That's a,

24
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,384
that's a,

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,433
that's a vehicle.

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,430
That's what that is.

27
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,820
Learn it,

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,840
learn how to use that vehicle.

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,010
You would have intensive
study for a low for years

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,520
of just trying to figure out how to go
about the correct way of doing this.

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,473
They would be like,

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,890
you know,

33
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,141
you,

34
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,060
you'd have to figure out what
is the best way to think,

35
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,930
what is the best way,

36
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,980
what most beneficial way to you
to approach every project as a,

37
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,660
as a person moving around in this
human world with this human machine,

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,670
it would be like a
super complicated thing,

39
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,560
but instead it's just two people.

40
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,394
Fucking,

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,370
some guy shoots a load in the girl,

42
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:29,790
boom.

43
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,660
She swells up,

44
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,170
plank.

45
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,220
A person comes out,

46
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,510
no one knows shit.

47
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,500
Sound effects by the way.

48
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,010
Thank you.

49
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,540
So the three of them are standing there.

50
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,050
No one knows what the fuck is going
on and they keep doing the same thing.

51
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,510
They keep interacting with each other.

52
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,363
Same thing,

53
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,520
the way the human,

54
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,200
the way the human being and the human
body interacts with the world is so

55
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:54,201
bizarre and complicated and to get it
right and correct takes so much fucking

56
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,974
thinking.

57
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,150
It's amazing.

58
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,770
We just let these things just
go loose out into the world,

59
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,580
right?

60
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,413
I mean,

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,840
which is why people are desperate and
lonely and four stores were continents and

62
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,490
machine.

63
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,560
There's a real machine going on with,

64
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:17,561
with society today and that
machine is the building of society,

65
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,890
the increasing of bandwidth,

66
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,371
you know,

67
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,640
the interconnectivity that's
provided by technology.

68
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,040
It's all of that and it's,

69
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,050
it's all of that with this exponentially
increasing momentum behind it.

70
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,470
And we're all caught up in that and
we're caught up in that and we have

71
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,870
mortgages and we have bills
and we have all these,

72
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,431
but we're,

73
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:37,651
we're,

74
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,380
we're doing is we're feeding this system,

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
we're feeding the system of televisions
and computers and cell phones and new

76
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,980
clothes and distracting.

77
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,400
It's just,

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,870
it's so distracting.

79
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,331
It's like you,

80
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:49,561
you,

81
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,420
you start unknowledgeable and the Greek,

82
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,110
so I said you go from knowledge but
you don't jump all the way to wisdom.

83
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,490
There's an in between place,

84
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:57,271
which is correct.

85
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,104
Opinion,

86
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,670
correct opinion from when you study,

87
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,200
as you're reaching for wisdom,

88
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,620
you start to develop as the world
crystallizes around you with the right

89
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,650
teaching and,

90
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,503
and stuff.

91
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,190
You start to learn what the what,

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,960
what sort of the correct way to look
at and reach and follow and the correct

93
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,681
opinion is,

94
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:19,681
and then you finally get to a point
where you understand and can explain why

95
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,370
that is the correct opinion.

96
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,810
That takes a long fucking time.

97
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,160
That's life mastery in a way,

98
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,050
but it's like what you're saying is it's,

99
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,371
it's,

100
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:27,010
it's,

101
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,270
we don't have a system and we
tried it with public education,

102
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:36,271
but we don't have a way or a system
to really teach people how to live the

103
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:37,870
artist.

104
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,231
No,

105
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,000
no one knows what the
fuck they're doing and we,

106
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,950
the people that we were raised by,

107
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,450
they didn't know what the
fuck they're doing either.

108
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:43,930
I mean,

109
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,940
my parents are very nice people.

110
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,320
My mother is a,

111
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,370
with my Stepdad,

112
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,540
they'd been together forever.

113
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,460
It's like they're very nice couple,

114
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,540
they're very nice people,

115
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,900
but they were raised by people who
didn't know shit and their parents were

116
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,830
raised by people who didn't know shit.

117
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,190
And this era that we're
living in right now.

118
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:08,110
It's like human beings are just starting
to wake up and realize that we were all

119
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,470
living in this weird
sort of momentous world.

120
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,610
His world that moves on
momentum and memento.

121
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,620
It doesn't make any sense at all and
we're all just waking up realizing that it

122
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:20,020
was set up by people didn't know
what the fuck they were doing.

123
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,531
I mean,

124
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,970
they knew how to build buildings.

125
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,680
They knew how to use electricity,

126
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,430
but no one knew how to teach society,

127
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,720
how to chill the fuck out,

128
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,160
relax and enjoy each other.

129
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,720
Not One fucking person besides like
Martin Luther King and a few people with

130
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,920
some dreamy speeches.

131
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,790
Not One person emphasizes that
in the role of government.

132
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,970
Not One person is pushing that like can't
we figure out a way that human beings

133
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,840
are just nicer to each other?

134
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,400
Can't we figure out a way where there's
maybe a little bit less profit but also

135
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,480
less pollution and less fucking
with people and less light,

136
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,180
less control over the human populous?

137
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,360
Isn't that possible?

138
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,301
I would say though,

139
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,400
you're also dealing with the residue of,

140
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,950
of a most of human history.

141
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,050
Almost all of it has
been not enough to eat.

142
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,053
Yeah.

143
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,661
Oh yeah.

144
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:09,841
No,

145
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:10,561
it's no doubt.

146
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,140
There's been a lot of things
that led us to this point.

147
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
This is also the first point.

148
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:20,481
We have a responsibility as the human
beings that have the first access to this

149
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:24,630
sort of information to not be looked at
like a bunch of silly fucks where the

150
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,500
people of the future,

151
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,410
because that's a real problem
because if I look back,

152
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,180
I mean living this life right now,

153
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:33,840
just looking at all that silly nonsense
that human beings are involved with.

154
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,831
Like everybody,

155
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:38,760
I looked on Twitter and everybody has
these fucking equal signs on their,

156
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:38,971
uh,

157
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:39,181
their,

158
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,810
their Twitter Avatar to let every nut
one know that they're into marriage with

159
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:43,640
the quality.

160
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,401
It's a quality,

161
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,360
it's marriage equality.

162
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,680
You should be,

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,633
you should be.

164
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,880
That's like saying you're having
that on your Twitter Avatar.

165
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,730
You might as well just
say water's wet is hot,

166
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,420
hot.

167
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,500
It's cold cold.

168
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:55,741
I didn't,

169
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:57,680
of course marriage equality sense.

170
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
The fact that you even have to,

171
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,440
who are you talking to?

172
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,150
I know,

173
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,570
but,

174
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,403
but seriously,

175
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,390
in 2000 and fucking 13 anybody we should
find out who doesn't have that on their

176
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,224
avatar.

177
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,890
It should be that.

178
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,040
Let's,

179
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,020
how about nobody use
their face anymore and,

180
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,391
and,

181
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:12,830
and let's,

182
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,340
let's find out and do the people
who have a problem with it.

183
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,970
It gives a shit whether or not a couple
of lesbians want to marry each other.

184
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,750
You're an asshole.

185
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,690
You're an asshole and baby,

186
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:25,250
nobody tells you you're an asshole.

187
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,230
But why do you give a fuck about them?

188
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,350
You worrying at all about what
other people are doing sucks.

189
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,850
It sucks for everyone around you.

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,530
You fuck everything up.

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,010
You care that two people love each other
and they want to sign some paperwork.

192
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,180
Why do you give a fuck?

193
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,200
What do you give a fuck of cheap signed
some paperwork that the other chicks are

194
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,780
going to be her ass eating slave till
the end of time and she'll have to be

195
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,820
reincarnated as a future ass eater.

196
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,830
And upon turning 18 resume,

197
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,640
her practice,

198
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,620
where's is this check
is going to be immortal.

199
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,830
Write down on paper what
fucking differences it made.

200
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,630
Why do you care if you care?

201
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,100
You're an asshole.

202
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,020
You're just an ass or understood it.

203
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,890
I never understood that.

204
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,060
It's fucking dumb and desire to control
of the people and you impose your

205
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:13,040
mythology or your belief system on someone
else because really uncreative fucks

206
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,000
to are not thinking about how ridiculous
you're going to look in the future when

207
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,410
they're looking back on the past,

208
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,010
the way they looked at those idiots that
thought that leaches were the best way

209
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,360
to cure your broken leg.

210
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,550
That goes fucking people.

211
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,940
We laugh at them today and don't tell
me about scientific applications of

212
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:29,331
leeches.

213
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,490
You have fucks because there's none.

214
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,010
I can just,

215
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,920
you can nudge

216
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:34,941
people like,

217
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:35,151
you know,

218
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:36,950
there are medical
applications for leaches.

219
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:39,560
Like people send me that cause
I was making fun of for gang.

220
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,030
Green Bay can use it for stuff.

221
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:41,481
But guess what?

222
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,920
Medicine works better
for almost everything.
