1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,300
I think,

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,133
um,

4
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,850
William James was one of the,

5
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,960
one of the guys who really did a
good job of that saying basically,

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,070
you know,

7
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,490
if I may be right about
this way of thinking,

8
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,750
but even if I'm not thinking this
way allows me to lead a better life.

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:22,370
And I think he was talking about free
will and he was basically saying,

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,030
look,

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,930
I don't know if we have freewill or I
don't know if everything we do is based on

12
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,600
a causal chain of events
that we really can't control.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,020
But thinking about free will in a way
that it does exist allows me to live a

14
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:36,290
better life.

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,430
And so guess what,

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,230
I am a proponent of freewill because
that allows me to live a better life that

17
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:42,381
way.

18
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:44,240
Cause I feel like I have more flexibility,

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,111
more choice.

20
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,190
I'm a happier person.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,280
And I think sometimes people
forget some of that too.

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,620
You know?

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,460
I mean there's something to be
said for thinking about things.

24
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,420
Even if you don't know,

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:53,841
you know,

26
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:54,950
think about things in a,

27
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:57,890
in a way that's going to allow
you to lead the best life.

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,910
And you know,

29
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,420
way better than if you don't know any
ways you think about something in a way

30
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,380
that fucking sucks.

31
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:03,670
Like,

32
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,820
Oh,

33
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm going to go to hell for sure.

34
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,190
Well,

35
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,670
if you're wrong in that you've lived a
life being afraid and being worried about

36
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,220
shit,

37
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,481
man,

38
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,230
you were wrong.

39
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,450
Might as well think in a positive way.

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,171
And it's still,

41
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,580
you still may turn out to be wrong,

42
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,120
but hey,

43
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,830
along the way you lived in a better way.

44
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:19,710
Yeah.

45
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,080
Sounds like someone is starting a cult.

46
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,973
That's what I just heard.

47
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,963
I heard it.

48
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,350
Yeah.

49
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,561
No,

50
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:25,370
no doubt man.

51
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,390
I mean there's a,

52
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,710
I think it's couldn't,

53
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,690
it might not be either or as well.

54
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,580
It might be another one
of those situations.

55
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,110
Yeah.

56
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,810
You know,

57
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,081
it,

58
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:33,650
uh,

59
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,483
it,

60
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,330
there's this,

61
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,710
I think there's a lot of things going on.

62
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,080
There's a lot of things
going on in this life and um,

63
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,850
I think we should acknowledge all of them.

64
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,601
You know,

65
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,000
we should acknowledge
the most importantly,

66
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:44,870
the mystery of it all.

67
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,020
That's one of the big things that drives
me crazy about someone when they say,

68
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,660
you know that this is this
and that is that in the,

69
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,051
you know,

70
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,490
the way you should live is this,

71
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,080
and the way the government
should do is that,

72
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,910
and the way we're going
to solve this is by that.

73
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,830
Like maybe not,

74
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,300
maybe not like are you,

75
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,940
are you really so sure that you're paying
attention to what the fuck is going

76
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:02,420
on?

77
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,600
We're flying through space
like we're on a spaceship.

78
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,310
Spaceship was a hundred feet wide.

79
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,110
You'd be freaking the fuck out right now.

80
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,670
The only reason why
you're not freaking out,

81
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,800
it's because it's like
thousands of miles wide,

82
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,090
but it's still a space ship.

83
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,830
You're on this spinning fucking thing.

84
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,190
And at nighttime you could see the space
you're flying through and you spinning

85
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,480
a thousand miles an hour in a circle
and your hose floating around this giant

86
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,530
nuclear explosion.

87
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,480
And that's around other bigger rocks that
are flying behind you and gas giants.

88
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:34,481
And then other galaxies and other universe
has an on and on and on and you just

89
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:38,360
hurdling through it while you're worried
about what's on TV and why the walking

90
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:41,900
dead is so many commercials
and why gas is $4.

91
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,570
And if you imagine,

92
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,500
if this was,

93
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,493
let's say,

94
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,240
put yourself in a position where this
really was a dream and you had a lucid

95
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:50,380
dream where you're aware,

96
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,900
is that what you would
want to do with your dream?

97
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,410
If you're going to sleep at night and
you were saying you would worry about all

98
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:57,490
of these inane things,

99
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,990
never actually be in the present,

100
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,460
never taken adventure,

101
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,660
never go on a risk,

102
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,520
never love because you could get hurt.

103
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,331
Now if you,

104
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:04,810
if this,

105
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,910
if you really did treat this like a dream,

106
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,520
you would do as much
cool shit as possible.

107
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,270
You know,

108
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,571
put his,

109
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:15,430
put as many good things into that dream
as he possibly could and not not be so

110
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,340
fucking stressed out
about all this nonsense.

111
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:18,671
You know,

112
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:18,831
and,

113
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,890
and I think we've been talking a lot,

114
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,600
it's kinda been the theme of this podcast,

115
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,400
but if you actually did,

116
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,900
if this was a lucid dream,

117
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,150
you know you would live
it in a different way.

118
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,220
You would live it to have
some fun and enjoy it.

119
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,090
Like what can I fly cause all my
lucid dreams I want to fly or breathe

120
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,750
underwater.

121
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,040
Breathing underwater is cool too.

122
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,443
That's a good one.

123
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,110
Yeah,

124
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,880
it would be very strange
if one day it was,

125
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,600
it was proven that we are really living
in some sort of self created reality.

126
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,470
It would be like a really traumatizing
for a lot of people that have fucked it

127
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,030
up.

128
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,461
We'd be like,

129
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,300
this is what I made.

130
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,360
But it's like remember when you were in
school and like there was a project and

131
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:55,090
you had to use your hand and make a
Turkey and you put your hand down.

132
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,160
He drew around and then you know,

133
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,860
everybody's got their own little Turkey
painted it and then the teacher would

134
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,930
put them up with new
and I'll look at them.

135
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,481
Some people's,

136
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,950
Turkey's looked like dog shit.

137
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,641
I looked,

138
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,410
I didn't know what the
fuck a Turkey looked like.

139
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,540
They didn't even know how
to draw around their hand.

140
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,860
Like everything was a disaster and other
people that beautiful darkies well your

141
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,880
life is a work of art.

142
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,420
Your life is like a hand Turkey
that you make in grade school.

143
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,210
It's,

144
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,700
you could do whatever
you want with that thing.

145
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,870
You can make it super dope.

146
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,890
You know you can,

147
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,530
you can make it so it looks really cool
if you put the effort and time into it,

148
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,700
if you really focus on it or you could
just half ass that mother fucker and

149
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,520
trial bunch of squiggly things
don't look anything like fingers.

150
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:35,320
Some eyeballs are floating above his
stupid fake Turkey head and everybody's

151
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:35,441
like,

152
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,610
what the fuck's wrong with Bob?

153
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,700
He's like on test takers got cancer.

154
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,511
I think one of the,

155
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,220
one of the coolest pieces that I've seen,

156
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,630
and I have to go to the bathroom,

157
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,464
so I don't know if you want to play,

158
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
but it's a Alan,

159
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,140
it's called Alan Watts.

160
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:47,801
Inception,

161
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,210
is the name of the video on Google,

162
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
and he talks about,

163
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,914
