1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,960
What this episode is. Ladies
and gentlemen, if you, if
you tune into this podcast,

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,660
he go, oh, I'm going to elicit
to an intellectual discussion.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,640
This is going to be fascinating.
No,

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,760
this is four guys sitting around
watching the UFC and we might get drunk.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,720
Okay. Brendan Schaub is
here. Brian Cowan is here.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,940
Aubrey Marcus is here and I'm here.
And what we did,

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,190
we decided to do is while the fights are
going on, we're in my podcast studio.

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:33,600
We figured, fuck it man. Let's watch the
fights with friends. Have a good time.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,780
Have a cookbook.
Gag Dale's a couple of adult beverages.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,470
I brought some 2003 Bordeaux.
Did you really? Where is it?

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,460
I'll put it into my class. I don't want a
real glass. Well, you'll learn. Oh, you,

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,150
they call me the aristocratic
for a reason. Anyway,

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,120
so if you look in for a regular
podcast with skip, oh look,

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,830
I've got a million of them,
but this ain't one of them.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,310
This may not ever happen again,
but it's happening right now. Uh,

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,010
shop and Cowan and I talked
about doing this for awhile.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,750
Aubrey just happens to be in town right
now. So, uh, we're doing it right now.

18
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,230
We're watching the,
uh, the prelims and uh,

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,300
no sponsors well were sponsored by on it.

20
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:16,800
Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t and
get your freak on. Use the Codeword Rogan

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,550
still waiting for you to fucking
email me your address. I clowned.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,150
Email it to me. You fucking clown. I mean,

23
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm not telling you did I told you?

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,480
Email it to me so I can email to
RB. Oh yeah, I'll get right on the

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,410
[inaudible]. [inaudible] it's so hard to
email people and it's almost impossible.

26
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:46,100
One piece of writing for my best
little yellow pad that just want to do

27
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,090
kettlebell workout. Right?
He doesn't care about mine.

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,760
Piece of paper.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,670
You should have seen Brian trying to
pull back a 90 pound bow the other day.

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,523
He told me

31
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,380
things have ever seen. He tells me it's
all in tech. It's all in the technique.

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,380
Oh yeah. I saw that technique of
lifting weights for many years,

33
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,660
so shut up.

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,060
I wasn't warmed up. It was
so sad. My back. Anyway,

35
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,360
he needs kettlebells. Aubrey,
he needs a lot of things,

36
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:13,760
but kettlebells are also on the man.
I don't know if he wants one.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah,
I want the Chevy doesn't want no man.

38
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,970
Maybe if he has it earlier today,

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,290
the, the, the main fights cost of was
good fight versus Lauren's locker.

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:28,350
That's the combien. Uh, Eric Koch is
a, is fighting on this car as well.

41
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:33,120
Let me pull it up on ufc.com which
a ufc.com is a very good website,

42
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,510
but the UFC app,
boy does that suck a fat one.

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,960
That is a fucking terrible app.
Whoever made that APP,

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,350
how dare you call positive a very,

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,060
that's a very good fight.
Eric Koch versus Dan Crookshanks.

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,170
Very good fight and Cruickshank,
who's, who's his last opponent,

47
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,550
he's so fun to watch. Oh yeah,
no shit man. Darren is a,

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,510
he's a taekwondo taekwondo
guy. Originally. He's got
wild ass fucking kicks,

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,110
but he's also like putting
together the rest of his game.

50
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,810
Now you might have the best
nickname in sports. What is it?

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,540
Detroit superstar was a little long.
No,

52
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,240
it's dope.
They should be shorter.

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,210
Creepy takes it from me. That's
pretty good. A little creepy.

54
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,980
That Detroit superstar. It's not a buy
my name be. If I was a fighter, Brian,

55
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:28,500
the irritable, irritable, he wouldn't,

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,220
when he doesn't eat, he gets
grumpy. Callen you really
wouldn't have a nickname.

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,470
No. No. What do you mean
I have, I need a nickname.

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,130
You'd be the kid need Brian.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,660
Brendan Schaub gala.
Mike Rio was the,

60
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,450
the last fight. God Damn, that was a
good fight. She's the Mike Rio Fight. Uh,

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Darrin Cruickshank was
on fire. Kicks, right.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,860
He's laying a lot of kids
whose land and everything.

63
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,270
He just looked sensational and
coke's a bad mother fucker. Dude.

64
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,430
You know coke is a,
he's a very talented kid.

65
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,950
I mean he lost to a poor.
Yay.

66
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,600
But then he came back and beat Hafi
Elo. Oliveira he lost too, right?

67
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:12,190
He lasted a poor. Yay. And
then he lost. Lost Him. Ricardo
Lamas back to back. Yeah,

68
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,580
but too tough fucking guys.
Two really tough guys.

69
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,820
Why did you pour this in the glass? You
made sure you poured it in glass. Well,

70
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:23,290
it tastes better in a glass
coffee mug. The, the, the
blue. Shut up. Shut your mouth,

71
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,350
bring it to your nose. Shut your fucking
mouth. Take it into your mouth. Hey,

72
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,770
next year, see Eddie, Eddie
Wineland lost today. I know.

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,770
Got knocked up by this kid who was
caught in two years. First round.

74
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,560
I believe it was the second round.
I think he's the end of the first.

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,410
Could am I crazy? It might've been. I
was watching it while I was working out.

76
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,620
So you might be, who is the guy lost
to? Uh, I'll tell you right now.

77
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,680
I have a computer, but a Wineland.
I mean, coming off of a title fight,

78
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,380
right. You know, uh, it
comes off of that fight.

79
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:55,150
Then look sensational in his next
fight. He fights. I'm just get caught.

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,320
He fought eve job, Wayne and stopped him
and looked fucking sensational. Not well.

81
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,200
He fights in a weird way.
He Wineland keeps his,

82
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:06,850
never lifts his hands above his nipples.
Aggressive too. Super aggressive,

83
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,060
super strong. And he's a really good
fighter. He moves his head a lot.

84
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,280
He's got a lot of faints
and he gets away with it.

85
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,370
And the punches come from all kinds of
crazy angles because his hands are low,

86
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:18,460
but that's never a good style.
It's just never a good stock.

87
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,700
Keep your fucking hands low is never good.
And this kid correct him.

88
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:26,470
Johnny Eduardo cracked him with the
right hand and the first round. Um, yeah,

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,360
you were right. Round one, four minutes,

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,510
37 seconds in Brown one caught him with
a right hand earlier in the round and

91
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,530
then stunned him with one for about four
minutes 20 in and then followed up with

92
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,170
another one and dropped him in his legs.
Just completely gave out.

93
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:44,740
He's always that guy who is one away
from the title just in that weight class.

94
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,570
He's always,
he's always right there,

95
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,640
especially when he's there coming off
that eve job wave five where he looked

96
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,960
close fucking sensation and Jill boys
up, bad motherfucker dude, that was,

97
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,130
that was a really good fight. And
Eddie what? What rank number four?

98
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,430
I think so it's close number four
when exactly. He's number four.

99
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,090
He takes his fight against an unheralded
guy who hasn't fought in over two

100
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,840
years. This kid hadn't fought in.
I think it was something crazy,

101
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,410
like 700 days.
God said,

102
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,790
God a man top.

103
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,700
That's where it doesn't
pay to take fights.

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,340
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Well,

105
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,100
a lot of guys sit down and people give
him a hard time and they said, Ooh,

106
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,060
fighters fight.
But

107
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,240
man, it's a business. You should have
a manager. Listen, UFC Austin a fight.

108
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:33,320
I take it. But at the same time too,
you want to fight the highest rank guy,

109
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,750
the most famous guy possible.
That's all anyone cares about me.

110
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:39,530
And the highest rate guy
who'd ever turned down.

111
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,950
Have you ever turned
down and why? Um, man,

112
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:47,300
the only fight I ever turned down, it
was once, I don't remember his name.

113
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,250
He a huge guy. A grappler. Abu
Dhabi fight, peewee Herman.

114
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:56,270
Last few Herman fight of the
night. You know, I'm talking about,

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,030
but he retired enormous dude.

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,080
MMM. God dammit. Okay, let's Dave Herman

117
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,620
pull it up.
The Rock.

118
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,670
He really sweats a lot. Is that the guy?
Okay, I sweats. Last guy who sweats a lot,

119
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,750
man, I forget his name. God
super muscular. And My, my,

120
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,340
my manager called me and uh, with the
fight and I was like, uh, oh, John, olive,

121
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,380
Imo, Imo, Imo. So they
called me the fight and uh,

122
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:29,200
I just got off fight Nogueira so I'm
not going to go no gear. I know, right?

123
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:33,290
I was just like, no man, not happening.
And uh, my manager's like, well,

124
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,410
let's see what they come with. I said,
all right, well if it's a do or die,

125
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,720
I'll take it. Let's do
it. I'll destroy this guy.

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,750
And then they came up with a different
opponent, came up with Rothwell,

127
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,540
but that's the only fight where I
was like, ah, I don't think so man.

128
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,630
Right. Yeah. The only time, yeah. It's
a tricky thing, right? Like when you,

129
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:52,910
you want to take a fight if you're,
you know, if you need a fight,

130
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,950
if you need the money,
you want to take a fine.

131
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,580
But if you're in a situation where they
offer you something dangerous on two

132
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,990
weeks notice,
yes.

133
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,530
Like sometimes cards fall apart and
they try to pull that car together.

134
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,950
Like they're making a bunch of calls
this week to try to get someone to fight

135
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,610
Vitorin Brazil because junior
dos Santos just broke his hand.

136
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,410
Junior dos Santos was supposed to fight
Steve Bay chick, he broke his hand. Um,

137
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
they had meo chick is now gone.

138
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,280
Fabulous Maldonado who is at two oh
five or who's fan at two oh five true.

139
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,701
You know,

140
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,730
and now he's stepping up to
fight heavyweight and Steve
Bay Myoshia cause a top

141
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,490
10 guy.
So it's a,

142
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,090
it's kind of a crazy matchup that probably
wouldn't be approved in the state.

143
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,060
I agree. And I also heard that you can
get your money back. Oh wait. Why would,

144
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,650
why wouldn't that fight the, are you
sure? I heard the states like what?

145
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,880
There's actual five or fighting a top
10 heavyweight as a commissioner that

146
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,780
says that's just too much of a mismatch.

147
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,250
Well not even a two oh five or two or
five or that's been zombied you know,

148
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,660
I mean, he's been beaten senseless by
a bunch of guys. He's a tough mother.

149
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,100
Fucks as tough as they come.
Fabio Maldonado

150
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,280
is so tough that you got to watch out
for him if he fights a big guy because

151
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:03,210
he's got to go, God, this guy takes so
much punishment. He's so fucking tough.

152
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,000
You've got to almost protect
them from the other end though.

153
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:11,001
I can see cause Steve Bay has in the past
don't you rung because he is a beast.

154
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,840
Used to be a trading part in mine. Super
Freak to athlete to monster. However,

155
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,110
when he fought strew if he kind of gassed
out and got knocked out, correct. Yeah.

156
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,030
Now in this fight, you know what I
mean? The cardio, it could be an issue.

157
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,590
And uh, Fairview auto boxing
is really, really good. Yes.

158
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,370
He's got the most rabid fans in
the world driving him. That's true.

159
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,530
We watched him in Brazil and
they'd go crazy for five year.

160
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,460
Well Maldonado was just as tough as
the heroes. Toughest. Fuck man. He's,

161
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,750
and he's probably one of the
best body punches in this sport.

162
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,190
My concern would just be the size, just
the sheer size difference. What is Tbi?

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,960
Walk around at two 30. So who this
right now, who's fighting right now,

164
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:55,470
and Jane will give us some volume so we
can at least hear it. Hearing it is fine.

165
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,350
Chris Kerry Yasso and who is he fighting?
They'll give us some volume.

166
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,340
Bruce buffer with the official
introduction. Yeah, and

167
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,620
that's the coolest.

168
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,600
The coolest fucking thing is watching
Bruce buffer introduced fighters in Brazil

169
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,000
because everybody together goes,

170
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,330
it's really 2000 people
will be doing it in sync.

171
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,980
No Way. Oh, it's amazing. It's one of the
coolest things ever is actually great.

172
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:26,780
He's got that great voice. Ooh. Bruce
buffers the bat. He really is the best,

173
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,260
the best Bruce buffer.
I've seen him at Gold's gym.

174
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,570
I work out there in the off season.

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,110
I saw him in Gold's gym on the
cable machine doing the Bruce.

176
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,040
What was it? The one 80 turn though?
No, it works it out. You worked it out

177
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,980
and so explosive. I didn't see him
and I'm walking through the gym.

178
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:49,250
I hear [inaudible].

179
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,950
I was so embarrassed. Oh, that's funny.

180
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,740
He's good though. He doesn't
take, he doesn't have a a
card with them or anything.

181
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:02,250
He just remembers it all. That's not true
at all. He has a card constantly. Shit,

182
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,060
what are you talking about?
He reads off the cards.

183
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:08,140
He throws the cards in the ground
when he's done. Good Jack Ass.

184
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,830
Get your facts right. I was talking
about the rock again. Shit. By the way,

185
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,270
all you can't. They get mad
at me for giving Brian a
hard time. Do you know what?

186
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,030
I'd love this motherfucker like a brother
and I would give them a hard time if

187
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:23,390
it was a podcast or no pot.
That's how friends hang with.

188
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,830
He took a sensitive for me.
Thank you everybody. Thank
you. A marathon by the way.

189
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,580
He'll do that to me too. Okay.
That's what friends are all about.

190
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,150
It's not in the podcast. Joe Rogan, I
just don't have as many weaknesses as him,

191
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,900
so it's more difficult to find holes.
That's openings,

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,380
but if he finds holes in my game,
he will chip at them.

193
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,950
One of the things that friends are for,
I liked the USA keep each other honest.

194
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:48,530
We've got a good friend keeps sending
to jump on board. What's that?

195
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,190
USA judo jumping on board.
Just restaurants or shun?

196
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,180
Well USA recipe for what? Yeah, it is.

197
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,540
You'll see wrestles beings and I feel
like when you kick to the body with your,

198
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,900
with the top guys are fighting.
No, it did say that last thing.

199
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,020
I want to fight with them. When you kicked
your butt, when you kick to the body,

200
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:07,841
when the top of your foot,

201
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,420
I always feel like that's so risky because
you could break the top of your foot.

202
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,360
So we shut the fuck man.
We're talking taekwondo.

203
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,160
Not well. You know I broke the top of
my foot many times on elbows. Yeah,

204
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,280
that's what you gotta be. You
gotta be scared. But look,

205
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,870
obviously you could break
your fucking shins, your mind,

206
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,050
everything lightening fast. Cause
I go, I go up and then I can't,

207
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,170
you see Tyrone Spong brings lay against
fucking bill con Saki. Holy Shit. No,

208
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,950
I didn't see. It's weird
seeing a high level kickboxer
do that. It's a super rare.

209
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,820
I agree. But to me it's surprising that
not more guys break their legs. It is,

210
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,780
well, it's weird. There's like this rash
of broken legs. You know, Anderson Silva,

211
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:47,860
Tyrone Spong civil last week looking
pretty good, moving pretty good.

212
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,630
Well, Tyrone Spong is only four weeks
out. I think he's already walking.

213
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,190
He's walking on a treadmill. No CAS, no
nothing. They've got a bolt in there.

214
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,000
When you, what, what they do now back
in the day when you break your Femur,

215
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,130
I'll break your bone in half like that.
They would keep you off it.

216
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,040
What they do now is within 12 hours,
24 hours,

217
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,380
they tried to get you walking on it
immediately. And the reason for that,

218
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:11,650
they'll set it and have you actually start
putting pressure on it because to the

219
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:11,930
Bot,

220
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,820
what they found is it you heal faster
because your body rushes calcium to that

221
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,960
part of the bone and that
weird, that is weird. Within
12 hours, 12 hours, 12 hours.

222
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:23,120
Like if you were walking on a broken leg
and 12 obviously you don't put, yeah,

223
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,850
you don't put a lot of,
you don't put a lot of pressure,

224
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,650
but when they break their femur skiers,

225
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,760
they got those guys in their feet as
soon as possible because apparently you

226
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,790
know the, you, you heal
much faster. Wow. Yeah.

227
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,390
So Carrie also is a,
he's a wild mother fucker man.

228
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,710
I love watching their kid fight too. And
now that he's dead, this is one 25 right?

229
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,740
These guys are fighting at one 25 or are
they not a fly wakes 25 cause he fought

230
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:49,690
at one 35 for the longest time
and he was kind of undersized.

231
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,610
I'm glad they have
that. They're, you know,

232
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:55,300
they're thinking about doing a straw
weight. A one 15 for guys and for women's.

233
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:59,410
Obviously they are. But for
guys there Straw weight, man,

234
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,860
that is a small dude.
That's right.

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,410
That would be such a nightmare to fight
that guy because he'd probably still win

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,310
and he's so respectful. I box with that
Guy Wayne McCullough. He light you up.

237
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,480
I know him. You kidding me?
Worst thing ever. It just
takes so much longer. One 19.

238
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,450
Oh, what's like Ken and Floy and
you see Kenny flew into a bar,

239
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,420
probably going to pick on it. Yeah,
I'll let it says dresses like a hipster,

240
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,100
although he's hitting the
baddest dudes on the planet.

241
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:24,190
But both my head and your head would fit
in Kenny's head. He's got a giant head,

242
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,570
big head, huge head. When I
first saw him in person, I went,

243
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:29,480
that can't be Kenny Florida.

244
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:32,550
And that's the biggest head I've
ever seen on that gentleman. And uh,

245
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,170
I wonder if there's a real
direct correlation between
taking a punch and having

246
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:42,340
a big head. I always joke around about
it and talk about it in podcasts. Well,

247
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,450
boxing boxing trainers thing, Emmanuel
Steward said that they look for when,

248
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,720
when trainers looking for boxers, they
look for a wide face and a short neck.

249
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,220
We'll look at David [inaudible] who
took a punch better than that Guy

250
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,720
[inaudible] Nelson mark
on Roy Nelson. Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:00,980
And then there's some guys that just
like Tommy Hearns always had a hard time

252
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,080
taking a punch.
Just has that narrow face.

253
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,570
And there's nothing you can do about that.
Just it is what it is.

254
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,510
You want to talk about a guy spinning?
So I'm fucking wars. Tommy Hearns.

255
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,350
I was watching some Tommy Hearns fight.
The other guy on Youtube,

256
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,170
a couple when he knocked out Duran Dude,

257
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:22,460
he knocked around and he was and he
was and he fought at 47 which I can't

258
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:26,270
believe. Yeah, well he fought
as high as a light heavyweight.

259
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,000
I believe he went all the loss to Iran.
Barkley.

260
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,490
I think that was at one 68 I'm not sure.

261
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,440
You know what's interesting about this
fight is a, usually you have to have,

262
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,400
so for instance, homeboy on the
cages, red shorts, car Yasso. Yes.

263
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,140
And the other guy is black and red shorts.

264
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,400
Both similar shorts usually have
to be complete opposite shorts.

265
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,090
They force you to do that. Yeah. It's
just the bottom of the trim though.

266
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:54,980
It's pretty obvious, isn't it? You think?
I think it go cut. This guy, the guy,

267
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,640
um, what's Carrie asked? Mocha
Curiosa. No, he's a morning Thai guy.

268
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,120
Caught on using that term is
try to dope dope response.

269
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,940
First of all your word.
Don't let Rhonda tell him some moves.

270
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,990
She my favorite word though. How are
we go? She is, Oh shit. Oh it's tight.

271
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,980
Oh nope. Lost the position.
But I'll let go of that.

272
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,590
Getting a lot of guys who've been
catching that von flue choke. Yeah man.

273
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,380
Cause they hang on the routine.
Look at this. He gets forward again.

274
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,340
It does not under the Chin though. He's
just a that crank and I'm, yeah. Nice.

275
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,730
Oh Nice fish.
Then the round scrappy,

276
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,330
crappy end of the round lolly
guys hang onto that key.

277
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,190
A teen and then all the guys
doing is taking them down.

278
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:38,120
Pass the side control and you can't get
your glove out. You know what I'm saying?

279
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,430
Can't you? Your glove out. So
then you have a choke there.

280
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:43,230
You just ramming your shoulder
into the artery and the, yeah,

281
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,350
they can't get it out. It's called
the von flue choke. That's what, uh,

282
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,240
everybody calls it because someone just
had a big finish with that recently.

283
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:54,740
Now OSP crew. Yeah. Opens
saying against Al Capone,

284
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,670
a guy who was fighting and heavyweight
most of his career, really undersized.

285
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,700
A smallest heavyweights ever.
Yeah.

286
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,250
He's fighting a Cody Donovan in Dublin.

287
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,860
Now I OSP is a no,

288
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,460
a alcopop two oh five hmm.

289
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,680
Interesting that that von flue choke.

290
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,210
You very rarely see in Jujitsu though.
That's what's interesting about that.

291
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,780
Jitsu guys don't a good GC guys not gonna
hang onto that. Yeah, he's just not,

292
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,700
it's true.
They're not going to waste the energy.

293
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,180
High level juice guys don't go
waste his energy on it's up.

294
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,240
The guy was kind of panicking in a fight
and a fight gets taken down and doesn't

295
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,260
want the guy to posture,

296
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,620
so he holds onto the gay thing and
then when your gloves caught in there,

297
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:38,400
you're screwed. Man. It's a
lot of pressure. I mean, I'm
sure you felt it. You know,

298
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,050
with a glove on. It's a different story
when you're stuck. It's like, Dang. Yeah.

299
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:44,360
When a guy really knows how
to put that weight on it too,

300
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,880
he's got a good side control
and knows how to pin you down.

301
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,980
Put forced that shoulder and your neck
or yeah, you'd to sleep. Some guys

302
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,100
can fuck you up. Just head arm control
when they're passing your card,

303
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,700
like there's different kinds of pressure.
It's like his wrestler pressure.

304
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,680
There's some guys straight on top of you.
They just,

305
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,940
they know how to put all their weight
on a very small point like this.

306
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,440
Some guys who get side control on you,

307
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:08,520
but they're like laying on their knees
and even if they're cy controls solid.

308
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,640
If you can't get out of it, you're
not hurting, you're not in pain.

309
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,420
And then there's other motherfuckers that
we'll have all of their weight unlike

310
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:19,200
the left side of their chest and they'll
like put side control on you. Just

311
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,910
where do you like a collage of science?
Yeah, it really is. It's a balance.

312
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,140
I'm still working on it.

313
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,540
It's hard, man. It's hard.

314
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,550
It's interesting because I have like
a nasty twister side control on,

315
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,980
on the right side,
but then when I do it on the left side,

316
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:37,160
it feels alien because I never go to it
on the left side of some positions like

317
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:37,791
that. It's, we're,

318
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,480
we would think that this is a position I
know in my head inside and now it's not

319
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:45,230
that complex a position, but on the
right side, Bam. It's like, I'll fuck,

320
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,490
it's like a clamp bank. It's
like locked in place. But on the,

321
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,350
on the other side I'm like
moving too much and I'm slippery.

322
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:53,801
It was,

323
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,220
people could see Joe because he's actually
moving around in his chair wiggle.

324
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,050
I'm a wiggler. He's a wiggle in this
corner. No wiggle. I'm a wiggler Brian,

325
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:07,610
Kaitlyn and Brian Callen number. We, are
you ever going to go back to Jujitsu? Um,

326
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,080
I think I'd like to talk about on the
ride down and I miss it a lot and then he

327
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:14,020
goes, well everyone has nick problems
who does Jujitsu. That is true.

328
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,780
A lot of people do.
You're a big guy. Yeah,

329
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,430
it's the real problem is rolling with
big guys. Don't roll big guys stacked.

330
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,310
Getting stacked is a big
problem and exploding,

331
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,900
trying to explode from the bottom.

332
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:28,990
A lot of times guys get injured doing
that bridge. Going to be smart. Brian,

333
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:33,930
you're not trying to win Abu Dhabi.
Just grapple with girls. Only when,

334
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,370
when?
When Brian and I first met each other,

335
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:39,970
I brought him to Carlson Gracie's and he
started working out with Sergio Cohen.

336
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,970
It was one of Carlson Gracie's black
belts and he like grabbed Sergio's neck.

337
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,720
Well because I was grabbed his neck,

338
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,860
like Claude is never going into a Sergio
headbutted him and his nose and broke

339
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:54,730
his nose and just smushed him
like a bug because I was actually,

340
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,820
I went in there like thinking as a
wrestler I was going to take these,

341
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,530
I was taking like people
down because they've,

342
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,070
they don't care about that may limit. Let
me clarify, this is not what happened.

343
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,850
He,

344
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,470
he just got aggressive and Douchey with
a guy who was a big juiced up crossing

345
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:09,520
gate.
That guy,

346
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,440
I mean he's a big guy to
play to watch that. Yeah.

347
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:17,220
I didn't have any respect cause I
thought out this is the wrestling bad

348
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,910
wrestling. I didn't know where that
meat head, who's going all hard.

349
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,560
I was just taking, I would like they'd
white belts and they're like blue belts.

350
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,530
Who'd never done any rustling,

351
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:31,060
so I'd be taking them down and then I
go third year. Who Decides to go, let's,

352
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,100
let's do some you want to take,
you want to go take downs?

353
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,050
And he grabs me and I was like,
oh well that's a bear.

354
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,900
And it was so much bigger than
him. Okay, now we're back.

355
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,820
We're back to Fox sports one. Everybody,
the fights were on Fox sports too.

356
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,270
And then what happened? The the base guy
handles over. So we'll get back to you.

357
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,600
We'll get back to my fighting. That
bullshit baseball game. What was it? Nine.

358
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,990
Nothing forces us to baseball.
If they invented baseball today,

359
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,600
people would spit in your face
and we tried to sell it. I agree.

360
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,200
If you try to pitch and given one bill,
why I got a gain,

361
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:04,090
it'd be could take forever.
It's like fucking like cricket.

362
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,390
Imagine trying to pitch cricket.
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

363
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,830
Why is he throwing the ball like that?
What is he doing? Why does he have a pet?

364
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:14,650
Your arm is your arm on? He has a
paddle wheel. The guy has a paddle.

365
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,450
And why is this game lasting three days?

366
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,120
You can read the fucking guy is
nick it and make it go backwards.

367
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,750
And where is the game? Last
three days. No satisfaction.

368
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,630
Even if you whacked the ball
hard. And guess what? In baseball,

369
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,560
if you hit the ball three out of 10
times, you're in the hall of fame. Yup.

370
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,160
Three out of 10 guess what? In the
UFC, when three out of 10 flights,

371
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,190
you don't know,

372
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,770
three out of 10 10 cracks
him with a nice left car.

373
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,160
Yasso throws a very deceptive head
kick to he. He hides his head kicks.

374
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,740
Well he'll sneak him over the outside
of the shoulders like the right outside,

375
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:52,080
right over the Jag. It's
fucking Deontay wilder. Yes.

376
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,890
Beat the fuck Internet troll classic.
The guy he fought, first of all,

377
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:01,090
that guy who the troll is insane. Like
clinically, something's wrong with him.

378
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,680
Like he's like bipolar or something.

379
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:05,290
I want him to knock the
troll out like really bad.

380
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,220
The troll had me laughing because it
took a shot during the gym and he takes a

381
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,260
shot and hit some of the
body and then they're like,

382
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,940
break it up and then the troll just
goes, got you to the body, bro. Hit you,

383
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,360
hit you the body man body,

384
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,590
and they went back at it and while
they're crushed him, smashed him,

385
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,480
got him on the ground, dropped
him, hit him when he was down.

386
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:26,790
He still like hit you in the body. I
hate that. Made me laugh because I know

387
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,960
he's going to sleep. He's got a
power game going to sleep. Oh,

388
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:34,090
he's trying to get out of it.
That's a good way to get out of it.

389
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:38,080
Guys do get out of it that way.
Just drop into their back. Wow.

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,940
He got right there. That right
there. That's how you hurt
your neck. That is how I,

391
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,810
my fucking neck has gotten hurt so many
times because I didn't tap and I'm like,

392
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:50,720
boom, fucking no Turpin I'm
no to happen. Meanwhile,

393
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,150
your neck is ruined for weeks if you
just have that ego. I don't have that.

394
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,970
If I'm going with another UFC heavyweight,
if we're trained together,

395
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,590
I'm not tapping and then not had
enough that he got no. However,

396
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,800
if I'm at the Gracie Academy
up, man, I don't care. Do not.

397
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,060
The idea is that you shouldn't have been
in that position in the first place.

398
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,590
You know how to learn from it.
You're going to learn from it and UFC.

399
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,291
If you're a heavy weight,

400
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:19,291
you have to be under to 60 right to 65
to 65 somebody was saying that there is a

401
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:23,090
purpose, there is a, there is a number,
there's a perfect way for a heavyweight,

402
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,240
two 42 42 in other words,

403
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:28,400
that's where the best guys
seem to lie at [inaudible].

404
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,620
Even if you would let made the weight
class 300 and you got a 300 pound guy,

405
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,530
well the differences in boxing,
in boxing,

406
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,260
it's a little lighter because
you don't get it got away on you.

407
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,260
Like you have to deal with the fact that
you're moving bodyweight around. Right?

408
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,620
Like there's a different way like
in boxing look at, in my opinion,

409
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,310
Mike in his prime,

410
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,420
the Mike Tyson of the early, the
like the 85 Mike Tyson, that range.

411
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,510
I think he's the greatest heavyweight
of all time. That's my opinion.

412
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,540
Just a lot of the people that have
opinions, but I think the Mike Tyson,

413
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,040
the destroyed Marvis Frazier,

414
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:03,041
the Mike Tyson that knocked out Larry
Holmes to 20 to 20 maybe two eight just

415
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,650
Hauer mother fucking guys
just motherfucking them. Yeah,

416
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,940
but I don't think you could get
away with that as a UFC fighter.

417
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:14,390
I don't think in boxing, by the way,
doesn't even have a fucking wait Mendez.

418
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:15,140
He would have been what?

419
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,160
Two S two too small to handle a big guy
on top of them that they'll guy like

420
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,080
Cain takes you down,
lays on you and starts.

421
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,620
You got a guy like big foot
who's capturing 300 men.

422
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,810
You're talking about a different game.
It's always funny to me and granted,

423
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:29,420
listen, cutting weight.
I'm sure it's horrendous.

424
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:33,110
I've cut from two 50 to 25 for
Metamorris and it was tough,

425
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,960
but not like these guys. You know, Bacon,

426
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,500
one 55 one 45 but we'll be at the
wanes and nothing drives me more crazy.

427
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,530
Everyone goes, God wish I was a
heavyweight. Everyone tells that English.

428
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,580
How's everybody?
Oh do you?

429
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,110
Oh really? That's cool. You're fighting
a guy at one 55 right? That's cool.

430
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,080
Because I weighed two 38
the guy I'm fighting to 65

431
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,820
I'm scared shitless. 25 pounds
a lot of ways. A lot of weight.

432
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,490
25 25 almost 25 men.

433
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,020
25 with 16 ounce John
Stacked on top each other.

434
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,670
And then that drops on your head.

435
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,910
Just that is that two weight
classes pretty much. And there's,

436
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,450
there's no other division like that
and said there's nothing like that.

437
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,270
This guy keeps giving his neck to carry
off. So carry also on the bottom here.

438
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,170
You're right.
You know the,

439
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:27,470
the shorts are confusing cause I just
thought [inaudible] was on the bottom.

440
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,170
I've never seen it this close.
Usually Yossi doesn't play that game.

441
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,820
You know, you're fighting a
superstar if they're like, yeah,

442
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,560
he got some black shorts. Oh, okay. Make
you cool. Change the color of your shirt,

443
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,430
you're wearing white. He's obviously
when the Croatian flag black. Cool man.

444
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,160
Nobody ever had to worry about that.
With rich Franklin,

445
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,060
he's got the pink shorts and you can
have your Brown oh carrier Aso's mounted.

446
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,350
Oh Shit.
Smokers on top of him.

447
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,760
Did you guys see the Zak Cummings
fight earlier tonight? No.

448
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,740
Fucking incredible fighter and credible.
What a fight. It was awesome. Yeah.

449
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,170
And Cummings was the underdog
and he wound up winning.

450
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,970
I don't think mount is
a dangerous positions.

451
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,700
Everyone thinks as it's notoriously known
for. What do you think of that, Joe? Um,

452
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:15,160
I think in MMA the,

453
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:18,800
the problem with the mount is
when you go to rain down punches,

454
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:20,900
you give up space.
And when you give up space,

455
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:22,830
guys put their hands on your
hips and they pop softly.

456
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,980
Like people think when you get to
mount, like, oh no, it's over now.

457
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,870
Especially if a guy knows what he's doing,
depending on the mound posture. But,

458
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,450
but if you're, if you have your
hooks in, you control them,

459
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:33,830
you're not going to go to punches hard.
Well,

460
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:37,790
some guys have a nasty Malik Benevidez
has a wicked mount because he does,

461
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,260
he does a guard from the mount. I
love that position. And when, uh,

462
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,360
when you Mount Guy and you cross
your feet underneath his body,

463
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,250
you can constrict him the same way you
can with a guard and Benevidez if he gets

464
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:55,250
a, uh, an arm anywhere near your chin,
his gay teen game is so strong as,

465
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:58,110
as your,
I favors as his cello Mendez.

466
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,290
All the teen guys are
ridiculous when they get unit.

467
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,440
I'm just saying as far as taking punishing
them, if you have a decent amount,

468
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,360
dark defense guys are evenly matched.

469
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,640
Scramble. This is a great
Jujitsu match actually. Yeah.

470
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,000
There used to be a time where mouth
or like back mount was game over.

471
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,700
People got used to that.
It's like for like five years.

472
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:22,710
Is that all you've got his back.
It's a similar thing.

473
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:26,040
Like so gets a mountain even
in even a camp right now.

474
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,440
So I want to get to mountain
was like, oh no. And I was like,

475
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,120
well do you remember when big of a deal
rem co Pardot fought Marco who was Marco

476
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:34,710
who has mounted him and he tapped

477
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,020
sheer terror. You've got
the mountain. He's like,

478
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,820
he says over the position is no Gui.

479
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,960
You know what one guy where if he got
mount it was actually over and you should

480
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,480
tap shank Carlin. Oh
yeah, that's a good point.

481
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:52,630
And it's like having a building on it
didn't matter how good your Jujitsu,

482
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,770
we haven't a building on you,
but Brock Lesnar survived it.

483
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,730
Otherwise Way Shankar strong.

484
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:03,810
Scott Bardelli any postured up Dan
Carlin's strongest guy you've ever,

485
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,530
ever rolled with? Yes. I mean he's like,

486
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,370
he's like an alien from a muscle planet.
You don't want to say it's like,

487
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,590
Oh did you come from muscle planet?

488
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:20,130
That fucking guy was so big and his arms
were so long to get my car and cry man.

489
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,410
After practice you'd think
you'd be getting better.

490
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,850
Cause he takes like a week off cause
he just didn't give a shit. Yeah.

491
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,880
And then I'd beat,
you know,

492
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,550
in the gym and electric in the gym seven
days a week he'd come in and just what

493
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:33,010
my ass now when he got injured,
you know, like what, how,

494
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,060
how much did his injuries progress
and how did they progress?

495
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:38,910
Cause I know he had a lot of
back injuries, back injuries,

496
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:42,330
then they had a horrible neck and it
was like, like when he fought Frank Mir,

497
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,900
he might've hit myths three times.
He just couldn't do it. Wow.

498
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,650
We just got fucked up when, when
Shane, Colin flat, Gabriel Gonzaga,

499
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,530
that was like his very first big test
and he knocked them out with like, uh,

500
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,453
like this.

501
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,850
He just went boom and knock Gabriel's
and after you got tagged and he got his

502
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:59,130
nose broken. Exactly. But, uh,

503
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:03,420
when Shane was getting me for that fight
and I've seen a ton of fighters, man,

504
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,220
my time a ton,
the best in the world,

505
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,980
that was the best heavyweight
and I've ever seen in my life.

506
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,410
She was about two 55 sure.
Ratted.

507
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,170
It looked like you shaved a silverback
gorilla and put boxing gloves on them.

508
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,490
And I had to be his main training.
I like,

509
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,460
I had to give myself a pep talk in
the car. I was talking myself up like,

510
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:28,070
you can do this bro, just get,
just get through it. Yeah. But I,

511
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,440
I've never, his speed, his
quickness, his cardio was good.

512
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,180
He hit so hard and they'd be like,
Hey, we got other guys for Shane today.

513
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:38,070
I'm like, thank God cause I don't
have to go one round with them.

514
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,560
These other guys would go in.
I'd just sit back and like,

515
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,600
you would knock everybody out, man. In
training, in training now. Did at grudge,

516
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,720
was there too much of that
going on at grudge? Uh,

517
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,390
I would say yes.

518
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,250
Big Smile before you answer, I
would say. But you know what,

519
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,010
that was the thing that like back
then I think every gym was like that.

520
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,490
Cause I go to for you knew better before
you go down to Jackson's and all we

521
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,190
would do is punch each other in the face.
It's all we did.

522
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,270
It's a weird thing because a lot, you
know who criticizes a lot of that is um,

523
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,450
Ernesto hoost or nuts. So who's who's
talking about gyms that do that?

524
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:16,530
And he was like, it's ridiculous.
It's horrible because it's very,

525
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,560
doesn't make you better. It's
not necessary. It doesn't
make you what's doing it.

526
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,610
It's taken yet it's taken out
potential fight of the nights.

527
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:28,990
You could have getting paid a lot of
money for it. Like a on Friday. Um,

528
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,420
it's spined at rain and
there's a bunch of new guys.

529
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:34,630
They're tough high level guys.
And if they don't have headgear on,

530
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,510
I won't smarm really
nothing cause my head.

531
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:41,300
But if we both can you cut my list, man,
I got to fight in four weeks. Right.

532
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,390
Beating you up does nothing for me. I
don't get paid to do this. Well they,

533
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,970
they were wondering why it's like that
now I'll say something like, Nah Bro,

534
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:52,430
get headgear, we'll do it. We'll go
next round our role or something. Right.

535
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,040
They did it really?
And somebody was talking about how smart,

536
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,610
when somebody gets knocked out five times
or whatever and they start getting a

537
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,470
glass chin, so you
touch them, they go out.

538
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,840
And what they were saying was that the
reason for that was that your brain, when,

539
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,140
when you, when you get caught, you're
brain will shut off. It's so used to that.

540
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:11,020
It goes, oh danger time, don't
want any more punishment.

541
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:14,480
Gotta protect itself and we'll
shut your body right off. The Dell,

542
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,090
Dell explained it to me.

543
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,810
We were talking about at once and he
said that he just couldn't take a shot

544
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,290
anymore. What it was because he
said he was, you know, he was,

545
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,450
he would grit his fucking,

546
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:29,170
it would bite down on his mouthpiece and
cough it out and just absorb punishment.

547
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,440
And his brain knew when he was getting
hint that he was going to do that and his

548
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:36,160
brain knew that he was gonna absorb
punishment. So the is like, fuck you,

549
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,860
I'm going to just shut off.
That's good though. Yeah.

550
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:41,830
So when I said somebody who can be the
point of you and I'm telling the story

551
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:43,390
again. All right, so that's right. Yeah.

552
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,900
Johnny Hendricks came out pretty publicly
and talked about how he didn't take

553
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:50,380
head shots for that whole camp
against Lawler. Well it's smart.

554
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:53,290
You see him in the cage there and those
guys are just trading back and forth.

555
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:57,970
Then you got to save it for when
it counts you football, don't they?

556
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:58,560
They're not going to see,

557
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,210
they don't scrimmage like
all these certain guys cause
they're getting smarter.

558
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,940
Like Michigan, Ohio state, they
don't hit during the season.

559
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,970
It makes in the NFL you really don't hit,

560
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:10,090
you don't hit your paying these athletes
so much money. Why the hell listen,

561
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,490
if you can't take a punch
now or void a pinch now,

562
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:15,970
you're not going to do it four weeks from
now. Exactly. That's a very good point.

563
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,780
And your ability to take a punch a lot
of times depends on how many punches

564
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:22,780
you've already taken. I mean, we've
all seen guys where they just,

565
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:24,100
their chin starts to go.

566
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,130
We've all seen guys like that
where they just start to hit.

567
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,890
Did you see Pat Barry's last fight?
I did.

568
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,300
Pat Barry had never gotten knocked out
before. When he fought Chuck Congo,

569
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,910
check Congo was the first time he
ever went out. That was a great fight.

570
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,010
It was a great fight. But then he
got knocked out there. He got knocked

571
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,040
out by soul politely.
He got knocked out by Lavard Johnson.

572
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,540
He got knocked out and he got knocked
out by this Zach Movie Casa. Holy Shit.

573
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,960
Is that guy up to hell? What was that?
That's the Congo son. That's a girl.

574
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,900
Grew up in the fucking Congo.
Congo.

575
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,060
We we're talking about when we
were talking about Russians,

576
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,020
Russians are scared of people from the
Congo cause that's some next level shit.

577
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,750
Next level shows dudes who climbed,

578
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,170
he's got silver backs in Russia,
the wrestling,

579
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,680
grizzly bears. Here I am in Malibu
playing grab ass with Bruce Jenner.

580
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,880
How the fuck am I going to do
this, man? My kids are screwed.

581
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,230
So I kick a Jaguar in the,
I

582
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,510
kick his shuck water, I DVR
it. And when I got home,

583
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:27,980
I fast forward to Pat Barry's fight in
the dude. He was fighting. I was like, no,

584
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,490
who signed this fight? Why would
you do that? Movie Casa has a,

585
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,650
he's got a pretty good boxer boxing
background. Yeah. And you know,

586
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,730
I think it was 12 and one is a pro.
I like Pat Barry.

587
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:40,580
But I hate when a guy says
I fight one round fights.

588
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,610
So I fired one round fired some other.
If I wonder if I stop,

589
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,860
we stop saying that it's a mental week.
Well not only that, like what do you,

590
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,560
I understand that you want to be exciting.
I understand that.

591
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:54,110
But you're a fighter and you're skillful.

592
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,260
You know that guy should be doing and
he should be training at some high level

593
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:01,220
camp, you know, some high level Moitai.
Can you want to be a more anti fighter?

594
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:06,200
Fucking go to Golden Glory MMA gym.
Go Do. Yes, exactly. Go somewhere.

595
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:09,800
You know how was the guy who had walked
into wrestling and literally you'd be

596
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:12,180
like, dude, just don't kill
your dog on the way here.

597
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:16,760
Or You'd get to watch wrestling and
just be like super sad, super sad.

598
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,820
The other heavyweight shop go
with pat and like, all right,

599
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,750
come here and Mopey Murdo let's go.
Let's go.

600
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,380
This is how you avoid
hitting stuffed on your back.

601
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:36,350
He just hated wrestling that much.
Hate, dreaded it. He was gone.

602
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,220
He was doing wrestling and was like, you
know what? Fuck this. And then was like,

603
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:43,090
I'm, I'm, I'm retiring. I don't wanna
do this anymore. That's hilarious. Hear.

604
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,710
I hear he's like a really funny guy.
Like he's hilarious. He's a great guy,

605
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,430
but for how much longer?
How much longer?

606
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:52,030
If he keeps getting knocked out like
that, you know? That's what I worry about.

607
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,400
I like that. It's a sweetheart. He's
a great guy. He's tough as shit.

608
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,360
He puts on exciting fights. I mean,
when he knocked out the late, great,

609
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,310
Shane del Rosario, that was like one, a,

610
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:03,710
one of my favorite heavyweight fights
ever. Yeah. I'll take some more.

611
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,020
You're not mad at this wine, by
the way. Very. I'm not mad at this.

612
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,570
Bulletproof coffee.
The only reason I come,

613
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,090
somebody is in camp. I swill line
like an aristocrat. By the way,

614
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,100
it's one of the reasons why he
can't pull back in 90 pound ball.

615
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:19,960
Your body's rejecting. It doesn't matter.
I've got good taste buds. My buddies,

616
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:24,600
I'm belt for dancing,
elbows, whatever bullshit.

617
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,550
Afterwards I can do 28 champs,
which, okay, which is Peter,

618
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,160
tell me how to tell me. He's like, I
don't get it. You could do it so easy.

619
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,270
You could do it easy. By the way, heavy
weights. I was all bunched up. I was like,

620
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,030
Huh? Heavyweights. How about
pots was selling mouthpieces.

621
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,070
That's how he got into the game. Sell
mouthpieces, pots and sour politely.

622
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,540
[inaudible] he's not, he's not Samoan
isn't, how do you see he's a happy boy.

623
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,760
His name Ruan pots. Let's put some
volume here. Is He from Holland?

624
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:56,594
Where's he from?

625
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,270
Heavyweight comes to the UFC.
Haven't finished.

626
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,240
Let's back it up so we could see how
John Annex says his name and then fast

627
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,940
forward. So we're not out of line
with all the people watching at home.

628
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,780
So am I be besides big foot.
The second biggest guy

629
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,510
back it up again. What a bad
ass. I wish I was. Simone,

630
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,970
you'll see on the back it up again

631
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,710
and welcome to the big show.

632
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,480
Rule One.
Alright,

633
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,720
for this shit. Where is Ron pots
from? He lives next door to you,

634
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,060
your wife right now. Hey Man, I'll tell
you. I'm not there to videotape it.

635
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,920
What is this?
What is this?

636
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,730
Why does Fox News insists on putting
hot chicks in dresses that talk about

637
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,430
sports? I'm not mad about it.
I'm not mad about it either,

638
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:44,460
but it makes me uncomfortable.
My Dick gets hard, right?

639
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,980
I'm watching. I'm like,
what are you doing?

640
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:50,810
Are you sending me mixed mixes and had
a big sweaty Samoan comes on the screen.

641
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:55,160
You're like, oh no, I'm really confused.
I disagree with your political outlook,

642
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,810
but my dick is hard listening.
Got a hard on.

643
00:36:58,811 --> 00:37:02,330
I want to argue with you and give you
a better point than you're capable of

644
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:02,730
making.
Yeah.

645
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,390
Just so I can fuck. You
can remember on a freak,

646
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,220
your friends would just walk
into the room with a heart on.

647
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,520
Well that's what they're trying to do
when they're putting these women on Fox

648
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,670
News. I mean, look, not,

649
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:15,000
not saying there's anything wrong
with these women or that they're not

650
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:17,760
intelligent. They surely are.
That's how they got on you. Look,

651
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:21,150
it's very difficult to get a job where
you're a political correspondent or

652
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,560
you're doing sports.

653
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,130
I mean it's even harder for a woman
to do sports and it's for our man,

654
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:28,560
cause he's got to stand
up to all the patriarchy,

655
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,770
all the bullshit that guys don't want
to hear women talking about sports.

656
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,170
However, they're all hot. Like
that's a, that's a fucking strategy.

657
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,530
They know what they're
doing and you tricking us.

658
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,640
We can have large Marge
up there and be like,

659
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:45,641
let's just Wayne Wayne back that up real,

660
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,820
oh, packed that up. I need to see
this. There's no need for that.

661
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:50,990
When you think about a boner,

662
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,710
so here's the commercial is all
this Wayne Newton's spinning around.

663
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,270
That might be a wow.
Who's hot as fuck,

664
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:00,900
by the way,

665
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,900
is excited that we Newton still don't
let it let it roll because Oh and look,

666
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:11,100
she gets excited. No, she
knows that. Oh Gee, you're not
a good enough factor, ma'am.

667
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,590
You're not a good enough factor
for that to go to videos and face.

668
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,550
Zombie did touch her pussy moist. No, he
does not. He's a thousand years old. Yeah,

669
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,830
and I know you want to get your sag card,
but that's,

670
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
there's better ways vampires.
There's fucking better ways.

671
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,530
[inaudible] who's able to wink?
He had a fucking sweat.

672
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,390
You doing squats.

673
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,270
Weekend is like 40 pounds.

674
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,010
The Botox.
I bet he has so many bitches in Vegas.

675
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:49,600
It's not even books ridiculous.
He probably has so much money,

676
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,070
so if he has so much money,

677
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:54,490
of course he has so many bitches
in case there's so many lost,

678
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,050
confused people get these girls to
the show seeing some little song.

679
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,450
I think at this point in his career it's
probably done. I disagree. I disagree.

680
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,460
He's performing at Hooters casino though.
He is he.

681
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,660
Okay, well let's find out
where he is. Well, he might
still be, believe it or not,

682
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,110
either way and cause he's going,
he's going back to the villain.

683
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,630
Just haven't bitches. It's one of
those things like Tony Bennett.

684
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:20,860
Will you pretend it's good

685
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,620
if Tony Bennett between the spearmint
rhino or going to see Tony Bennett? Me,

686
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,610
it. No, because I just feel like
those girls, I feel sorry for them.

687
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:38,410
Most of them are nursing students. Wayne
newton.com schedule. Let's go to sketch.

688
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:41,650
You guys want to get boners in the
meantime or no? All right. Oh, okay.

689
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:45,250
He might not even be in Vegas anymore
because it says here he's in Nebraska,

690
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:50,190
five 17 Lindenwood university.
Yup.

691
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,680
Casino Dude. He took, he
took your shit on the road.

692
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,220
There's nothing wrong with that,
but it's not even defending Wayne Newton.

693
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,870
You're a contrarian,
but university is spelled wrong.

694
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,320
It's you never city cit. Why that's not
how you spell university isn't, well,

695
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:11,650
if it's a university, Brian, who
you got in this fight, heavyweight,

696
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,030
Samoan on principal,

697
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,810
Mr Las Vegas world tour and he's going
to some university in Saint Charles,

698
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,990
Missouri and then another
place in Wisconsin,

699
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,290
Lake Lake.
Of the torches resort.

700
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:34,120
Casino lock do Flom Bay,
Wisconsin.

701
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,440
Holy Shit. You know, he just,
he wishes Hooters casino. Wow.

702
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:42,630
He might not be in pain. This is
really true. He really does. He still,

703
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,820
he still calls himself Mister Vegas.
I don't know.

704
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,530
It's a good question man. It seems like
he's not in Vegas anymore. That's insane.

705
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,280
It's a shame. Really. So,
Brendan, for the heavyweights,

706
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,860
how much tougher is a heavyweights
chin versus the punching power?

707
00:40:56,861 --> 00:41:01,780
Like what's that relation there? You
people ask me this all the time. I mean,

708
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,480
besides Mark Hunt and Roy Nelson,

709
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,680
there's really no such thing. Everyone's
been knocked out at heavyweight.

710
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,080
I mean name a guy,
he's been knocked out.

711
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,340
All the top guys have really been
knocked out. So, and if you haven't,

712
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,570
you're not finding tough enough guys.
Yeah.

713
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,510
So if you say from
middleweight to heavyweight,

714
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:24,490
how much more of a punch does it take?
20% 30% it's tough to say Tufts.

715
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:28,060
It depends on the fighter. But like
if a soul, it lands a good jab here,

716
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:32,340
it could knock at that size of a jab,
the size of his legs.

717
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:33,920
So saw my God,

718
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,220
Brian, please control, sorry. Sorry. It's
a big boy. He's put your back straight.

719
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:41,820
But I'm just saying so it was a big
boards a hands, Huh? But he fought, he,

720
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,170
he felt part of against Eddie Sanchez
in his first fight in the UFC,

721
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,700
just hardier adrenaline,

722
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,050
adrenaline dump because Ryan Parsons
was very high on this guy who was saying

723
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,380
like, the guy's a beast. He
just, he just had a hard time.

724
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,540
He's light on a hard time
dealing with the pressure.

725
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,560
The pressure's a motherfucker,
right. I mean, oh Brendan,

726
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:04,190
you feel like the pressure was
you sold on so yeah, exactly.

727
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,940
Doing saying guys do that drives
me nuts. But Paul, Ellie, his,

728
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:10,920
he had his arm trapped, trapped. But
if it wasn't, he would come over.

729
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,760
But I bet he doesn't do that
cause he's not a graph. No. Well,

730
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:17,530
you know he did Mount,
um, Pat Barry. Pat. Yes.

731
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,560
So did my brother.
But he did work with a lot of wrestlers.

732
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,280
He did work with a raw. So
it did. So look at this.

733
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,420
This guy's using this gay teens to,
he's using.

734
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,730
Can you just gave him half guard so
it just, and then he gave it back.

735
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,500
He's still holding onto his neck. Look
at, Hey, roll the ball with the neck.

736
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,910
Oh my goodness.

737
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:42,911
This is some blue belt level shit is a
good thing for it to be a horrible idea.

738
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,540
But uh,
pulled guard,

739
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,240
Eh Brendan Schaub getting
crazy. Yeah. Not a good move.

740
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,570
What look what level of
Jujitsu when you compare,

741
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:58,571
like say Metamorris Abu Dhabi and then
you watch grappling like an average match

742
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:02,300
in the UFC. Give me some
volume there. Young Jamie,

743
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,140
how much a difference do you
think? What do you, what do you,

744
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:07,750
what would you say the average is like in,

745
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:12,140
in metamorris black belt in the U s level
black. The average. His purple belt.

746
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,920
I would really, I would say this
is blue belt. What we're seeing,

747
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,350
this is low level. Yes, this is blue belt,

748
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:22,190
but I think the [inaudible] I'd
say on average I'd say purple.

749
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,690
He's not as having an arm bar. The elbows?
No, no, he doesn't have that either.

750
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:31,190
I was saying it was in the family and the,
in that family.

751
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,900
Do you think the average is purple belt?
If you had, let's say, purple belt,

752
00:43:33,901 --> 00:43:36,520
whatever about yeah, that's a pro
belt. And then when he went and then,

753
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:40,040
but at one 55 black belt.
Black belt. Yeah. Yeah.

754
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,660
One 55 one 70 oh Hellboy how fucking
good is Jim Miller's Jujitsu?

755
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,720
God Ron's out and see that cause
polarity hits fucking hardest shit man.

756
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:54,380
Had kissed him on the back of the head.
Wow. Where did he kiss the referee?

757
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,230
Yeah. Good move. Yeah. Keith
Peterson's a sexy bitch.

758
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,060
It's a good guy to kiss politely.

759
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,590
See now there's a guy that is getting
comfortable in the UFC and you're getting

760
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:07,520
to see what everybody saw from him in
the gym. Neon belly gets the mount.

761
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,290
Dang. Oh, oh no.

762
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,130
Even not even a lot behind it.
Oh, he kissed him. Yeah. Awesome.

763
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,180
Left underneath all that. Needed
them daily check out the left. Not,

764
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,420
but this is what everybody said about him.
The guy fucking hits wicked hard.

765
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,430
Look at this pump that left town and I
look at guys that one eye open. Oh God.

766
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,670
He's seeing all kinds of shit that you
used to see when you were a little kid.

767
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,760
When you saw those cartoons where a guy
got hit in the head with a frying pan.

768
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,240
I think I saw that in the jungle.
[inaudible]

769
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:47,590
we'll talk about that tomorrow.
So it's like 21 and three now I think.

770
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,570
Yeah. Impressive. [inaudible]
it's outside the UFC,

771
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:54,670
so I don't want to do the Haka
because I can only get behind it.

772
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:57,420
My favorite thing, I watched the all
blacks hoc all the time. I do it.

773
00:44:57,421 --> 00:45:01,420
Am I going to be up? Yep.
Sorry for yourself. You
haven't a fucking pity party.

774
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,980
Well, no idea. Youtube with a Haka.
Nobody wants to be Samoan more than me,

775
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,733
so

776
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,580
I may or may not have written
my own Haka actually really

777
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,650
go to battle. Sorry sir. Swim across
the orange potion, the dugout canoes.

778
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,680
I realized that I couldn't do
anything with it, but I've tried.

779
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,400
It's all right man. So right. As
was motivated as far as that Haka,

780
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:31,330
I watched a lot of watch, a little cowl
Drogo game of Thrones. As far as Joe,

781
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,540
if you think Jujitsu, is
that okay? It approvable

782
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,040
level overall we're talking I'll
weight classes. What would you say?

783
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:39,130
Striking purple belt as well?
Probably would say, yeah,

784
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:42,340
I mean if you pay attention to
like look at high level boxing,

785
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,480
look at high level Moitai look at high
level kickboxing and the difference

786
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:48,520
between kickboxing and Muay Thai.
For folks who don't know,

787
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:49,930
if you watch him like glory,

788
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,010
what they're not allowed to do in glory
and I'd Love Glory but what they're not

789
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:57,550
allowed to do his elbows to the head
and the not allowed to clinch and throw

790
00:45:57,551 --> 00:46:02,080
knees. But Moy Tai, that's a
big part of my time, a big,

791
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:05,650
and it also protects fighters and in a,
in a good instance,

792
00:46:05,651 --> 00:46:10,390
a good a example rather a guy like
John Wayne par multiple time Moy Thai

793
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,391
champion,

794
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:15,220
but not really allowed to use his
full skillset when he fights in glory.

795
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,890
And I'm a fan of why is that?
Why?

796
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,250
Because Gloria has decided they
want to go to the k one route.

797
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,870
And what k one decided was they used
to let you clinch with two hands,

798
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,690
but then Alastair started
kneeing guys into oblivion.

799
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,740
So they changed two hands to one hand.
Sakharova yeah.

800
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,800
Could Sakharova fun with it? Oh No. It
was a who did he fight where he broke his,

801
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,920
his chin, uh, soccer.

802
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:45,830
Rob and broke his chin over him. Did it to
him. No, no Overeem. Never fought soccer.

803
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,070
I think you're thinking of Melvin
Manhoef. Nope. No fought soccer.

804
00:46:51,071 --> 00:46:54,610
Rabo Sakuraba only in Muay Thai.
MMA.

805
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:58,330
He never fought when we tie it was MMA
booze in the clinch. He broke his chin.

806
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:00,990
Sorry, I just heard, I'm not
sure what fight that wasn't me.

807
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,760
Soccer Sakharova has taken some
fucking brutal beatings in his time.

808
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,850
But the bottom line is that you're,

809
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:11,851
you're not as able to defend yourself
if you're fighting kickboxing because

810
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:16,360
kickboxing, you have all these
other things that you can do.

811
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,460
You know you can grab the plum,

812
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:23,461
you can shove your head up into the
side of his head and really control that

813
00:47:23,651 --> 00:47:27,220
clinch, a need of the body and
trip and throw him to the ground.

814
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,810
There's all these different
things that you could do.

815
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:33,010
Like you watch the only
promotion in America that
allows that as lion fights and

816
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:36,520
you can wash out an access TV.
Great, great, great fights.

817
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:41,200
I love watching that and you, you, we
see some really like high level Moy,

818
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:44,860
Tai, you see all the elbows,
you see the, the, there's,

819
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:48,730
there's all these tools that guys are
allowed to use and stand up an MMA that

820
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:53,080
you can't use and dream we can't or rather
a you can't use in k one and he can't

821
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:53,914
use in glory.

822
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,510
One of the most confusing things I ever
saw was watching fights in Bangkok and

823
00:47:57,511 --> 00:48:01,570
similarly in Thailand because the rule
system there for the Muy Thai fight,

824
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:05,440
first of all it's epic cause their bet
everybody taught at that time like come

825
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:08,890
on the way though they will do like
in first round they'll a lot of times

826
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:11,560
because they bet on things like
how many, how many, uh, roundhouse.

827
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,280
Second I sort of the right side. They
do all kinds of stuff. You're a guy,

828
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:17,550
if you're betting on your guy,
your guy will get that notion.

829
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,990
He'll get that note and he'll actually,

830
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,290
so that you can never tell
how somebody's going to do,

831
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,940
how good a fight or somebody is by
watching their first round. Yeah.

832
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,650
There's a lot of times,

833
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,950
a lot of the best things in a
lot of guts came in after that.

834
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,860
But you would watch these
fights and there'd be some,

835
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,990
the crowd would go crazy
for a knee to the body,

836
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:38,140
like crazy for a need of the body or
kicked in the leg or something like that.

837
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,320
And then you'd see like an American
guy in their English guy, I don't know,

838
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,350
white guy in there and he would just
start like in late around just start

839
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:47,950
lighting somebody up with punches
to the face, like Hook, cross,

840
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,100
upper cut and you're like, oh shit.
Oh Shit. But I'm the only one yelling.

841
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,050
And then at the end of the fight I'm like,
man,

842
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:55,900
that guy kicked the other guys
as Joe and hit me. It's the,

843
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:01,050
it's the Thai guy who landed more knees
that when what is going not Sakharova

844
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,163
Fujita

845
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,630
No. Yeah, he got a plot. Overeem, Overeem.

846
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:10,420
What he did was kick was
nice. Yeah, it kicked,

847
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,070
that was Eddie Wineland
and he knocked out.

848
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:16,450
He's gonna Fight Tj Dillashaw such a
good back. Bacchic yeah, that's Hanan.

849
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:19,600
Barao he might be the best pound for
pound guy on the planet around phenomena.

850
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,790
Phenomenal. He's not the
best. He's close to it yet,

851
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,810
but I'm t j by Japanese necktie.
Oh yeah.

852
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,900
Maybe I wouldn't that be crazy though.
That'd be dope.

853
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,900
I showed it to him at the Onnit
headquarters. Did you really?

854
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:34,650
I couldn't believe you didn't
know it. Never seen it. No,

855
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,470
neither did a t TJ didn't know.
And Danny Castillo,

856
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,450
neither one of those guys knew it. Amun
Ra and the Japanese neck hold with them.

857
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,200
Yeah, well I showed them some techniques
that I, well the only tapping was uh,

858
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:51,430
that and then I just put them in
rubber guard and asked him to escape.

859
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,130
And then I got him in the M and Ari.
Do you know the MNR well,

860
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,060
I was trying to show Whitney. I don't know
the names to a problem. A lot of Bravo.

861
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,990
Well [inaudible] not Bravo's.
It's a and technique. It's a,

862
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:04,660
it's basically an Omoplata.
We finished with a neck crank.

863
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,200
You go for the Omoplata
when you got the guy,

864
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:11,040
you know how you got a guy flatten
down, you've got the seat belt. Yeah.

865
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,580
You grabbed the neck.
It's a fucking devastating move.

866
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,920
I'll pull it up for you to just
do it to me. No, I'll show you.

867
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,480
Just do it to me.
Well,

868
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,710
you can just voice gets
raspy my dick out on God.

869
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,740
The bone or is everywhere.
This podcast is the best,

870
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,550
but because Google uh,
imaginary all my plot,

871
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,500
a neck crank, there's a video of
it. It's pretty fucking dope dude.

872
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,360
He um, he really knows how to do it.
He and he invented that. Ever seen it?

873
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,350
I never saw anybody do it before.
Mnr He did.

874
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:54,920
We got some videos of you teaching that
on the, on it youtube too. Oh is that on,

875
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,870
on its youtube? I'm pretty sure.
Yeah. Better get audit. I asked,

876
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,220
I asked Danny if he had ever seen it
before and that strangle, the minute

877
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,580
I had him in the eye,
I asked him to get out of a rubber guard.

878
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,330
He couldn't get out of rubber guard cause
if a guy's got a good mission control,

879
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:16,010
it's pretty surprising.

880
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,180
Like you get in a guy like Katie
Bravo's guard and ask, you know,

881
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:24,160
like try to get out of it. You're
completely clamped down. But the,

882
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:27,470
the thing about it is that you
don't know where you're in danger.

883
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:29,550
You don't know which, which Mu, it's,

884
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,200
there's so many non traditional
attacks from that position. But Suman,

885
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:36,770
Ari figured out this
dope ass grip neck crank.

886
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,830
You just reach under the Chin with the
escript and you really can't fucking

887
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:43,880
defend it because your right arm
totally trapped in the Omoplata. Right.

888
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:48,350
You're attacking the shoulder just
sitting up getting an s grip on the neck

889
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,640
anywhere around the neck and just
yanking that motherfucker back.

890
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,190
It's essentially your entire core,

891
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,520
all the weight of your bag and
everything on the unprotected neck.

892
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,340
There's not a lot you can
do to defend hard to finish.

893
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,090
It was very hard to finish it anyway.
A lot in the heavyweight heavyweight.

894
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:08,810
I feel like it's even worse. Guys are
so big. What is that? What is the one?

895
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:10,840
Jujitsu and man is one.

896
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,950
If they'd done a stiff at stat on what
the one Jujitsu move in the UFC the most,

897
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:20,300
the most successful
submission rate.

898
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,520
I'd say Katie because more people know it.

899
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,270
A lot of guys aren't going to pull off,
you know all these kids be interesting.

900
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:30,510
Is the chat rear naked chokes cause that's
been on a steady choking [inaudible]

901
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,390
up there. I don't know.
It's hard with the gloves.

902
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,270
The gloves is what makes it hard,
man.

903
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,570
It's almost now people have to be
dazed for you to see, you know,

904
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:42,470
see someone famous or they have to be
giving a cowboy Serone when he had a

905
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,210
Barbosa days. Then even, you
know, just all over. Yeah. Tj.

906
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,400
Hello Tj.
Let's do this shit.

907
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:55,070
Tough to be a good one. That TV over
there. That's a crazy fight, man.

908
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,450
That's going to be a crazy fight.
Oh,

909
00:52:56,451 --> 00:53:00,800
there's an Minari pulling it off on that
foot. Look at that. On that TV. Pull it.

910
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:02,030
Pull back it up a little bit,
Jamie,

911
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:05,660
so we could get a look at it as
the guy rolls repeating Gif this.

912
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,000
See how he gets it. Look at
that in the world. Is that strs?

913
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,560
That is so nasty. Oh no, that's
bad, man. Let me do it to Brian.

914
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,550
No Way Tot death. That's how it went
away. If you've got a neck problem now,

915
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:22,490
fucking forget that.
That's just from count with terrible.

916
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,250
That's literally how break your fucking

917
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,780
body. Beautiful technique though.
It's super effective. Rarely Plata,

918
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,130
and you just grab his head like that.

919
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,670
Especially if the guy's trying to
release your legs to try to save his arm

920
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,470
because you kind of give up.

921
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:40,260
Your right arm is trapped now there
he gets underneath that checks,

922
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,570
but you don't have to go
anywhere around the space.

923
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,070
It's basically a net crank and you're,
you're breaking your spine. I mean,

924
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:49,560
she's a horrible, horrible
position. You're putting so
much pressure on the discs.

925
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,013
It's honorable

926
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,770
man. I mean I'll, I'll show you after
the podcast, the set up, it's super,

927
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,240
super clean and it's one
of those techniques where
it's there the whole time,

928
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,140
but nobody does it.

929
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,680
Sort of like the Japanese necktie necktie
where a lot of guys want to get the

930
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:09,860
dark. He can't get the Darth,
they don't know that neck ties,

931
00:54:09,861 --> 00:54:12,720
but you weren't there the whole
time. You know that right? You,

932
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,760
you do that Japanese necktie on familiar,

933
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:17,100
we should go over it after your
Doris is fucking nasty man.

934
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:20,040
That Darcy you hit mitre on
with that was locked down tight.

935
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:23,430
That was bank vault tight. Yeah.
Darcy, that's just forever. You know,

936
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:27,690
things could just come to you for
whatever reason. I see Darcy's everywhere.

937
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:31,380
It's for whatever reason.
I just see as soon as surgeon and Jujitsu,

938
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,780
they show me the doors and
then I was just right away.

939
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:36,640
It was just something they showed me
once and it was in my [inaudible].

940
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,930
There's some guys that just like certain
techniques really click with them.

941
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:43,480
So weird. Now we're like Paul Sas
triangles, Bang, Bang, Bang. He just,

942
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,190
that's his thing.

943
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,670
That guy you'd get caught and Paul
sasses guard you gotta fucking get out of

944
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:51,720
there and run. That mother fucker would
triangle the shit out of you. It's weird.

945
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,070
Other guys,
that triangle is just dog shit week.

946
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:57,140
He could find a way to get on
high level guys to the like, uh,

947
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,690
I'll do Darcy's on guys,
super high level guys and then I'm like,

948
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,140
you're not a dark sky. Like No. Like they
don't even, they don't even mess with it.

949
00:55:04,141 --> 00:55:07,320
They don't even care to mess with it.
I don't have to arm bars or whatever.

950
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,180
I don't understand that Darcy is such
a potent weapon such as shit man.

951
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,690
When it with the guys.
The reason I developed it a lot.

952
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:17,010
It's because with Shane car
I was shooting in on me.

953
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:18,560
I should come up with something,
right?

954
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,290
So it was gay teens and Darcy's had to
come up with something out of desperation.

955
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:25,770
Rilla out attack feet.
Watch me in the face.

956
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,480
Browse a beast, man. He's a motherfucker,
dude. He is as good as it gets.

957
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,790
Undefeated winning streak in
MMA. Is that true? That's crazy.

958
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,910
That's the longest I think.
Something crazy. Let's find out.

959
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,080
It's 36 38 well, when you're,
when you're training partners, uh,

960
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,200
Jose Aldo that, no, the thing
is the weight class he's in,

961
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,890
he's fighting black belts and everything.
Everything.

962
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:56,460
It's hard to even comprehend that long.
The fight streak as a fighter. To me,

963
00:55:56,461 --> 00:56:00,730
that's kind of speed and stuff too. Like
where everybody's fast length. Yeah.

964
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,730
Let's see.
Daniel Cormier,

965
00:56:02,731 --> 00:56:06,720
who was about five foot one picking
dudes up and just look at that.

966
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,700
He's not fight for one five, eight, five,
nine. He's not that much taller than that.

967
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:16,440
He's five 11 that's a lie. I stood
next to him. I towered over him.

968
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,780
He was like, man, you're tall. I was like,
thanks man cause I love your work that

969
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,980
I was like, thank you. I was like, you're
way more athletic and person. I was like,

970
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:31,390
I know I wrestled six feet tall.
Go fuck yourself feet tall.

971
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:36,550
Towering. I was literally, you are
wearing stilts. I was, that's true.

972
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,170
Women's shoes.
Well this is a good meal.

973
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,570
Magni and Tim means you'll get mad at me.
Eye strain within Denver.

974
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:48,571
We call him the Gazelle because
this kid's cardio is insane.

975
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,700
Insane. That guy has fangs. He's so tough.

976
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:57,130
He's really tough on animal to both
guys are animals and both guys are very

977
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:57,521
similar.

978
00:56:57,521 --> 00:57:02,521
Real tall guys for 55 and means he
knocked out Pete Spratt at once.

979
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:07,390
70 man listen, the the difference between
means and magnesium, magnesium, my boy,

980
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:12,391
but the difference is means is just
nasty and each switches things up.

981
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,160
Like you'll see Neal,
his movements great,

982
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,700
but it's more of like a
point scoring system for him.

983
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,010
He's just touching like Neil's,

984
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,960
I don't think it's ever
knocked anyone out in his life.

985
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,350
All he's doing is beating you off points.

986
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,930
You'll see a jab of right hand jab right
hand and he's just moving the whole

987
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:33,880
time. Means does not play that man. He
means reminds me of a Carlos condit.

988
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,540
Isn't that interesting that that's one
of the reasons why magnet can keep going

989
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:42,170
forever and ever. I was just like that.
He's not putting on a commander. No. Yeah.

990
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,660
That's a weird thing,
isn't it?

991
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,200
Where you're not totally 100%
committing to techniques,

992
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:51,130
but you can keep going for
a way longer with that.

993
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,740
What do you think about that?
That's what you have to have a,

994
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,480
you have to have a mix of that. You have
to, you look at the guys at the top.

995
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,410
There's a mix, right? You
can't go. For instance,

996
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,450
if we look at the fights recently,

997
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,200
look at Travis Brown and I talked
to her doom last Tuesday about this.

998
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:13,390
Verdomme said every shot that Travis
was stolen was that had bad intentions,

999
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:15,970
knockout power.
He's trying to knock them out in one shot.

1000
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,840
He was up putting combos together. It
makes for a high as an ad, a high level.

1001
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:21,760
It's, that's not gonna work, man. Guys.

1002
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:25,290
See it and they're getting out of the
way and they're gonna take, you said it,

1003
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,220
you said about Travis Brown
and you said there's no method,

1004
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,050
there's no method to the madness. And you
said they keys, there's nothing behind.

1005
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,870
There is no strategy behind.
Listen, you can't put,

1006
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:39,100
you can't floor your car in seventh
gear and just it's gonna burn out.

1007
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:39,993
You just can't do it.

1008
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,450
You have to use all the gears and the
guys at the very highest level are using

1009
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:47,740
all the gears, like looking at dos
Santos, he comes out very relaxed,

1010
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,790
Jab, Jab, and then you're gonna see a big
shot and he's back down to second gear,

1011
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,300
but he's not chilling at seventh
gear like Shane Carlin. Yeah,

1012
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:58,900
I see what you're saying. I would
just say first gear, first gear,

1013
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,910
third gear, but yeah, I know what you're
saying. Yeah. I think that there's a,

1014
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:08,320
there's not good, it's not good. There's
some guys who do fight like that though.

1015
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:10,480
They just explode, explode,
explode, explode, explode.

1016
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,920
And then by the time the third round comes
along and a high level guys, I'm like,

1017
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:17,480
cool, let's we're going to drag
his ass to the third round,

1018
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:19,390
the third round we're going to
go to work and submit this wall.

1019
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,640
That's why I was really interesting
to really interested to see what would

1020
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:26,450
happen with Tyron Woodley and
Jay and Carlos condit. I agree.

1021
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,840
Unfortunately for Cangelosi
and Roy McDonald though, right?

1022
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:30,900
With dollar drag is athlete.

1023
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,210
You have to wait before maybe if
he had survived the onslaught.

1024
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,020
Woodley is so fucking fast.
Wrong.

1025
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,270
You should see this guy
in the gym hit Mitts. Nah,

1026
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:45,260
I don't want to see it scared me
up at night, bro. It's insane.

1027
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:50,920
I don't want to see it. Any might place
third and miss the Olympia right now.

1028
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,240
He's just never ever say,
why does he,

1029
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:56,480
why would you wear clothes when you walk
to the grocery store? It's ridiculous.

1030
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,100
Just a Bandana just to keep
this cutter from dragging him.

1031
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:04,670
I hope I saw me myths with his trainer
Wildcard Real Pete had some type Valley

1032
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,660
Tudo showing
things to do.

1033
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,180
I just chill man.

1034
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,150
How often is it wildcard?
What's up? He's not an la guy.

1035
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:20,650
How often is he out? He's out here cause
straighten coat. A striking coach Arnold.

1036
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,570
Is that a wildcard out here?
Arnold?

1037
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:27,590
I met Arnold doing stunt director now
was an extra in a B movie with heath

1038
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:30,650
herring and heath herring was beating
me up and stealing my girlfriend in the

1039
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:34,790
movie and Arnold was the stunt
coordinator. What's he doing now?

1040
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:38,600
He's playing poker. Poker. I used to have,

1041
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:42,830
he's playing poker. You have more round
shirt. What a fucking legit wild man.

1042
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:46,010
He's hair. I'll never forget
his fight with Tom Erickson.

1043
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:51,350
Tom Erickson was on top of them dominating
him and he was getting tired and they

1044
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:56,210
stood them up and pride and
when they stood them up,
heath herring just goes, Woo.

1045
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,500
Fucking slap. Erickson was like, oh fuck.

1046
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,890
And he just charged after
herring and smashed him,

1047
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:09,410
kissed him and yeah, hailed him
classic at the fucking stare-down

1048
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:15,860
right now. He shook his head
before he punched him too.

1049
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,160
He could tell he thought about
it. He's like, no, fuck this.

1050
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,220
He got suspended. That's dope.
Got this bent. They probably
gave him some money to.

1051
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:26,930
These guys are very similar,

1052
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,340
but the difference in this fight will
be Tim means it just has a nasty,

1053
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:35,690
nasty streak. Oh, this is one 70 yes.
Means has been fighting. If 55 though,

1054
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:40,160
has he not,
he's been fighting in the MFC,

1055
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:44,570
but before that, when he
fought in the UFC, I look at
this learning, look at this.

1056
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:49,520
Look, what are we doing? He does remind
me of Carl's comment, right? Yeah.

1057
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:53,820
He's fought lightweight, lightweight
quite a few times. I'm going to get to,

1058
01:01:53,821 --> 01:01:56,060
that's what kind of tattoo should I get,
guys?

1059
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:01,090
You should get a dove
daddy dick on your chest.

1060
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:01,964
Like Brock Lesnar.

1061
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,870
I dealt with a Dick flying loss
twice in the UFC at lightweight.

1062
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:08,780
He lost against Muscovy doll and
he lost against Danny Castillo.

1063
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,660
So I think that he was having
a hard time making that weight.

1064
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,700
And why would he was only six foot
fucking to these crazy six three bro.

1065
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,160
No, it's crazy. It's crazy.
Fuckers that drops off my boys,

1066
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,550
Loren Landow and the battery one 17
he's got muscle on him. That's crazy.

1067
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:28,560
What I mean, that's magnes reaches insane.
Yeah. Like I said, the differences,

1068
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:32,490
these guys are very similar, same
size. Magna has great footwork,

1069
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:37,110
but Tim means just has this killer's
Macchiato for Jack Timber. No, Denver.

1070
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,710
Yeah.
Means is like a dirty means.

1071
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:44,070
It's like you want to go to the ground
does not cure where it goes, man.

1072
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,190
He just wants to finish the fight
magnet will not get tired. Huh? Nope.

1073
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,930
Means it's got real
good head movement too.

1074
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,530
I like how he that Longreach another
thing that people don't talk about about

1075
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,990
Longreach. Yeah, but the long reach,

1076
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:58,830
the ability to bend at the waist
and move away from Shit. That's,

1077
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,590
that's one of the things
that Jon Jones does so well.

1078
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,410
Best in the moving away from
Shit not getting hit. Yeah.

1079
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:09,150
I guarantee you the game plan
here for Neil Magni is don't wait.

1080
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:13,440
As soon as you hit the cage, get off.
You're going to see them circling,

1081
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:14,400
constantly circling.

1082
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,360
It's interesting how different body types
have different advantages like he got

1083
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,580
that who some are Paul Horez body.

1084
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,240
What ted is just a huge
advantage for ripping off legs.

1085
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:28,650
Rip on a hall of legs and if you
watched his fight with Ivan salivary,

1086
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:31,620
basically anything he does in grappling,
he's just so ridiculous.

1087
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:35,810
Came out of his mom and put her in
ankle lock just to tick is dude.

1088
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,470
Do you ever see video of him rolling
with the Mayhem Miller? Yeah.

1089
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,350
It just talk to mom about that man said
he was really hung over though. Yeah,

1090
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:45,570
whatever. Whatever. I would say
that too. If I got fucking two cost,

1091
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:49,920
it's trial that day.
Such a monster for a guy like me.

1092
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,080
Paul hires is scary man. Me and Doug
Davidoff tried to fight mayhem on time.

1093
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,830
We tried to grab him and He Ooh, get
jab. See I like this moving out of Neal.

1094
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,390
But like if you see, you see what I mean?
Went by point sparring. It's just Jab,

1095
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:06,630
move, Jab, move, Jab. Well
he's, there's no bad intentions.

1096
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:08,000
It's not loading up on any,

1097
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:11,340
what's the difference between his style
and like the Diaz brothers then cause

1098
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:16,260
they kind of, his brother's
load up eventually but pop,
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

1099
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:19,660
pop, pop, pop, boom, boom
to the body. Diaz is, it's,

1100
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,610
it's almost like a machine gun.
It's like for five rounds.

1101
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:27,060
They also seem like high level boxers
and comparison. Well, he also has,

1102
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:30,660
Diaz has an incredible chin, especially
nick. They just come forward,

1103
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:34,260
just keep coming and nick as an
eventual cheers guys out. Well,

1104
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:37,410
frank shamrock said it best when
he fought Nick Diaz. He's like,

1105
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:41,010
you can't breathe because he's always
hitting you and every time he hits you

1106
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:44,040
tighten up because even
if it's only a 50% shot,

1107
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,820
you still have to hold your breath and
then he rips you to the bottom and then

1108
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:48,870
you're just,
you never,

1109
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,880
you never breathe and he's landing 80%
of those 50 shots. It's crazy, man.

1110
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:58,560
He does triathlons and he swam
back from Alcatraz twice. Come on,

1111
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,070
stop it. Yes, he did shark infested
waters. He's out of his mind.

1112
01:05:02,071 --> 01:05:05,610
I love that guy more than I
asked him to come on the podcast.

1113
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:08,550
I just don't believe he'll show up here.
I would have him on.

1114
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:10,980
I love that fucking guy. Like,
I love my mother, but I would,

1115
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:14,400
I would only have him on if I had a
backup guest. I'm coming please, please,

1116
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:18,370
please, please. Out of the rankings.

1117
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,130
Huh?
Yeah.

1118
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,560
I don't know about all that.
I don't know what that was all about.

1119
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:25,010
That that bothers me. Just doesn't want
to fight, Huh? No, he wants more money.

1120
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:27,050
He wants more money.
Cause you found out what Gilbert,

1121
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,150
because Gilbert's his
buddy and there was a,

1122
01:05:29,151 --> 01:05:31,670
a contract negotiation with Gilbert Bella.

1123
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,670
Toi was trying to pick up Gilbert when
his contract was over and they gave

1124
01:05:34,671 --> 01:05:38,060
Gilbert a shit ton of money.
And Nate is like, what the fuck?

1125
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,560
And so there's some sort of contract
negotiation and I think there's also at

1126
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,930
that I should pay Nate.
I love Nate and I agree,

1127
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:49,100
but I don't know who his manager is.
I Dunno who negotiated his contract.

1128
01:05:49,101 --> 01:05:52,280
I don't know what the deal is.
But a deal's a deal's a deal is a deal.

1129
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:55,820
You got to stick to it and
nice take down by name.

1130
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,760
It's one of those things
where you talk publicly,

1131
01:05:58,761 --> 01:06:01,480
you talk shit about the UFC and
you're not going to win. Man. What?

1132
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:06,080
What motivation did they have to, you
know, to give you more money? Well,

1133
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:10,640
the other thing is too is guys forget
there's no bigger guy than the UFC.

1134
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,200
The UFC is going to keep on the circus,

1135
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,780
keeps on going if one of the elephants
fallout. So it just keeps on going.

1136
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:19,430
How about Eddie Alvarez backing out of
the fucking Michael Chan Bell Tours?

1137
01:06:19,431 --> 01:06:23,420
First pay view loves. It's gone.
It's gone. It's going to evaporate.

1138
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,570
There's not going to be a paper if you
know they're still doing it. They got it.

1139
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,480
They found a backup. Right? If some
guy, Phil, who I've never heard of him,

1140
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:30,610
that's the problem.
Oh No.

1141
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,990
And now you want people's money.

1142
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,840
This really strange bike because it
almost looks like they're sparring and it

1143
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:37,690
doesn't matter. And they'd still,
I told you saw the point sparring.

1144
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,720
It's don't look that it's interesting.

1145
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,120
Tim means is a slow start.

1146
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:48,960
It doesn't seem concerned about any
low kicks whatsoever. He says, well,

1147
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,800
he's just Kinda,
oh,

1148
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,070
by the way, this might be one
of my favorite podcasts ever.

1149
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,750
Just hanging out,
watching our guys.

1150
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:04,490
Watch him fight just for
guys with their pants. Oh,

1151
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:06,960
tagged them left by Magni out.

1152
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:11,210
Now you should have kept book means
a fucking hanging in there, man.

1153
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:15,540
I brownie you coach. No, I wasn't. No I
wasn't. I said, see, I stopped myself.

1154
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:16,374
I was like,
hold on.

1155
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:20,010
Brian and I have conversations and
they're not nearly as frustrating to me as

1156
01:07:20,011 --> 01:07:22,890
they must be to you.
Ryan and I have conversations.

1157
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:24,990
I just sit on the outside
and call the fights,

1158
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:28,970
but Brian and I have
conversations where I go, that's,

1159
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,960
that's no last week. Last weekend. Why
don't guys just, just crescent kick,

1160
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,993
no crap.

1161
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,880
Well you haven't seen my crafts and
kick last weekend during the Mayweather

1162
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:42,900
fight. I have to look over Miu. Hey Bro,
do you mind just shutting the fuck up?

1163
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:47,250
I saw two rounds from me and he goes,
can I shut up bro?

1164
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,860
You need my, you need
my knees up one. Nothing

1165
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,540
for sure. I want to get a shirt
that says venom. So get a dove. Huh?

1166
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:58,190
How about venom has a tattoo. You do need?

1167
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,260
I have a problem.

1168
01:08:00,261 --> 01:08:03,500
The only problem that I have with Bella
toward the only problem is that there's

1169
01:08:03,501 --> 01:08:05,900
not crossfit's like what do you mean?

1170
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:11,150
Like you know how like if a Bob Arum
promoted fighter wants to fight a golden

1171
01:08:11,151 --> 01:08:14,590
boy promoted fighter, they figured
out a way to make it happen for pack.

1172
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:18,050
Y'All made it for Pacquiao,
Mayweather and arguably that might be May.

1173
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:22,220
Whether it doesn't want
to fight pack, pack. Yes.

1174
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,860
I want to find new about that. Want to
do the drug test? Oh, I dunno about that.

1175
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:32,210
I don't know. It might be true. I
mean total complete speculation.

1176
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,610
That also could be propaganda
from the May where the camp,

1177
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,120
I'm not inside enough to speculate.
However,

1178
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,000
what were you saying though about
matching? There's smoke, there's fire.

1179
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,910
So many people have said that pack,
y'all was doing something.

1180
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:47,480
When a guy moves up one weight
class, you go, well that's normal.

1181
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:52,250
The guys growing when a guy moves up
eight week classes and knocks bitches

1182
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,250
[inaudible] that's weird.
Hey,

1183
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,070
no speaking as a guy who's
actually done steroids,

1184
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:01,640
I would say maybe he's done some
steroids. I'd say maybe. I'm just saying,

1185
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,630
I'm just saying,

1186
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,190
I used to take this shit called Mag 10
that used to buy at Gnc at all this shit.

1187
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:09,320
I've done testosterone replacement.
All the Shit I've done.

1188
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,440
Mag 10 was the crazy shit ever. Couldn't
believe you could buy it. That's the shit

1189
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,510
they would take. Industry and Diane,
I don't know what this mag 10 was,

1190
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:25,250
but they made it illegal quick. But
I did a cycle with it. I grew tits.

1191
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,870
My Dick was as hard as hell.
Cat couldn't scratch it.

1192
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,070
It was unbelievable.

1193
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:36,071
I never had roid rage with anything that
I've ever done cause I'm pretty calm

1194
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:39,980
guy. But the closest I ever got
to Freud wages is on that stuff.

1195
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:44,720
You take 10 pills a day, you would
buy in a store, take 10 pills a day.

1196
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,670
And I was like,
how could I gained 10 day?

1197
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:52,690
I gain 10 pounds of muscle in six
weeks and I'm not know healthy.

1198
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,800
Well, here's how I know it's not
healthy. Cause when I stopped taking it,

1199
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:02,600
my Dick just went, hey, I'm
going to see my dick was like,

1200
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:07,580
they kicked the row it, I quit. My Dick
wasn't normal for a month and a half.

1201
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:11,820
Internet searches for bag 10 just went
through the fucking roof. I know, I know.

1202
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,050
Not Legal. You can't buy it anymore.
Okay, let me see if I can find it.

1203
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:18,410
If anybody finds mag seven,
it just makes you shit.

1204
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,960
You'll find that in the store.

1205
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:25,130
And that's the thing that I'll say
that I did steroids because I did this.

1206
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:29,060
I mean even though it's not like it's
not considered a steroid because he could

1207
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:33,770
buy it at GMC, GMC rather.
It's fucking steroids, man.

1208
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:38,300
Biotest mag 10 it doesn't exist anymore.

1209
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,320
You can't buy anymore more.
2001

1210
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:48,530
it's illegal now. Yeah, it was incredible.

1211
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,393
I can't,

1212
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,790
might've been the greatest thing
I've ever life. It's 10 lbs.

1213
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:03,170
Daily recommended dose. I did well the
daily recommended, just whatever it did.

1214
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:07,490
Turn your fucking monkey.
It was crazy. But uh,

1215
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,190
that was when the game plan is
for either one of these guys.

1216
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,830
I was recovering from an ACL,

1217
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,920
so I was taking it at
the same time was taking,

1218
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:20,230
I was really lifting really heavy because
I couldn't go everybody. Yeah. Yeah.

1219
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:22,050
All upper body,
lower body.

1220
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:25,890
For the first couple months all I
was doing was bodyweight squats.

1221
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:30,060
Just very light, trying to increase
my, um, my flexibility and all that.

1222
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:34,120
Tim means all over him. Man. I
like his nickname too. Dirty bird.

1223
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,820
Dirty bird. Dirty bird just
said sponsors. Nah, I'm good.

1224
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,360
You know what I like about magnet?

1225
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:43,980
Put my dirty brick logo on the
bag in the back of his legs.

1226
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,340
You know what I like about Beltour
Jimmy Smith, that motherfucker,

1227
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,510
great guy and fucking on
point as a commentator,

1228
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,740
he's very clear, very clear, knows
his shit. Black belt in Jujitsu.

1229
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:58,860
Damn means hitting him with a head, knees
to the head when he was on the ground.

1230
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:00,900
I don't want to graph what the fuck man.

1231
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:04,920
He definitely got one hand
was down one or two for sure.

1232
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,760
It's a tricky thing, man. I don't
like that knee to the ground thing,

1233
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,580
knee on the ground. You can
kind of sit there, right?

1234
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:16,050
You can job the system by touching your
hand and lifting it up and touching your

1235
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:19,260
hand and lifting it up. That doesn't
make sense for fighting to me. No.

1236
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,950
I think the knees to the,

1237
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,640
to the head for grounded opponent should
be legal and less a part of your body

1238
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:26,790
is touching the cage.
Why did they make that illegal?

1239
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:29,820
Because it's dangerous or this is
where I think it should be illegal.

1240
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:32,400
When a guy's got his head pressed
up against the cage ain't going.

1241
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,110
You can't go anywhere.
You can't move.

1242
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:38,250
That's why I like soccer kicks and
stomps and pride because you could always

1243
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:42,380
spin your head around and go under the
cage to avoid the technique. You know?

1244
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,233
You know why?

1245
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:47,430
I don't think they ever make that illegal
because a America is not ready for it.

1246
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,430
Teeth. They think this hotel
flying to violent as it is now.

1247
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,320
Then the terrorists
win the terrorist wing.

1248
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,400
You can't punch somebodies head like
a soccer ball, but why not? I mean,

1249
01:12:55,401 --> 01:12:58,300
I know Bob. It would
hurt. It would hurt to it.

1250
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,830
You would get some of that fancy
wine. Unwanted press. Yeah,

1251
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:04,620
but I don't believe in unwanted press.
I think it's bullshit.

1252
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:07,440
As long as you could debate it. Why?
Why should you be allowed to wheel?

1253
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:08,310
Kick your guy in the head.

1254
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:12,750
But I can soccer kick probably cause a
wheel kicks harder to get off. Mirko Cro,

1255
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:16,790
cop soccer, soccer kick.
Ron Waterman the face. Yes.

1256
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,300
Horrific.

1257
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,420
Little short about Ron Waterman chucked
me out with this titties when I was a

1258
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:24,960
white belt. Literally put my face between
his tits and choke me up. Come on,

1259
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:30,420
I'm conscious unconscious or you tapped
that but, but he almost broke my nose.

1260
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:31,980
He almost broke my,
he's a big fuck.

1261
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,570
And he was doing it for Jesus and
real set of tits on him though.

1262
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,700
And he was choking you for Jesus,
right? He shows me for Jesus.

1263
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,640
Did he give you a cross afterwards or
maybe a Bible? Give me a little pep talk.

1264
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:45,560
Slap on the ass. Give me a pep talk
after he bought me a sandwich. Pity.

1265
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:48,630
I'm super embarrassed. How many
shines goes. Don't worry brother.

1266
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,920
He did that to me before.

1267
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,040
Look at that sandwich to the KFC thing
that they're promoted that double down.

1268
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,740
I'm a big fan of that.
Hell No.

1269
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:58,530
I'm going to fast food home with
12 you don't need to have it.

1270
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,680
You know there's a place
in Montreal called Joe Beef
and they did a variation on

1271
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:07,950
a double down, ready for this
two chunks of fog. Voila.

1272
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:12,110
So time is of deep fried duck liver.
Yeah,

1273
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,770
in between Bacon and cheese.

1274
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,770
And it might be the best thing I've
ever had in my life. You know what?

1275
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:21,060
I wonder if I don't like
shitting my pants so I don't eat.

1276
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:26,080
I do not eat that stuff, bro. You want
to shit your pants? Okay. I don't,

1277
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:31,090
but [inaudible] good question.

1278
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:35,080
If anyone,
if you want to shit your pants,

1279
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:40,370
drink a shitload of
coconut oil. Okay, sure.

1280
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,560
Oh, I drink that shit every day. Not a
heavy dose. Heavy dose in the morning,

1281
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,110
I have to run back and I
said to the gym or cocky

1282
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,390
rocket shit out of my
asshole like Kale shakes.

1283
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,870
I drink a Kale shake in the morning.
Those that love me for me,

1284
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,220
it doesn't bother me, but it just, it's,

1285
01:14:58,221 --> 01:15:01,990
it's basically like
rude or down the drain.

1286
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:03,251
They say you're not supposed to.

1287
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:06,220
You're not supposed to
drink too many Kale shakes.

1288
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,620
Too many spinach shakes and
things because it actually,

1289
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:10,450
because it's a big leafy green vegetables.

1290
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:15,270
There's a lot of toxins in the lead
is not toxic. Wildcats, healthy Brian,

1291
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,540
you could use listen,
knucklehead. Listen, I ahead.

1292
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:22,360
You've got to stop saying shit like that
when you don't research it because you

1293
01:15:22,361 --> 01:15:25,210
can't. No, you haven't because you can
counteract all that stuff with calcium.

1294
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:28,840
Oxalic acid is the problem, but you can
counteract it with calcium. No, no, no.

1295
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,960
Here's what, here's what I'll say
about when you and your friends,

1296
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:38,170
when you eat,
when you eat a lot of meeting,

1297
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:41,360
a lot of raw leafy greens.
Here's, here's the,

1298
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:46,420
the issue with the problem is that a lot
of times leafy Greens because they have

1299
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:52,891
to keep insects and they
produce oxalic acid.

1300
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:56,830
He countered that with calcium. Just
go online, not just stocks, Chasse,

1301
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:59,170
fuck these other things.
Well,

1302
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:01,770
what are these other things where
they're all Tim means it's all over Neil

1303
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:06,550
magnate. That's, that's no close
fight. This is fucking great fight.

1304
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,800
Whatever things Brian come
toxins that keep, no, no, no, no,

1305
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:15,390
no, no other talks. You
know better than you.

1306
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,470
Green Leaf expert pro and googling
shit before. Talk about it.

1307
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:21,161
Okay.

1308
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:25,910
I have a very [inaudible]

1309
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,190
back guys. Go to their back. That's twice.

1310
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:35,191
We've seen that with Karrie Yasso dos
Santos and cane Sean Shelby people not

1311
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:39,340
even watching the fights guys fucking
ring side of the greatest fucking

1312
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:44,180
supporting of it. Look at
Bruce Buffer. He's sleeping,
sleeping. Sean Shelby people.

1313
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,440
Too many fights. You're never
going to see that for me, man.

1314
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,500
Never going to see that from me.
You, you see me ringside in a fight.

1315
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:53,230
You see me either glued to a
monitor or watch the fights.

1316
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:57,160
People always ask me that like,
you're bored. Fucking never. Never.

1317
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,320
When when those bells ring,
especially a fight like this,

1318
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:04,120
this is a great fucking fight back
and forth. For sure. Fuck yeah, man.

1319
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:07,230
It's a great fight.
Brian Coogler,

1320
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,360
people telling me that David Asprey,
Dave Asprey, and John Duran, Dave Aspery,

1321
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:17,930
you fuck you not even paying attention.
Dave Asprey offers solutions.

1322
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:23,110
He offered solutions. Calcium was one
of them. God Damn. Fuck I fucking,

1323
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,230
you hurt my feelings because I love
you. Whatever, dude, I love you but you.

1324
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:29,120
You give out shit tweets

1325
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,940
they fucking hate. They hate it
comes at me. I'm like, I love him.

1326
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:39,770
I ain't got you don't know him. He
tell you fuck whores. We're flawed.

1327
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,160
I am flawed too.
Everyone's flawed.

1328
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,580
You know I have a real problem with
people that only complained about people.

1329
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,700
You don't talk shit about themselves.
It really bothers me.

1330
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,420
Know there's a lot of that
with people who write blogs.

1331
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,350
I never talk shit about
anybody I said bore.

1332
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:58,250
You're just talking shit about vegetables.
I'm a preacher about spinach.

1333
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:01,260
I spent I juice every morning of fuck

1334
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:05,940
every morning. Yeah, I feel great.
You look very toxic feelings to Brent.

1335
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:07,000
It looks pretty healthy.
By the way,

1336
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,690
a healthy fucking animal is going to
be a sabbath. Looks pretty healthy.

1337
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:12,870
That'd be healthy. He's a fucking
UFC fighter. Got No choice. Really.

1338
01:18:12,871 --> 01:18:16,090
It's a professional comedian voice. I
don't have any convictions. Oh fuck.

1339
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:18,850
I don't fight for my kid. This
man can be the difference. And,

1340
01:18:18,851 --> 01:18:21,680
and look at me and starting to slow down.
Neil Mag,

1341
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:25,620
these main training partner named
Mark Cart. So is that right? Oh boy.

1342
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,450
Oh

1343
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:33,190
Wow. So close means fucking mouth loaded
out of it. These gates in his long legs,

1344
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:37,850
man. Good body triangle. Oh good.
Uh, but rather a bag. So when,

1345
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:40,690
when needed that switches to
mount, when Neal came off, uh,

1346
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:44,380
I think it was the ultimate fighter.
14 when chin, Carmen was the coach.

1347
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:48,970
He lived with Nate, Mark
Cart and his wife. They loved
having them around so much.

1348
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:52,420
He basically stayed there for a year and
became their babysitter. Is that right?

1349
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,110
True Story. Wow. Take some freaky
stuff was going on. I like to think,

1350
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:04,630
well, your information before you say
things like that, that's on Google.

1351
01:19:04,631 --> 01:19:07,170
Brian Magni.

1352
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:11,810
And he keeps trying to get that back
triangle but can't get it. Look at me.

1353
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:14,940
Man's controlling that alarm. Yup.
That's a big move. But get this,

1354
01:19:14,941 --> 01:19:18,300
he gives up the fucking mountain,
goes to butterfly half guard.

1355
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:25,410
Neil was trying to isolate that
arm in arm. Yeah. Get that arm.

1356
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:27,130
But it doesn't have the arm
in the right position. No.

1357
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,340
If you're going to isolate it,
you've got to go down and cross.

1358
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:31,080
It shows you can go to mountain.
Why is this doing?

1359
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,950
Why is he going to head and arm
the first place? So weird position.

1360
01:19:34,951 --> 01:19:39,060
He's holding Super Weird
homeboy get past the side.

1361
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:41,490
He's just taking a break, taking
a little break there. You know,

1362
01:19:41,491 --> 01:19:43,570
he's still in his half guard. He's
just taking a little break. Was there,

1363
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,670
but Neal's given him all sorts of space,
like oh space. When I was over the baby,

1364
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:53,360
I was over Hixon Gracie's house once
and we watched coliseum 2000 is a mixed

1365
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:58,590
martial arts event in Japan back in the
does a, when a Hixon fought who? Nakia.

1366
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:03,410
And uh, that was think Hickson's last
fight. And uh, was he talking to him?

1367
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,680
Look at him. I dunno, but Neil, one to
one I think. Where were you saying though,

1368
01:20:06,681 --> 01:20:08,670
Joe? But Hixon uh, was, uh,

1369
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:13,070
it's so amazing watching fights with Hixon
when he starts breaking out positions.

1370
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:16,920
He, yeah, he, he gets this
gusted when he sees space,

1371
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:22,000
when they see these guys,
they're shitty

1372
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:26,760
side controlled shitty mounts and he goes,
when I go to,

1373
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,690
when we start, we're neutral
position. Well if I go to one,

1374
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:33,930
we're not going back to wall zero.
We've started at zero.

1375
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,590
I moved to Juan and from one I go to,
I'm not going back to zero.

1376
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,090
I'm going to one and then two,
two and then checkmate.

1377
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:47,420
Yeah, he's made and then
they say this, I believe you.

1378
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:49,130
But by the way, maybe it has. No,

1379
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,860
I've never seen I does he ever
cracked jokes in his life?

1380
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:54,110
Is he dead serious all the
time? I don't know. I mean,

1381
01:20:54,111 --> 01:20:56,270
I'm sure if you're around
them and you know you,

1382
01:20:56,330 --> 01:21:00,370
you've fucking been strangled by him
sufficiently that he knows pretty cool.

1383
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,680
You understand your position.

1384
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:06,320
The mean he is Frank Grillo and my buddy
trained with him for a long time was on

1385
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:07,470
his competition teams.
Z,

1386
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:12,540
a green baret navy seal zipper that you
know that name ever guys serve combat

1387
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,490
riot police, little former
world champion. He Won.

1388
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,390
He won the world
championships and everything.

1389
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,950
Tell me about her friends cause they
make you a better person, but he said,

1390
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:26,784
he said

1391
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:31,990
that all your friends does to make you
a better person and you find that a frat

1392
01:21:31,991 --> 01:21:34,160
girl, it doesn't even exist.
He was in captain America.

1393
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:37,820
I played this one of the Jerky
boys. No, he's an American play.

1394
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,611
One of the Philippines.

1395
01:21:38,611 --> 01:21:41,450
I don't mean I didn't see it but then the
latest captain America had a big part.

1396
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:45,200
Okay. And he said that picks someone,
let you put him in and his purple belt,

1397
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:49,220
anybody put them in and literally like
a choke hold and count the 10 he'd be

1398
01:21:49,221 --> 01:21:49,371
like,

1399
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:53,060
I'm going to get out of this and ten nine
hey tell you what he was going to do.

1400
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,800
Black belts do that. Yeah, he would. He
tell you what he was going to do to you.

1401
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:57,500
I'm going to put you in an arm bar,
no matter what you do to it.

1402
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,960
He full back control with the hooks in
a rear naked choke locked in and you

1403
01:22:01,961 --> 01:22:06,580
would get out. It's ridiculous. It is
Neil getting the win, but it's not.

1404
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:10,900
If you let a white belt do
it to you. Yeah, I would let
a white paper that to me,

1405
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:15,820
I agree and hates Kale.
Yeah. Yo magnate. Nice big.

1406
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:22,060
That style, that style of, you know,
never committing 100% to everything.

1407
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:25,000
What's his name ran off.
Huh? He's not to me Brian.

1408
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:28,870
He just lost a really big fight.
A big fucking event.

1409
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,280
Where's on magnet train now he's at
grudge. Oh Colorado. You know what?

1410
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,030
You know he's not, he's not
at crutch. Head coaches.

1411
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:40,080
Lease for bowling and he's with a
date mark cart and Cody Donovan,

1412
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,610
those guys in Denver at
elevate. Ah, yes sir.

1413
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:47,400
Team elevate and they turn out that muscle
farm. Jim, that Jim's read Dick. Is it?

1414
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,710
Ah, state of the art. It's from
Kennedy was on the podcast here.

1415
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:54,310
They talking mad shit about muscle
farm products. I've never had them.

1416
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,540
I've never had it myself. I just know
the facility. I love six star products.

1417
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:02,990
I just know, I just know the
muscle farm. Jim Is Nice.

1418
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:06,130
Their products probably make
you shit your pants. I Dunno.

1419
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,523
I Dunno.

1420
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:19,190
I'm not a big fan of shitting my pants
bad. Depends what I'm spoiled with that.

1421
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,180
It depends on what I'm doing.

1422
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,190
I'm Sarah and I ain't got
nothing to put on a good movie.

1423
01:23:22,191 --> 01:23:27,110
Shit my pants by the way. Thanks
for animating that. That shit story.

1424
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:31,280
A video that Joe and I did you see
animated it. Oh Dude, you didn't get it.

1425
01:23:31,281 --> 01:23:34,010
Some Guy Online. Yeah, they animated.
It made it really funny too.

1426
01:23:34,011 --> 01:23:36,640
There's so many funny fucking people.
So great.

1427
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:39,680
Was your shit story about you running
around from away from the girl in the

1428
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,980
woods when we were talking about when
we were doing well, I was telling you,

1429
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:48,010
oh the one the shit story when we were
we shit shit on a stick to your story

1430
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:51,740
that no one's animated.
Someone hear my call.

1431
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:55,480
The story that you told about
running away from girl? Yeah.

1432
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,710
Brian was hiking with a girl
and he had a shit, his pants,

1433
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,010
so we made a game out of it. I ran into
the woods. She's like, what are you going,

1434
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:05,670
we are back. I'm trying to scare you. Oh,

1435
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:08,620
shouting out of my ass hole
shouting out of mass mass.

1436
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:13,640
It was literally by the end it was like
as I, and she came walking in, I was like,

1437
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:15,160
Ooh, look at the hawk. Ooh,

1438
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:20,560
make faces at her [inaudible]
here and has a beer,

1439
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:21,690
more tasks.

1440
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:24,110
You finally heard it cause I couldn't
get around and tie and she goes,

1441
01:24:24,111 --> 01:24:27,890
are you sick? I go, I
think so. She smelled it.

1442
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,810
I had to walk her through it
back through the minefield.

1443
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,950
We had to turn back around my floor,
asshole,

1444
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,970
all chasing dirty.

1445
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:38,450
You know if a girl can deal with
that, if you can say, hey listen,

1446
01:24:38,451 --> 01:24:40,760
I don't want to lie to you,
but I got fucking crazy diarrhea.

1447
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,490
It was like a first day and guess what?
She couldn't deal with it.

1448
01:24:43,491 --> 01:24:47,870
In fact it's are a year later. She ran
out of the fucking door, but that's good.

1449
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,310
That's good.
You got off light.

1450
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,300
What would you do if you on a date
with a chick and she said she has bad

1451
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:56,480
diarrhea. I said, it's, look, we're
human. It's all good. I would,

1452
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,180
that's what I would say. Well,
yes. Are you tad fucker anyway?

1453
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,010
Well you definitely fucker anyway,

1454
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:06,020
but even I probably wouldn't fuck her
right then and let her wash up. Diarrhea,

1455
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,600
diarrhea doesn't really get my dick hard.

1456
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:11,870
That's the thing is I wouldn't judge her
but some people would get upset at you

1457
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,640
and that's like just a weakness thing.

1458
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:17,840
They would sense weakness in you but they
probably sense weakness in you because

1459
01:25:17,841 --> 01:25:20,240
you tried to hide it. Whereas the
guy like me would say, hey listen,

1460
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:24,680
I got fucking diarrhea so we deal
with this or not. It's all good.

1461
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:26,210
I can understand if you hate me now,

1462
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,520
but I'm going to go shit
behind this trip I was in,

1463
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:32,960
I was in an acting class and
this huck, the guy goes, hey,

1464
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,760
I got to say this before
because this is on,

1465
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:38,360
I fucking hate this nas
commercial and I'm done.

1466
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,000
You can't keep showing
this God damn thing.

1467
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:44,330
What was the guy throws all these wild
kicks and the other guy comes out and

1468
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:47,510
punches him in the face and
then drink some caffeine. Yeah.

1469
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,150
Punched him in the face and then eat.

1470
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,720
And then these are folk who cool,

1471
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:57,240
calm and collected caffeine
because I was knocked out.

1472
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:02,410
I totally need to be stimulated
because I just knocked the guy out. No,

1473
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,870
because I wa

1474
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:07,910
I was once on a like really super early
in dating this girl and I got food

1475
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:08,301
poisoning,

1476
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:13,060
were sleeping in the same hotel
room together when we met him.

1477
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:16,520
We met in Greece. So I drink a
bunch of Ouzo and pass the fuck out.

1478
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:20,810
I like terrible food
poisoning. Quick work. Yeah.

1479
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,550
Cause I thought maybe it
helped the food poisoning.

1480
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:27,270
He could call up like a fucking
baby. Woke up, woke up here.

1481
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:32,110
Oh my God. And I was like, wow,
what? I was like, no, no, no, no.

1482
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:36,510
And she just jumps out at
[inaudible] and a huge,

1483
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:42,720
that's a huge issue
you have to throw away.

1484
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:46,270
That's not what's important.
What's important is what happened.

1485
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:48,370
Tours with the girl.
It was a lot of laughter.

1486
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,940
And anytime I tried to be like
romantic and we'd be having a wine,

1487
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,370
she just looked at me and just
crack the fuck off. I'm like,

1488
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,390
how is he says I shit myself. Right? And
you're like, oh, your friends are the

1489
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,350
best for you. Look at this fucking
pregame. This girl's tits are popping out.

1490
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,320
She's with a black guy or on TV.

1491
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:12,290
I'm upset that your voice gets very high.

1492
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:16,610
I get angry that she's hot as fuck.
That's ridiculous. Have you had,

1493
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:20,770
have you ever had a girl blow up your
bathroom? Oh yeah. Oh, I deal breaker.

1494
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,510
I have lose my number. No,
you blow up my bathroom ever.

1495
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,110
You and I are different now.
I had a problem. I was fight
of the night right here.

1496
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:30,480
Oh yeah. Cooking, uh,

1497
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,840
Derek Cruickshank and Eric Cooks
Superstore about to fight right now.

1498
01:27:34,841 --> 01:27:38,440
New Breed and Detroit superstar
about to throw down great

1499
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:45,580
coke, Duke Group, Phis trained fighter.
And so his Cruickshank, by the way,

1500
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,710
when I was at Duke's camp, um, I was,

1501
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:52,120
I was trained at Duke's place when I
was in Minneapolis and Cruickshank was

1502
01:27:52,121 --> 01:27:55,390
there and coke is one of his boys.
So this is kind of interesting.

1503
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:58,960
I didn't know that. Brendan, you have a
tough, this isn't crazy. I gotta just say,

1504
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:03,820
please don't say something stupid.
[inaudible] job. You got a bottle opener.

1505
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:05,960
I'm nervous as shit when,

1506
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:09,610
when you see that little thing pop up at
the bottom says you have to see one 74.

1507
01:28:09,611 --> 01:28:12,850
I was like this.
What makes you scared?

1508
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:18,160
I'm scared. It's just nervous. I can
see it. So you have to think about it.

1509
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:22,900
Do you try to avoid thinking about fights
is much as possible before you do them?

1510
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:27,910
Um, that's a good question.
By the time I get home,

1511
01:28:27,911 --> 01:28:31,390
I'm still exhausted. I really
don't think about it. I'll wake up.

1512
01:28:31,391 --> 01:28:34,780
Sometimes I'll sleep like shit thing
about our Lawsky, stuff like that. But

1513
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:39,310
I'm just so exhausted
by the time I get home.

1514
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,090
I'm really just know I would never compare
myself to anything that you've done.

1515
01:28:43,091 --> 01:28:46,690
But I did some competing when I was
younger and one of the things that I found

1516
01:28:46,691 --> 01:28:50,020
was I won the US Open
when I was 19 years old.

1517
01:28:50,021 --> 01:28:52,900
And one of the reasons I think that I
want it is cause I didn't think I was

1518
01:28:52,901 --> 01:28:57,901
fighting and it was because I had fought
the week before and I had injured my

1519
01:28:58,391 --> 01:29:01,770
hamstring on my groin rather.
And uh,

1520
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,440
the, the tournament was the
week after that and I was like,

1521
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:08,280
well I'm not going to find him. I'm,
I'm hurt this thing I need to heal up.

1522
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:12,450
And then I woke up the morning of the
fights and I had a bunch of donuts

1523
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:18,450
and then I had some coffee cause
I used to have a paper route.

1524
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:21,840
It's always to make money. When I was
fighting, I said, get up in the morning,

1525
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,140
I'd get up at 5:00 AM and I would
deliver papers from five to seven.

1526
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:27,660
Then they go back to
sleep. Wow. And so, uh, I,

1527
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:32,700
I had these fucking Dunkin donuts donuts
with powdered sugar and lemon filling

1528
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:35,461
and a,

1529
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:39,900
and I had some Boston cream donuts and
I was cooking for you lit up with sugar.

1530
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:44,310
And I was like, I'm fucking
fighting. So I got in my car,

1531
01:29:44,311 --> 01:29:48,660
I went home, packed my bag and I w I,
I not only did I not think about it,

1532
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,450
I told myself I wasn't fighting.
Right.

1533
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:56,540
So for a week I was relaxed as fuck
and I did no training whatsoever.

1534
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:58,980
I mean, I might have
liked, did some stretching.

1535
01:29:58,981 --> 01:30:01,740
I would definitely worked out in the pool
because that's what I would do when I

1536
01:30:01,741 --> 01:30:04,890
wasn't fighting. If I was
injured, I tore my, uh,

1537
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:09,650
Sartorius muscle besides my ACL is one
of the biggest injuries I ever had was a

1538
01:30:09,651 --> 01:30:13,020
bit, it's a hell of a sartorial,
connects your hip to your quadricep.

1539
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:16,290
It's a pretty big muscle. And it was
a pretty bad in terms like a dinosaur.

1540
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,070
It was a for a few months,
I couldn't throw any kicks.
It all, it was pretty bad.

1541
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,930
But, um, so besides that, this I'd
hurt myself. So I said, you know what,

1542
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:26,040
let me just take some time off.

1543
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:29,970
I did a little swimming and this and
that and the day of I decided, fuck it,

1544
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:33,550
I'm fighting.
But I fought so good because I had slept.

1545
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:38,520
I slept good. I relaxed I the
whole week, I wasn't nervous.

1546
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,510
I was Z.

1547
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:43,200
I had zero nerves the whole week because
I was convinced that I wasn't fighting.

1548
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:47,700
So it was just a sugar rush,
a split decision. And it
was one of them. I did work,

1549
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:51,180
but as a taekwondo fighter,
it was one of my biggest victories.

1550
01:30:51,181 --> 01:30:53,250
Winning the US Open.
It was like a big phone.

1551
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:56,100
I've also heard from some athletes
when you're a little bit injured too,

1552
01:30:56,101 --> 01:30:59,400
it kind of takes some of the pressure
off of you for your own performance.

1553
01:30:59,401 --> 01:31:03,300
You're like, well, I'm injured anyway.
You just relax. You don't have a train.

1554
01:31:03,301 --> 01:31:05,070
Like I think Bernard
Hopkins will you telling me,

1555
01:31:05,071 --> 01:31:07,440
Bernard Hopkins says that
it said something like,

1556
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:11,550
why would I train most of these guys?
Overtrain he doesn't even train them.

1557
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:14,970
Well now as he's older and Larry Holmes
said the same thing, he realized,

1558
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:17,920
why am I training an hour and a
half for a 30 minute fight? True.

1559
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,990
And that just comes with
experience and about Roger Federer.

1560
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,790
The top tennis players do not
practice more than two hours a day.

1561
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,570
It sounds really surprised. Hours
a day is a long, it's a long time.

1562
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,220
We were just talking about
some bad motherfucking sport.

1563
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:35,550
Nobody's playing in Chins off your
head. Play four or five hours, bro.

1564
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,850
I don't give a fuck if
you need to learn tennis.

1565
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:45,770
Rob Talking about [inaudible]
for two hours. Here's the,

1566
01:31:45,771 --> 01:31:46,920
here's the best today.

1567
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:53,590
Take it guy who weighs about the same
that I do and who runs an ultra marathon.

1568
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:54,960
He runs a hundred miles,
right?

1569
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:59,190
Give him a month off and I'll fucking
strangle him. He doesn't have a chance,

1570
01:31:59,620 --> 01:31:59,980
is no

1571
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,370
chance. You know why? Because it's not
a marathon. If you lock up with me,

1572
01:32:03,371 --> 01:32:06,010
you don't know what you're doing. I'm
going to choke the shit out of you. See,

1573
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:09,400
a marathon is nonsense. You just
running. No one's kicking you.

1574
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:12,380
No one's throwing rocks at you.
There's no niggers historic,

1575
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,460
difficult ignorance in this room.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1576
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:25,830
I will make you
give me some volume to drown out.

1577
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:28,570
You see my fucking wheel kick?
I'm going to flip out right now.

1578
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:33,830
[inaudible] whoa.

1579
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:35,810
He's the underdog.
Huge underdog.

1580
01:32:37,070 --> 01:32:41,120
Plus the 55 is what does that mean? What
does, how do they come to that number?

1581
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,630
Put $100 on him, right?
You know what I'm saying?

1582
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:46,780
He's basically a three to
100 almost four and a half.

1583
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:50,920
That is fucking interesting.
That's an interesting fucking who dog.

1584
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:53,890
Who makes those yards.
They what experts are doing that?

1585
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,880
Who is doing someone sets an
initial line cause a bedding. Whoa.

1586
01:32:57,881 --> 01:33:02,320
He's minus four 50 sees a heavier fabric.
Look at that Tattoo.

1587
01:33:02,321 --> 01:33:04,870
Of course he's mine is four 50
what is that? It's terrifying.

1588
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,330
I think it's a Jrr Tolkien or something.
Who knows?

1589
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:11,950
It's probably his favorite
author. Hello, Gary Cohn.

1590
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,930
Gary Copeland is as wide as he as tall
and he's not very tall. He's fantastic.

1591
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,410
He is fantastic about Chrissy. How
she's good girl. By the way, Brian,

1592
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:22,000
if you ever want to put
you said she's a good girl.

1593
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:27,660
You played tennis gentlemen in the room
and make you make you quit or table

1594
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,600
tennis is an athlete. I felt this
back. He's got to valley for a back.

1595
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:35,710
I appreciate it. Let's see.
Cruickshank and oh gosh,

1596
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:39,760
a tag coke with right hand double
valley tuto shorts, cooked, shine.

1597
01:33:39,761 --> 01:33:43,630
Coming off of that victory is very,
very hyped dude.

1598
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:47,890
The way he mixes things up is insane. You
just can't train for it, but the kicks,

1599
01:33:47,891 --> 01:33:50,530
the angles. His hands are low, dude.

1600
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:52,960
He's trying to make him
pay with every kick.

1601
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,690
That's what you gotta do with the kicker,
man. If you're a coke going to Barbara,

1602
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:00,970
a chart who gets the
girl? Well, the shop does

1603
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:04,210
his fight versus he's too small.

1604
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:08,500
The giant is my first as Mike Rock.

1605
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:14,410
When you see a girl like shop, you just
got to get her away and he's on fire.

1606
01:34:14,411 --> 01:34:18,880
I've got to run. It's true
cancer. It's fucking, it's Ariel.

1607
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:20,950
I disappear when I'm standing next to him.
I disappeared.

1608
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,080
I looked like a cup of coffee.
I could be a candle.

1609
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:26,160
It doesn't matter when you might just
go girls, Brian is aids. I'm like,

1610
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:31,440
I look like I do. He wouldn't get
tests. I'm all gone by the way.

1611
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:35,590
Definitely the last guy on earth that
gets tested. Definitely not like Bro.

1612
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:40,210
It's not meant to feel fine. Whatever.
I just say he fights, I play tennis,

1613
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:42,360
whatever else.
He has his Duke in and out with the A's.

1614
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:46,150
He's happy to just be a battle.
Just a huge cock block.

1615
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:49,810
His body is a battleground
with a big kick to the body.

1616
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:55,210
You know it's interesting. Like I said,
because when I was at Rufus Sport,

1617
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,860
Cruickshank was trained
there when they had the UFC

1618
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,840
in Milwaukee. That fucking southpaw
stance, it's always tricky.

1619
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:06,450
South paws are tricky man.
They are tricky, but they're
opened up for right hand.

1620
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:10,070
Right,
but they also start to deal with,

1621
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,050
they're used to it more
than you are correct.

1622
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,240
Unless you train on a regular basis.
They're really good. South paw,

1623
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,910
south falls are tough, man.
Metro was a south pole.

1624
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:22,430
It's tough to find a high
level South Pole guy. Oh, nice.

1625
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:26,120
Little snappy, snappy, right.
Jab is a motherfucker man.

1626
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,170
Straight rights or how
you beat a South Pole.

1627
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,710
But Cruickshank I was so impressed
with him in that Mike Rio Fight.

1628
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:38,360
And I know Mike Rio is primarily a
grappler. So, uh, the difference between,

1629
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:41,630
Ooh, nice inside leg kick. I like
how he set it up with the punches.

1630
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:46,080
He's got the boat, got crazy
explosion this fast. Good Job Ryan.

1631
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:51,370
Cause I liked it.
I like to come that myself,

1632
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:54,460
I keep myself going because obviously
I'm surrounded by enemies in his fucking

1633
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,200
surrounded by people would not
appreciate tennis except for Aubrey.

1634
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,460
Aubrey gentlemen. Oh God,
thank God you're here.

1635
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:06,860
God,
you're here fighting a bunch of parents.

1636
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:13,230
Oh right hand by Cruickshank. God Damn.
Tell you what, whoever made these odds,

1637
01:36:13,231 --> 01:36:17,790
men are way off. They need to educate
themselves. I get confused sometimes.

1638
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:22,330
It's some of the odds. I mean, Adri
has made a killing allegedly by,

1639
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,560
I was a betting man by, uh, some of
the things that I sometimes, you know,

1640
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:28,890
he'll come to fights and I'll go,
whatever you do better

1641
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:32,340
fucking hell.
He's

1642
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:39,060
out Bro. I don't know. Yes, I do
know. He's just taking punishment.

1643
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,960
Oh, he's hanging in there. Gary is
close to stopping this fight. That's it.

1644
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:47,370
Oh shoot.
Oh

1645
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:52,470
shoot. Victory. And I would
told, watch this setup.

1646
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,890
Those odds are off.
Those odds are off.

1647
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,860
I text my brother right before we got in
and he said, he said he should. I bet on,

1648
01:36:58,861 --> 01:37:01,320
I said, Detroit superstar.
That's a big victory.

1649
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,680
Who the fuck made him a three and a half
to one underdog and a four and a half

1650
01:37:04,681 --> 01:37:08,700
to one favorite for coke. Some fuck. Who's
used to doing an NFL and NBA was like,

1651
01:37:08,701 --> 01:37:12,150
Oh yeah, I'll do GFC this week. Some guy
who doesn't train. That's all that is.

1652
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,000
That's a guy who doesn't train.
Look at this head kick. Watch this.

1653
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:17,690
Oh,
and by the way,

1654
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:21,320
Brian caught him with the
foot towards Sam writing.

1655
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:22,970
Did you and I know the difference.

1656
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,360
You and I know that Gary stopped the fight
because he got tired of being so low.

1657
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:28,970
How about the others who's squatting?
He gassed out and he's like,

1658
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:29,960
I gotta stop this fight.

1659
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:35,040
[inaudible] that's that stick legged man.

1660
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:40,130
I would have stopped that fight. I gotta
be honest with you. You wouldn't have no,

1661
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:44,330
no. It wasn't enough. I mean he was
definitely in trouble. But look,

1662
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:46,670
when Crookshanks on top of him,

1663
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:49,910
he's dropping these shots and every
time she goes shopping these shots,

1664
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:54,920
he's grabbing him. Coke is trying to get
up. I mean, he's definitely tagging them,

1665
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:58,320
but I don't think I would have stopped
that fight because I like to see a guy

1666
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:00,330
survived that kind of shit and come back.

1667
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,280
And I know that sometimes when guys burn
themselves out trying to finish a fight,

1668
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:08,100
it can like they could gas
and just got ourselves here.

1669
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,760
Stole your can do a back flip on
a trampoline on the trampoline.

1670
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:16,600
I can't even do it on a tramp fucking,
I can't either. I can have a problem.

1671
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:17,850
We could have.
I took the time.

1672
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,380
I did gymnastics forever cause I used
to hang out with GSP all the time.

1673
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:25,530
He did gymnasts. Those I want to be
like him. So I started doing gymnastics,

1674
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:29,820
then he went back to Montreal bottling
it. Worst body for gymnasts. Not really.

1675
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,280
You got really good.
Sorry. I got really good.

1676
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:35,940
And then as he's trying to criticize you,
he's so tall.

1677
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:39,830
Shut down your body for fucking you.

1678
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,120
You wouldn't get
sensitive about your body.

1679
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,570
That body for gymnastics,
by the way.

1680
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:52,140
I'm six five, two 50 I'm not
really. Yeah, you do. Well,

1681
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:55,920
but the one objective kept doing it and
then I was getting really tired from it

1682
01:38:55,921 --> 01:38:58,770
and he's like hurting my knees.
I was like, what the fuck am I?

1683
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:00,410
What am I doing gymnastics right now?

1684
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:05,550
If you tell your needs covered and
there's 10 year olds everywhere doing way

1685
01:39:05,681 --> 01:39:08,250
cooler shit than me, 13 pounds.
And I was like, you know what?

1686
01:39:08,251 --> 01:39:10,710
I should probably be in the gym rolling.
I'm at the fuck out of there.

1687
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:13,320
I've never been back. Good
for you. That's very smart.

1688
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:16,410
[inaudible] no one ever want to
fight by doing backflips. No,

1689
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:20,030
it's the only reason I went so I
could do a backflip. I'd be Brian,

1690
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,000
do you think this, this fight is a
fucking interesting fight, right?

1691
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:24,480
It's a couple of interesting
fights in this card.

1692
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,810
The me a Dan Henderson
is very interesting,

1693
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:32,970
but the thing about me and Henderson
is like, Henderson is off the TRT now.

1694
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,930
Trts been banned. They shut that shit.
There's a couple of guys who were like,

1695
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,780
Ah Shit.
He Tour Vito.

1696
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:44,220
I put out a statement and
I feel I'm a beast without
TRT. The Holy Spirit. Really?

1697
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:49,270
Yeah. He said the Holy Spirit tweeted
that out. I'm a beast without TRT crutch.

1698
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:53,610
All Ladies and gentlemen, you
just got a new superstar. UFC,

1699
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,900
the Detroit superstar. That's
a big, huge women. Huge wing.

1700
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:01,110
Eric Coco said, fight for the title.
Remember that he was supposed to.

1701
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:05,490
Although for the title,
that's a big God.

1702
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:09,480
I hate seen guys lose.
Well I do,

1703
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:12,720
but I like seeing guys win at the same
time and one of them has to happen for

1704
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:16,500
the other to happen and I'm a big
fan of Cruickshank get to really,

1705
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:21,360
I'm a really big fan. All right, let's
come back. This guy takes a lot of heat.

1706
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,590
Jon.
Anik,

1707
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:27,300
he takes a lot of fucking shit online
cause he's on because he's a fucking

1708
01:40:27,301 --> 01:40:28,134
commentator.

1709
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:33,830
Take Shit was you don't I take Lenny
just doesn't bother me with Joe has what?

1710
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:41,370
Six G Gilly and followers on Twitter
you can take some hits. You take kids.

1711
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:46,230
It's just, Oh look at that
head kick Crookshanks on him.

1712
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:50,910
But see this is my point and I'm
not saying it wasn't bad stoppage.

1713
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:54,040
I'm just saying if I was standing
over him, I'm fighting through

1714
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,161
it.

1715
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:58,630
A let him fight a little bit more because
I don't think that any of these shots

1716
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,720
are putting them away. He's
not flat lining. I agree.

1717
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:05,740
His head is off the mat and he's
trying to make him the route away.

1718
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,800
He's trying to figure out a way
to get out of that scenario.

1719
01:41:08,801 --> 01:41:13,690
But when the guys on top of you and a
guys blown is wildlife that swarming as a

1720
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:16,210
guy who's experienced a lot of fights,

1721
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:19,870
I think that you got to let a god try
to fight out of the bottom position

1722
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:21,320
listener. Yay. Yes,

1723
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:27,820
because the guy's head, he never
laid back. There's his dad.

1724
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:30,950
I mean it was dad's karate instructor.
What did he have kids?

1725
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,180
It might be wheat belly dance.

1726
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:38,460
It might be we found that
the inventor across food.

1727
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:46,030
No, he ate better of cross. That's insane.

1728
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,520
Do you think did he pulls down
outside and go dad, come on.

1729
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:52,080
We're going to go walk in
today is walking dead. Oh,

1730
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:57,081
earlier must be a good
teammate versus bedroom wall.

1731
01:41:57,461 --> 01:42:01,300
I did not see this fight, so it must be
an exciting, can I spoil it for everyone?

1732
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,810
No,
please don't tell Dan.

1733
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:08,830
I was working out of a gym at
the House by the way, gentlemen.

1734
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:13,540
And unless you have a cage while I
was uh, yeah, I keep lines in it.

1735
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,430
I like to keep mine. I like to
work out why? Watching fights.

1736
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:19,573
It makes me scared.

1737
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,920
What was that Mafia guy who would bring
you down to the basement to see the lion

1738
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,710
if you want to vote with you?
I think it was, um, fuck.

1739
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:28,570
Do you know you can you follow the stone?

1740
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,510
There was a mafia guy who had it kept up.

1741
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:34,660
They kept Elian downstairs and uh,

1742
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,480
and the informant was talking to you
as well. If they, we had a problem,

1743
01:42:37,481 --> 01:42:39,370
we take them down and see the lion,
that's all it was.

1744
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:43,310
All we needed for the guy to comply and
they just had this huge male lion down.

1745
01:42:43,311 --> 01:42:46,440
I would imagine that's the last
way you'd want to die. Well,

1746
01:42:46,441 --> 01:42:50,650
the Uday and Qusay whatever who
say, yeah, some, a lot about scenes.

1747
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:54,370
Kids used to feed sweet
up dogs to rottweilers.

1748
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:57,220
They was not feed the dogs for days.

1749
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:59,170
And then they would
throw people to the dogs,

1750
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,760
including like women that they raped. They
would rape women on their wedding day.

1751
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,910
They would find them on their wedding day,
steal them away from their,

1752
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,630
their groom,
raped them,

1753
01:43:07,631 --> 01:43:11,950
and then feed them to dog William Wallace
when that shit was at biggest assholes

1754
01:43:11,951 --> 01:43:16,630
on the planet. The biggest assets
complete. Total. There's a hell.

1755
01:43:16,631 --> 01:43:20,670
I hope they're just fucking
emails,

1756
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,100
shit heads for the rest of time.
I hope the little kids step on them.

1757
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:27,650
They come back as snail. Just keep coming
back to stay. I was going to step down.

1758
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:33,520
We get run over by cars. Splott they live,
but they're in agony for like 20 hours.

1759
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:34,450
Just snails.

1760
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:39,600
[inaudible] snails come back
as another snail. Crows,

1761
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:43,160
snails on the salt flat. STOMP, stomp.

1762
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:47,980
Impressive beard by this man. Only
impressive because he bothered to grow.

1763
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:51,320
At this point in time.
I'm a little tired of those beards.

1764
01:43:51,321 --> 01:43:55,460
I gotta be honest with you. It's getting
a little old, right? Everyone's doing it.

1765
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,210
Yeah. That's what it says. The
guy who can just sign that.

1766
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:02,000
You need a little bit of attention.
I can grow one. I would agree.

1767
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:06,810
I think it's a sidebar. My Beer. Do you
know and look at how fucking don't know.

1768
01:44:06,811 --> 01:44:10,570
If you have a big Dick, you don't have
a rich dark as to my beard. I do have.

1769
01:44:10,571 --> 01:44:12,440
You have a big Dick. You
need. Don't need a big beard,

1770
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,620
but if you have a big Dick and
a big beard, it's like, Whoa,

1771
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:19,340
I didn't see that common.
You look like a monster with a tail.

1772
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:24,590
You have a big Dick and a big beard.
Multifaceted mother fucker.

1773
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:28,970
Do you write your own poetry?
What's your Twitter account like?

1774
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:31,820
A lot of retweets.
If you got a huge beard,

1775
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:36,040
do you trim your pubic Bush or did you
just let it go? Wild pans on the couch.

1776
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,060
Hey,
usually if you're going to bid like that,

1777
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:40,250
you kind of don't give a shit
and you have that seventies Bush.

1778
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:44,300
I take it all down guys. Just say
it now. I got a number three razor.

1779
01:44:44,301 --> 01:44:48,770
I take it down and keep it tight. A
chick who didn't like it if like, oh,

1780
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,550

I think my legs are gun tower on
his back. Turned upside down. No,

1792
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,880
I haven't been there for over
a year. I know. I'm confused.

1793
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:44,010
I can't wait for Vancouver. Oh, we're
going to have a good time. Ah Dude.

1798
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:05,600
Confirm what I love about [inaudible]
22nd and 23rd at the comedy works in

1799
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:09,920
Denver. Joe Rogan would probably
open for me for what I want.

1800
01:46:09,921 --> 01:46:14,510
Our special asked me. Let me know. I'll do
it. Alright, I'm done. I'll be happy to.

1801
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:17,390
I love you. I'd be happy to
introduce you. I want you to do that.

1802
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:21,620
Let me know if I get the week off. I'm
fucking in there. I know my brother,

1803
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:25,520
my favorite and my favorite thing is
listening to you laugh in the audience

1804
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:26,870
while I'm doing my standup.

1805
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:31,871
Well we work together in DC at the Improv
so fucking hear you cackling the whole

1806
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:32,924
it was the fun.

1807
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,440
That's like when your friend is that
you end up just doing stand up for your

1808
01:46:36,441 --> 01:46:39,920
friend. I think that's a artimus
prime or whatever the fuck it is.

1809
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:44,750
One of the Bandanna which are
those things called transformers.

1810
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:49,260
Transformers back. You know Marky Mark's
and then you transformer movie. Yeah.

1811
01:46:49,261 --> 01:46:50,070
I can't wait.
Who

1812
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,370
told him to be in that moment?
It's like someone,

1813
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,720
someone offering you John Oliver.
I know I need a manager.

1814
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:06,360
You want to be in the transformer
unless you want to fuck Megan Fox.

1815
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:09,520
I would say no cheating. You want to
be in a trailer right next to her? No,

1816
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:14,490
and our trailers butted up next to
each other and less mine is open.

1817
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:19,500
Take the hinges off mine
transfuser doors together.

1818
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:24,600
I want to know if she's showering.
Do you need a towel? A towel?

1819
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:26,580
She's not even in those
movies. Right? They got,

1820
01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:29,070
they know she had a
problem with a director.

1821
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,520
She is in though the new teenage
mutant Ninja turtle movie. Yeah.

1822
01:47:32,521 --> 01:47:35,010
I was actually on exactly
what I want as a kid.

1823
01:47:35,011 --> 01:47:37,680
I love teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.
Let's make them realistic.

1824
01:47:37,681 --> 01:47:41,790
Said no one we met. Was she in that
movie? Fuck. Was she in the movie?

1825
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:45,540
Is that the same guy who directed it was
the guy has a problem with the gay guys?

1826
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:49,200
No, it's not. That's the other guy.
Michael Bay did t nine sings turtles.

1827
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,990
The Brian Singer's the ones
having a problem with gay
guys coming out and saying

1828
01:47:51,991 --> 01:47:52,820
that he fucked him.

1829
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:56,790
I got a message for all your little twinks
that fuck Bryan singer and now you're

1830
01:47:56,791 --> 01:48:00,270
running. You Yap. Listen,
you knew the fucking deal.

1831
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:04,410
When you get into a pool and there's 500
other twinks in there and you're all on

1832
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:09,120
ecstasy, shut the fuck up. Exactly.
Okay. The guy who hooked you up,

1833
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:10,980
he brought you to the party.

1834
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:14,130
He didn't have to bridge straight
guy who fucked here. Take it easy.

1835
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:17,370
There's not a shortage of decent
ass straight. Oh, sorry. Sorry.

1836
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,370
There's a shortage of twinks.
Okay.

1837
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:25,020
Settle the a great tweak is a
great gain out of that. Using it.

1838
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:28,230
Would I be a twink in that gate? Well,
I'm too old. No, you're definitely not.

1839
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:33,200
What's a twink? You're a guy buys
twinks. Yes. You might be in,

1840
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:35,730
you might be, there's like different
words. You know there's a good bear,

1841
01:48:35,731 --> 01:48:37,920
but there's like otters
and there's a whole ladder.

1842
01:48:37,921 --> 01:48:42,480
It's like a horse bear forest of animals.
What am I, why do all I know is big?

1843
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:45,810
Because you are a barrel road, but
you're not here. No, not here enough. Oh.

1844
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:51,140
Tweakers the tweakers like a
little, a twin. A pink, like
a soft as smooth, like a,

1845
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:55,860
like a feminine boy.
I might be an honor.

1846
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:59,550
I got my daughter likes bears though.

1847
01:48:59,551 --> 01:49:01,890
I think when I'm working with,
I'm going to

1848
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:06,540
take your shirt off with smite.
We might be a muscle otter then.

1849
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,550
I'm technically a muscle water.

1850
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,540
It's a definition when the ATO
look at that muscle water. No,

1851
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:14,850
Brian's a chicken head in the gay
community. Are you kidding me?

1852
01:49:14,851 --> 01:49:18,360
Look at the fucking, what does it, is
that a four pack almost can see your abs

1853
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:22,350
was right oil though.
Dude

1854
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:26,410
died for beat 50 40 look good.
Grow

1855
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:32,850
with the numbers man. You and Donald
Sterling just doing the damn thing.

1856
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:36,121
I'll tell you,

1857
01:49:36,121 --> 01:49:39,030
there's a lot of people that saw Donald
Sterling with that chick and they

1858
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:44,460
ignored the racism and what there's hope.
So by the way,

1859
01:49:44,461 --> 01:49:48,120
81 year old guy can fuck that. 20
something year old. Check there.

1860
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:52,030
So if I, if I get, what's his name?

1861
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:54,790
He's got a banana and played pro.
Forget about all that.

1862
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:58,870
Look at Adam Sandler and doing another
movie with Drew Barrymore and expecting

1863
01:49:58,871 --> 01:50:02,080
someone to watch that. You know what
you know who watches those involved?

1864
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:07,920
Those bullshit movies Guy
Madison content stuff.

1865
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:12,520
Yeah.
So I watched that content stuff.

1866
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:16,120
When you prepare for a fight in June
in general, cause my job so intense.

1867
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:21,340
Like last night I went saw that movie.

1873
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:48,650
Yeah, true. Oh my God.
Seth Rogan and neighbors.

1874
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:52,480
I give that movie on the entertainment
of four out of five. You know what?

1875
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:55,660
Winning awards. You don't
go there to learn something.
Just go to be entertained.

1876
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,200
I love how James Franco Dodge
that 18 year old bullet.

1877
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:03,040
I love the way you said
Franco, Franco, Franco,

1878
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,280
James Franco. He was uh, he was trying
to bank some 17 year old. Was He?

1879
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:12,350
He was great. He didn't bangers that
was pretty like shooting the shit

1880
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,630

Yeah. That fucking cunt.

1881
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:20,870
She should be boycotted for
life by the way. But him, um,

1882
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:24,070
what he did was pretty
creepy. What happened? He was,

1883
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:27,820
he was a on Instagram with some chick.
She was 17 he was like,

1884

1885
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:32,950
and she like printed all,

1886
01:51:32,951 --> 01:51:37,620
took all the tweets that he sent her
or whatever it was and a chats. Yeah.

1887
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:42,100
There's something creepy about that and
mean we know chick 17 and you're fucking

1888
01:51:42,101 --> 01:51:46,950
James Franco that the deal is you're
supposed to back off and go stone.

1889
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:48,820
Are you supposed to say,
okay,

1890
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:53,300
it's not like I'm in the desert and
you're going to have to fuck my kids and,

1891
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:58,290
and eat my neighbors Rolodex
of 50 pot bitches who over,

1892
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,800
you got to try something different.

1893
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:03,490
The problem is there's some
dudes that are innocent.

1894
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,570
They have a real thing with teenage angst.
There has to be a better way to,

1895
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:10,480
and [inaudible] has been through
two divorces with a sex swing.

1896
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:14,680
Scott's on her breath. Yeah. Like an
older chick with cigarettes in her purse.

1897
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:19,840
It's disappointment chick who's gets a
text from a guy who goes to fuck you and

1898
01:52:19,841 --> 01:52:24,700
then throws the phone in the
toilet and kind of bad skin.

1899
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:28,540
I don't like, like all that. Will you
like a girl who is in love with you?

1900
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,830
Whatever. Joe. I don't
want to talk to them.

1901
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:36,160
You don't like a girl who sees Brendan
Schaub and it's like I can get that guy

1902
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:40,920
you like a girl who knows she can't get
Brennan Shab Cause Brennan Shabazz bow

1903
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:45,230
busy with something superior.
I like a little broken.

1904
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,000
I like a broken

1905
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,530
way. Always have. And you used
to always be like, why are
you with that? I was like,

1906
01:52:49,531 --> 01:52:52,820
oh, like it shut up little broken. I'd be
like, come on, whatever. I look her like,

1907
01:52:52,821 --> 01:52:55,670
what are you doing? I Dunno,
I don't, I'm drawn to it, man.

1908
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,990
I like a little refused to want
them to fall in love with you too,

1909
01:52:58,991 --> 01:53:02,440
which is always odd to me. But that I
just like making a connection. Yeah,

1910
01:53:02,441 --> 01:53:06,400
but you want a guy, it was really
hard to tell what was going on.

1911
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:10,890
We both know what's happening here.
Right, right. And they're like, yeah,

1912
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:16,120
no you weren't that guy. You we have
a connection. Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.

1913
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,780
I fall in love in the moment.

1914
01:53:19,781 --> 01:53:23,290
There's no question the same way as I
don't know if you fall in love. Well,

1915
01:53:23,291 --> 01:53:24,250
I don't know if you fall in love,

1916
01:53:24,251 --> 01:53:28,120
I think you want them to fall in love
so that you can feel good about it.

1917
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:34,010
When you guys, when you asked
her, you knew she was the
one when he met her. Well,

1918
01:53:34,011 --> 01:53:37,270
she get pregnant. There's some
game. Listen, here's the reality.

1919
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:42,100
There is no perfect
person, not me, not you,

1920
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:45,820
not anyone. And it's when you
enter into a relationship,

1921
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:50,710
it's really all a matter of
where are you in your life?

1922
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:52,420
Where, what? What are you deciding?

1923
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:57,190
What decisions do you make as far
as like how you proceed and when,

1924
01:53:57,191 --> 01:53:59,200
and I've had friends that
are like, you know, hey man,

1925
01:53:59,201 --> 01:54:01,120
I'm thinking about getting
married. I'm like, stop.

1926
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:05,370
Stop what you're doing right now and
understand what you're doing because a

1927
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:08,680
marriage, all it is is a
legal contract with the state.

1928
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:11,380
That means you're going to have
kids and you want to have kids.

1929
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,870
Marriage is all good,
but I didn't get married until I had kids.

1930
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:15,430
And on that smooth,
I'm going to take it.

1931
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:17,720
I'm going to have a pickle
break right now. Go much.

1932
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:22,520
Why am I going if I want to connect
to grab, grab hold on. Pickle.

1933
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:25,570
Yes. It's that close man. And
just so everybody understands,

1934
01:54:25,571 --> 01:54:26,800
there's nothing wrong
with getting married.

1935
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:28,750
There's nothing wrong with having
kids. Nothing wrong, all those things.

1936
01:54:28,751 --> 01:54:31,840
But it tends to be the right time
and know the right person to,

1937
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:35,800
it's gotta be the right fucking,
it's gotta be the right scenarios.

1938
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:41,040
Pickles, pickles, pickles up.
So when we play in tennis,

1939
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:45,270
Brian, I'd love to hear that for
real. Are you around tomorrow?

1940
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:50,260
We're gonna do it tomorrow. Tomorrow.
How about Monday? Possibly. All right.

1941
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:55,140
Yeah. Do you play a lot? But
I love it. Yup. Yeah. I'm
obsessed with tennis. Right up.

1942
01:54:55,230 --> 01:54:58,650
I boxing and tennis now.
I don't know.

1943
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:03,870
Pretty different. Hey Bro, could
you please get tougher bro?

1944
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:08,910
I you do something. Did you eat
beef jerky or something like this?

1945
01:55:08,911 --> 01:55:11,160
And I am tough. I mean, not really,

1946
01:55:11,161 --> 01:55:15,420
but if like if one of the
toughest comedians and not bad,

1947
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:20,370
I'll go for the top thousand. Here's what
I, you're not tough. But if he, if he,

1948
01:55:20,371 --> 01:55:22,080
if my friends in a fight,
I'm going to, I'm not,

1949
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:24,210
I'm not going to stand around and I'm,
I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna help you out.

1950
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,500
These are mustard pickles.
I've never had these pickles.

1951
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,990
Grillo's pickles company
sends me these pickles.

1952
01:55:30,991 --> 01:55:34,500
They're fresh pickles from Boston
and they're fucking amazing.

1953
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,910
But I'm pretty excited about,

1954
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:39,510
I'm going to pick on a grid so
that you can get in on that.

1955
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,960
Everybody could get it on that. I've
got that on. He goes through, everybody

1956
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:49,070
is going to sound like,
Oh, here we'll sat.

1957
01:55:49,071 --> 01:55:51,640
So my buddy is fucking blew up ma'am.

1958
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,220
Beers too.
I bought some Sam Adams.

1959
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:00,980
Oh,
uh,

1960
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:03,690
the perfect storm to
shit your pants again.

1961
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:07,770
Pickled mustard pickles and a shitload
of battle gallon. Bulletproof coffee.

1962
01:56:07,771 --> 01:56:12,750
I've had, I've never
had this before. Yeah,

1963
01:56:12,751 --> 01:56:16,830
it is good.
It's unusual garlic here or by what?

1964
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,760
People aren't complaining on Twitter
because I'm eating your own microphone.

1965
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:25,170
Go Fuck your mother.
I have to say,

1966
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:29,780
you go fuck your mother.
Ah.

1967
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:35,010
And you're like, Ooh, can porn cause
so because I heard your children,

1968
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:36,690
fuck you

1969
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:41,550
podcasts.
All kinds of people.

1970
01:56:41,551 --> 01:56:44,280
Just went out to go get pickles
right from this here in the crunch.

1971
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:45,893
Grillo's pickles

1972
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:51,130
and a lot of you like, what's
so good about pickles? Pickles,

1973
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,850
who there's the James Franco
thing. Huh? Let me see.

1974
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:54,890
Did they have a picture of this girl?

1975
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:58,970
He's got a movie coming out. This,
uh, the trailer came out the same day.

1976
01:56:58,971 --> 01:57:03,170
That story broke. That's not a hoax
hoax that I'm rolling for teenage girls.

1977
01:57:03,171 --> 01:57:03,981
His movie is,

1978
01:57:03,981 --> 01:57:08,060
he plays a coach that gets involved with
one of his players who's at 17 year old

1979
01:57:08,061 --> 01:57:08,894
world PR move

1980
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:13,380
average. Guess what? None of us knew that.
Now we think he's just a psycho. Yeah.

1981
01:57:13,970 --> 01:57:16,290
I don't know about that, but I'm
looking at this Godzilla commercial.

1982
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:20,110
My Dick hard as a rock. Right.
Very excited about what,

1983
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:25,050
you know, what not excited about it, man.
That's cause United doing tense shit.

1984
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:26,161
See me,

1985
01:57:26,161 --> 01:57:31,110
I'm not worried about fighting Andrea
Orlowski because I don't have to.

1986
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:35,910
So, um, I'm watching Godzilla and
I'm getting fucking pumped. Yup.

1987
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:39,170
The other guy till it was
some bullshit with machinery.

1988
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:41,460
I've got Joel commercial or
Ronda Rousey right after it.

1989
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,330
Uh, for me. I'll take it

1990
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:48,820
Zilla I wouldn't say Rhonda because
Godzilla was definitely going to kick your

1991
01:57:48,821 --> 01:57:52,030
ass and you know it going in so fuck it.
Oh well try again.

1992
01:57:52,031 --> 01:57:55,570
And the next incarnation, Rhonda, you
feel like you might have a chance.

1993
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:56,650
That's what fucks.

1994
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:59,570
I don't think I have a chance
and I'm under no illusion.

1995
01:57:59,571 --> 01:58:03,320
She choked me out on Instagram.
Guys. Follow me on Instagram.

1996
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:06,130
[inaudible] funny thing
that you do on Instagram.

1997
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:09,310
You do have a really interesting
thing that you're doing what you do.

1998
01:58:09,311 --> 01:58:13,090
The splash on the devil. That's
fucking hilarious. Really funny man.

1999
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,540
It's really original to ma'am. Good.
I'm going to do, I've got more to come.

2000
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:19,930
Well I fucking hope so at least.
Ah,

2001
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,320
Brian's doing this thing where he has a
cell phone on one side and the iPad on

2002
01:58:23,321 --> 01:58:27,940
the other c has two things talking
to him at the same time. That is me.

2003
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:30,720
I always have a you doing that
when you're on the road? Yes.

2004
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:35,980
And isn't one like hey fuck guys. Like
wait, what? Yeah, the guy. I was like,

2005
01:58:35,981 --> 01:58:39,290
fuck yeah. Keeps me. Yeah.
You have to watch it. Well,

2006
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:42,040
this is a broad who was in the broad,
this is

2007
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,930
the girl who's in love with Wayne Newton.

2008
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,960
Here comes here comes who still
knew and we knew their guys excited.

2009
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:54,580
Whether that, wait, how does
he not know? Buzzes girlfriend?

2010
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:57,550
He doesn't know for the same
reason why bodybuilders don't know.

2011
01:58:57,551 --> 01:58:59,950
They look ridiculous or
anorexics don't know. The liquid

2012
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:05,530
gets a fucking, did they run out
of people to sponsor the UFC?

2013
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:09,280
Did they not have a guy in the office?
Does quality control?

2014
01:59:09,281 --> 01:59:12,430
It goes enough with the fucking
spinning. Na's guy, bro. Real quick.

2015
01:59:12,431 --> 01:59:15,070
Let's talk about bodybuilding.
I think there'd be a game sport.

2016
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:21,100
It's guys suck for competitions.
I actually went, I had a
friend who's competing.

2017
01:59:21,101 --> 01:59:24,610
This girl competing in one of those. I
went to the first time ever guys on guys,

2018
01:59:24,611 --> 01:59:28,350
right guys? It was the craziest,
scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.

2019
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:33,820
Wait a minute. Racks on racks, on racks.
Guys. Philip, who's Polish muscularity,

2020
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:36,640
he's Rasta. Philip, do
you know it's interesting.

2021
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:39,670
Casa Philip who left ray long goes camp,
you know,

2022
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:44,380
because he's 185 pounds, most likely
Weidman's one 85 they might have to fight.

2023
01:59:44,381 --> 01:59:48,680
I don't know what all the drama was.
Do you, do you know anything? Um,

2024
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,880
but since then he's is not
looked as good as last.

2025
01:59:51,881 --> 01:59:55,930
His last two against Luke
Rockhold and Francis Karma. I uh,

2026
01:59:55,931 --> 02:00:00,640
on my last fight with [inaudible] UFC
one 65, me and him shared a locker room.

2027
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:01,780
I'm not making this up.

2028
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:07,320
This guy did maybe half a jumping jack
and went out and fought no warmup.

2029
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:12,520
Zero. Look at, I'm not a sweat out sweat.
He does not warm up. He didn't hit Mitts,

2030
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:16,420
he didn't do anything. He did kind of this
half ass jumping. Jack goes, let's roll.

2031
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,900
And here I am sweating my ass
off in the back, getting ready.

2032
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:24,370
Look at this fight because
he's fighting Lorens Larkin.

2033
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:29,390
And my take on this is that Larkin is
like a really multifaceted striker.

2034
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:34,060
It goes a lot of kit, very
tricky, very tricky. But Phillip,

2035
02:00:34,061 --> 02:00:38,260
who is almost exclusively a boxer,
he's like a sprawl boxer type care.

2036
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:40,240
And he's been getting
taken down a lot lately.

2037
02:00:40,241 --> 02:00:43,210
That's how he's been losing his fights.
What Carmona really kind of tricked him.

2038
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:46,240
I don't think he ever saw that coming.
I think he's on the call it up though,

2039
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:48,020
because Karma is GSP.

2040
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:52,000
GSP is running double the differences.
Phillip,

2041
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:54,950
who has crazy knockout pyre?
Larkin's really not known.

2042
02:00:54,951 --> 02:00:57,720
Does he though does fill up
whoever you crazy knockout mouse.

2043
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:00,990
Who is he knocked out? Who's the
last guy who knocked out though? Uh,

2044
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:05,350
just see his fight with Jared Haman.
Oh Man. Talk about brain damage.

2045
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:09,790
Really not fun to watch.
These are my new favorite pickles.

2046
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:13,360
I can't get enough of these pickles. I
don't feel good. I'm a little lightheaded,

2047
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:16,330
but I'm eating the shit out. These big
goals. It might be the bulletproof coffee.

2048
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:18,830
There's no,
she's pickles with the fucking,

2049
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:22,510
it's the perfect storm to shit your pants.
30 seconds people.

2050
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:26,770
I blocked five guys who complained
about me chewing pickles. By the way,

2051
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:30,130
are we allowed to ask?
I know you guys don't make predictions,

2052
02:01:30,131 --> 02:01:33,960
but if you had to put your money on
the silver Brown fight, can I get,

2053
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:38,380
can I get a call? Which fine.
On the seventh round main event.

2054
02:01:38,381 --> 02:01:42,170
The main want to wait for the main
event? Yeah. No, I like Matt Brown.

2055
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:46,160
I don't like the fact that Eric Silver
is a big, uh, a big, he's two to one.

2056
02:01:46,161 --> 02:01:51,140
Who makes these odds. Crazy eyes. Fuck.
Do we do it? Math four fights in a row.

2057
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,160
All knockouts.

2058
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:57,260
Eric Silva's one one seven
fights in a row as it is. It? No,

2059
02:01:57,270 --> 02:02:01,940
it's four for whatever it is. Um,
I'm always impressed with him.

2060
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,750
You might, you might be right on seven.
Maybe it's four knockouts in a row.

2061
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:09,530
I'm not unimpressed with Eric Silver.
I think Eric's Silva's a fucking,

2062
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:11,420
I think Matt Brown spot tougher guys.

2063
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:14,790
But don young good knocked
him out and that makes me, uh,

2064
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:19,790
not that don young calves out and animal.
He is here at one, two, three, four,

2065
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:23,270
five, six, seven, six in a row. Fulfill,

2066
02:02:23,271 --> 02:02:26,150
fulfill the 44 knockouts
in a row, right? Yeah.

2067
02:02:26,151 --> 02:02:29,410
His last loss was so proud of
him and a good team. Either way.

2068
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:34,430
Oh, you just got tagged Phillip.
Who's tired of losing man?

2069
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,420
He was ranked, what? Six at one
point he was up there. He's a beast.

2070
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:43,640
He's so strong. His leg would imagine
he is strong. His legs are insane.

2071
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:46,790
Look at his calves. They ain't giving
those muscles way in a cracker jack box.

2072
02:02:46,791 --> 02:02:49,750
You know what I'm saying, folks? You know
what I'm saying? Not that'd be me as a,

2073
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:54,350
as a, as a the kids creek,
he's got to go tease balls.

2074
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:57,890
Good leg kicked by Larkin in there and
Larkin used to fight two oh five right?

2075
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,470
Yeah. Do you don't lock in
as a win over Robbie Lawler?

2076
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:04,760
Do you know that and striking? You look
good. Oh good. In that Robbie Lawler, man,

2077
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:07,350
he's really clean as far as
like as tech and you know what?

2078
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:10,910
In Strikeforce he was a, he was
a killer. I think the UFC was,

2079
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:15,980
I don't see a big jump, but
it's different. Strikeforce
and UFC or different. He's,

2080
02:03:15,981 --> 02:03:20,040
he's stumbled a little bit in the UFC
so far are conceives a very can be,

2081
02:03:20,041 --> 02:03:21,430
just hasn't gotten current combos.

2082
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:28,860
The haircuts freaking me out kid and play
kind of thing going on in the eighties

2083
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:35,990
back stop. What about vittores? Vittores
haircut. I'm a fan. I am too. I like,

2084
02:03:35,991 --> 02:03:38,730
I like them in cornrows and I let
them in and we were see towards

2085
02:03:40,450 --> 02:03:45,380
white face and make it what
beautiful woman. Yeah, yeah,

2086
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:49,880
yeah. He's, he's a named mark
cart to train with him. His
wife came and I was like,

2087
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:50,730
he's a fucking,

2088
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:54,980
you don't spit it back if I can stare
at it or I will eat a spinning back kick

2089
02:03:54,981 --> 02:03:58,400
to the face and, and uh, ooze classic.

2090
02:03:58,401 --> 02:04:03,080
He's getting hot chick dual Larkin and
the truck hit Costa Philip who are thrown.

2091
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:08,090
He's got beautiful kids, right? They look
like x men. All of them. Yup. Beautiful.

2092
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:11,690
Both of these guys have their
back up against the wall.
Oh, big kicked by. Largan.

2093
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,810
See that's a different gene.
Larkin is the kicking techniques.

2094
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:18,500
I mean Philip who threw a kick but missed,
but Larkin is real clean boots.

2095
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:21,050
Going to counter when these kicks
with a big right hand who maybe,

2096
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:28,130
it's funny how it's used a
little more active than this.

2097
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:33,280
These Kickstarter started like they
start changing like what becomes a trend

2098
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:37,560
now? Everybody is throwing those oblique
kick copied copycat league. Tony Man.

2099
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:41,060
Yeah that front kick Anderson does now
everyone does it. Everyone does it.

2100
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,680
We'll kicks everyone wheel kicks.
That's a cool thing.

2101
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:47,970
Superman Punch was the thing like a
denim jacket. Oh about two months ago.

2102
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:52,600
I'm wondering waiting for body shots. Look
body punches to be like God, that's it.

2103
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:56,250
No you're fighting a high level
striker that he's gone to the body.

2104
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,900
If he's comfortable gone
the body by Philip boot.

2105
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:03,870
Oh it's coming back right counter
one of those kicks. Hey who am I?

2106
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,330
We got ourselves a fight here.

2107
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:10,460
I want to say that you took it
out of her own. We tagged them.

2108
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,780
Taking the wind out of my
sails wasn't gentleman.

2109
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:17,310
These guys are sweating where his cost
of Phillies guys strong cause you still

2110
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:20,220
training on Long Island? Yeah, he's
still on the east coast. I know that.

2111
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:22,640
And his managers.
Lex Mcmahon.

2112
02:05:22,641 --> 02:05:25,320
One of the best in the business
that Catherine plants her. Um,

2113
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:32,350
is there anybody that would ever fight
with an implant? You imagined dudes.

2114
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:38,610
That's the number one. Number one
implant for guys, his calves. I'm weird.

2115
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:43,410
You think they'd have a Dick Implant
by now? They do. How do you know?

2116
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,130
I don't want to talk about it in Africa.
They so rocks in there sometimes. Yeah.

2117
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:52,930
Say what you fucking with me
and the entire continent. Oh,

2118
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,450
lucky. Went Down Phil Pool.
Huge win for holy Shit.

2119
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:03,240
Yeah. Some tribes. I don't know why. I
have another picked on that Dude Phillip,

2120
02:06:03,310 --> 02:06:08,250
who he's got, he is jacked. He
is sweat and Brian, he's jacked.

2121
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:13,380
Wow. That was a big women. Here's, here's
my felt. This got some muscle lost.

2122
02:06:13,381 --> 02:06:16,710
His last two man, he needed that one
had to do or die and not, not only that,

2123
02:06:16,711 --> 02:06:18,390
I think you might've been
the first guy to ever stop.

2124
02:06:18,391 --> 02:06:22,110
Lorens Larkin is tracked for us or the
UFC. Look at him. He's fucking wobbled,

2125
02:06:22,111 --> 02:06:26,100
ma'am. A lot of power, right? Remember I
said a lot of power. You're talking shit.

2126
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:31,310
Boom, boom. Oh, clean, bright, happy.

2127
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:34,350
She's got short. That right hand is
he hit his head up. Folks at home,

2128
02:06:34,770 --> 02:06:37,230
when you watch how short
he threw that punch,

2129
02:06:37,231 --> 02:06:39,840
let's call it the tower
that's called power is power.

2130
02:06:39,841 --> 02:06:43,620
It's technique because he didn't wind up
and pull it way back before he launched

2131
02:06:43,621 --> 02:06:46,050
it. And that's why it
landed in the first place.

2132
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:50,610
And so people got understand
donk. Oh, beautiful box.

2133
02:06:50,611 --> 02:06:54,780
And that was a beautiful right hand.
There's,

2134
02:06:54,781 --> 02:06:58,050
you're knocked out hard left hook.

2135
02:06:58,290 --> 02:07:02,670
And here's a right hand cod donk.
Dot.

2136
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:07,260
Dunkel oh, look at that. Lumped
it curd underneath his ear.

2137
02:07:07,290 --> 02:07:11,040
What is that? That's not even a
bone. So you know how Joe Silva,

2138
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:14,070
you'll see him in the ring
when he congratulates guys,
what did he say to you?

2139
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:17,690
Well, if he's unhappy with their fight, he
doesn't come in the ring. Even if, right.

2140
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:20,280
If he's happy comes in and says like,
great job.

2141
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:23,730
Has He ever seen on the
weird to you something like,
you're my idol. I was like,

2142
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:27,890
come on. That's true. Really
never. How you doing Bryan County?

2143
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:33,030
Just a liar. He's your cock is big
as I hope my Lavar Johnson fight.

2144
02:07:33,031 --> 02:07:36,040
When I just kept taking them down, beat
were booing me. I was like, Yo, where's

2145
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,300
Joe Head? I won my fight when the bank,

2146
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:42,670
you just walked right pass and I was like,
yeah,

2147
02:07:42,671 --> 02:07:44,950
but that's what you gotta do when
you're fighting Lavard Johnson.

2148
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:49,390
That guy's ridiculous. What I want on the
scale and I'm like, I turned my coaches,

2149
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:53,110
I think he's on steroids and was like,
Nah, you're the same size. I was like,

2150
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:56,140
I look like him. Like yeah.
I'm like, Oh fuck. Yeah.

2151
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:01,940
I was in the hotel, the
hotel taking selfies. I

2152
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:08,050
asked him to chicks and then after
the fight my coach can, good Lord,

2153
02:08:08,051 --> 02:08:12,450
that guy was way bigger and
way. Fuck man. He's like,

2154
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:16,570
we just want to say that so you weren't
so scared and he tested positive for

2155
02:08:16,571 --> 02:08:19,660
steroids.
Steroids is fucking hilarious.

2156
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:24,640
You wear a panty behind live t
by 15 seconds behind live TV,

2157
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:27,730
which was asked for that. I got in
the clinch with him. I was like,

2158
02:08:27,731 --> 02:08:31,180
this is not snowflake. This is not stuff
like, oh, the Internet is behind by,

2159
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:34,900
he was just ridiculous.
A strong, so folks,

2160
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:37,600
if you're watching this and you're like,
you're behind,

2161
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:42,460
it's because of the Internet.
So back you fucking Tivo up by 15 seconds.

2162
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:46,000
And by the way, if you don't have
Tivo, go fuck your mother. All right.

2163
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:50,050
Fuck your mother. Fucking people have
to walk. I was at a friend's house.

2164
02:08:50,051 --> 02:08:54,460
They don't even have a DVR.
I'm like, why not use candles?

2165
02:08:56,140 --> 02:09:01,090
Why not live in the guy told me, how much
do we a message by pigeon. Alright, yeah,

2166
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:05,670
send it over to stand with a good
friend and a, you know, their family.

2167
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:08,740
My family friends and I saw that they had,
uh,

2168
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:12,700
they had the channel where glory was on
the head spike. I was like, oh perfect.

2169
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,180
I'll just watch it on the DVR. I'm
like, Whoa, what is this? Where's your,

2170
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:20,410
where's your fucking Dvr? I'll try
to pause their TV. I can't pause it.

2171
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:25,600
What the fuck is happening?
What am I living in a different time?

2172
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:31,690
Do you guys have steam powered machines?
Philip was interviewing himself.

2173
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:37,780
That's not true. They don't look
anything alike, but the joke they do

2174
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:45,180
chose may do. What does his shirt,
there were tea with a backwards torque.

2175
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:49,800
Dawn do it. What? Whoever made that shirt
stop was going to say it doesn't stop.

2176
02:09:49,801 --> 02:09:54,630
Kind of confusing. If you want to get
your name out there just like that.

2177
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:58,870
With this going to confuse the fuck
out of people. I'm confused right now.

2178
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:03,100
Costa Philip, who's a good
guy, man, I'm, I'm happy for
him. He too went into, listen,

2179
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:06,790
I've lost two in a row.
That third fight is so stressful.

2180
02:10:06,791 --> 02:10:09,160
It's not even funny because guess what?

2181
02:10:09,161 --> 02:10:12,700
You lose you going back
to fricking dancing,

2182
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,560
shaking your ass for guys white and a man.

2183
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:23,890
You're back at Starbucks.
My balls so sweat. You lose.

2184
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:28,240
If you had a high level and you lose two
in a row and you're getting paid decent,

2185
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:31,270
that third one, you better win.
Otherwise you're getting your pink slip.

2186
02:10:31,810 --> 02:10:32,920
He was under a lot of pressure.

2187
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:35,660
Is that like a hard rule or
is that just kind of informal?

2188
02:10:38,230 --> 02:10:41,840
Depends on the guy. It depends
what you're getting paid. Yeah.

2189
02:10:41,841 --> 02:10:44,150
That's a weird thing.
If you have like a good contract,

2190
02:10:44,151 --> 02:10:46,910
like there's certain guys that come in
and they're like highly touted and they

2191
02:10:46,911 --> 02:10:50,500
lose a couple of fights in a row, 400
g's and you lose two in a row. UFC,

2192
02:10:50,530 --> 02:10:54,290
he's like, Huh, what are we
doing? But if they're fun fights,

2193
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:57,860
if it's an exciting fighting,
you're fighting top level guys. Oh,

2194
02:10:57,861 --> 02:11:00,540
look at that fucking right hand.
That's beautiful. Tell you why.

2195
02:11:00,541 --> 02:11:03,560
Losing two fights that third fight,
most stressful fight of my career.

2196
02:11:03,870 --> 02:11:07,970
I've been in the UFC a long time.
Quite a while. Beautiful combination.

2197
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:11,160
That left hook right hand
that's short right hand.

2198
02:11:11,161 --> 02:11:13,600
Why I told you he's a fucking
knock our arms, Bro. That's right.

2199
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:18,980
I said what happened to flight in the
kid podcasts available centered on Fox.

2200
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:21,530
Oh,

2201
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:26,300
they must have listened to me
telling them you're going to leave

2202
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:32,360
the fucking offering you guys to come
over to hire primate.com for free.

2203
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:36,560
We've got Travis Barker right on
Wednesday. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

2204
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:42,170
Yeah, he is. He knows a lot about
finding. Yeah. Seems like a good dude too.

2205
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:45,740
You know what, man, if he's one of the
nicest people I've ever met, he's so nice.

2206
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:46,940
You know when you meet someone,
the show nights,

2207
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:49,730
you think they want something from you?
Like, what do you want me to see my Dick?

2208
02:11:49,731 --> 02:11:52,850
Or something like, what do you,
what do you want to ride in my call?

2209
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:56,600
Whether that's your first option.
You must want to see my Dick. Well,

2210
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:01,880
why is he so friendly? Nice. Yeah. Cool
man. Just start taking my clothes off.

2211
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:06,740
I don't know what's going on, right?
I guess this is what you want.

2212
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:10,820
Oh, I'm not used to it.
When he was on pump two,

2213
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,000
he was on punked with
Ahmed Ahmed. Ahmed. Ahmed.

2214
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:17,360
Ahmed was talking crazy shit to him in
a restaurant and he was like, come on.

2215
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:20,210
What the fuck it, let's go
outside. He likes, he's a rockstar.

2216
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:22,910
He's ready to drag someone
outside of fight with them, Bro.

2217
02:12:22,911 --> 02:12:27,830
That dude's cardio is insane. Really.
Jim, he does like 12 rounds in a row.

2218
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:29,780
Just submits,
moving insane

2219
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:35,990
drums to do the best drummer in the world.

2220
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:39,770
Drums are a lot of cardio,
man. Hey, hey, hey bro.

2221
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,620
Calm down about the best
drummer in the world, but,

2222
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:45,590
but I understand who's the best
drama for sure. For sure. Calm down.

2223
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:51,800
Don't know, cause I'm not a drummer
expert, but I imagine fucking Neil Perch.

2224
02:12:51,801 --> 02:12:56,660
Got Something to say. Who's Neil?
Perts drama for rush. Holy Shit.

2225
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:03,890
It's fucking pot. Yeah. 85 and has a
grape nuts. Hang down on the drums.

2226
02:13:03,891 --> 02:13:08,810
Hey Bro, guys, Neil Peart is
probably the, I tell you what,

2227
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:13,670
Google best drummers.
I just did best drummer in the world.

2228
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:18,840
Okay, Neil Peart according
to you. Fuck you Jay,

2229
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:21,380
Bro.
Fuck guest.

2230
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:25,140
You don't get to say
James, James, James, James.

2231
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:29,300
There's a lot of people that
believe in different things.

2232
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:32,450
The sparker is definitely one
of the best of all time. Uh,

2233
02:13:32,530 --> 02:13:34,920
you're out of your
fucking mind. Okay. Brian,

2234
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:37,770
what's your p's and q's to understand
that you're out of your mind and I've had

2235
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:42,810
to take you serious and Neil
Peart from rush is on this.

2236
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:46,330
What I just looked up, John Bonham
from led Zeppelin is number two.

2237
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:50,580
I am writing Chad Smith, red
hot chili peppers. Number three.

2238
02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:53,100
Why?
You know when they say still alive,

2239
02:13:53,101 --> 02:13:56,850
it's like is I'll lead the greatest
boxers still alive because I'm pretty sure

2240
02:13:56,851 --> 02:14:01,750
that Vladimir Klitschko would fuck him
up right now. Ryan would fuck them.

2241
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:04,290
Point well put. Well put. Yeah.

2242
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:09,320
I mean there's a current drummers
Travis brown still look at and we'll get

2243
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:15,120
[inaudible] fucking drum set. I think
of that. Any more questions Brendan?

2244
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:18,240
Shop but doesn't know anything
about drumming. Travis Barker.

2245
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:23,130
I take drum lessons. Brian, you're 57
you don't know when they have to is.

2246
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:25,170
You have no idea. I've never
heard of that. That band,

2247
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:26,760
Travis Barker can drive upside down.

2248
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:29,550
I'm pretty sure Travis
parks a bad motherfucker.

2249
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:35,070
I will slap you right and I talked
back. Collins is in here. Joey Jordan.

2250
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:38,700
A lot of people think who is he from?
Do we have from young?

2251
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:42,540
From a slipknot Korn.
Okay.

2252
02:14:42,541 --> 02:14:47,150
Rob Zombie is another one that folks
consider to be number one. Yeah,

2253
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:52,020
whatever. I believe the guy from the
Allman brothers, Gregg Allman, who is it?

2254
02:14:52,021 --> 02:14:52,960
Who played the drums,

2255
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:58,150
I believe notes might be the best in oats,
which,

2256
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:03,360
oh, by the way, I'll tell you who's
a better looking guy than there.

2257
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:08,390
Then a big brown Brendan shop and
that would be Mr. Silva Silva fear.

2258
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:14,070
He's got his throwing fucking
waiver throwing for a hair.

2259
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:15,570
I am looking forward to this fight.

2260
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,480
The only thing that I can hope is that
this fight goes five fucking rounds.

2261
02:15:18,481 --> 02:15:21,680
Got Beautiful Hair. Really? I
wanna see I wanna I don't wanna.

2262
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:25,420
I don't want it to be a quick one.
One because they can't get enough pick.

2263
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:28,170
If I was a betting man, I would
have bet on the over on this fight.

2264
02:15:28,171 --> 02:15:31,410
I'm just saying I just can't hold.
The three arrows were one and a half.

2265
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:35,790
I can't believe that all of is the for
one and a half minus one 50 people.

2266
02:15:35,791 --> 02:15:40,620
If you're out doing,
if it goes over to go over one and a half.

2267
02:15:40,621 --> 02:15:42,300
Yeah,
that's how much you get for that.

2268
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:45,300
It was minus one 50 so you have to
give away a little bit, but it's still,

2269
02:15:45,301 --> 02:15:46,450
I think there's a pretty good chance.

2270
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:50,430
I would tell you to bet the
fucking farm on that man. Brendan,

2271
02:15:50,431 --> 02:15:55,320
did you train with the Michael
Bisbing? Yes. Recently. On a Tuesday.

2272
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:58,410
How's his eye? Good. Okay.

2273
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:02,930
Your Voice was too active to hire folks
at home and not going to get into.

2274
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:06,330
That was a weird pause cause he went good.

2275
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:12,900
It seemed good. He team, we were sparring.
He's going hard with a heavy weight.

2276
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:16,230
I tell you what, it was our warmup
round. He came at me like a banshee.

2277
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:21,600
Are we show video here, chairman? By
the way, here's the trivia questions.

2278
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:26,550
What is a banshee? But don't look
it up yet. What's it been a banshee?

2279
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:30,940
Uh, let's a band shit like,
gosh, it's an avenging spirit.

2280
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:34,540
Not Bad. What's it Bangy.
It's a, a very upset spirit.

2281
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:38,800
Fucking liar.
Some shit that screams that doesn't fancy.

2282
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:45,130
It's such shit. The little kids
believe is real. A banshee,

2283
02:16:45,131 --> 02:16:49,990
I believe and I think
is a, an Irish, Irish,

2284
02:16:49,991 --> 02:16:51,850
very of mischief.
Please look it up.

2285
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:56,950
Why are you trying to like gain Brownie
pans from the oxalic acid debacle?

2286
02:16:58,050 --> 02:17:02,040
Sorry, go the stupidest facts
of all time. Oxalic acid.

2287
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:06,070
Once you go make me some fucking
juice. Hey Bro. Yeah, Brian,

2288
02:17:06,071 --> 02:17:08,750
that's when they'll come back. I
went, Hey Brian. I had no comment.

2289
02:17:08,751 --> 02:17:10,710
What about the toxins?
The other toxins,

2290
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:15,280
the toxins in fucking leafy
Greens will kill you. Feel Great.

2291
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:21,040
I'll tell you what they are. They're
oxy there. I'm fucking chlorine.

2292
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:26,320
Nick [inaudible] color farts.

2293
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:32,710
What's wrong with you? Really?
What is wrong? I am a lawyer.

2294
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:37,300
I say things for attention. We don't
like looking things up cause it's a bore.

2295
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:42,060
Who are you? I just work on instinct.
You fuck. It's hard to blue.

2296
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:46,090
When did Brian just drop all this stuff?
You stopped doing combat sports.

2297
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:50,380
You stopped juicing. You played tennis
juice in my life, but I will. I'll start.

2298
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:55,400
Oh, juicing. I thought you meant
choosing this truce. I drink a,

2299
02:17:55,401 --> 02:17:59,350
I have a press juices delivered to my
house every day. That's gangster. God,

2300
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:02,100
it's so good. You were right. Very good.

2301
02:18:02,110 --> 02:18:05,110
Banshee's a fairy woman who begins
to whale. If someone is about to die,

2302
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:08,230
don't be fucking my boy. Aubrey.
Just don't fuck with no Joe.

2303
02:18:08,270 --> 02:18:11,080
He doesn't say shit unless he knows what
he's talking about. Is very different.

2304
02:18:11,081 --> 02:18:13,120
No wonder you in that respect.

2305
02:18:13,270 --> 02:18:16,360
No wonder if Aubrey doesn't know he's
got this crazy thing he does. He goes,

2306
02:18:16,361 --> 02:18:18,610
I don't know.
You should try it.

2307
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:23,210
Brian makes the block that I love
that. I don't know. That's a boring,

2308
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:27,180
just trying to ask me any questions. You
can answer it. Don't be scared. Try to,

2309
02:18:27,181 --> 02:18:31,330
I now if somebody has somebody
has their hood open in that car,

2310
02:18:31,331 --> 02:18:34,570
I'll come over and give him by
giving him nothing about car.

2311
02:18:35,290 --> 02:18:38,740
I literally will come over and go find
a ranch on the side of the road and pick

2312
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:41,860
it up and see if it fits. You.
Check the fucking a carburetor.

2313
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:43,420
You have distributor caps,

2314
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:48,400
disturb your calves cause she fucking,
how's the HVAC valve on that?

2315
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:52,690
This is a big fucking fight from Matt
Brown and for Eric Silva. Look at this.

2316
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:56,980
Here's the rankings. See, okay.
Matt Brown, rank number seven.

2317
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:00,930
Eric Silva, not even on the
fucking top 10 for Internet.

2318
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:04,630
They have him as a two to one favorite.
That's crazy.

2319
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:10,190
Look at how tough. Look at
that shit. Crazy feels holding.

2320
02:19:10,220 --> 02:19:15,200
That's also why allegedly Aubrey has
made a shit fuck ton of money. Yes.

2321
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:18,520
There you go. On my advice,
allegedly, what is the percentage?

2322
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:22,330
Allegedly like 80% allegedly it'd
be, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

2323
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:28,500
One fight where allegedly we won 10 out
of 11 so you allegedly talked to Joe

2324
02:19:29,630 --> 02:19:33,500
Rogan before you put money allegedly
Callahana for only certain ones.

2325
02:19:33,501 --> 02:19:38,070
I go bet they'll fucking farm
on Tyron Woodley allegedly.

2326
02:19:38,330 --> 02:19:42,710
Hey Bro, this certain ones, those
tips. Yeah, I will, but you won't bet.

2327
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:45,950
You'll go to a buddy who
was used to be a navy seal.

2328
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:50,960
He gave me contrary advice. I wanted to
make him happy, so I showed him my slips.

2329
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:56,390
I held him. I have a friend,
hey, let's hear this. This

2330
02:19:56,390 --> 02:20:00,240
breakdown. Oh, it's me.

2331
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:01,993
How convenient.

2332
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:08,870
This is a fucking great fight,
man. Really good fight. Well,

2333
02:20:08,871 --> 02:20:13,750
I'd love just Matt Brown for a little bit.
Hurt his back. Yeah, that's what's I'm,

2334
02:20:13,751 --> 02:20:16,580
I'm interested in this. He
nodded. Not just hurt his back.

2335
02:20:16,730 --> 02:20:20,230
You fucking herniated discs.
We had to pull out of a big fight.

2336
02:20:20,231 --> 02:20:25,231
You're supposed to fight condit cold out
and herniated discs are not something

2337
02:20:25,371 --> 02:20:30,230
that heals up real quick, man.
You know, I know. I, I, I had, um,

2338
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:31,251
you know,

2339
02:20:31,251 --> 02:20:36,251
it took me a long fucking time of a lot
of different types of therapies to deal

2340
02:20:38,271 --> 02:20:43,250
with. Uh, my, uh, bulging disc that I had.
You know what's weird is, is Matt Brown,

2341
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:47,090
he came to Denver to train with
us one time and I was like, oh,

2342
02:20:47,091 --> 02:20:51,920
this pacing would be insane watching
him spar Neil Magni nope. Nope.

2343
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:55,160
It's a different,
like his octagon pace.

2344
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:58,250
And is sparring paces
completely different? Well,

2345
02:20:58,251 --> 02:21:00,380
it probably should just putting in work,
you know,

2346
02:21:00,381 --> 02:21:05,240
he's probably smart about that and that
sense. Was He, um, was he with Beecher?

2347
02:21:05,810 --> 02:21:09,020
Yes. Yeah. Beach is a good
dude, man. A really good dude.

2348
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,990
Features have got to turn me onto
my tattoo artist. Oh, really?

2349
02:21:11,991 --> 02:21:15,650
Who's your tattoo artist? Aaron
Dellavedova from grew tattoo in San Diego.

2350
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:20,660
Great fucking guy. Do you have to
go down to San Diego? San Diego. He,

2351
02:21:20,661 --> 02:21:25,380
um, he did a, I talked to Beecher. I was
like, who did your fucking sleeve? Yeah.

2352
02:21:25,390 --> 02:21:28,490
He's like, Karen DeSalvo over the guy's
fucking awesome. He gave me his number.

2353
02:21:28,491 --> 02:21:30,260
I called the guy guys cool as shit.

2354
02:21:30,261 --> 02:21:34,940
I saw stuff online and it was worth it
for me. Do you have both? Just your arms.

2355
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,930
Both guys are Erindale widow and has your
back and chest onto, oh, nothing's done.

2356
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:43,610
But these just arms. Both sleeves. Both
done by the same guy. He's awesome.

2357
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:47,570
I want to get, I want to get just one
sleeve. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2358
02:21:47,571 --> 02:21:52,190
I did too. But I had this uh, idea to
do this. Me and Moto Musashi sleeve. Oh.

2359
02:21:52,191 --> 02:21:56,240
It was kind of important to me, so I
said fuck it. That's book of five rings.

2360
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:57,690
I love that. But yeah. Oh,

2361
02:21:57,691 --> 02:22:00,320
we'll get Eric Silva slapping
himself before Matt Brown does

2362
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:05,960
their pro there. Press poster for this
fight. It was pretty fucking epic.

2363
02:22:05,961 --> 02:22:10,640
Pretty towns. Yeah. They're pretty
intense dudes, man. Yeah man.

2364
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,990
It's like the young lion versus
the established line. Cool.

2365
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:20,350
How old is this kid
killer? He's young. I mean,

2366
02:22:20,351 --> 02:22:24,500
I don't think he's holding than
25 I think he is. Is He? Hold on.

2367
02:22:24,501 --> 02:22:28,770
I want to say he's 27 or 28 okay,
let's pull it up. Eric Silva.

2368
02:22:32,190 --> 02:22:35,490
I feel like he didn't feel like he
made Bieber was separated at birth.

2369
02:22:35,491 --> 02:22:39,240
One went to Brazil, right? He's,
he's actually 29 29 yeah. Wow.

2370
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:42,840
I guess I'm pro basing it on how
old he was. He looks 20 words.

2371
02:22:43,490 --> 02:22:47,550
You look 21 looks 21 yeah.
I kind of forget that guy's age.

2372
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:53,700
The answer the UFC at
Leesville Eg. Oh, look at him.

2373
02:22:56,060 --> 02:23:01,020
Ishmael. His last name is Ishmael.
Ishmael lead. Gee, that guy,

2374
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:04,740
he rides one of those little crotch
rockets and he takes him to Aziz. Oh yeah,

2375
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:08,850
he does. He's a serious to some
end goals out here. Yep. Yeah.

2376
02:23:08,851 --> 02:23:11,430
He's to work out and goes all the time
though. He's still doctor. Great Guy.

2377
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:16,110
I saw him the other day. Guy, original
Carlson, Gracie black belts. He is choked.

2378
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:19,620
Hoists Gracie unconscious
in Rio on the beach.

2379
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:23,460
That was a community fucking heads out,
didn't he? Didn't he beat Hendo as well?

2380
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:27,570
Jujitsu match. You might be right. Yup.
It might be bright. Believe he did.

2381
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:32,970
He's a serious guy. He's a tank that was
back when, uh, there was the rivalry,

2382
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:36,840
you know, the Carlson Gracie
rivalry with Elios kids.

2383
02:23:37,770 --> 02:23:42,210
The Leo side and this hall is rivalries.
It's crazy.

2384
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:43,920
It's crazy.
It's a family.

2385
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:48,600
Even the family like holy [inaudible]
criticizes Henner and he ran for doing the

2386
02:23:48,601 --> 02:23:53,280
grace university. Like I don't get
that criticism man. I really don't.

2387
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:56,760
A lot of guys think that you can't
have Jujitsu instructions online.

2388
02:23:57,090 --> 02:24:01,470
Of course you can. Is it as good as
being there in person? No, it's not.

2389
02:24:01,471 --> 02:24:05,950
Is it still good? Yes, it is still bakes
Jujitsu available to a lot of people.

2390
02:24:06,050 --> 02:24:08,640
Can't get to the, I have a
buddy lives in Kentucky, man.

2391
02:24:08,670 --> 02:24:11,040
He lives in the middle of fucking
nowhere and him and his buddies,

2392
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:15,150
they watch videos and they practice
together and that's all he has.

2393
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:19,230
He's like two hours away.
You can simply get better that way.

2394
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:20,780
But that's how rich Franklin learned.
Hey,

2395
02:24:20,781 --> 02:24:24,990
you got a lot of guys learned like that
man Tanner Bas Rutten's said he was,

2396
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:27,210
he'd been beginning of
kind of self taught. Well,

2397
02:24:27,211 --> 02:24:30,840
he definitely learned a lot of
grappling that way. Not Striking.

2398
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:33,990
He's also just a gorilla is pos.
How about,

2399
02:24:33,991 --> 02:24:37,180
how about when he was doing like just
demonstrating shit for us? My God,

2400
02:24:37,181 --> 02:24:40,560
let's just like he's getting Regena keen
done at the same place where I get mine

2401
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:44,040
done on his arm, on his neck.
He's got a real problem though.

2402
02:24:44,041 --> 02:24:47,160
Here's for folks at home, man. Here's
the thing that my doctor told me.

2403
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:51,210
Once you start getting um, numbness
and then you start getting atrophy,

2404
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:53,520
if you don't catch that shit quick,

2405
02:24:53,790 --> 02:24:58,350
you have a small window where your
nerves have the possibility that he just

2406
02:24:58,351 --> 02:25:00,300
stumbled there and slipped.
That scares me.

2407
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:05,430
He ripped his fucking knee right
there and then played it off. Um, you,

2408
02:25:05,431 --> 02:25:08,250
you have a small window when you,
uh,

2409
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:11,340
when you lose muscle and size
and you start atrophying,

2410
02:25:11,341 --> 02:25:13,890
it's only a couple of months he said,
and in those couple of months,

2411
02:25:13,891 --> 02:25:17,340
if you don't get surgery or they don't
get something that reduces the pressure

2412
02:25:17,341 --> 02:25:18,060
on the nerves,

2413
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:21,510
those nerves can die off and then you
never get them back to you and there's

2414
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:24,250
nothing you can do. So it
never comes back 100%. Never.

2415
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:26,350
Cause Bas Rutten was telling me,
you know,

2416
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:28,900
he was trying all these different
things to get his nerves back,

2417
02:25:28,901 --> 02:25:31,480
but it's a long fucking time.
It's been years.

2418
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:34,240
He's got this massive
atrophy on his right arm.

2419
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:39,300
Like boss had neck problems all the way
back that to the tea Yoshiko Osaka fight.

2420
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:42,520
When he won the UFC heavyweight title
couldn't wrestle training for that fight.

2421
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:48,270
Same Shit is Carwyn had like serious neck
injuries and couldn't fucking wrestle.

2422
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:53,320
And so then I think it was sons of
anarchy was doing stunts for the,

2423
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:55,090
he fell on his head.

2424
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:59,560
It's spiked on his neck and he's
like [inaudible] fucking pain.

2425
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:03,820
Herniated disc in the neck,
atrophy of the nerves like the whole deal.

2426
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:06,220
But boss is just such an animal.

2427
02:26:06,310 --> 02:26:09,460
He's like one of those guys
that like if he gets injured,

2428
02:26:09,461 --> 02:26:11,720
he just sucks it up and keeps working out.
He's the one,

2429
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:16,750
the original filers who was a freak
athlete just picked up things so fast.

2430
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:18,940
He was one of the best
strikers in the early days,

2431
02:26:18,980 --> 02:26:23,680
asking strictly how would boss
do nat who have the old guys.

2432
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:27,400
I know you can't ask that because we're
so involved. The whole hall comes out.

2433
02:26:27,401 --> 02:26:28,760
The day that it's evolved.

2434
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:32,500
I tried to do the Bas Rutten
jumping double kick on the
trampoline all the time.

2435
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:36,190
It's totally useless
unless you're in a movie.

2436
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:39,760
Hence the trampoline and two
dummies are running at you.

2437
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:44,240
I would imagine Matt Brown
said to a super high pace,

2438
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:47,530
being in some townies would
come out pretty amped up. Well,

2439
02:26:47,531 --> 02:26:51,940
it's also a big question like how,
how much time is he had to fix that back?

2440
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:54,360
You got to remember this is five rounds,
so that patient,

2441
02:26:54,390 --> 02:26:57,930
there's no way you can do it
for five rounds. Just can't,
I don't know. You know,

2442
02:26:57,940 --> 02:27:02,260
I don't know what his injury was like,
but I know that like Matt Serra,

2443
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:05,290
when he came back from herniating,
a disk in his back and he fought GSP,

2444
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:08,800
he was really not the same. It was
really not the same. And most guys,

2445
02:27:08,801 --> 02:27:12,880
when they injure a disc in their back,
you're back is a lot like your knee,

2446
02:27:12,881 --> 02:27:14,800
which is a lot like your brain.
You know when,

2447
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:19,480
that's a good analogy like a guy doesn't
understand what a brain injury is like

2448
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,530
when you get owed and then you
get CalEd again easily afterwards.

2449
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:27,520
It's just like tweaking a knee and you
rip it the ligament and then you get it

2450
02:27:27,521 --> 02:27:30,490
fixed but then you need is
always kind of sore, you know.

2451
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:34,180
Well when you hurt your back though
that's so different cause it's connecting

2452
02:27:34,181 --> 02:27:36,920
your nerves back injury?

2453
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:41,200
I don't think so because I've never
seen Nate except I guess a brain trauma.

2454
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:44,560
I mean but I've never seen anything as
far as like a mixed martial arts related

2455
02:27:44,561 --> 02:27:48,610
injury that can just end it.
Backer that yeah,

2456
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:53,200
back or neck and end it and your,
your arms shrivel your leg show.

2457
02:27:53,230 --> 02:27:58,030
I have a friend and he had
two back surgeries and for
whatever reason it didn't

2458
02:27:58,031 --> 02:28:02,530
take and his leg is,
he has one leg that's shriveled.

2459
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:03,520
His,

2460
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:08,300
his right calf is like a bone to heal
and he's super self conscious about it.

2461
02:28:08,301 --> 02:28:12,460
He like wear sweat pants, he won't wear
shorts and he's all fucked up about it.

2462
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:14,110
He's hoping it comes back,

2463
02:28:14,111 --> 02:28:16,960
but the reality is if it's more
than a certain amount of time,

2464
02:28:16,961 --> 02:28:19,510
it ain't coming back.
It's tough.

2465
02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:22,010
And so if you're out there and
you got any sort of an injury,

2466
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:26,540
fucking don't tough it out. Deal
with it, deal with it immediately.

2467
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:29,840
Go get it. Prolo to fuck. Yap.

2468
02:28:29,870 --> 02:28:34,270
Prolotherapy prolozone had
probably therapy on my neck
and I worked for me. Yeah,

2469
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:38,000
no he didn't. Yes, you had
a neck problem, man. Yeah.

2470
02:28:38,910 --> 02:28:43,390
Join digits here and I had a
showering. No, I had told I really did.

2471
02:28:43,391 --> 02:28:46,750
I pull it in therapy and they
shot him. They shoot. Um,

2472
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:51,040
I think a saline solution in
your next Chicago, whatever
it is. And it worked. Ooh,

2473
02:28:51,070 --> 02:28:54,100
that sounds intense. Oh
boy. This is a nose to nose.

2474
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:57,760
Exactly the same height about to
kiss good. Soft there he goes matter.

2475
02:28:57,950 --> 02:28:59,580
It doesn't matter.
No.

2476
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:02,820
You know what's interesting about Matt
Brown and like he doesn't move that

2477
02:29:02,821 --> 02:29:03,660
fluidly.

2478
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:07,260
Like if you looked at the way he moves
his strikes and everything like that,

2479
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:11,670
you wouldn't like there's certain guys,
you look at them like perfect example,

2480
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:16,080
Hector Lombard. You look at a move and you
go, Oh, fucking Christ. See this place.

2481
02:29:16,090 --> 02:29:20,250
Leave this space now.
That just super kick.

2482
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:26,190
He was kissing guys. Fuck down.
Spacious. Maybe with his back,

2483
02:29:26,191 --> 02:29:30,220
he might just let them take
them. Boom. Oh boy. Oh boy.

2484
02:29:30,221 --> 02:29:34,740
Pulls him over on top. This is what I'm
telling him of time at the high pace.

2485
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:37,380
Charged up home crowd,
body kit.

2486
02:29:40,260 --> 02:29:43,590
Brown breaks. Motherfuckers
too. Does Ooh, good body kick.

2487
02:29:43,890 --> 02:29:48,180
But he's sold like Eaton shots and comes
back. He's not a front runner, man.

2488
02:29:49,650 --> 02:29:54,420
Big liver kick. Oh No fucking
hurt, man. Don't stop it.

2489
02:29:54,660 --> 02:29:59,340
He's not. He's not locked out. Oh He's,
he's gonna Survive. He'll survive.

2490
02:29:59,580 --> 02:30:03,090
But look at this. [inaudible] Silva's got
his back. He's got to work that defense.

2491
02:30:03,150 --> 02:30:04,770
But you know if you can
get ahold of a glove,

2492
02:30:04,771 --> 02:30:08,490
this is a good little break right here.
If you get two on one, you're pretty safe.

2493
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:12,990
Oh, this is just a neck crank here.
How about zero on one hand? No.

2494
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:16,140
Why does it need turn into the choke
turned turned towards his right.

2495
02:30:16,530 --> 02:30:17,940
He doesn't have body triangle either.

2496
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:20,880
He might be taking a little break you as
long as it take to recover from a kick,

2497
02:30:20,881 --> 02:30:24,850
like that tight body kick.
You're in trouble for a while.

2498
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:28,250
It depends entirely on how bad and where.

2499
02:30:28,410 --> 02:30:32,310
God George me and dropped him with a
fucking body shot and he hit him with a

2500
02:30:32,311 --> 02:30:33,150
vicious body.

2501
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:37,620
Punched 200 201 I was trying
to get to the right of it.

2502
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:41,670
This is great. Back control sort
of, but he's got his legs crossed.

2503
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:45,600
If Matt Brown steps over that and he
could make it at least let him make his

2504
02:30:45,601 --> 02:30:47,910
legs uncomfortable.
He doesn't have his legs crossed again.

2505
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:51,570
But then like when Hixon choked out
food knocky he has legs cross too,

2506
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:56,750
but Hickson, I am worried about that
shit. Come on. Oh he's got a deep now.

2507
02:30:57,090 --> 02:31:01,610
Shit. Nope. Oh boy. It's just a neck
crank. Ope. If it fits under the shoulder.

2508
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:06,590
What's he doing? Oh man, that is a neck
fucking Kremlin. It's not under the neck.

2509
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:08,080
Okay.

2510
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:11,500
It's under the Chin there you go to
o two on one for the love of God.

2511
02:31:11,501 --> 02:31:13,810
Defend your,
it's such a weird thing is to find your

2512
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:20,880
body triangle, but he's not rolling
dot. Not Rolling towards the triangle.

2513
02:31:21,770 --> 02:31:25,140
Now. He's not a good thing. Now he's doing
a good thing. See how he's, you know,

2514
02:31:25,141 --> 02:31:28,650
I see. You got to tap once from
an arm bar from that position.

2515
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:33,830
He got two on one on a guy's arm and then
extended it against is exhausting for

2516
02:31:34,591 --> 02:31:38,220
him though right now, right? It's Eric
silver or from Africa or if I'm at Brown.

2517
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:42,000
Yeah, but Matt Brown was getting
bad. That was he. Yeah, he's tough.

2518
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:46,080
He's tough. He's tough. Yup. The
UFC fighters. Pretty tough. Hey,

2519
02:31:46,081 --> 02:31:49,620
you calm down back there.
We've tracked up though.

2520
02:31:49,621 --> 02:31:51,370
He trapped this right arm that's dirty,

2521
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:55,080
fucked up and I was going to take that
other handout. You've got it back.

2522
02:31:55,730 --> 02:31:59,070
This is very nerve wracking.
We've got two minutes left,

2523
02:31:59,071 --> 02:32:02,250
but she know what Matt Brown,
he relishes these kinds of fights.

2524
02:32:02,251 --> 02:32:06,570
Man Goes to the second round.
This is a lot of shit,

2525
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:10,890
but Eric Silva tried several times to
exert a lot of energy to try to finish him

2526
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:14,190
and what he's trying to trap that
arm again. You see how his heel,

2527
02:32:14,350 --> 02:32:19,080
his heels blocking his arm from coming
in and he's out. He's out. Oh boy.

2528
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:23,970
Oh Shit. Here comes the Nissan.
Oh, there it goes. One of the body.

2529
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:27,750
The body shot was great and there's an
elbow and another need of the body and

2530
02:32:27,751 --> 02:32:30,300
this is Eric's Silva.

2531
02:32:30,610 --> 02:32:32,020
He my God,
Matt,

2532
02:32:32,770 --> 02:32:36,820
Matt Brown has Robo is coming coming on,
man.

2533
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:42,280
All that exertion. This is a kid
that wilted against John Fitch.

2534
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:45,190
The same sort of scenario.
Brown does not stop coming.

2535
02:32:45,850 --> 02:32:50,800
This pace is got Brian. Keep making
comments versus guys in total wars.

2536
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:55,560
Oh Man. Oh I'm sorry. I can't
help it. Huc Site. What?

2537
02:32:55,570 --> 02:32:59,200
These guys sweat a lot guys.
These guys are all muscle.

2538
02:32:59,530 --> 02:33:03,250
There's no fat on a minute and 20
seconds in my no bullshit aside.

2539
02:33:03,251 --> 02:33:07,720
This is crazy crazy.
The crowd. He's rugged,

2540
02:33:07,930 --> 02:33:12,160
rugged. This is exactly what I keep your
hands up, man. Keep your hands up. Please.

2541
02:33:12,161 --> 02:33:14,260
Fuck. Keep his hands up. Oh.

2542
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:18,940
Oh, Eric Silva's in trouble. Don't
trip Silva's exhausted. Punch him.

2543
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:23,920
Oh, good. Block of that name.
Took one to the head. Elbows.

2544
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:27,970
That's about to break and my 45 fucking
seconds is a long time. We get beat on.

2545
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:32,170
Ooh, that's more tied to,
that's that Muay Thai dump.

2546
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:38,170
Oh Man. He's all over this. He
kicked him in the head kick. No,

2547
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:41,620
Jesus Christ.
Last thing you want to see this?

2548
02:33:41,621 --> 02:33:46,510
This is fight fucking stopped on
a DQ. Oh Dude. Silva's exhausted.

2549
02:33:46,511 --> 02:33:51,040
Look at him walking away. Don't do that.
He can't even pick his legs up to hick.

2550
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:55,870
Somebody calling out. It's crazy,
Matt Brown trout has. That's crazy.

2551
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:59,830
Oh, that's crazy. For
your morale. Oh, cut.

2552
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:05,070
Drags dues into hell, man. I
want it to get to. Oh boom. Wow.

2553
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:07,820
Wow. Please let this fight. Keep going.

2554
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:11,410
You guys didn't even better,

2555
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:19,410
dude. He run down one does it
half rounds. Are you kidding?

2556
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:25,240
Clearly give that round
to Matt. Right? Wow.

2557
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:29,420
God Damn. Let me see
the replays that, wow,

2558
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:34,220
this is a commercial for light.
Fuck nigger wearing a wig.

2559
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:37,600
It's commercial thousand times
that came out like a banshee.

2560
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:41,200
Arlo can play some ping pong.
He actually his peer legs on.

2561
02:34:41,201 --> 02:34:42,250
You haven't seen me play ping pong.

2562
02:34:42,251 --> 02:34:46,630
I'd actually kind of like Matt Brown and
Pink Pong is anybody like suffered less

2563
02:34:46,631 --> 02:34:49,440
from fucking their housekeeper and
getting her pregnant and then oral.

2564
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:53,410
He's the greatest.
He went right into that to several chai.

2565
02:34:55,830 --> 02:34:59,770
I don't think I'm speaking actually ask
for enough loose some about that and he

2566
02:34:59,771 --> 02:35:02,200
goes like this. I go, what did you
do? And he goes, just laid low.

2567
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:06,520
I swear to God. I go, what
did you do when that happened?

2568
02:35:06,521 --> 02:35:10,030
Because he was going to do a movie where
he has a Spanish lover and they said,

2569
02:35:10,031 --> 02:35:13,090
look, you know it's probably not a good
idea. And I go, what did you do with that?

2570
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:18,360
I just laid low. Yeah, he is
a remarkable vision of what,

2571
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:21,530
what's going on. It's kind of like
he's kind of a macho, he can't hear me.

2572
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:25,750
Here's the replay. So this
is the gate. Oh my God.

2573
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:29,800
And you see him tighten up.
Boom.

2574
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:33,190
Brown is all over silver.
That's the thing about Matt Brown.

2575
02:35:33,191 --> 02:35:37,060
You can't blow your wad on
this motherfucker cause he
relishes. He'll look at us.

2576
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:42,110
He relishes. Ward kept this pace. Two
and a half minutes, boys, come on,

2577
02:35:42,130 --> 02:35:46,900
you can make it so not brown. It's
fired it around and a half and you uh,

2578
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:48,130
you,
you win the bet.

2579
02:35:48,490 --> 02:35:51,640
I don't think you're probably still was
going to wait to make it Silva's getting

2580
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:55,380
fucking fuck stop. He's going to
have to hurt Matt Brown. I mean,

2581
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:59,800
I'm assuming you can kick.
You need to take down.

2582
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:04,000
You need to take, that's same. Kicky
fuck. Sato up with his last opponent.

2583
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:09,040
Oh, both a little fatigued.
How could you not? Well,

2584
02:36:09,041 --> 02:36:11,410
I mean Matt Brown just
ate another liver kick.

2585
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:15,910
He throws that whole,
Oh God,

2586
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:21,070
this kid will drag you
in a fucking hell man.

2587
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:24,370
Take him down short
elbows to got to love it.

2588
02:36:24,490 --> 02:36:27,730
He's got a really weird strength and
conditioning program to what does it feel

2589
02:36:27,731 --> 02:36:32,710
to five minute rounds like holding
a hundred pound ball. I got to get,

2590
02:36:33,010 --> 02:36:34,990
can I get my fucking kettlebells please?

2591
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:37,840
You guys just got to get
the edit the address.

2592
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:41,710
You write it down in that yellow
sheet workout equipment at home.

2593
02:36:41,711 --> 02:36:43,540
I'm getting a Matte Brown Tattoo.
I'll tell you that much.

2594
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:47,590
What would a Mel Brown Tattoo be?
It's going to be,

2595
02:36:47,591 --> 02:36:52,420
it gets going to on my entire torso
and my back. Would it be him? Oh Man.

2596
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:58,060
Oh, this dude is just shots.
Silver tried to trip him.

2597
02:36:58,090 --> 02:37:00,880
This could be it. How much more
time you need to admit it. I got it.

2598
02:37:01,690 --> 02:37:05,730
You need to take down for, I think the
kid might last a minute. Oh, I'm, I'm,

2599
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:09,670
I'm feeling that you graze
the head all that hair.

2600
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:13,660
Oh my God. He's all done.
Silva's tough though.

2601
02:37:13,661 --> 02:37:16,070
There's no way this kid's last in
five minutes. I'll tell you that.

2602
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:19,400
I agree. He's exhausted and he's not
going to win and he's not going to last.

2603
02:37:19,430 --> 02:37:24,290
He just not going to at this point.
Look at that. Who? He's exhausted.

2604
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:27,050
He's exhausted. The only thing
that's keeping them up right now,

2605
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:31,010
his heart and will, does Sylvia have a
huge wake up call? Beauty is, yes he does.

2606
02:37:31,011 --> 02:37:33,170
Yes he does.
So he's a big guy.

2607
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:37,400
I've seen him walk around outside the
octagon in between fights and I was like,

2608
02:37:37,410 --> 02:37:40,730
Geez. Nasty. Very nasty.

2609
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:45,560
You Know Matt Brown's only upper
body workout he does for his arm. Oh,

2610
02:37:45,561 --> 02:37:48,950
he kicked him again. Delivered
Kick Matt Reynolds. He does.

2611
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:52,850
He does dumbbell presses. And that's
it. By the way, silver can take off.

2612
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:55,530
Oh,

2613
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:01,400
his poor liver. Incredible. Well,
he might have a broken rib. I mean,

2614
02:38:01,401 --> 02:38:05,030
if he's getting hurt that easy.
Beautiful takedown inside controls.

2615
02:38:05,150 --> 02:38:05,983
Yeah,

2616
02:38:09,260 --> 02:38:13,150
man.
Damn mounted crucifix.

2617
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:16,210
He better get an energy. Are you going
to stop the fight here but crucifix him.

2618
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:17,530
Just keep that. Well, I'll tell you what,

2619
02:38:17,531 --> 02:38:20,600
Matt Brown also has a very good fucking
ground game to a lot of people don't

2620
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:25,400
respect that ground game. His
ground games nasty. I got to,

2621
02:38:25,401 --> 02:38:30,110
I mean if he can step over this. Oh
No, no, no. Oh my God. Oh Man. Oh boy.

2622
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:33,640
You attack the arm.
What do you call that?

2623
02:38:34,780 --> 02:38:36,850
The fuck out. Inverted
triangle. Yeah. Yeah.

2624
02:38:36,890 --> 02:38:40,130
That's a bad position for other
way though. That's, that's hell.

2625
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:44,610
He needs to attack that. How is
silver breathing right now? He goes,

2626
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:49,040
nope, he loves a wild fucking fight, man.

2627
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:51,980
This is what I love about Matt
Brown fights. They're wild.

2628
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:56,690
Did you never see a boring, oh,
he's done. The kids done. He just,

2629
02:38:56,691 --> 02:38:59,870
he can't, he can't defend. Look
at his left arm. It's like,

2630
02:38:59,871 --> 02:39:02,600
it's just floating around there.
He's not doing anything.

2631
02:39:02,601 --> 02:39:05,030
He's just hoping to get a break.
It's like a dark

2632
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,170
dark from the mount, but
he's like, oh my goodness,

2633
02:39:12,171 --> 02:39:15,380
this is going to be it. Yeah. This kid's
not getting out of the mouth. Really.

2634
02:39:15,381 --> 02:39:20,060
Not leaving anything though. Yeah, but
Eric Silva doesn't have anything left.

2635
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:24,620
Look good. You know, I love Herb
Dean in these situations because her,

2636
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:28,340
look how closely and calmly herb Dean's
looking at this. He's not freaking out.

2637
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:31,540
And I like how he took a knee so his legs
don't burn out like the Big Guy, Huh?

2638
02:39:32,190 --> 02:39:33,420
Oh,
oh,

2639
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:41,090
holy shit.
Matt Brown is he locked up?

2640
02:39:41,091 --> 02:39:43,550
He locked up the triangle.
So I was in trouble.

2641
02:39:43,590 --> 02:39:48,590
How seleg he's attacking me
arm to keep attacking the arm.

2642
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:53,370
The arm is the shit, but he also needs to
hook that leg that, you know he'd been,

2643
02:39:53,390 --> 02:39:56,790
that leg is important.
Oh my God.

2644
02:39:56,820 --> 02:40:01,820
It's fucking hard coming up.
If you had bet,

2645
02:40:02,030 --> 02:40:03,890
if you had bit the over for two rounds,

2646
02:40:03,891 --> 02:40:07,870
you'd be having a goddamn
heart attack right now on

2647
02:40:09,820 --> 02:40:12,830
that is going can get us back
for them to this round. Nope.

2648
02:40:13,290 --> 02:40:18,060
20 seconds is fucking fight is incredible.
Just needs to attack the body.

2649
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:21,600
I feel sorry for the people that are
watching us online that are 15 seconds

2650
02:40:21,601 --> 02:40:22,434
behind

2651
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:27,300
cause we're like, we're talking, I
mean one of the fight could be over.

2652
02:40:29,090 --> 02:40:34,020
This is pause your DVR.
You fucks. Stay with us.

2653
02:40:34,021 --> 02:40:39,021
My 15 second talk about a
main of wow being inspired.

2654
02:40:39,811 --> 02:40:41,340
What are we doing?
I got to go.

2655
02:40:43,870 --> 02:40:47,320
Oh my God. This is incredible. What
a fucking fight for our best fight.

2656
02:40:47,321 --> 02:40:49,720
I remember saying,
Hey Michael Bisbing eye.

2657
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:54,310
Let's go back to this cause we're maturing
rounds. Um, it's good. Is it all right?

2658
02:40:54,910 --> 02:40:58,210
Is it all right? Yeah. Yeah. Damn Dude.

2659
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:00,513
Maybe the worst.

2660
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:03,130
Don't ever try to go in an acting

2661
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:07,470
role when we're smart and good.

2662
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:11,490
Did it seem good? It's like
one of them is dark. Yeah.

2663
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:16,100
He's looking at me like, let's not talk
about this. All right. I'll let this go.

2664
02:41:16,580 --> 02:41:20,540
I'm going to, yeah. He wouldn't ask if I
asked him. He wouldn't tell me. You know.

2665
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:26,360
When are you going to do, he's a tough
motherfucker. He's having problems too.

2666
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:29,240
He's got a weak arm.
Really? Same thing. Yeah.

2667
02:41:29,300 --> 02:41:34,200
Pinched nerves here on your boy here on
the same issue. I know I haven't wrote,

2668
02:41:34,220 --> 02:41:37,970
well I wrote with you on last week
for the first time in about six months

2669
02:41:37,971 --> 02:41:41,030
because he's had a neck issue. Yeah.
How's he doing now? Is he better? Yeah.

2670
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:46,130
What did he do to get better?
He saw some specialists in Beverly Hills.

2671
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:49,220
Oh yeah. What the guy
tell him? I'm not sure

2672
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:56,160
what a fucking fight this is so far.
I want to see that dig into the body.

2673
02:41:57,290 --> 02:42:01,410
There it is. Out of nowhere.
He heard them. I mean Matt
Brown was coming on strong.

2674
02:42:01,411 --> 02:42:05,370
Here we go. Round three bitches
throw to the body. This is a,

2675
02:42:05,490 --> 02:42:09,270
this is a matter of whether or not Eric
Silva has that second wind in them.

2676
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:13,000
You know, these mother fuckers that
caught all this incredible weight,

2677
02:42:13,030 --> 02:42:17,070
it catches up with the right [inaudible]
in this kind of a fight because Matt

2678
02:42:17,070 --> 02:42:20,430
Brown is not a big guy.
He's not cutting a shit ton of weight.

2679
02:42:20,431 --> 02:42:23,220
He's not a 200 pound roll.
Oh Man.

2680
02:42:25,270 --> 02:42:29,850
He's just breaking motherfuckers
piss break in her way.

2681
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:33,970
Oh God, this is awesome. Oh,

2682
02:42:33,971 --> 02:42:38,140
spinning back fist and he's just
constantly on you. You never get a break.

2683
02:42:38,141 --> 02:42:41,060
There's no rest. There's no break, no
risk. Your heart rate's consequently

2684
02:42:42,790 --> 02:42:46,870
would fucking love to see
fight Matt Brown, Nick Diaz.

2685
02:42:47,170 --> 02:42:49,930
I think that might be the greatest
fight in the history of the universe.

2686
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:51,970
You might be really back,
oh my God,

2687
02:42:51,971 --> 02:42:55,810
Matt Brown versus Nick Diaz might be the
greatest match up of all the holes that

2688
02:42:55,811 --> 02:43:00,080
go down. I don't know. I
don't know. Just chaos.

2689
02:43:00,490 --> 02:43:03,490
Just pure chaos. Well,
you know, Diaz is not,

2690
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:07,690
he's not a guy that's gonna wilt
like Eric Silvis. I think this kid,

2691
02:43:07,870 --> 02:43:12,550
I think there's a lot of people that
do great and training and they do great

2692
02:43:12,551 --> 02:43:15,670
when they're not cutting the weight and
then they cut the weight and they think

2693
02:43:15,671 --> 02:43:16,481
they're going to be okay,

2694
02:43:16,481 --> 02:43:21,481
but they don't take into account that
diminished effect that it has on your

2695
02:43:21,551 --> 02:43:25,300
body. I mean, it has a big effect on
your body when you're in a war like this,

2696
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:29,380
you really shouldn't be fighting a
fucking guy like this at 170 pounds.

2697
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:32,770
You don't football games when it
gets to the overtime, when they go,

2698
02:43:32,771 --> 02:43:35,440
this is a war of nutrition,
not bitch for real.

2699
02:43:36,530 --> 02:43:40,690
They never say nutrition, nutrition,
nutrition. The pub we gave.

2700
02:43:41,930 --> 02:43:45,430
I gotcha. I gotcha. I hear you,

2701
02:43:45,431 --> 02:43:50,350
but this podcast, I'd probably let
that go if this wasn't on the Internet.

2702
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,970
Browse on top of them. Fucking Eric
Silva. There's a cut now though.

2703
02:43:54,971 --> 02:43:57,850
Now they're going to look to stop.
That was mixing up. Where's the blood?

2704
02:43:58,170 --> 02:44:00,400
Eric's Elvis bleed. He's not,
he's not protecting himself.

2705
02:44:00,490 --> 02:44:03,910
Do you stop it now or now? Nope. No. Herb
Dean. We'll give them some chances, man.

2706
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:09,730
He's pushing off a little
bit with his feet, his feet,
but that's it. That's Eddie.

2707
02:44:09,790 --> 02:44:13,480
He turtled up. He gave
up. Wow. Matt Brown.

2708
02:44:13,540 --> 02:44:16,930
Fuck you odds makers.
You pitches were wrong twice.

2709
02:44:17,800 --> 02:44:20,980
I'd make yourself look at and
look at that kind of chuckling.

2710
02:44:20,981 --> 02:44:25,240
Dell outfit was hell. It's good.
Look at Eric Silverman beaten down.

2711
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:28,010
That motherfucker broke him.
Matt Brown is up.

2712
02:44:29,530 --> 02:44:34,210
He is a fucking beast. A great
fight. Holy Shit. That was fun.

2713
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:38,610
Joe Silva doing it. He's in the
ring and he'd like to fight takes.

2714
02:44:38,660 --> 02:44:41,890
We know the facts. We know the secret
code was already making the next fights.

2715
02:44:41,950 --> 02:44:45,820
He's texting. Johnny has texting. He says,

2716
02:44:45,821 --> 02:44:49,300
listen to this podcast
idea robos to the eyeball.

2717
02:44:49,301 --> 02:44:51,360
He just elbowed him right in
the eye socket where the cut.

2718
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:56,140
That's where the Kate Tim Silva
Silva game. Serious fight though.

2719
02:44:56,410 --> 02:44:57,550
Well he did in the first round,

2720
02:44:57,551 --> 02:45:01,210
but really the only thing he did
is that left kick to the body.

2721
02:45:01,211 --> 02:45:04,900
He just wiped blood off of his,
I took too much and you know it's just,

2722
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:07,450
he's not in that league man.
He's just not in that league.

2723
02:45:07,630 --> 02:45:11,880
This guy isn't a hell league.
He dragged you into hell.

2724
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:14,710
Hell member.
She looks just him.

2725
02:45:16,630 --> 02:45:19,540
He is rough as it gets.
He's been in there for a long time.

2726
02:45:19,541 --> 02:45:22,560
He knows what it feels like to being hell.
I'm just super,

2727
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:27,280
I'm super impressed that he bounced
back from those herniated disc to not a

2728
02:45:27,281 --> 02:45:32,020
scratch on his face. You can go drink a
beer right now. It's five Kenny ever. Wow.

2729
02:45:32,021 --> 02:45:35,590
That was, took some shots to the liver
and he's the God damn. Do some core work.

2730
02:45:35,591 --> 02:45:40,300
Maybe help his discs. Help the body.
Well, I mean I'm sure he did something.

2731
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:42,580
He has a very unique training regimen.

2732
02:45:42,581 --> 02:45:45,400
They were talking about it on my
message board. They were detailing it,

2733
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:47,050
talking about some of the things he does.

2734
02:45:47,051 --> 02:45:51,730
It carries a barrel filled with water
like kill cause like you have to carry it

2735
02:45:51,731 --> 02:45:54,450
with your hips and he carries it for
five rounds and moves around with it.

2736
02:45:54,740 --> 02:45:57,730
It does a lot of crazy shit
level interesting shit.

2737
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:02,560
All like hips and cores and glutes,
all bunch of things that uh,

2738
02:46:02,980 --> 02:46:05,590
his strength and conditioning
coaches some pretty Monday.

2739
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:07,090
Monday you're going to
see on my Instagram,

2740
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:11,390
me just carrying the big gas water bottle.
It's a copycat league.

2741
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:16,280
You know what else works girls true
could carry girl heavy chair and even big

2742
02:46:16,281 --> 02:46:20,510
old heavy chair around the thing about
a barrel as he puts it on your hands

2743
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:23,540
around. So what does he, I
don't understand. Hoist it up,

2744
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:28,550
you know arches his back hips into it,
you're saying, right? Yeah, exactly.

2745
02:46:28,551 --> 02:46:30,320
You have to have your hips into it.
The same way you would take,

2746
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:31,310
take a person down,

2747
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:35,450
bad technique and I can get a hold
the pill or even defend a take down.

2748
02:46:35,451 --> 02:46:37,430
Who are these fucking jokers?
I'll tell you what,

2749
02:46:37,431 --> 02:46:40,700
these little skinny neck pitchers don't
know shit about MMA. Shut your mouth.

2750
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:45,440
They probably made the odds. Jay and Dan,
did you make the odds? You fuck heads.

2751
02:46:45,710 --> 02:46:50,430
Why don't you go talk about
cricket? Talking about some
shit. You understand. So,

2752
02:46:50,431 --> 02:46:54,750
uh, I guess the podcast is over, right?
I mean this is bad. It's a good time.

2753
02:46:56,790 --> 02:46:59,170
I'm calling us to success.
I think this is a great,

2754
02:46:59,330 --> 02:47:02,620
probably the greatest idea
we've ever had collectively.

2755
02:47:03,470 --> 02:47:08,300
Come see me in the admin. Matt, look at
this. Eric Silva's still hasn't gotten up,

2756
02:47:08,301 --> 02:47:12,140
man. He's sitting, he's
exhausted, he's broken, and you
know when he announces he's,

2757
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:14,960
he's realizing right now I'm
not going to be the champion.

2758
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:18,890
Like I might be able to, you can't beat
that kind. Not going to beat that guy.

2759
02:47:19,310 --> 02:47:22,430
I'm not going to beat guys like him and
I'm not going to beat guys that can beat

2760
02:47:22,431 --> 02:47:26,840
him. Maybe it needs to fight 85 yeah,
well baby needs to stop lifting weights.

2761
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:30,140
You know, this is the thing that dudes
have to realize. I look at Matt Brown,

2762
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:33,980
not a big guy, man. He loved.
I wish I could give it some
bond. Give me some volume,

2763
02:47:40,110 --> 02:47:42,840
give it up campaigning for the
title a little early for that baby.

2764
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:46,470
While he's one that man,
he's won eight in a row about that.

2765
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:49,710
I would say I would definitely let,
let him fight for the title.

2766
02:47:51,390 --> 02:47:56,340
I mean Hendrix, right now, Johnny has
to recover from a torn bicep surgery.

2767
02:47:56,341 --> 02:48:00,060
This is the thing about the top of the
food chain. So if you're fighting Woodley,

2768
02:48:00,090 --> 02:48:01,280
if you're fighting Roy McDonald,

2769
02:48:01,290 --> 02:48:03,450
you're fighting Hendricks and
you've come forward like that,

2770
02:48:03,451 --> 02:48:06,720
you're going to take it down. You're
right. It's a different animal, right?

2771
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:08,670
It's a total,
it's all about matchups

2772
02:48:10,770 --> 02:48:15,640
now him verse coils conduct. That's an
amazing fire. Carlos isn't shooting a AA.

2773
02:48:15,700 --> 02:48:18,570
Yeah,
but Carlos has got an ACL reconstruction.

2774
02:48:18,571 --> 02:48:23,100
He does going to be out for awhile.
I'm just saying there's certain guys,

2775
02:48:23,101 --> 02:48:27,560
there's the top three guys that the
very top are horrible matchups for him.

2776
02:48:27,960 --> 02:48:30,690
I don't know. But they wrestle
man. But here's the thing,

2777
02:48:30,870 --> 02:48:33,430
what if Woodley Beats Hendrickson,

2778
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:37,980
the title Matt Brown Fights Woodley and
it gets into the fourth round. You know,

2779
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:40,590
I agree. I'm thinking about
this motherfucker is, look,

2780
02:48:41,010 --> 02:48:44,100
I don't think there's a baddest man
on the planet anymore and it is.

2781
02:48:44,101 --> 02:48:48,750
I totally agree about matchups. I
totally agree. But this kid, man,

2782
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:53,210
I'm telling Matt Brown might be as
fierce as anybody have ever seen fight as

2783
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:57,660
anybody. And everybody was
saying that when he was in
the octagon, you know, like,

2784
02:48:57,661 --> 02:48:59,630
or rather when he was on the
ultimate fighter was said,

2785
02:48:59,640 --> 02:49:04,080
there was a thing about him. It
just, he breaks motherfuckers,

2786
02:49:04,110 --> 02:49:09,110
he breaks motherfuckers and I don't think
people realize another UFC fighter is

2787
02:49:09,121 --> 02:49:13,170
insane. Insane. Especially when the
ranked number 14 in the world. I mean,

2788
02:49:13,171 --> 02:49:17,370
think about the gritty guys you've seen.
Like he was man just over and over.

2789
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:20,130
I mean out of all the guys
who have fought in the UFC,

2790
02:49:20,131 --> 02:49:23,940
who is fiercer me Vandelay
when he was in pride, right.

2791
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:28,320
He's in pride is another level, but
he was also juice to the gills. It's,

2792
02:49:28,360 --> 02:49:29,520
that's why I meet another level.

2793
02:49:29,521 --> 02:49:32,940
It's a different thing to different
thing as having a real struggle time.

2794
02:49:32,941 --> 02:49:36,420
That bell all sorts of, yeah, that
kind of needs to learn how to tie,

2795
02:49:36,421 --> 02:49:40,320
but you can't give a belt if
you don't like, ah, fucking
granny knot. That's shit.

2796
02:49:40,470 --> 02:49:45,290
What are you fishing?
Tying up a boat to fuck.

2797
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:48,690
It's all goofy in the back. Look at it.
It's all I ruined. The cockeyed shit

2798
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:53,430
is boys. That's toss. Horrible. Horrible.

2799
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:57,330
Imagine that you will go to your Fucking
Room when your dad tells you to go to

2800
02:49:57,331 --> 02:50:00,780
your room. Matt Brown, those kids,

2801
02:50:00,900 --> 02:50:03,690
they just watched him crazy
shit that they don't understand.

2802
02:50:03,770 --> 02:50:07,640
Like Jenny getting a serious fight.
Pure scared

2803
02:50:07,730 --> 02:50:10,280
eyes,
but plus genetics,

2804
02:50:11,330 --> 02:50:16,280
UFC active WinStreak John John 11 and,
and Barao seven Matt Brown. Seven. Wow.

2805
02:50:16,370 --> 02:50:19,280
Damn. Widen the sets. Impressive.
Oh, either differences.

2806
02:50:19,281 --> 02:50:24,050
Weidman never lost. John
Jones. Never Lost Hanan.

2807
02:50:24,051 --> 02:50:29,030
Barao never lost none of those
guys I've ever lost the RQ. Wow.

2808
02:50:29,090 --> 02:50:33,800
The last time I'm Matt loss was a
is in ski, which is pretty crazy.

2809
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:38,100
He's, he's choking around. Yeah, they're
choking. Right. And you know, happy.

2810
02:50:39,380 --> 02:50:41,510
But I'm just saying after a war like that,
he's fine.

2811
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:45,560
So right to he was completely
disrespected by the odds, you know?

2812
02:50:45,561 --> 02:50:49,190
And he's talked about it quite a bit in
the pre fight that it's two and a half

2813
02:50:49,191 --> 02:50:52,460
to one. And he was like, what the
fuck is that about man? He's like,

2814
02:50:52,550 --> 02:50:56,570
I've won six fucking fights in a row. And
you look at the quality of competition.

2815
02:50:56,571 --> 02:50:57,110
True.

2816
02:50:57,110 --> 02:51:01,580
And then you look at the guys that
Eric Silva fought and lost to Fitch and

2817
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:05,570
knocked out by Don Young Kim.
Again, Don Young, Kim's up beast.

2818
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:06,650
No doubt about it.

2819
02:51:06,980 --> 02:51:10,730
But how are you going to have
that kid losing to that guy?

2820
02:51:10,850 --> 02:51:15,530
Beating Sato and then coming off of
that fight being a two to one favorite.

2821
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:18,200
That's crazy man. That
is weird. Super Weird.

2822
02:51:20,570 --> 02:51:21,950
Well in fights. Nice. Get him

2823
02:51:22,910 --> 02:51:24,980
right.
Fights is a success.

2824
02:51:24,981 --> 02:51:28,700
I'm going to quit the UFC and just do
this with you guys. Yeah, I'm done.

2825
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:31,220
This is more fun.
It's way more fun to do it,

2826
02:51:32,450 --> 02:51:36,450
you know, just about as good as it
gets. But I think I found my future.

2827
02:51:37,230 --> 02:51:38,460
I don't like traveling guys.

2828
02:51:38,610 --> 02:51:42,090
I don't either.
No one likes [inaudible].

2829
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:46,860
We just did this right from the comfort
of the podcast studio and the fucking

2830
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:49,890
might've been my favorite
podcast of all time. Um,

2831
02:51:50,970 --> 02:51:55,020
I need a shit load of pickles, pickles. It
goes bulletproof coffee. You guys enjoy.

2832
02:51:55,021 --> 02:51:59,490
The wines were good. I enjoyed
every aspect of this. Look
at this as a stare down.

2833
02:51:59,970 --> 02:52:02,880
Here's the highlights again.
Eric Silva, Eric Silva,

2834
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:07,810
and he heard him with that kick.
It's kind of a friend kiss. It's,

2835
02:52:07,811 --> 02:52:10,310
it's almost like a cocoon,

2836
02:52:10,311 --> 02:52:13,480
knows kicked that sort of
crossing kick did. He does,

2837
02:52:13,570 --> 02:52:18,400
but look all over him. Work in the
nic crank too much effort in that.

2838
02:52:18,430 --> 02:52:21,010
Yup, you're right. And he, he
gassed out because of that.

2839
02:52:21,130 --> 02:52:25,420
But I think it's also the body,
the body weight cut. I agree.

2840
02:52:25,450 --> 02:52:29,800
When I rented to Silva in Brazil, I swear
to God, the kid had to be 200 pounds.

2841
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:32,800
If he's not 200 pounds, he's fucking
clothes. There's that cake again.

2842
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:37,360
It's like a front kick butt at an angle.
It's how cocoons throws it.

2843
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:40,600
It's like they call it a crescent kick,

2844
02:52:40,601 --> 02:52:43,150
but it's not a crescent kick because
it's a front kick because it's with the

2845
02:52:43,151 --> 02:52:45,790
ball of the foot.
I'll get you hooked him in the body there.

2846
02:52:46,320 --> 02:52:50,710
Probably same spot where you got
hurt before. It's a nasty inclusive.

2847
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:55,740
Eric Silva was just overwhelmed
by the ferocity of Brett to do.

2848
02:52:56,020 --> 02:52:59,380
Just was never comfortable ever.
I'll tell you what I got.

2849
02:52:59,381 --> 02:53:00,101
I'm gonna say it right now.

2850
02:53:00,101 --> 02:53:02,860
Matt Brown was my favorite
fighter next to Brennan shop,

2851
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:10,120
my favorite fight. I mean, not that
he's the best, but his fun is to watch.

2852
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:14,620
He,
he just forces everything to be war.

2853
02:53:14,740 --> 02:53:16,720
You have no choice but to
be in the war. Yeah. No,

2854
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:18,730
you're not going to sit back
and make it look pretty.

2855
02:53:18,731 --> 02:53:22,060
It doesn't matter who you are. When
