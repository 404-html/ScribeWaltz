1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,091
So when,

3
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:03,150
when I worked for Jamison,

4
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:03,841
I worked for James from,

5
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:04,381
for two years.

6
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,520
Did the Jamison tore me.

7
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:06,091
Billy Gardell,

8
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:06,924
Steve Byrne,

9
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,033
uh,

10
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,920
Michael Loftus,

11
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,630
Nick Griffin and Danny Bevins and you,

12
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,000
they sent cases at Jamison to your house
every fucking month they sent cases of

13
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,460
pace is of Jamison.

14
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,160
Nug Spence,

15
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,430
how they expect you to drink it all.

16
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:19,890
And,

17
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,660
and know when you got to a show,

18
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,240
Jamison waiting in the green room and
the rule was you had to drink at Jamison

19
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:25,950
onstage.

20
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,220
You had to mention how
good your Jamison was,

21
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,770
but putting on a show
like take a step like,

22
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:31,981
damn,

23
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:33,000
that's good fucking Jamison.

24
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,840
Like,

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,591
and you had to like,

26
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,760
hey everyone today,

27
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,230
like you had to be pro Jamison.

28
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,600
I got no problem with that because
Jameson is pretty God damn good.

29
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,160
It's fucking awesome.

30
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:41,994
Good Shannon,

31
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,100
we get done the tour.

32
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,943
You ready for this?

33
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,070
They buy us each of them acre of land in,

34
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,430
in fucking,

35
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,710
in Ireland on a river.

36
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,180
All of us right next to each other.

37
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,500
We get a fucking Acre land,

38
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,120
a deed and a picture.

39
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,780
Whoa.

40
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,021
Yeah.

41
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,854
Fucking Jamison was,

42
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,690
you got to build a house in Ireland.

43
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,380
Now you can't build,

44
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,213
you can't build on it.

45
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,010
Can't build on it and
it's fucking pointless.

46
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,170
But can you camp on it?

47
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,033
You could camp on it.

48
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,980
They can't take him
Billy garden permanent.

49
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,810
Can you have a permanent tent?

50
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:07,991
Yeah,

51
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:11,020
but me and a bunch of pikeys
ob fucking t w o pikeys.

52
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,591
Yeah Dude,

53
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:15,860
I've been obsessing about watching
these Irish travelers fights.

54
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,720
Can we,

55
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,553
some of the uncles,

56
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,331
oh my God,

57
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:20,680
they have some of the best fights,

58
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,980
dude.

59
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,641
You got to Brian,

60
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:22,600
you got to look this up.

61
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,620
They're boring as shit.

62
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,270
I mean most of these guys,

63
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,680
but they're tough guys and everything.

64
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:29,530
But there's a different style of
fighting when you fight bare knuckle and

65
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,720
literally they stand there and
volunteer themselves in the face.

66
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,240
It's not like a street fight like you've
seen in the states have used that once.

67
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,710
They challenge each other when
they challenge each other.

68
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:37,890
How,

69
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,920
I'll tell you that Johnny.

70
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,550
Johnny Mac.

71
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,850
Yeah.

72
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,720
You're good for nothing.

73
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,670
That's how you are gonna happen and yeah,

74
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,410
cause I thought Boston's Heidi of hall.

75
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:44,950
I'll tell you,

76
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,783
I don't know.

77
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,790
I'll fight cha anytime before Christmas.

78
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,450
Any.

79
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:49,790
I thought,

80
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,140
goodness me,

81
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,660
there's a beauty.

82
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,100
I mean,

83
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,770
there's a video of of a
pikey driving to a street.

84
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,011
They said,

85
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:54,140
well,

86
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,720
meet what?

87
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,120
Be a according to the click to flies.

88
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,963
It uploads it.

89
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
And whoever knows that
one between me cause I,

90
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,590
I tweeted it a while ago.

91
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,610
It's really hilarious,

92
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:06,040
but I can't find it in my Twitter
while the show is going on.

93
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,750
But I want to play it because it's so,

94
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:11,050
it's so ridiculous to see something
really disturbing Irish travelers.

95
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,141
Then there,

96
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,990
there were talking shit
before street fight.

97
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,130
It's even better than the actual

98
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,350
most disturbing pikey video on
there is most disturbing one.

99
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,900
Every week someone's listening that
knows exactly what I'm talking about at.

100
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,150
Please tweet it to Joe and me and Brian,

101
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
it is pikey gets what he deserves
and it's a bunch of a British school,

102
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,000
kids in a park having beers,

103
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,080
snorting coke,

104
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,130
smoking weed,

105
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,771
and a pike,

106
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,020
you will comes up and he won.

107
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,270
But it's all done post.

108
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,591
It's a,

109
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,760
it's a recount of the British kid going.

110
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,790
So a little pikey comes up
and he wants to little drink.

111
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,391
He wants a thing.

112
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,260
I didn't do this and that.

113
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,040
Well,

114
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,350
we tell them it's cocaine,

115
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,760
but guess who just got a nose full of k,

116
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:54,250
a special k and they cut in the pike.

117
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:56,110
He is fucking seizuring on the ground.

118
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,670
It's bulky.

119
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,933
Sketchy.

120
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,520
Breaks your heart because you go,

121
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,421
that guy's helpless.

122
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,710
He's in a k hole right now.

123
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,320
He's not coming out
anytime soon and it's all,

124
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,180
it's if you've,

125
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,030
if you type in Brian of you typing
pikey gets what he deserves,

126
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,650
park or something like that,

127
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,060
you'll see it and it fucking,

128
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:13,631
you just go,

129
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:13,841

130
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,770
that shit happens.

131
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,270
That fucking happens.

132
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,313
That does happen.

133
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,040
But manuals pikey fights were gripe.

134
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,400
Fucking was obsessed
with those for a while.

135
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,351
Here's one of them.

136
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:23,160

you got two things
playing at the same time.

171
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,741
It's two things.

172

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,890

Let's see how good they can get.

292
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:18,901
Oh fuck.

293
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:19,800
I want to do one tonight.

294
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,170
I want to do with the second we get done.

295
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,681
Brian,

296
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,514
get a camera.

297
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,810
I'm doing to reply to that guy.

298
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,381
What's his name?

299
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:26,214
Big John.

300
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,211
And I'm going to be dead.

301
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:27,781
Fucking serious.

302
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,980
So big John sees and either,

303
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,371
you know,

304
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:30,204
he doesn't get irony.

305
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,380
He's gonna be sitting
in this trailer going,

306
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,530
who the fuck on is the slow
modem that he's got to use these?

307
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,321
Use these.

308
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:41,430
John Haley was going to
use these shirts coming off

309
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,620
the shirt coming off as a strange move.

310
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,470
Cause especially I don't give a fuck move.

311
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,660
It's like that white rapper that
I was talking about earlier,

312
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,071
who is,

313
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:49,781
he takes his shirt off.

314
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:50,010
It's like,

315
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,101
Oh,

316
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:50,581
do Kumu.

317
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:51,780
Fuck the guy with Birdman.

318
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,381
I don't know,

319
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:53,280
but he didn't give a fuck.

320
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,690
His whole thing was that
he didn't give a fuck.

321
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,081
Well,

322
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,850
this guy basically is
doing the same thing.

323
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,690
He doesn't give a fuck.

324
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,621
It takes his shirt off.

325
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,030
He knows he's fat and love it.

326
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,040
He knows he's not
pressing shirt comes off.

327
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:02,690
That's when the fuck,

328
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,350
what's up Phil Baroni under there.

329
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,831
You know,

330
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:05,664
that's not a,

331
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,440
that's not a young Randy coture.

332
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,010
Come on,

333
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,843
son.

334
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,770
What are you looking at for now,

335
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:10,031
Brian?

336
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,270
You're looking at Irish funerals,

337
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,880
the bagpipes and buttholes.

338
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,580
It's like buffaloes.

339
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,413
Put the bag pipes

340
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,881
grown man.

341
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:17,630
Ladies and gentlemen.
