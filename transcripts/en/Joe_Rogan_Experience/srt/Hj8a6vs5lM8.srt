1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,940
Sweet baby.
Jesus.

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,520
We're back again.
Hala,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,880
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight fuck 

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,460
was that?
That's just my new shit.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm ready.
I'm ready for a new opening.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,750
Allah.
Allah.

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,850
God,
what's up?

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,150
What's up?
That's going to be the new thing.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,750
Just like that.
Boys,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,110
Joe Rogan.
Just gentle.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,820
That's the new thing.
Brian,

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,850
go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the fleshlight

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,310
and entering the code name Brogan and 
save yourself.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,820
Fifteen percent of the number one sex 
toy for men,

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,760
right?
Brian?

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,660
They were there when no one believed in 
us.

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,690
They believed in me until I got one.
Fuck are you say you're not helping sell

18
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,880
shit.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

19
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,160
You creepy bitch.
Has Michael told me to.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,200
Oh,
well,

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,010
Michael Rupert told you to wear 
sunglasses.

22
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:01,530
I would say wear sunglasses.
Maybe know something.

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,940
I would like to get those sunglasses 
that Rowdy Roddy Piper had.

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,090
Yeah.
Do you imagine if they had douche bag 

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,090
sunglasses?
Only sunglasses.

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,090
Holy Shit.
I was looking at those going,

27
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,030
I want a pair of those.
How awesome was having nice claimed.

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,580
It was amazing shit.
We're also sponsored by onnit Dotcom,

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,980
makers of Alpha brain,
the cognitive enhancing supplement,

30
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,190
if you're interested in these are any 
alpha brain or any of the other 

31
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,241
nootropics that we have.
We have a new moon which is a five htp 

32
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:32,820
and serotonin boosting supplement.
We have this stuff called shroom tech,

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,160
which is let's get a lot of [inaudible] 
in it and quarter seps mushrooms and 

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,061
it's an endurance enhancing supplement 
and there's another one called shroom 

35
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:44,900
tech immune,
which is a fascinating one where it's a 

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,170
mushroom that actually tricks your body 
into thinking your body has a cold and 

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,460
so it pumps up your immune system for a 
fight that never takes place.

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,100
I'm not explaining it as well as it can 
be explained,

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,160
but if you go to [inaudible] dot com,
that's o n n I t you can get all the 

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,601
information on it.
The way we have it set up is the way 

41
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:03,060
we're trying to rip people off the 
least,

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,120
and by that I mean you,
when you order the first set of 30 

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,210
pills,
if you ordered from us,

44
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:14,211
if you don't like it,
you get a hundred percent money back 

45
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:14,211
guarantee.
You don't have to return it.

46
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:14,970
You just say,
this stuff sucks.

47
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:17,820
I'm not into it and you get all your 
money back.

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,360
We want to make sure that people are not
number one,

49
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,540
don't feel ripped off before we even 
think about making money.

50
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,150
And these are all things that I've 
taken.

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,760
I've taken a bunch of them.
I always talk about a bill,

52
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:32,910
Roman [inaudible] neuro one a,
which is a great one.

53
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,910
I,
I started taking that years ago and 

54
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,660
that's how I actually do name no name 
from,

55
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,020
uh,
the uh,

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,800
Alice Morning Radio Show,
Sarah,

57
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,440
no name.
Oh yeah,

58
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,130
he's a good guy.
Yeah.

59
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:49,131
No name was working out with Roman.
And his turned me onto that neuro one 

60
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:49,410
stuff.
And that was when I first got interested

61
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,480
in nootropics,
but it's a,

62
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,490
it's a very complex and fascinating area
of study.

63
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,020
And uh,
there's a,

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,130
there's,
there's debates on both sides of the 

65
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,320
arguments that are fascinating,
but I've been using them for a long time

66
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:07,321
and I absolutely believe in them.
I can feel the difference between when 

67
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:07,321
I'm not.
And when I am,

68
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:07,870
I feel like,
I think clear.

69
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,871
I feel like it gives me a,
a more fluid connection with my 

70
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:13,480
thoughts,
if that makes any sense.

71
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,740
Everybody's different if it doesn't,
doesn't really hold up water for you.

72
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,840
Like we said,
100 percent money back guarantee.

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,910
Try it out.
Entering the code name,

74
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,780
Rogan and save yourself 10 percent.
All you already bitches.

75
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,330
Michael ropers.
Here we're,

76
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,250
we're,
we're fend to get to the bottom of shit.

77
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,870
I always wanted to say that we're 
fender.

78
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,750
I wish I could say without irony,
the Joe Rogan experience

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,290
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

80
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,090
Just to clear things up.
There's a lot of people in the MMA 

81
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,090
world.
They're saying,

82
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,350
hey man,
Nick Diaz no show to a match with 

83
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,230
Braulio esteem when they were supposed 
to have a Jujitsu superfight and Nick 

84
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,290
Diaz no showed.
And they said,

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,380
are you going to take him off your,
the opening your podcast?

86
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,420
And I was like,
how dare you,

87
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,350
how dare you suggest that I would ever 
take Nick Diaz off the opening of my 

88
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,061
podcast?
That was one of the greatest moments of 

89
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:14,061
my life,
sir.

90
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:14,061
I love it.
It's my,

91
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,540
one of my favorite parts and I don't 
know why he knows,

92
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,860
showed.
I'm sure he had his reasons.

93
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,580
You know,
I don't,

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,050
I don't know what the fuck happened 
behind the scenes.

95
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,060
I don't know who pissed him off.
You can't piss that dude off.

96
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,050
Alright.
If you want,

97
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,600
if you want that to defy,
everything has to be smooth as silk,

98
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:25,650
like the UFC.

99
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,390
There's no bullshit.
Everything's handled.

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Everybody.
Everybody's smooth and professional and 

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,400
it goes off without a hitch and he has 
no problems with anybody,

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,430
but you can't be pissing that dude off.
And then expecting him to show up.

103
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,050
He'll just,
he'll just vanish on you.

104
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,110
What was the wizard some controversy 
like was there a reason that he got 

105
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,110
pissed off?
There was a weight issue.

106
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,950
Apparently they were supposed to fight 
at,

107
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,951
uh,
they were supposed to weigh in at 180 

108
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:50,811
pounds,
hundred and 85 pounds a day of the 

109
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:51,210
match.
Like you had to weigh ins and apparently

110
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:53,130
braulio esteem.
I didn't know this.

111
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,160
And then he,
he weighed in in the morning,

112
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,690
he lost the weight,
he had to cut weight.

113
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:02,691
He had a cut like nine pounds,
so he cut the weight and he waited in 

114
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:03,930
the morning and then he,
then he rehydrated and,

115
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,730
but the confusion of him not being on 
weight or not knowing what the weight is

116
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,470
or when to weigh in,
it's real.

117
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,470
That's,
that's where it gets confusing because 

118
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:15,510
it seems like it's the fault of the 
organizers.

119
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:20,511
It seems like there was,
there's a big confusion as to like when 

120
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,960
this was all supposed to go down.
And then of course with Nick Diaz,

121
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,950
you see,
like I said,

122
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,480
he can't piss them off if you piss him 
off.

123
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,430
He's just not just show up,
you know,

124
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:28,800
and they fuck they fucked up in that 
regard.

125
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,660
They should have had everything working 
nice and smooth.

126
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,790
But I don't,
you know,

127
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
I,
you can't excuse it.

128
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,860
It was,
I would have loved to seen it,

129
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,840
man.
Nick is a bad motherfucker,

130
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,870
you know,
and for him to have the kind of 

131
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,611
confidence to get in there with Braulio 
Braulio is one of the two or three best 

132
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,300
Jujitsu guys in the world.
I mean,

133
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:50,301
he's amazing and it is a pure grappler 
mean he taps out other amazing,

134
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:53,280
pure grapplers,
very smart guy,

135
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,540
you know,
and you know,

136
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,380
it sucks for him more than anything 
because,

137
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,620
you know,
he came over here from England for this.

138
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,620
This is like a big moment for him as a 
representative of the best Jujitsu 

139
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,511
that's currently available to have a 
grappling match against what is a 

140
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,980
representative of the best martial 
artists to mixed martial arts.

141
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,970
We have available.
I mean,

142
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,040
Nick Diaz is in the elite of the elite,
you know,

143
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,280
he's right up there with the top guys in
the world as far as MMA is concerned,

144
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,520
as is Braulio in Jujitsu.
And so that would be so fascinating to 

145
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,760
see them go at it.
And it sucks that it didn't work out.

146
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,400
I don't know why it didn't work out,
but uh,

147
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,630
it seems like all these guys have weight
issues,

148
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:33,980
so like that's a huge problem.
Why don't they just have like four girls

149
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:38,981
on staff?
They just have to focus on weight 

150
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,471
issues.
They seem like they would be pros at 

151
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:41,471
that.
Well they won't,

152
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:44,021
you know,
you gotta leave that shit up to a 

153
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:44,021
fighter,
you know,

154
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,481
and this is a,
this is a different sort of situation 

155
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:46,520
because there was a lot of confusion 
apparently as to when they were supposed

156
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,570
to weigh in and different people like 
Nick Diaz waiting in one day and Braulio

157
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,820
awaiting in the morning and the next 
days there's obvious confusion.

158
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,280
I don't,
I don't know exactly what happened.

159
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,160
You would have to sit both guys down at 
sort of piece the argument out,

160
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:03,161
but it sucks.
I was just trying to get an idea that 

161
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:03,200
has some girls on staff just trying to 
help the guy out.

162
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,820
Ladies and gentlemen,
Michael per tier.

163
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,250
And he's going to get down to the bottom
of things.

164
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Michael Rupert's been,
I've heard that Fox magic is 

165
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,920
particularly strong this type of month.
Fox magic been working,

166
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,970
so this time when the Fox magazine,
it's has been magic and all over the 

167
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,100
place and yeah.
Yeah,

168
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,440
but as far as what's going on,
that's what I came down here to find 

169
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,440
out.
I had to talk to you to figure it out.

170
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,980
I don't know if I have any answers for 
you.

171
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,100
So I have a feeling.
Anything that we come out of my mouth is

172
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:42,101
pure speculation.
Good from someone who's completely 

173
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:42,101
unqualified.

174
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,780
Well,
let's speculate at all over the place.

175
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,350
Just a ton of shit going on and there've
been some major changes and,

176
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,670
and,
and as far as my life goes,

177
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:55,880
things are changing for the good all 
over the place.

178
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,440
I've left.
Collapsed net.

179
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,080
No.
Explain for the folks who are 

180
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,080
uninitiated,
what is collapsed?

181
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Net

182
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,350
collapsing network,
a collapsed net.com.

183
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,170
Naco lapse.net.
Uh,

184
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:07,900
it's,
it's a,

185
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:11,310
it's a company we started two years ago,
uh,

186
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,610
after the movie,
the duck collapse came out and it,

187
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,670
it's purpose was to help people to 
prepare for the collapse of human 

188
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,410
industrial civilization,
which is well underway right now.

189
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,950
And over the two years we've grown to 
six members in 68 countries and we got 

190
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:34,171
really busy.
We specialize in bringing a really 

191
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:35,530
accurate news reports from all over the 
world.

192
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,200
It gives us a real picture and telling 
people what's really going on,

193
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,900
but also connecting them through a 
directory,

194
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,460
a with 1600 handpicked entries that's 
free the lighthouse directory for.

195
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,630
So the lights are just going on,
maybe it's a good idea to grow food or 

196
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,070
maybe there's going to be more blackouts
or maybe this,

197
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,340
that so,
and a lot of work has been done or the 

198
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,440
course of a couple of decades by a lot 
of people.

199
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
So we bring all that data there so you 
don't have to reinvent the wheel.

200
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,710
And then we bring a lot of great feature
writers and stuff.

201
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,760
So,
um,

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,940
it got to be big and we had some big 
challenges.

203
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,460
We got a massively cyber attack this 
year,

204
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,270
man.
They just,

205
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,330
Oh,
they just laid into us twice this year.

206
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,310
And uh,
we had some big struggles,

207
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,311
but the way it,
the way it all evolved and one of my 

208
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,470
lines is like evolve or perish,
you know,

209
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,670
grow up or die.
And one of my big spiritual lessons now 

210
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,860
it's about letting go.
It's not,

211
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,370
it's,
you know,

212
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:33,000
it's letting go.
That really gives me more options.

213
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:38,001
And so anyway,
isn't it funny that you figured it out 

214
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:38,001
like later in life?
Everybody does.

215
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:38,790
Oh yeah.
Well when you're young,

216
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,890
it's like the big problem.
I spent,

217
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:43,230
uh,
21 years in 12 step and,

218
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,940
and I lived that program.

219
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,670
So letting go came to be,
um,

220
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,400
something you practice when confronted 
with,

221
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,370
you know,
so letting go of collapse,

222
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,010
that turned out to be perfect.
I gave the ownership back to the,

223
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,720
you know,
and I'm out completely,

224
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:01,590
but now they don't have to pay my salary
and they're all on their own and they're

225
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,320
just so energized and they're just so on
fire.

226
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,000
And now I get to step back a little bit 
cause I'm a tired motherfucker,

227
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,190
you know,
I've been at this a long time.

228
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Do you ever put nice stories on like,
like someone found a box of kittens and 

229
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:22,440
they were powering and beautiful smile.
We went home and they had a great time

230
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
day and a new episode of game of thrones
was on and we watched it and it was 

231
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,790
awesome and they had fox news.
You.

232
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,250
What kind of music is that?
Fox Magic Song.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
We,
we have a sound for it now.

234
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,460
Do you think it's possible that 
civilization one arms?

235
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,170
Is it possible that we're just stumbling
and that will,

236
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,000
uh,
will balance out?

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,840
Is that possible?

238
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,050
Well,
absolutely.

239
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Totally.
That's one of the reasons why I'm going 

240
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,090
through this big change.
I mean we not only did I in two books in

241
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:59,491
the movie and everything else kinda 
predict all of this stuff based upon a 

242
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,030
model that said that that means 
civilization is collapsing.

243
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:04,000
So if you see these symptoms,
there's a pretty good chance that's what

244
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:08,500
the disease is a.
But now just recently,

245
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Fukushima is so totally out of control.
Reactor number two is so hot that any 

246
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:19,420
robots they send to the reactor get 
fried and so they can't get into work on

247
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:22,210
this melted core that's lying at the 
bottom and,

248
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,600
and then they've said no machines that 
can handle that.

249
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,790
Radiation have even been designed yet.
Oh,

250
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:32,791
okay.
That leaves a reactor to act building 

251
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:32,791
for with all the raw.

252
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,610
That's it.
I think it's amazing that someone made 

253
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,460
nuclear reactors in the first place.
I think it's amazing.

254
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,210
Yeah.
You know,

255
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,920
I,
I did a joke about it in my act,

256
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:44,921
but it really is fascinating that you 
can build something like that,

257
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
that you can't shut off,
that someone allowed them to build 

258
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,651
something like that where in some 
unmeasurable event or the power gets 

259
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:54,190
shut off and can't

260
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,070
get back on and time.
It's fucked forever.

261
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,100
There are 450 more reactors around the 
Santa no phrase just had a major 

262
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,300
breakdown.
Where's that?

263
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,810
That's in San Clemente on the way to San
Diego.

264
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,730
Really?
And they had a major.

265
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,060
It's down all seasons,
so you guys in Los Angeles are going to 

266
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,050
be having some,
some humongous blackouts this summer.

267
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,490
Really?
And Brownouts.

268
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,570
Yeah,
I'm surprised.

269
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,490
See,
we had that on collapsed in it,

270
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,710
but they hide it from you in the 
mainstream news here.

271
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,780
That's why collapsed.
That's so good at what we do.

272
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,130
Whoa.
So because of the.

273
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,510
What's wrong with the reactor?
That's the one though.

274
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:35,511
You see when you drive down the reactor 
number two at Santa Ana for a right by 

275
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:38,821
Camp Pendleton on that.
So it's a weird feeling to drive by and 

276
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:38,821
see a nuclear reactor.
Two,

277
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,830
there was problems with the cooling 
pipes and then I think they were 

278
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,310
checking another reactor g,
the x rays showed some faulty piping,

279
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:49,540
but now the reactor is offline 
indefinitely.

280
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,630
It is such a stupid fucking idea.
The idea that you can make something.

281
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,020
You can never shut off the the.
That you would do that.

282
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,820
Yeah.
That's so arrogant.

283
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,740
It's so incredibly arrogant because if 
it fucks up and people were like,

284
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,830
well,
most of the time it's clean and safe.

285
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,100
What are you banking on?
If you look at the permanence of any 

286
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,361
fuck up,
it would a massive amount of time it 

287
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,690
takes before that area is not deadly to 
go near.

288
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,870
If you look at the fuck up,
that's we're talking about thousands of 

289
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,870
years.
Japan is dead.

290
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,930
Japan is mortally wounded and I've been 
saying so far and it's clear.

291
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,310
J Japan's economy is imploding.
They,

292
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,360
they,
they are now a net importer.

293
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Their debt is like a 280 percent of GDP.
And how are they getting their power 

294
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,480
now?
Very good question.

295
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Japan has replaced a was at a Japanese 
impression by the way.

296
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,120
No,
I couldn't do better one if you don't do

297
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:54,870
that.
No,

298
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,150
no,
no.

299
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,510
So,
so Japan was what happened,

300
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,370
what?
They're running emergency diesel widely,

301
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,490
uh,
which is a diesel is a whole separate 

302
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,460
issue worldwide,
but they're running a diesel.

303
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,700
They're burning now.
Fuel oil and coal oil,

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,110
which,
excuse me,

305
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,310
two grades of Oil but,
and they're importing liquefied natural 

306
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,870
gas now that's where you build this 
$450,

307
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:27,871
million dollar floating,
gigantic bomb of liquid liquified 

308
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:30,610
natural gas.
And you floated across and you know,

309
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,670
one of those things would,
it is almost the size of an atom bomb 

310
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,780
goes off.
This is energy desperation,

311
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:41,830
but once and when you talk about diesel,
you know,

312
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:46,831
don't buy a diesel now and here's why.
Diesel shortage all over the world in 

313
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:47,500
India,
they got 30,000

314
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,980
generators to,
to,

315
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,710
to handle blackouts at the Taj Mahal

316
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,440
and,
and,

317
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,240
and the city that's around that.
We ran that story twice on,

318
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,570
on collapsed net and there are so many 
blackouts in India and Pakistan,

319
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,940
they're all burning diesel and they're 
shorter coal.

320
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,370
I mean it's happening all around the 
world right now.

321
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,810
But diesel's in really short supply.

322
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,760
What are they going to do with all these
nuclear power plants?

323
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,260
They can't shut them down.
Right?

324
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,820
There's no way you can,
you,

325
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,650
you can't.
Like it's not.

326
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,490
You can't shut it off

327
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,300
off.
Well,

328
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,230
if you combine that,
let me just take it a little bit further

329
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:20,910
ahead to where the point of all this is 
going.

330
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,610
Okay.
Because from four different directions,

331
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,270
they ain't gonna shut the nuclear power 
plants off.

332
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,280
They can't control what the got a and B,
because electricity is industrial 

333
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:32,820
civilization.
Yeah,

334
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,980
right.
Have industrial articulates.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
To put something like that in an area 
where it's close to humans,

336
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,670
it seeds the idea that you can 
completely contain that insane amount of

337
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:51,671
energy.
It's like it's so arrogant that that's 

338
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:52,300
one prong of a fork.
Yeah.

339
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,980
Fukushima here.
The second prompt,

340
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,600
one of the aides,
you know what happened?

341
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,810
AIDS AIDS just put it out and come out 
of the gate like Tyson.

342
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,660
No.
AIDS was killing people left and right,

343
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,940
but now you hardly hear about aids 
anymore.

344
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,910
It's the best diet in Hollywood right 
now.

345
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,830
It also generates a lot of medical and 
money in the.

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,220
In the medical business.
Do you ever read like that?

347
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,710
Peter Duesberg stuff?
A long time.

348
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,090
Who he is.
He's the guy.

349
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,730
He's the biologist from the University 
of California Berkeley,

350
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,880
and his claim is something along the 
lines of that HIV is like a weak virus 

351
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,730
and I may be paraphrasing here and that 
when you're seeing it in people,

352
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:32,290
most likely it's because they have a 
weakened immune system.

353
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,300
That nor a strong healthy immune system 
fights off HIV fairly easily that it's 

354
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,951
not the culprit of aids but rather a 
symptom of a depleted immune system 

355
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,550
that's from a variety of different 
things and you know,

356
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,620
it's,
it's a crazy argument because if it's 

357
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,891
true,
it's like how could this only this guy 

358
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:51,260
be figuring that out is one biologist 
and all these other guys,

359
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,480
they haven't noticed that.
I don't trust that tricky.

360
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,250
I don't trust any of the science behind,
but it's possible.

361
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,840
That's not possible though.
Right?

362
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,720
I mean it's not possible that that AIDS 
is a hoax.

363
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,460
That's not possible.
That's not possible,

364
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,890
but it is definitely possible and it was
man made.

365
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,230
Right.
But it's a real diversity is definitely 

366
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,830
possible that it was intentionally 
released.

367
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,240
You really,
you think you feel like,

368
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,910
yeah,
I've seen this was goes way,

369
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,190
way back to like the nineties when I saw
these,

370
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:24,191
but these were who document showing the 
first outbreak of aids and at know and 

371
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,600
superimposed were who vaccination 
programs and there was a like a perfect 

372
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,560
match.
Wow.

373
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,010
Yeah.
I don't want A.

374
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,010
Obviously

375
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,570
I'm no biologist,
but I don't see how one guy could be out

376
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:41,440
there saying something like that and all
of his peers disagree.

377
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,030
Is that how it works?
I mean,

378
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:47,590
obviously people think that HIV causes 
AIDS isn't this guy's mind.

379
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,910
He's like,
these people were all.

380
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,340
I think it's is that it was a drug abuse
and uh,

381
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,670
you know,
partying and he was,

382
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,370
that's what he was attributing to their,
uh,

383
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,430
their depleted states that they were 
doing like crystal meth and rappers and 

384
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,360
Emile nitrate stuff and that apparently 
his immune system crushing this aim on 

385
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,460
nitrates.
That was big in the eight seventies.

386
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,980
Why?
I mean,

387
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,670
when I was a cop,
I ran into a mill on the street.

388
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,850
What would they do?
Just pop it and then they smell it or 

389
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:16,850
something like that.
I'll see it.

390
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,800
Sam Kennison had a business,
the story of the funniest dead body I 

391
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:21,800
have ever seen in my life.
You want to.

392
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,120
Are you sending my life?
Yes.

393
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,750
All right.
This is,

394
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I swear this is true.
I was working Wilshire Division and I 

395
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,310
was a p three,
had two stripes and every Christmas cops

396
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:36,530
from one division will go cover for 
another division one,

397
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,060
it has its Christmas party,
you know,

398
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,910
so we were covering for Hollywood 
divisions Christmas party.

399
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:45,911
So I'm,
I'm driving up around Hollywood and we 

400
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:45,911
get a call six,
eight,

401
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:46,440
42,
uh,

402
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,740
meet the Ra dead body,
such and such address and maybe on 

403
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,241
Cherokee some.
So the Ra is a rescue ambulance so we 

404
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:58,370
pull up and it's,
it's a three story standard,

405
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,940
California really bare bones,
interior courtyard,

406
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:06,080
open about balconies and it's up on the 
third floor.

407
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:11,081
And so me and my partner would go 
walking down and I noticed that the 

408
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:13,430
paramedics are just outside the laughing
their asses off.

409
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,060
They're down on their knees,
they're laughing so hard.

410
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay,
I don't go on.

411
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,450
Okay guys,
this is the dead body called right.

412
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,850
And at what point?
And so I go in and there's this dead guy

413
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:32,090
on the floor.
And he was a,

414
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,570
I would say,
young twentyish light skin African 

415
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,391
American guy.
I'm a in a Frederick's of Hollywood 

416
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,060
negligee.

417
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,620
Hello.

418
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,710
And,
and he was laying on the floor and kind 

419
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,740
of Spread Eagle and I looked in,
there is a broomstick pool protruding 

420
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,340
from,
you know,

421
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,540
where,
okay.

422
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,640
But there's only about a foot of it 
protruding from,

423
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,300
you know,
where.

424
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,010
Oh God.
And,

425
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,700
and,
uh,

426
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,520
so,
uh,

427
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,350
the table had been pushed up against a 
guy.

428
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,160
It was easy to figure it.
He,

429
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,330
I guess this will be for a man,
could buy a sex toy or something,

430
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:16,331
I don't know,
but he had been up masturbating on the 

431
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:19,841
table with the broom and the purpose of 
the aml was to strike it right as you 

432
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:20,360
come.
Right.

433
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,090
But what it does is it gives you an 
involuntary back spasm.

434
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,720
And Oh my God,
that's my aim.

435
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,980
Well,
nitrate story and the broomstick went up

436
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:35,960
his ass and killed him.
He looks satisfied.

437
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:36,610
Um,
what a,

438
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,320
what a to way to

439
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,950
go,
man.

440
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Yeah.
There's been a bunch of dudes that have 

441
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,220
gone as fixation style,
right?

442
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,630
That's like the nxs guy

443
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,260
carrying a pussy shit.
Because like a real guy would do it the 

444
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,750
other way with the broom coming at you 
from the Bristol part side.

445
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,290
That's,
that's the real way to know.

446
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,340
Look like a man.
Men.

447
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,360
It is West Hollywood shit.
That's how I can talk a gay samoans 

448
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:10,120
handle it until you to rite of passage.
Got to use a broom the other way.

449
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,920
Humor was good,
but you chick.

450
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,400
Yeah,
that's a dumb way to die.

451
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,500
Do you think one of the things I heard 
is like the big,

452
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,990
the big conspiracy that would be that if
you wanted to shame a person you would 

453
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,140
kill them and make it look like they 
died.

454
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,670
Masturbating like an idiot.
I mean that's like in a couple of Nwa,

455
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:35,671
so gay porns around like that would.
That would be the ultimate joke if you 

456
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:39,010
found your buddy dead like alright,
he's dead.

457
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,170
So listen,
there's nothing I can do about that,

458
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:46,171
but what I can do is put his dick in his
hand and put a bunch of gay porns all 

459
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,720
around them and then take pictures of 
him and they'll put it online.

460
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,130
I got you the last,
the last one.

461
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,930
Come on.
That would be high.

462
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,620
Hilarious.

463
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,660
If you knew,
if you knew that guy and you loved him 

464
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,420
and it's like the one last jokey get out
of them,

465
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,580
that's so fucked up.
It's so fucked up.

466
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,480
It's so fucked up,
but it would be hilarious whole.

467
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,710
You gotta have a good sense of humor.
Come on man.

468
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,670
That's hilarious.
All right.

469
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,990
I think that you remember that.
Yeah,

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,140
I remember that too.
Bitch.

471
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,060
That sucks.
Why do you even release that into the 

472
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,630
photos of you out there with Dixon,
your hand and your mouth and that's the 

473
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,520
golden rule of the Internet.
Imagine her real life conspiracy against

474
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,270
you nails back.
Oh No.

475
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,940
It's not real like a whooper went with 
the sunglasses on.

476
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:37,900
That's when he's gonna.
Get deep.

477
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
It's not a weird thing like that.
That's a cool guy thing to wear your 

478
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:43,800
sunglasses.
You know we're.

479
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,160
We're thing.
I tell you one thing,

480
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,990
new meme with sunglasses.

481
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,270
Come down and go to deal with it.
I love it.

482
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,900
That come from.
How did.

483
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,920
I love it too,
but where did it originate?

484
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,910
What is that from?
I don't know how to deal with it.

485
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,210
It's everywhere though.
I see it all.

486
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,070
It's all over the place.
Sunglasses dropped down,

487
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,690
deal with it.
It's beautiful.

488
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,900
But how did sunglasses to be cool?
I don't even know what that means.

489
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,000
What that means is whatever you know you
have issue with,

490
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,010
why don't you just fucking deal with it 
and leave me alone.

491
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,310
No deal with it.
Get out of my face.

492
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,090
Well,
he's a cool guy.

493
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:19,090
He's got a sunglasses on.
Super Cool.

494
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,230
Yeah,
but why?

495
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,910
Why not?
How does that make you cool?

496
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:24,070
Well,
how did sunglasses become something that

497
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:24,790
makes you cool?
Right?

498
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,400
Because you look different.
You had your eyes or you look like.

499
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,870
Now you look like a fly.

500
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,870
You look like,
you know I've been wanting to do right 

501
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,880
there.
Those are actually pretty dope record 

502
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:38,880
hd,
but those are Oakley's,

503
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,220
right?
No,

504
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:39,760
they're not.
No,

505
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:41,870
they're just.
They're a hoaxes.

506
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,620
That is amazing.
That's hd.

507
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,770
What a world we live in.
How long before you get a chip in your 

508
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,621
eyeball that just does that?
You don't have to have seven days with 

509
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:53,621
this.
Probably going to be.

510
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:54,920
We're going to be in certain shit into 
our bodies.

511
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:59,921
Eventually they're going to give you 
something that just works way better 

512
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:02,590
like this.
All you need is this one little 

513
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:02,780
microprocessor in your body and you will
never have a disease again.

514
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,340
It just bang.
You have like this microprocessor that 

515
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,291
regulates your body.
They put it right in your pituitary 

516
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:11,291
gland,
in your body,

517
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:15,941
like a little micro messenger,
and then that shit's going to start 

518
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:15,941
getting viruses,
but every 10 years they have to give you

519
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,690
a brain surgery and opening up to change
the battery.

520
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,910
What do you think?
Yeah,

521
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,170
but imagine if that,
that computer,

522
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,160
that computer inside you,
that computer inside your fixes all the 

523
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,350
diseases and all this shit,
and then that computer gets.

524
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,780
He gets a virus,
so you have to start making medicine to 

525
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,440
help that computer.
So you put the virus,

526
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:40,441
it turns you gay minds in that all of a 
sudden you just could not stop your gay 

527
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:42,590
urges.
That would probably be the first thing.

528
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,850
Virus John Travolta had that and all 
this time people were just being mean to

529
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,130
him and they don't know that he has a 
disease.

530
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,460
He has a genetically designed like a 
disease from like the Russians.

531
00:24:57,021 --> 00:25:02,021
Maybe if you know,
if you wanted to do that and make some 

532
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:02,780
like super aggressively gay.
The government has worked on this,

533
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,890
right?
This is not a joke.

534
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:05,000
Michael Rupert,
we're back me up.

535
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,860
I remember in during a rack they were.

536
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,020
They were trying to figure out how to 
make a gay bomb.

537
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,620
This is not a joke they have using God 
can guarantee that with all of the 

538
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,200
hundreds and hundreds of billions of 
dollars that the black ops community has

539
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:21,110
had to work with in the secret budget.
All these years,

540
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:24,740
they have tried every stupid fucking 
thing in the world.

541
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:29,180
You could think of.
This idea was that they were going to be

542
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:33,830
able to spray something down like 
something blows up over these guys.

543
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,960
It sprays all over them and it makes him
gay.

544
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,140
I mean they were really like looking 
into the possibility that they thought 

545
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,931
it would demoralize them.
Did they ever hear about the Greeks and 

546
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:45,200
the Romans?
Some of the greatest fucking soldiers of

547
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,060
all time.
They were bone in each other constantly.

548
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,940
The Samurai's boned each other too.
There's dudes,

549
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:52,670
bone dudes back then and they were 
cutting heads off every day.

550
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,890
There was a wild time.
You know,

551
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:56,780
you can't think that,
you know,

552
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,440
making these people guy is gonna.
Make a better fighters.

553
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,270
Well you don't want to fight for their 
boyfriend now.

554
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Fuck you up.
That's what the system does with pretty 

555
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,580
much everything.
It takes something and it bends it.

556
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,660
It twists it so that you accept a way to
look at it.

557
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,900
That is a basic fundamental lie.
Anyway.

558
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,300
No,
I don't think gay or non gay has shit to

559
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,310
do with how good a warrior you are.
Exactly.

560
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,140
Yeah.
There's a lot of gay dudes that can beat

561
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:22,370
the fuck out of,
you know,

562
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,600
data kick once by a dyke as a cost.
What I did,

563
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,270
she was six,
two and she could bench like to 60 or 

564
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:32,270
something.
Oh my God.

565
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,130
Did you underestimate her?
Did she charge you like what happened?

566
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,950
We just call,
it was a 4:15

567
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:39,280
fight at a bar and it was for 15 
minutes.

568
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,570
That's a place call for disturbance,
you know,

569
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,980
it's 4:20
really pot.

570
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,080
No,
that

571
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,580
had nothing to do with police.
I said that's a colloquialism.

572
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,750
It's a native,
you know.

573
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,520
But as far as lapd,
you know,

574
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:56,610
I never heard of for 20th.
How did for 20 become pot?

575
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,610
Anybody?
It's probably a good history behind that

576
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,220
might be a code in some county in 
northern California.

577
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,300
Okay.
So I'm sorry.

578
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,990
So for 15 comes out.
Yeah.

579
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,450
And go to visit it.
It's,

580
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,390
it's a,
it's a when we go in and you know,

581
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,850
and there's,
and you know,

582
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
she was fighting somebody else and I go 
to step in and she and she was walk

583
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,280
flying across the room when you got to 
be really careful because big women can 

584
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,480
knock you the fuck out.
That's for real.

585
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,880
There's some big women out there that 
can knock you the fuck out.

586
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,850
I know I checked.
It's only like 130 plus pounds.

587
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:35,851
Maybe like 1:40.
My friend Tommy Junior's girlfriend 

588
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:35,851
Katie,
and she can punch a fucking hole in your

589
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:35,980
face.
Man.

590
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,130
This chick knows how to punch like and 
she's a strong girl.

591
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:40,720
There's girls out there that can fuck 
you up.

592
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,320
You got to be careful,
especially if they sucker punch you.

593
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,280
Oh,
that's terrible.

594
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,690
There's a great video though.
Some fucking asshole who's yelling and 

595
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,791
screaming at this woman and she grabs 
him by the collars and headbutts and 

596
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,800
knocks him unconscious.
It was like a security camera in front 

597
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,931
of a bar.
The guy was just being a drunk douche 

598
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:00,931
bag and the girl,
the girl is bad ass man.

599
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,470
She was like a fucking character in a 
movie.

600
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:03,040
Cool.
I mean,

601
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,920
she wasn't a big girl,
but she grabs him by the collar and just

602
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,500
fucking headbutts and right in the chin.
The dude goes out.

603
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,290
It was hilarious.
Yeah,

604
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,280
it's a beautiful video.
Have you ever seen it,

605
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:14,010
Brian?
Pull it up because it's,

606
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:14,360
it's,
um.

607
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,560
There's not even any audio.
It's a probably girl headbutts guy.

608
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,750
Kao Yeah.
Maybe.

609
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,430
I don't know why I'm asking you to find 
that.

610
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:25,790
It's probably a billion of those.
Right?

611
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,520
How many,
how many videos online there about girls

612
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,250
headbutting a guy and knocking them out?

613
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,810
I could find it.
Well,

614
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:39,811
you know,
I am the only guy in the history of the 

615
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:39,811
Los Angeles Police Department.
No,

616
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:41,110
this isn't it.
To have been bitten in the left testicle

617
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:42,630
in the line of duty.
Really?

618
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,660
Oh,
Jesus.

619
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,660
The only guy ever.
Was it a slow buyer?

620
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:45,890
No.

621
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,460
Right.
Had your hand on it and you're massaging

622
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:49,550
it and then you were.
No,

623
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,870
no,
no life.

624
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,310
Why did someone the

625
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,710
ball we got to call.
This wasn't a day when angel dust was on

626
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,500
pcp or my God,
it's the worst thing I've ever seen drug

627
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:05,501
I've ever seen in my life with.
What is the effects for the unwashed 

628
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:05,501
masses?
Oh my God.

629
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:08,660
Well,
it was supposed to be.

630
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:11,120
It was designed as an elephant 
tranquilizer.

631
00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:12,720
That ain't the way it works in humans.
It's.

632
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:15,320
It's a.
it's a powerful hallucinogenic,

633
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:19,490
but it gives people a feeling of 
superhuman strength and they have it.

634
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,520
They display it.
You get a real thin sheen of 

635
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,520
perspiration and you get this glass.
He,

636
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,590
I looked,
just love this and so I look old and,

637
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,670
and,
and,

638
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,350
and these guys would throw five or six 
cops around,

639
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:38,351
they would pull fire,
stupid strengths things and quite 

640
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:40,310
frequently they had to be shot because 
there was just,

641
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,520
they wouldn't stop.
Um,

642
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,490
so a friend who got its finger bitten 
off when I was on PCP,

643
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,670
so,
so we got to call a wheelchair sergeant 

644
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:50,670
was requesting a backup.

645
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,290
It was just south of the station,
south of a librarian,

646
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,310
Venice.
They're a few blocks and we go rolling 

647
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,060
up and here's this sergeant Tim Wright 
was six foot five.

648
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:03,061
He's just backed into a corner in this 
apartment and here's this little bitty 

649
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:07,080
black guy,
about five foot eight like Sammy Davis 

650
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,960
Junior,
but he's holding like a 35 inch color 

651
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,900
console television set above his head.
Those things were heavy.

652
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,480
I mean,
he's right away,

653
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:14,230
you know,
it was,

654
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,410
it was dust and uh,
and,

655
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,460
and I was,
I was known as the fighter Sergeant 

656
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Sanchez Rupert getting so like five of 
us went in there and you know,

657
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:27,350
it was just like one of the cartoon 
Malay things.

658
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,210
We finally got him handcuffed and then 
flex a cuffed around his ankles.

659
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:34,420
You know the plastic cups called an 
ambulance,

660
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,000
put him on the Gurney to canvas straps 
on the Gurney.

661
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,830
Manoevre over like torso and one over a 
pfizer knees.

662
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,600
All right,
so we figure we got him.

663
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,360
We take him out to the ambulance.
Now I stand up,

664
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,890
but you know when you're lifting the 
Gurney,

665
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,570
the raise it into the ambulance.
She pulled it up.

666
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,170
Oh No.
Oh No.

667
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Oh.
So he got the canvas strap over his 

668
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:00,690
legs.
Oh my God.

669
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,370
And everybody went back to his legs and 
they went,

670
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,330
wow.
He went like that.

671
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,070
Oh my God.
He bit your ball sack.

672
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,390
Holy Shit.
How?

673
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,470
What is the recovery on something like 
that?

674
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,380
It hurt a lot.
Nothing was damaged,

675
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,470
but the fear must have been horrific.
Looking down for your first time,

676
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,440
I must have been horrific.
Must've been.

677
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,620
Yeah.
So yeah,

678
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,850
I,
I wound up having the nickname of 

679
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:32,850
inspector clouseau not,
not okay though,

680
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,380
you know,

681
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,370
I got a need and the Dick once in 
Jujitsu and I didn't know how bad it was

682
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,590
because before I used to wear a cup,
now I wear a cup.

683
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,980
Smart man.
Yeah.

684
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,060
And I didn't realize how bad it was 
until after I was done it fucking hurt 

685
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,530
like hell.
But I figured it's just me being a bitch

686
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:53,190
because I got hit in the Dick Duke 
because that's how you think.

687
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:58,191
Like it's,
it's like it's extra sensitive is my 

688
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:58,191
baby.
Are you wearing a Dixie?

689
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,190
I wasn't wearing anything.
I was wearing a jockstrap.

690
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,300
I mean that was wearing clothes.
I should be wrestling.

691
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:08,301
You doing boy and my friend Einstein was
passing my guard and he slammed his knee

692
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,060
and he's trying to pass his knee through
my legs and he just miscalculated and 

693
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,501
caught my dick.
And I didn't realize how bad it wasn't 

694
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,061
till I was taking a leak after training 
and blood was all over my jock strap.

695
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,290
My Josh trap was like filled with blood.
I was like,

696
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,710
oh great.
My Dick's bleeding,

697
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,440
this is awesome.
So like a retard.

698
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I didn't even go to the doctor.
Instead what I did was I went to see if 

699
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:33,540
I could beat off.
I'm like,

700
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,880
well if I could beat off,
might be good.

701
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,310
It can't be broken if I could beat off 
and I beat off and it didn't even hurt 

702
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,791
that much.
And when I came was like blood and come 

703
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:46,040
together.
Like I had a chicken,

704
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,930
like a little chicken egg.
So I said,

705
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,430
all right,
well let's see if this heals up.

706
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:52,430
If it feels even a little bit funny 
tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

707
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,850
So I peed blood for like two or three 
more days.

708
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,340
But I felt great.
So now they didn't,

709
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,980
didn't.
I was just checking for any inflammation

710
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:03,710
or feeling of irritation or I think,
you know,

711
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:04,840
you just heal up.
I'd like.

712
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's like,
would I go to the doctor if I did that 

713
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,000
with my nose?
And I'm in the answer was no.

714
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,170
I would have done it with my nose 100 
times.

715
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,230
I did drink a lot of orange juice and 
tried to make orange p,

716
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,230
you know what I mean?
Try to make lemonade.

717
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:17,390
Yeah.

718
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,140
It would be like pink lemonade.
No,

719
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:22,620
but seriously that,
that's something that you probably,

720
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,670
you probably didn't want to get checked 
out because he didn't want them to like 

721
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:27,670
have to put something in your penis hole
or something like that.

722
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:27,740
No,
I didn't want to be.

723
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,040
I would have.
I didn't want to be a posting.

724
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,800
I mean if I,
if it was my ear,

725
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,060
I wouldn't go to the doctor.
If it was my nos,

726
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,550
why am I going to the doctor?
If it's my Dick,

727
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,800
I wouldn't want him to go to the doctor.
If it's like infected,

728
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,330
what are they going to do?
How are they going to fix it?

729
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,350
What are they to do?
They're going to put a splint on his 

730
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,760
finger and put it into popsicle sticks 
and send it back in like a wounded 

731
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,780
soldier.
Um,

732
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,790
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck they would 

733
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:51,790
do.

734
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:51,790
I,
it was nothing wrong with it.

735
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:51,980
It was just hurt.
You know what I mean?

736
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,250
Just needed to heal up,
but if it was hurt,

737
00:33:55,251 --> 00:34:00,251
if it was more than that,
I would have noticed after awhile I 

738
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:03,161
would have felt I was pretty sensitive.
That's a great physical metaphor for 

739
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:06,311
what happens emotionally a few times in 
your life when you get kicked in the 

740
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:06,311
Dick.
Yeah.

741
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,810
You heal up.
Hopefully you heal up.

742
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,690
Hopefully.
Yeah.

743
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,090
Hopefully that's a good fit.
Physical Metaphor for that.

744
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,230
It's very difficult for people to accept
the idea that sometimes people don't 

745
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,270
want to be around them.
You know?

746
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,450
Some people aren't meant for each other.
They're fucking personalities clash and 

747
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,100
some people have different ideas.
It's very difficult to find someone that

748
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:27,050
you can hang with for any long period of
time.

749
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,080
Definitely.
We just got to learn to be nicer about 

750
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,080
the whole process.

751
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,690
You know,
it's the getting kicked in the Dick 

752
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,160
Emotionally.
Figure out how to.

753
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,150
Don't worry about that for you.
You know,

754
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:45,180
I had a party recently at my house,
a little kid's party and a couple 

755
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,080
friends came over,
including a two friends that are ex's.

756
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,030
Uh,
their ex boyfriend,

757
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,650
girlfriend,
married to different people now,

758
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:55,700
but still great friends.
And it's so cool to see that when people

759
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,390
can connect like that and keep being can
actually really be close friends.

760
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,630
Like their kids play together.
They go out to dinner together,

761
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,400
you know,
they go on double dates together.

762
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,470
They were genuinely friends.
So it's,

763
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,560
it is possible,
but Goddamn for the most part,

764
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,590
most of them end up like fucking like 
those air shows where they touch wings 

765
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:18,140
and fucking go into the crowd and a ball
of fire.

766
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,290
You have to go to an air show man.
You going to an air?

767
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,300
Yeah.
I grew up in an air force family,

768
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,930
Jesus Christ.
And uh,

769
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,040
I've been to quite a few.
Have you ever seen a wreck like that?

770
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,570
No.
Thank God.

771
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,910
Whew.
What a.

772
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,890
What kind of jets did you fly?
I didn't.

773
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,480
My father did.
He'd never been in one.

774
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,170
Not,
not in a fighter jet?

775
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:37,960
No.
No.

776
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,290
Did I do it?
Did a thing for the blue angels.

777
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,840
They would take celebrities up.
Cool.

778
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,320
Yeah.
We went seven and a half cheese and they

779
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,550
don't wear suits either.
Man.

780
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:48,570
You know,
when they do their shit,

781
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:51,330
they don't.
Most places they were like,

782
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,760
uh,
some sort of a compression suit that 

783
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:56,760
allows you to deal with the pressure,
but they don't,

784
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,131
they don't wear them.
They just do it all with their body and 

785
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:01,131
La.
They have to be like really,

786
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:01,820
really good shape.
Yeah.

787
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,830
It's just all kinds of gymnastics.
Lifting weights you have to like really 

788
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,300
strengthen your body.
Just to deal with the g force is fucking

789
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,110
incredible,
man.

790
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:15,111
The feeling is it's amazing how much 
pressure it is when you realize that 

791
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:19,590
like going fast doesn't just,
it doesn't come freight.

792
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Like if you want to really go that fast,
you have to move your body in a way 

793
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,870
that's completely unaccustomed to moving
through the universe.

794
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,380
Like the amount of pressure that comes 
from that kind of speed.

795
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,620
It's like monumental.
It's hard to even wrap your head around 

796
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:36,620
it.
I love it,

797
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:36,620
dude.
Seven and a half.

798
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,200
Jesus.
Insane.

799
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:40,620
And it feels like consciousness field 
literally feels like an elevator door.

800
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:42,810
You could see black on each side.
It's crazy.

801
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,810
It's a crazy feeling man.
But when they rack,

802
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,150
they were at Harvard.
I remember,

803
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,990
uh,
my,

804
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,600
my dad was a radar intercept officer and
fat,

805
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,430
nines and half nineties.
That's,

806
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:58,431
those are two seat interceptors.
He used to fly over the North Pole 

807
00:36:58,431 --> 00:36:59,220
waiting for the Russians to attack her 
in the Korean War.

808
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,610
That was his mission and we saw a few.
Ufo Isn't some strange thing.

809
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:05,460
She needs us anyway.
Uh,

810
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,540
but,
uh,

811
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,700
so the worst and it was all air force.
So he was in the late seventies,

812
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:12,640
early eighties.
The,

813
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,730
the thunderbirds,
the.

814
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,930
We're doing a of a five for formation 
loop,

815
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,360
ground loop and something went off in 
all five.

816
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,710
Flew straight into the ground and that 
was like,

817
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,040
that was just go,
oh my God.

818
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,710
Oh my God.
Holy Shit.

819
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,120
That's crazy.
It's fail.

820
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,680
That's crazy.
Yeah.

821
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,560
What happened?
How the fuck does that happen?

822
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,570
Something I'm not gonna say it wasn't a 
combination of pilot error and 

823
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,910
mechanical failure because everybody 
follows the lead.

824
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,990
Oh my God.
Nobody else is paying any attention to 

825
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:55,990
anything except the lead.
Oh my God.

826
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,290
That's so crazy.
That is so fucking crazy.

827
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,870
Yeah.
That's hard to even think about.

828
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,790
That's one of those things.
It's hard to wrap your head around,

829
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,980
you know,
what that must've been like to be a part

830
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:08,610
of and know that it's happening.
Like right before the fucking plane hits

831
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:10,010
the ground.
Yeah.

832
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,860
They didn't even know.
They might have had a microsecond to 

833
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,711
know.
The guy that took me on the blue angels 

834
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:21,201
flight was a bad motherfucker.
I wish I could remember his name and I 

835
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:21,240
have it at home.
It's on a signed photo,

836
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,470
but we went through these canyons and we
were going.

837
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:31,110
It was so fast.
It was ridiculous and we're only like a 

838
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,110
couple hundred feet off the ground and 
it just.

839
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,100
When you realize what those things can 
do and think about if you were on

840
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,770
the ground and one of those 
motherfuckers was looking for you,

841
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,220
holy Shit.
God Damn,

842
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:47,221
that's scary.
One of those fighter jets looking for 

843
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:51,271
you while you're on the ground would 
have to be one of the most frightening 

844
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:51,271
things.
Well,

845
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:52,030
they fly too fast.
I mean this is.

846
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,250
This is where I have some expertise 
because of the life I've led hanging 

847
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,850
with some green beanie guys and you 
know,

848
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,710
they can't see anything.
They fly too fast,

849
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,720
too fast.
So you need helicopters.

850
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,870
Yeah.
Well you,

851
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,390
you would want to,
uh,

852
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:09,391
Hilo where the flir for.
We're looking at infrared radar for 

853
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:09,680
night.
That's a third gen night vision where,

854
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,180
where you can pick out the heat moving 
very easily.

855
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,570
Could they use like a blimp or something
just floated up above the sky and get a 

856
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,570
big view of that shit.
You,

857
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:26,610
they really aren't there.
Do that little micro copters and they 

858
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:26,610
got all the money.

859
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,380
It's like Jack Nicholson in Batman.
Where did they get all the toys?

860
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,260
Just that's what they did.
Why did they feel like they have to 

861
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,260
control things so much?
Why is that?

862
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Because it has to be so many.
So much resources spent on this aspect 

863
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,900
of society.
It's the infinite growth of monetary 

864
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,841
paradigm,
but it's also a people who who have 

865
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:50,260
control,
if you will.

866
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:52,870
We have someone call them the powers 
that be.

867
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:57,871
I'm getting a call them the powers that 
were because they're failing 

868
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:57,930
monumentally,
uh,

869
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,970
but they must maintain control.
Otherwise all of the crimes that have 

870
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,801
been committed for eons will come 
starkly clear to a lot of people all at 

871
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,200
once.
Uh,

872
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,190
that's like the awakening of the 
hundredth monkey.

873
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:13,030
Like,
Holy Shit,

874
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,790
we are human beings really have been 
farmed.

875
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:20,791
What does that expression,
the weakened over the hungry 100th 

876
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:20,791
monkey because I've heard it more than 
once now.

877
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:23,580
That was in,
that was in the Daca,

878
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,820
collapsing it after the Second World War
and they were playing with the atom 

879
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,661
bombs.
They wanted to see how long it would 

880
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:36,301
take to repopulate an island.
So they went back to this island and a 

881
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:41,470
four or five years after and then they 
introduced trees and they got things 

882
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,900
grow and then they brought in like 
10,000

883
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,440
monkeys to see how they would survive a.
There was enough for everything,

884
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:52,441
but the,
the coconuts were slightly radioactive 

885
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:54,991
on the husks.
So the safe way to eat the coconut was 

886
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:57,781
to wash it in the stream and they taught
like 10 monkeys to wash the coconut.

887
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:04,590
And so they and then other monkeys look,
and then pretty soon there's 15 and then

888
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,500
47 and then a 200,
or excuse me,

889
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,730
you know,
88.

890
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,950
But when they reached the hundredth 
monkey,

891
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,290
all 10,000
got it all at once.

892
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,570
Everybody is.
Oh yeah.

893
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:22,230
Okay.
So then they all started washing the 

894
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,230
coconut.
Yeah.

895
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,230
And,
and that's,

896
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,840
uh,
that's a parable about,

897
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,700
you didn't tell me the story the last 
time you were here.

898
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:25,900
What did you know?
No,

899
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,400
it was in the movie.
That's what it was.

900
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,380
Okay.
Um,

901
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,380
but,
uh,

902
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,540
so that's,
uh,

903
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,860
a,
that's a

904
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,730
parable about a radical shift in 
consciousness.

905
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,450
And right now a radical shift in human 
consciousness is the only thing that can

906
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,850
possibly save us.
And there's a part of me for all of the 

907
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,150
stuff that I've done bringing the bad 
news.

908
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,070
Uh,
which was my mission.

909
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:54,650
That was my duty for like 30 years.
It was like to warn.

910
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:59,651
And now this,
now the Fox medicine spiritual message 

911
00:41:59,651 --> 00:41:59,960
says they've had all the warnings 
they're going to get.

912
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,560
But now I'm also very aware that this 
change of consciousness is happening and

913
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,510
I'm seeing enormously encouraging signs 
of that.

914
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,220
One day we won't have to think about how
we suddenly try to get governments to be

915
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:16,220
honest or you know,
one day,

916
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,650
listen,
this government right now,

917
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,790
one day is going to be embarrassing.
It's going to be embarrassed.

918
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,930
They're going to look back.
It is.

919
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:24,350
I agree.

920
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,430
All of them have been.
We're going to look back on this time 

921
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,800
with shame because the people that are 
running this country,

922
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,020
that's very small percentage of the 
people,

923
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,820
they're not going to be able to maintain
it.

924
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,910
It's just too.
There's too much access to information 

925
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,341
these days.
It's not the same animal as it was when 

926
00:42:42,341 --> 00:42:42,341
this whole monster was created.
If you look,

927
00:42:42,341 --> 00:42:45,620
Joe,
I'm anywhere in the world.

928
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,310
Every government is failing.
There is not a government anywhere in 

929
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,900
the world that's succeeding because the 
way they're set up is ridiculous.

930
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,920
The whole thing is ridiculous and after 
a while,

931
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:58,250
people just,
they can't take the inequity of it.

932
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,170
They just.
The people snap everywhere.

933
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,720
This is even this one.
The best one.

934
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,890
There is,
without a doubt,

935
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:05,450
I think Americans,
the best setup there is.

936
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,460
I love it here.
It's the greatest country in the world,

937
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,380
but God damn it could be better.

938
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,380
It can be better by a million fold.
It could easily be better.

939
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,660
I don't think America can be fixed.
That doesn't mean that I'm on American.

940
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,980
What I mean is I think the United States
of America as it's operating now is not 

941
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,480
fixable.
It's set up on a bullshit financial 

942
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:27,480
system.
That's a real big part of it.

943
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,090
It's utterly corrupt.
I'm Thomas Jefferson here.

944
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm saying this.
Thomas Jefferson said you need a 

945
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,540
revolution every generation.
Have you ever thought about just moving 

946
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,930
to Hawaii saying,
fuck you.

947
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,740
You ever thought about doing that?
No.

948
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,510
No,
I,

949
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:43,550
uh,
I spent four months in Venezuela.

950
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:45,560
That was a,
an unusual story.

951
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:46,290
But no,
I'm,

952
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,920
I'm where I'm at.
I'm up in northern California.

953
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,480
That's where I'm staying.
Staying.

954
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,010
Yeah.
So to asteroid.

955
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,060
I'm planting my ass in there.
They're going to have to come with a 

956
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,060
bulldozer and take me out of there.

957
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,660
You're out there making it happen while 
you sure that this is all gonna fall 

958
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,960
apart though it is falling apart.
What are the.

959
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:11,050
What is the possibility that something 
can happen that can pull us out of the 

960
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,890
fire?
Something that's gonna.

961
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,310
Keep us from the only laminate to the 
mountain.

962
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,340
The only thing that can keep us from 
slamming into the mountain is for the 

963
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:26,141
human race collectively to see it 
slamming itself into the mountain and 

964
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:30,281
decided to do differently.
It's got to be a change of 

965
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,771
consciousness.
This is not going to be a message 

966
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:32,771
written in a letter put out

967
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,060
in a broadcast,
put out.

968
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,450
Everybody's got to get it.
I personally think the Internet itself 

969
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:42,770
is very psychedelic and the fact that 
it's responsible for a massive expansion

970
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,590
of human consciousness,
not from a drug form,

971
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,600
but from an information for them.
The fact that you're the access to 

972
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,920
information is so spectacular and so the
whole viral aspect of it.

973
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,280
I think that that human beings right 
now,

974
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,610
what was a very rare time where we're in
a balancing act right now,

975
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,730
but I think the information that we're 
getting from the Internet is expanding 

976
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,020
consciousness as much almost as a drug 
would,

977
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,360
you know,
as an influx of you look back,

978
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,380
unlike,
you know,

979
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:18,381
19 between like 1994 and now what a 
massive change in our society has come 

980
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:25,971
about because of youtube and twitter and
facebook and the interconnectedness of 

981
00:45:25,971 --> 00:45:30,471
society.
The massive extent of it is so much 

982
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:30,471
different than it was.

983
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:34,890
The evolution of en via the net are 
amazing.

984
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,920
Amazing,
but I think that that's going to 

985
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,451
influence the way the government works.
I think it's going to influence who are 

986
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:42,240
the people that are in positions of 
power.

987
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,000
I think it's slowly going to root out 
the old.

988
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:50,030
The old system that's in place was all 
these fuckers were around before the 

989
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,650
Internet.
All of them except Obama,

990
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,120
the Obama,
you know,

991
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:56,760
he should have been just a little bit.
He's a little bit older than me,

992
00:45:56,761 --> 00:46:00,690
so he was a grown man while the internet
came out and you should have maybe maybe

993
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:05,691
it was too late for him to maybe maybe 
it's one more generation after this 

994
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:09,501
where they they realize you can't 
fucking lie anymore because there's new 

995
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:12,081
technology that lists or read thoughts 
and then everything has to be done 

996
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,721
transparent.
I don't think it's going to take 

997
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:14,721
anywhere near that long,
this,

998
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:17,660
this,
this old system is going to collapse 

999
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:17,660
because it will be satisfied with 
nothing less.

1000
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:21,650
It's seeking its own death.
It's doing everything to kill itself 

1001
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,920
intellectually.
Anything running this world right now is

1002
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:27,921
being defeated.
Do you think that's because the current 

1003
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:28,140
people are greedy and they're just 
looking out for themselves and trying to

1004
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:32,070
just score short term and just get out 
because that's where the money's at.

1005
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:34,640
Michael Rupert,
I think that they're trying as good.

1006
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:39,641
Right?
That was good that they're trying to do 

1007
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:41,871
anything they can to hold on to what 
power and what information they have 

1008
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,750
because they do not want the power or 
the information that they have to be 

1009
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,401
shared and it's a.
it's a total desperation move and 

1010
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:55,611
they're going to fail if I was a doctor 
for the world and I looked at this 

1011
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,050
problem and I was like,
hmm,

1012
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:03,330
I see we got.
This is a bunch of cunts that haven't 

1013
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:03,330
done mushrooms and they're running 
things.

1014
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,400
That's what it,
that you have a bunch of old greedy fuck

1015
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:08,880
heads that are,
that are just unsightly,

1016
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:13,881
delicately inclined.
They've never had consciousness 

1017
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:16,341
expanding experiences.
They don't know the beauty and the love 

1018
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:18,520
that you get from a psychedelic 
experience with friends where you,

1019
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:23,521
you realize how much of the way you 
behave and live and interact with 

1020
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:24,270
people.
It's just an insecurity.

1021
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:25,710
It's just,
it's just stupidity.

1022
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,410
It's nonsense.
It's not sure.

1023
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,060
I'm not sure that happen,
but

1024
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,400
it would cure it all.
Baby Lord.

1025
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,520
Seven billion doses of DMT.
Yeah.

1026
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,210
I think,
uh,

1027
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:38,680
I think it would kill the ego.
I mean,

1028
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:43,681
that's,
that's really what what you have today 

1029
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:43,681
or you go to kill the ego.
That's the dilemma.

1030
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:47,971
That's the issue that you.
And that's why I'm writing a third book 

1031
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:48,120
now because,
well,

1032
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,750
that's why everybody hates a chicken 
hawk.

1033
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,780
You know,
the idea of someone who wants to send 

1034
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:54,780
people into battle that's never been in 
battle themselves,

1035
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,281
but of course you're so confident and so
of course you're so aggressive about 

1036
00:47:59,281 --> 00:47:59,281
this.
This is not yours to risk.

1037
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,690
You know,
it's the,

1038
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,110
the,
the,

1039
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,510
the ego has no.
You don't understand what a war is.

1040
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:09,511
If maybe if you had been there,
you would have a completely different 

1041
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:09,511
sort of appreciation.
Yeah.

1042
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,570
You wouldn't be so callous and it 
wouldn't be such an easy option.

1043
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,690
I've,
I've come to a darker conclusion than 

1044
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:16,690
that,
Joe.

1045
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:16,690
And,
and,

1046
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,490
and that is that these people literally 
look at us as cattle,

1047
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,270
expendable cattle that have been farmed 
for Millennia.

1048
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,770
This is real or well,
this is,

1049
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:25,780
this is,
this is what it really is,

1050
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,880
is all about human beings are born and 
bred to be slaves and consumers to 

1051
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,580
generate wealth.
And that's the way it's always been.

1052
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,850
Roughly since there was,
since we started doing money,

1053
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:37,060
this one

1054
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,140
or who are they?
Is it a vein or is it just a series of 

1055
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,480
shit choices that have left us in a 
situation where people are copying 

1056
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,150
things.
You know,

1057
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,400
we,
there was a thing we talked about really

1058
00:48:50,401 --> 00:48:53,190
recently on this show about the Salem 
witch trials,

1059
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,520
the Salem witch trials.
There was a woman who wrote a paper for 

1060
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,771
a history class.
It sort of solved one of the major 

1061
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,911
puzzles of the Salem witchcraft trials 
and it was that there was an ergot 

1062
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:08,430
poisoning of food.
It was causing people to have a LSD type

1063
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:13,450
effects and that they thought that this 
was responsible for the original 

1064
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,511
murders,
but then they kept it up as a tradition 

1065
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:21,501
for years later.
Then it became a hysteria and then even 

1066
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:24,801
though people weren't even ergot 
poisoning would actually become a 

1067
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:27,471
learned behavior.
And I think that in situations like 

1068
00:49:27,471 --> 00:49:30,630
where you have greedy business people 
and they set up corporations and there's

1069
00:49:30,631 --> 00:49:35,631
patterns of learned behavior that come 
about from the way these corporations 

1070
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:37,690
interact with their consumers and the 
environment that they have there,

1071
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:42,691
their businesses set up in and that this
momentum gets carried away to a point 

1072
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:49,290
where the greed and the bottom line 
supersedes human nature at supersedes.

1073
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:54,290
The idea that you are a group of people 
and you know in the documentary the 

1074
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,110
corporation,
they went over this,

1075
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:57,870
that a corporation tends to act as a 
sociopath.

1076
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Well,
I think we just have to make everyone 

1077
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,540
aware of the accountability of their 
actions in that situation and remove 

1078
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,780
that,
remove that as a design.

1079
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,340
Remove that,
that,

1080
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:13,341
that diffusion of responsibility that 
you can get by being a part of a big 

1081
00:50:13,341 --> 00:50:13,470
group that does something really fucked 
up,

1082
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:15,940
but you don't feel responsible for it 
because you're just one piece.

1083
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:16,000
Well,

1084
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,780
from,
from my spiritual perspective,

1085
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:23,340
and let me just add that my DNA,
my dmt journey,

1086
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:23,920
my,
my,

1087
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,400
my cans just went crazy.
What'd you do to my headphones?

1088
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,340
What happened?
My cans

1089
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,720
just went.
I went into an echo chamber.

1090
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:30,660
It's cool.
You're right.

1091
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,360
You're right.
Your sound right now.

1092
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,620
I don't hear anything.
Fox match.

1093
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,260
That's for the folks listening on 
itunes.

1094
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:48,521
There was a photo of him.
Michael with his dog and he's got the 

1095
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:51,510
glasses on.
This dog is a Fox face.

1096
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,580
That's brilliant.
That's very funny.

1097
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,990
That's awesome.
DMT trip on the message.

1098
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,820
Have that.
What is his name?

1099
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:01,460
DMT teacher empty under who?
DMT underscore trip.

1100
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,080
Thank you buddy.
I don't know if he made it,

1101
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,790
but whatever.
What was I talking about?

1102
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:09,530
Fox Magic.
Somehow or another it came up.

1103
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,890
What were we talking about?
Oh,

1104
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,990
a DMT.
Uh,

1105
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,180
I approached that very spiritual.
I,

1106
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,370
I do medicine journeys as,
as part of my spiritual practice.

1107
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:24,371
And it's very important for me that I 
always approach a medicine with a clear 

1108
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:28,190
intent and it's always to seek and learn
something better.

1109
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,690
Yeah,
you better respect it.

1110
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,090
Yeah.
You have to respect psychedelic trips.

1111
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:34,400
If you think you're,
you're the shit and you can handle it,

1112
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:35,510
it'll fuck it.
Throw.

1113
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:36,550
You know,
there's a lot of people.

1114
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,920
I spent days preparing to do that.
Yeah.

1115
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,960
Well there's a lot of people that will 
listen to the man if you left hammers 

1116
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,030
around.
Lots of people are going to use to build

1117
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:49,031
houses.
Some people are going to break car 

1118
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:49,031
windows with them so people are just 
going to hit trees.

1119
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:49,520
Friends of ours.
It's like,

1120
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:54,550
it's like they,
they go do and go to the UFC and I'm 

1121
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:54,550
like,
man,

1122
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,070
that's crazy.
Like you don't want to.

1123
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,500
Do you really want that?
That's not do if you would.

1124
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,880
Joey ideas?
I would say yes.

1125
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:03,770
I would say if you didn't do it,
what are you a pussy.

1126
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,660
If you're a real hunter s Thompson Fan,
you're a fan of Hunter Thompson and Joey

1127
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,450
Diaz wants to do mushrooms with you at 
the UFC to fucking mushrooms.

1128
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,450
So what are you crazy?
I of course that's not respecting the 

1129
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,691
spiritual trip.
Fuck it isn't what a grand opportunity 

1130
00:52:19,691 --> 00:52:22,730
that isn't life to do mushrooms at the 
UFC with Joey Diaz.

1131
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,800
God dammit.
That's the best seat in the house.

1132
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,960
I thought I had the best seat in the 
house as a commentator.

1133
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:31,961
I don't.
The best seat in the house is to do to 

1134
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:31,961
get them to eat mushrooms next to Joey 
Diaz.

1135
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:35,300
UFC because you know,
funny Joey Diaz will be on mushrooms.

1136
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:40,540
It will make me chuckle fast.
Everyone would just be howling laughing 

1137
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,280
and you'd get to watch the UFC at the 
same time.

1138
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,890
It sounds like the greatest day on earth
you might have a panic attack.

1139
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,200
I think that it's just too many people I
like.

1140
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:53,201
I like being with nature.
If I'm going to go on any kind of 

1141
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:53,201
spiritual trip,
I went nature.

1142
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:53,510
I won't be able to.

1143
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,120
Are you talking about spiritual trips 
while you're smoking a cigarette?

1144
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:57,860
It is a spiritual trip.
It's just not as.

1145
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,130
It's a shitty one.
Tobacco trip.

1146
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,120
It is.
If you're a native.

1147
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,160
Yeah,
sure.

1148
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,930
About tobacco holds a strong ritual for.
Well,

1149
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:09,080
it also is a part of the IOWASCA ritual 
for some reason,

1150
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,950
like a lot of Iowasca arrows.
I think that's how they say them.

1151
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,650
They,
they,

1152
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,030
they,
they blow tobacco,

1153
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:17,210
smoke on people.
It's part of the whole thing.

1154
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:22,350
Yeah.
I mean nicotine or tobacco in of itself 

1155
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,510
and even nicotine is proven to have some
really positive health effects and there

1156
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:26,070
was something about nicotine that 
actually is good for your heart

1157
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,370
and now some like it's not nicotine.
That's really the problem.

1158
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,470
It's like caffeine.
Caffeine is not bad.

1159
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:34,440
If you have just a little bit.
If you're fucking crazy,

1160
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,600
you're drinking red bulls all day and

1161
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,230
check this.
I'm,

1162
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:40,330
I'm,
I'm 61.

1163
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,520
Okay.
I smoke.

1164
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,540
Everybody knows that.
Okay.

1165
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:48,541
My,
I just had a physical resting blood 

1166
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:49,150
pressure was 60 or a blood

1167
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,760
pulse rate was 60.
That's incredible.

1168
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,220
Resting.
That's really good.

1169
00:53:53,221 --> 00:53:55,830
Blood pressure was 1:20
oversell in really good shape.

1170
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,960
Do you do a lot of exercise?
It's pretty low.

1171
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,310
I eat really,
really,

1172
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,340
really good and,
and then I exercise as much weed,

1173
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:04,100
whack in two and a half acres now.
So that's,

1174
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:05,430
that's work.
That is work,

1175
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,870
you know.
And I mean,

1176
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:10,500
you know George Foreman when he was 
training for fights used to chop wood so

1177
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,470
well known fact.
It's like real work.

1178
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,670
Real work is hard work you.
No Shit that gets you in shape now.

1179
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,870
That's a pretty low resting heart rate 
though.

1180
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,950
Yeah.
So you know,

1181
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,820
what I'm saying is I'm,
I'm just real simple

1182
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,920
by an to all the propaganda I'm sold 
about everything because the way the 

1183
00:54:30,161 --> 00:54:35,161
people that run this world operate is 
they do it 90 percent truth and 10 

1184
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:39,421
percent bullshit.
And because you're not trained to 

1185
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:39,910
separate the bullshit,
the bullshit winds upstair in you.

1186
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,840
One of my favorite articles that came 
out during the time that the Patriot Act

1187
00:54:46,901 --> 00:54:49,390
was administered was a,
it was on CNN.

1188
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:54,450
They were talking about how the CIA has 
announced that it's going to leak fake 

1189
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:58,231
new stories in order to send terrorists 
in the wrong direction.

1190
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,400
And I,
I remember reading that and I was like,

1191
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:04,990
wow,
that's like game over.

1192
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,340
Like they just came out and said,
we're going to lie to you.

1193
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:12,690
That was,
that was right at the same time that a

1194
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,120
CNN,
uh,

1195
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:19,310
let it be known that the Department of 
Defense was permanently stationing 

1196
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,490
military intelligence personnel in the 
CNN newsroom.

1197
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:26,410
Whoa.
I screamed about that from the 

1198
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:26,410
wilderness.
That was my newsletter for eight years.

1199
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,261
We had some great people there.
We were just kicking Bush Cheney in the 

1200
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:31,050
balls every chance we could get.
Why was it from the Wilderness?

1201
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:36,210
Why'd you call it from the Wilderness?
Because for my personal story I had been

1202
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:41,211
trying to expose.
Cei was bringing drugs into the country 

1203
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:41,220
for like 18 years and nobody would 
listen to me.

1204
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:46,610
Then Gary Webb stories broken.
I confronted the CIA director at Locke 

1205
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,790
High School.
And the game changed a little bit.

1206
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,330
Uh,
so I started ftw,

1207
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:55,350
uh,
like a year and a half after I 

1208
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,600
confronted John Deutch and uh,
I was a voice crying in the wilderness,

1209
00:55:57,601 --> 00:56:00,820
but I was the guy from the wilderness 
that nobody had listened to and,

1210
00:56:00,821 --> 00:56:02,670
and then,
you know,

1211
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,590
and so that came to stand for,
uh,

1212
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,520
over the course of my career.
Many hundreds of people in organizations

1213
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:12,720
who were all,
uh,

1214
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,690
voices in the wilderness.
Nobody was listening to.

1215
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,240
And Damn,
we got it all right.

1216
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,290
You know.
And uh,

1217
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:22,230
there's some just amazing people I've 
met along the way.

1218
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,890
It's an interesting name.

1219
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,110
I remember when I,
when I first found out about it,

1220
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,100
I was like,
what the fuck is,

1221
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,550
what's that from the wilderness?
It was like,

1222
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,680
it sounds very unabomber ask funnel,
you know,

1223
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,510
like you're out there.
This was before hearing it,

1224
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:36,520
the disease society out in the distance.

1225
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,780
Yeah,
no,

1226
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,510
this,
this was just a,

1227
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,160
hey,
you know,

1228
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,360
pay it.
W we were pretty successful.

1229
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:47,360
We got to have 60 members of Congress 
and we broke the Pat Tillman,

1230
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,360
the whole,
the whole cover up with Pat Tillman was,

1231
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,150
was a seven part series.
We did ftw and uh,

1232
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,030
uh,
that's one of the good things now for me

1233
00:56:56,031 --> 00:56:58,490
about giving collapsed that over to the 
employees.

1234
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:03,491
I didn't get a chance to do that with a 
few because our computers were smashed 

1235
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:05,030
in the Tillman series.
I mean police falsified reports,

1236
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:09,990
a leaked to editors who were having sex 
with my children and for defrauding them

1237
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:15,110
and they really threw everything,
including the kitchen sink at me up.

1238
00:57:15,111 --> 00:57:16,910
And I actually talked to editors that.
What was,

1239
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:17,870
what was that?
Uh,

1240
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,180
there was,
uh,

1241
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,280
my computers were smashed and part five 
of the tilghman series.

1242
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:25,460
That's right when we were nailing Donald
Rumsfeld and he was eventually forced to

1243
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:30,461
resign.
He was forced to resign because of the 

1244
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:30,461
Pat Tillman.
And so yeah,

1245
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:30,860
that was what did it.
Yeah.

1246
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,780
He just resigned real suddenly.
Right.

1247
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:37,781
When Henry Waxman's a committee on 
governmental affairs was getting ready 

1248
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:37,781
to call him.

1249
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:40,190
What was the issue that he had created?
He,

1250
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:42,500
first of all,
if you wanted to have a bad guy and like

1251
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:47,501
a Batman movie,
that was like a bad government guy that 

1252
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:50,861
was actually evil,
would not Donald Rumsfeld will be the 

1253
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:50,960
fucking perfect guy.
Dick Cheney's,

1254
00:57:50,961 --> 00:57:52,130
right.
He's right up there too.

1255
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,930
Both of them.
But.

1256
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,790
So what,
what exactly took place?

1257
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,780
Well,

1258
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,390
uh,
we eventually nailed that.

1259
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,490
The series was being written by Stan 
Goff,

1260
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:06,491
who was my military affairs editor at 
from the Wilderness stands for retired 

1261
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:09,500
master sergeant from US Army Special 
Forces Delta stand taught at West Point.

1262
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:13,850
Stan is just one of the most amazing 
writers and human beings are really cool

1263
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:16,970
people I've ever met in my whole life 
and a brilliant guy.

1264
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,910
And a pat tillman's mom.
Danny,

1265
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,640
uh,
contacted me trying to get in touch with

1266
00:58:22,641 --> 00:58:23,990
stamp,
uh,

1267
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:29,100
and,
and I immediately said we'd publish 

1268
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:29,100
anything.
And I,

1269
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,420
I drove down to the Tillman House in,
uh,

1270
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:37,150
south of the bay and a copied overnight 
2000,

1271
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,740
200 pages of army records that she had 
been given all redacted,

1272
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,440
you know,
all blacked out and pages and stuff.

1273
00:58:45,441 --> 00:58:47,990
But they were in files and sections.
And all this stuff.

1274
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:52,991
So I returned the papers and drove back 
up to my offices and I flew stand golf 

1275
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:52,991
into Ashland,
Oregon,

1276
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,550
and we stand.

1277
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:59,000
Did most of the work,
but absolutely because Stan knew at all.

1278
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:04,030
So he decoded the documents and figured 
out who was who and what was what and 

1279
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:05,210
where it was,
where,

1280
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,420
uh,
I caught some things that help but stand

1281
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:13,421
wrote the seven part series a that 
proved that a stand that uh,

1282
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:19,700
pat had been killed by friendly fire at 
close range,

1283
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,970
uh,
and the Silver Star awarded him was,

1284
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,990
uh,
I think that that was probably the most 

1285
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:28,990
offensive thing.
The,

1286
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:29,040
for many in the,
in,

1287
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,060
in,
in the military was that that silver 

1288
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,101
star was fake,
not just destroys the value of the 

1289
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:36,130
silver star.
Uh,

1290
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:37,820
and uh,
so

1291
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,590
we broke that story and uh,
and this is similar to what they mean,

1292
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:47,591
it's been the Jessica Lynch story that 
changed that story around to apparently 

1293
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:52,661
any story that gets released,
any big story gets doctored up 

1294
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:57,130
favorably.
And so this one was an unfortunate 

1295
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:57,130
incident.
It wasn't a murder,

1296
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,010
right?
No one's claiming it wasn't murder.

1297
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:58,780
Oh No,
I,

1298
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:03,860
I think people claim it's Samaritan.
I think Danny believes that it's 

1299
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,450
possible that her son was murdered.
I think she said so.

1300
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:07,560
She said so to me,
um,

1301
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,280
I,
it could not have been premeditated,

1302
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,500
uh,
because it was in a full bar situation 

1303
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:15,970
there.
It was not really combat,

1304
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:18,760
it wasn't exaggerated stage play in some
respects.

1305
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,730
Uh,
there had been some incoming fire,

1306
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:23,710
but it was like three,
400 yards away,

1307
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:27,170
take a couple of mortgage,
fired a couple rounds and ran away and,

1308
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:27,670
and,
and,

1309
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and hear a whole lot of rangers.
It just start opening up on a lot of 

1310
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,481
everything all at once.
This is basically the way that played a 

1311
01:00:36,481 --> 01:00:38,170
and a but pat,
Pat Tillman's last words,

1312
01:00:38,171 --> 01:00:43,090
when he stood up before he took a three 
round burst from a sauce squad automatic

1313
01:00:43,091 --> 01:00:48,091
weapon right here.
I mean it just took his head off where 

1314
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:48,640
I'm pat fucking tillman

1315
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,250
and that's not disputed that that's 
fully in the record.

1316
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,040
Oh,
who was the guy that pulled the trigger?

1317
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:03,500
It was a sergeant in his cereal.
What was he just,

1318
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:06,020
was he on edge or was he trying to kill 
him?

1319
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,030
I can only speculate here.

1320
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,860
I'm a,

1321
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,390
if you add a space that was a really 
smart guy and he was honorable.

1322
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,470
He had seen that,

1323
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,040
that

1324
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,320
the war was all fucked up.
It was all lies that,

1325
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,910
you know,
and he was disheartened.

1326
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:24,800
I hear he was a pro football star,
right.

1327
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,220
And,
and uh,

1328
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:31,250
I quit the NFL,
a huge move to join the army to defend 

1329
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,670
his country because he thinks that,
you know,

1330
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:37,100
everything that you see in the movies is
how it works out and you're supposed to 

1331
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:37,570
rise up when your country gets attacked.
As,

1332
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:40,200
as a patriotic American.
He wanted to do his part.

1333
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,990
Well let me just continue with that a 
little bit.

1334
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:51,230
And he kept a diary and so there would 
be naturally be fear that he would come 

1335
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:55,401
back,
rejoined the NFL and start bad and the 

1336
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:55,401
government.

1337
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:55,630
But that

1338
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,940
didn't really factor into it that that 
could have been controlled in many other

1339
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:05,941
ways than that.
Pat Hung around frequently with special 

1340
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:05,941
forces and,
and that's,

1341
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:07,350
that's kind of a no,
no.

1342
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,390
In theater,
because one group does what they do and,

1343
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:13,690
and anyway,
that's just the way it works.

1344
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,820
Um,
and I,

1345
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:18,130
I think he was something of a 
grandstander,

1346
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,820
uh,
you know,

1347
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:19,160
a bit.

1348
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,050
Um,
and uh,

1349
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,160
so I think he was making a lot of noise 
and he was pissing some people off and 

1350
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,790
he was complaining about how fucked up 
things were on.

1351
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:31,300
Somebody might've put it to him.
Yeah.

1352
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,780
And,
and,

1353
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:38,781
uh,
I think he became a ranger before he 

1354
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:41,211
became a soldier and maybe only Rangers 
would understand that or SF would 

1355
01:02:41,211 --> 01:02:42,580
understand that.
But uh,

1356
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:43,950
uh,
it's,

1357
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,280
it's a,
it's a totally Shakespearean tragedy.

1358
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:52,370
I mean,
it's just like so fucked up all the way 

1359
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:52,380
around for everybody.
Yeah.

1360
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,010
Did you ever hear the eulogy the brother
gave?

1361
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:02,210
It's pretty intense too.
Do you think it was something to that 

1362
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:02,210
extent of Pat?
You know,

1363
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,710
pat sat and Heaven,
Pat's fucking dead.

1364
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,540
Something along those lines.
You know,

1365
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:11,630
he's an atheist or something.
I'm glad you didn't know him because 

1366
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:12,500
then he would have like lipstick all 
over him and they had

1367
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,360
pictures.
I don't even want to joke about this.

1368
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,670
I don't even want to joke about it 
unfortunately.

1369
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,420
But your joke about it,
I almost,

1370
01:03:22,421 --> 01:03:24,780
I came close to,
but you joke about it with me.

1371
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:28,800
No matter if you've got blown off your 
head got blown off.

1372
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:33,801
I wouldn't put a big deck like damn.
So try to suck it a smaller Dick Bitch.

1373
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,960
That'd be the last thing I would do for 
you.

1374
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,140
But it's like an American hero,
right?

1375
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,790
The whole thing was sad.
It was very,

1376
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:45,450
it was,
um,

1377
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,070
you know,
it was sad that he,

1378
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,460
he,
you know,

1379
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,040
he chose to jump in and uh,
it was sad that it wasn't what he 

1380
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,341
thought.
The truth is is that everything about 

1381
01:03:58,341 --> 01:03:58,341
those wars,
the,

1382
01:03:58,341 --> 01:04:03,220
the post nine slash 11 wars,
everything about those wars is fucked 

1383
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:03,220
up.
And when,

1384
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:07,870
when,
when you start off with everything on 

1385
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,161
the,
on the floor of your building on that 

1386
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:12,531
fucked up the war that takes place on 
top of that field can't be anything but 

1387
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:17,750
more compoundedly fucked up.
How do you have a just war when you go 

1388
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:21,020
into it with no ulterior motives?
Analyze.

1389
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,040
Yeah.
It's amazing that this is not like a 

1390
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,380
fucking army of people in jail right now
know it's,

1391
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,590
it's amazing.
It's amazing that they can get away with

1392
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:30,930
that level of corruption and not be 
accountable,

1393
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,850
but they do in the world,
in ones and Zeros,

1394
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,230
you know,
the Cartesian world,

1395
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,410
measurable matter.

1396
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,100
And of course we know there's such a 
thing as spirit.

1397
01:04:41,101 --> 01:04:46,101
There are things other than matter,
but they operate as if everything is 

1398
01:04:46,101 --> 01:04:46,440
matter.
That's what we gotta do,

1399
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:51,441
man.
We're going to bring them into the 

1400
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:51,441
light.
That's what we got to do.

1401
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:51,990
That's the solution to all of it.
It's not as.

1402
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:54,480
I'm not even fight them.
It's like they are us.

1403
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,290
They're just us in the worst case 
scenario and the worst possible position

1404
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,060
doing the wrong thing.
Exactly.

1405
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:05,880
That we are at one of the most ethical 
times in human history,

1406
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,980
of course,
perhaps all of human history.

1407
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,100
And I really believe that what I said in
the movie,

1408
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:12,840
uh,
is happening,

1409
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:17,870
that,
that our species is being forced to 

1410
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:17,870
choose

1411
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,100
to evolve or portrait parish to grow up 
or fucking die.

1412
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,400
Well,
it's obvious when you look at like what 

1413
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,210
we're doing as far as like and fish out 
of the ocean and depleting resources and

1414
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:31,610
polluting things.
It's like we're.

1415
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:36,611
We're certainly not doing it in a 
sustainable way right now and now I 

1416
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:38,010
don't.
I don't think it's impossible if,

1417
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:40,080
if,
if we kept the population exactly.

1418
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:41,430
How is it?
It is right now.

1419
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,880
It might even be possible to run the 
world the way it is and use the 

1420
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,420
resources,
but know what might be possible do as we

1421
01:05:48,421 --> 01:05:53,421
move along.
If it's not how we doing it right now 

1422
01:05:53,421 --> 01:05:54,810
we,
we are overextended,

1423
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:55,760
but we're doing it right.
No,

1424
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,770
no,
no.

1425
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,340
We are about.
Everything is imploding right now,

1426
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:02,370
but right now we're doing fine right 
now.

1427
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:05,960
We have electricity.
We the food.

1428
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,620
Okay.
It's not everybody.

1429
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:12,730
This is.
This is the ego bomb because this is 

1430
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,130
where I have the hardest trouble getting
through to people,

1431
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:15,820
but because they'll say,
whoa,

1432
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,210
how long do we have?
When is it going to happen?

1433
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,310
Right.
And subconsciously,

1434
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,970
all they're really saying is how long 
before it fucks with me.

1435
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:29,030
Yeah.
How long before I'm uncomfortable 

1436
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,250
exactly by like here we are,
but you know,

1437
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:34,470
that's why collapsed net exists because 
we bear witness to the fact that,

1438
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,440
uh,
all over Pakistan,

1439
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:40,160
cities are having blackouts.
That by the way was very authentic.

1440
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,110
Pakistan,
Pakistan,

1441
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:46,010
the blackouts lasting weeks at a time.
Same in Mindanao,

1442
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:47,520
uh,
India,

1443
01:06:47,521 --> 01:06:52,521
major power blackouts.
A civilization is collapsing all around 

1444
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:58,161
the world.
And just because people choose not to 

1445
01:06:58,161 --> 01:06:59,460
hold it in their consciousness don't 
mean it ain't going on.

1446
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:03,420
So you,
you recognize it as an inescapable trend

1447
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,940
that only a shift in consciousness can 
alter.

1448
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,730
So if the shift of consciousness 
occurred,

1449
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:12,510
how would that alter what would,
what would be the correct thing to do if

1450
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:17,511
the,
the human population was brought into 

1451
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:17,511
the light and everybody's sort of 
figured it out and said,

1452
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:22,101
hey,
we have to act responsibly and stopped 

1453
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:22,101
being a bunch of greedy.
Cons,

1454
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:26,300
what would we do?
I think it would all spring from a 

1455
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:29,030
fundamental

1456
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,850
overriding awareness.
Not a conviction,

1457
01:07:31,851 --> 01:07:33,200
belief,
just awareness,

1458
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:34,250
you know,
you're living it,

1459
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,130
you know,
you know,

1460
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,340
uh,
of

1461
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:43,100
the oneness of everything,
of the connectedness of everything.

1462
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,590
Uh,
oh,

1463
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,080
that's the place where you start

1464
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,250
and

1465
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,980
once you do that,
among other things,

1466
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:57,980
you overcome the pairs of opposites,
good,

1467
01:07:57,981 --> 01:07:58,640
bad,
rich,

1468
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,780
poor fat,
thin,

1469
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,010
whatever,
you know,

1470
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,160
this world of duality.
Um,

1471
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,800
and uh,
and I hit,

1472
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:10,810
there's some amazing work being done in 
quantum physics that is totally bearing 

1473
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,610
this out.
Uh,

1474
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:15,530
there's some amazing research,
uh,

1475
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,030
amit

1476
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:16,930
go twomey is,
uh,

1477
01:08:16,931 --> 01:08:17,980
is a,
uh,

1478
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:23,280
a quantum physicist and great book out 
by David Wilcock and other stuff that,

1479
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,510
a lot of stuff that I kind of became 
aware of along the way.

1480
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:29,960
So there's,
I think the awareness of that.

1481
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:35,530
Once it,
once it comes or at flowers in the 

1482
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:36,320
species and pray,
pray,

1483
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,360
God's got a spirit.
It does.

1484
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:40,040
Soon.
Uh,

1485
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,390
we just won't.
We will just automatically stopped doing

1486
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,530
all the stuff that we're doing that's 
turning this planet into a living hell.

1487
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,920
Come on.
The Gulf of Mexico is totally destroyed.

1488
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:56,360
They got shrimp with our guts hanging 
out in one eye and that eye in their ass

1489
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:58,280
and crabs with half.
I shell,

1490
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,520
I mean,
we've been running the photos of this 

1491
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:03,520
on,
you know,

1492
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,200
on collapsed net.
So it climatologically there's,

1493
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,100
there are a plumes,
two,

1494
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:12,410
one,
two kilometers across 20,

1495
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:17,411
30 of them have methane venting directly
up from Tundra in Siberia.

1496
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:23,380
I mean it's like methane is 20 times 
more powerful greenhouse gas than co 

1497
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:27,710
two.
This mess is out of control.

1498
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:30,590
It's going to come crashing down.
The only thing,

1499
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:34,220
because by calculation I had a guest on 
my radio show.

1500
01:09:34,221 --> 01:09:39,221
Great Guy.
I'm a professor from Arizona State and 

1501
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:42,410
so I'm having a brain fart on his name.
It'll come up in a minute.

1502
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,660
Thank you very much.
Um,

1503
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:50,850
but climatological that there's an 
incredible study that says you have to 

1504
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,761
stop all economic activity now or else 
all of the everything dies irreversibly 

1505
01:09:55,220 --> 01:10:00,220
as a result of temperature rise as it's 
hard science.

1506
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,760
So you know,
on all these fronts,

1507
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:06,760
with all that stuff happening,
I just stood back,

1508
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:11,830
reason I went,
this train wreck cannot be prevented at 

1509
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:16,571
this level of consciousness.
The only thing that can save us now 

1510
01:10:16,571 --> 01:10:16,820
literally is a miracle,

1511
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:18,560
right?
A miracle,

1512
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,790
a revolution of human consciousness.
But if that does happen,

1513
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:24,570
if there's revelations,
revolution,

1514
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,210
whatever you want,
would want to call it.

1515
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,950
If that did happen,
what would we do?

1516
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,820
How would we fix everything?
That just seems to me that the,

1517
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,110
the,
the we have to ship things.

1518
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:33,910
Okay.
We have to move,

1519
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,920
we have to manufacture shit and we have 
to move it around places because people 

1520
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:38,920
need stuff.
You know,

1521
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,890
you got to get food to supermarkets,
you gotta,

1522
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:42,230
you gotTa keep growing it.
You got to keep it can keep a good cycle

1523
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:44,300
going on.
So you've got to burn something.

1524
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,250
You gotta use something's got to run 
those engines.

1525
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,640
And then on top of that you have to have
at least public transportation.

1526
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:51,740
And then people were going to want to 
have cars.

1527
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,420
Okay,
how are you going to get all this shit?

1528
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,460
Just drives you crazy thinking about 
that doughnut.

1529
01:10:55,490 --> 01:11:00,490
Well,
it's amazing that we got so out of hand 

1530
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:00,490
and we got out as a society.
We're like,

1531
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:04,631
um,
it's like someone who was just at a 

1532
01:11:04,631 --> 01:11:05,900
college and you gave them an unlimited 
mastercard and you don't have to pay for

1533
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:08,570
the first year.
And they just fucking went bananas,

1534
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:13,950
you know,
they went bananas to the point where 

1535
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,160
it's completely unsustainable and then 
you realize you have this debt of

1536
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:18,850
the way you're living.
It's just so disproportionate resources.

1537
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:24,080
Here's the ultimate kicker to all of us.
There are not enough resources in the 

1538
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,650
world to pay off the debt that has been 
printed since 2008.

1539
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:33,980
All the bailouts or debt.
So all the resources in the world like 

1540
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,740
as far as all the gold,
all the diamonds,

1541
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:38,070
all the oil.
How about iron and copper and food.

1542
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:43,310
But energy is the first resource because
without energy you can't use anything 

1543
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,120
else.
So that's amazing.

1544
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:50,121
So how is that possible that we have an 
economy that's not based on an entirely 

1545
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:50,700
what,
what?

1546
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:55,701
Anything can be worth,
that that just shows you how completely 

1547
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:56,580
full of Shit.
The whole idea of the economy is,

1548
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:01,820
if they're the whole,
all the resources of the world and you 

1549
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:01,820
owe more than that.
Someone got fucked.

1550
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,750
Someone.
Someone,

1551
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:05,190
someone fucked you out of the whole 
world.

1552
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,050
Plus.
Yes.

1553
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,960
Think about that.
Think about how strong the fuckery is in

1554
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:14,961
this economy.
That is so bad that literally we owe 

1555
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,120
more than there is value in anything in 
the world to pay off.

1556
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:24,240
It costs more to make a penny than a 
penny's worth the same thing.

1557
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:27,780
I mean it seriously,
but here's,

1558
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:29,190
here's,
here's,

1559
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,160
here's the catch to all of that is 
founded,

1560
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:36,240
founded on a premise of infinite growth.
Wow.

1561
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:42,270
Infinite growth on a finite planet.
It is not possible with finite 

1562
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:43,140
resources.
Yeah.

1563
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,240
Have you ever read black gold 
stranglehold?

1564
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,110
Do you know the premise behind that?
Oh,

1565
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,920
that was.
Who was that?

1566
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,370
Was that your room course?
No,

1567
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,890
that was sinful book.
Wasn't really.

1568
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:54,870
I had it on my disinfect show.
Really?

1569
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,150
Yeah.
So it was a book that was,

1570
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,960
it was still completely ridiculous.
I was like,

1571
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:01,350
well,
how do you,

1572
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:02,870
how is that guy that knows it?

1573
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,540
Uh,
the,

1574
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:08,550
the premise was that goal that oil was,
I'm not a byproduct of fossil fuels or a

1575
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:09,780
biotic.
Yeah.

1576
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:10,560
Yeah.
That,

1577
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:15,561
it was a process of the.
It was like literally the blood of the 

1578
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:16,230
earth.
Earth has an endlessly filled,

1579
01:13:16,231 --> 01:13:21,231
creamy nougat center that will satisfy 
your every desire for as long as you're 

1580
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:21,690
Kinky,
as should crave it.

1581
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:26,800
What dirty evil vampire cons people are.
We just suck the oil out of the earth 

1582
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:29,700
until it's dead.
That's what we're doing.

1583
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:33,870
We're running our entire crazy business 
on the blood of the earth.

1584
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,140
We're like the craziest.
Exactly what it is to.

1585
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,170
Yeah,
it is the blood of the earth.

1586
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:42,180
Soil is life.
All we're doing is burning ancient 

1587
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,481
sunlight that was stored in light.
It's all solar energy in one form or 

1588
01:13:44,481 --> 01:13:48,141
another on this planet.
It's crazy when you really stop and 

1589
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:48,141
think about it like that.
It is God.

1590
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:50,220
It's amazing.
It's amazing when you really think about

1591
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,230
what it is.
Why do you think they're natives?

1592
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:54,540
Call it father sky,
because they were dumb.

1593
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:58,120
They didn't shit.
They didn't know.

1594
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,380
Oh yes they did.
They didn't even have fucking horses,

1595
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,730
man.
We had given them horses settled down.

1596
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,670
Fucking magic.
That might be all fake.

1597
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,800
Listen man,
those are the people that came across 

1598
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:10,800
the bering strait.
And it was proven recently actually when

1599
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,120
this Mormon tried

1600
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,520
to,
uh,

1601
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,320
tried to flex because he in the Mormon 
Book of Mormon,

1602
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:20,620
whatever the fuck that nonsense that 
Joseph Smith character wrote when he was

1603
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:24,220
14 years old,
that everybody followed along with a,

1604
01:14:24,221 --> 01:14:29,221
it was said that they believe that the 
American Indian was actually the lost 

1605
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:34,690
tribe of Israel and that he was going to
prove it with a genetic test.

1606
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,400
So he ran a DNA sequence on an American 
Indian.

1607
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:43,120
And most,
most of it is a actually Asian.

1608
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:47,080
Most American Indians are actually.
They came down from the street hockey.

1609
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,730
Joe was 18 sixties running a DNA test.
What?

1610
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,180
No,
no,

1611
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:51,420
no,
no.

1612
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:56,450
Recently ran a DNA test on American 
Indians and find out the origin because 

1613
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,680
if they were Israelis,
he could like see this is the lost tribe

1614
01:14:58,681 --> 01:15:01,020
of Israel.
If there were some medic and he could,

1615
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,360
I guess they could find that out,
but it was not.

1616
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:06,540
It was the most likely that they were 
Asian religions or business.

1617
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:12,010
And I really think overall Christianity 
had the best business plan.

1618
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:17,011
That's what it boils down to a.
But what's happening now is people are 

1619
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:21,721
also beginning to understand that part 
of this great awakening is that many of 

1620
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:27,751
us are returning to wisdom that existed 
before the word religion even existed.

1621
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:33,541
It was.
It was the knowledge of the ancients 

1622
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,440
living in direct connection with this 
planet and everything on it.

1623
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,560
You can adjust the tension.
You can absolutely learn from other 

1624
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,290
people's revelations that are written 
down and recorded,

1625
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:44,920
but the moment that people start 
attaching gods to them,

1626
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,260
and sorry that you were talking about a 
bunch of Shit,

1627
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:48,640
you don't really know what the fuck 
you're talking about.

1628
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:53,641
If you're a human being,
then you really don't know what you're 

1629
01:15:53,641 --> 01:15:55,861
saying.
You're saying you're saying a bunch of 

1630
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:55,861
nonsense.
You know?

1631
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:55,861
Either you learned something or you 
didn't,

1632
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:56,680
but they.
When you,

1633
01:15:56,681 --> 01:16:01,681
when you start thinking about things 
like Mormons are scientologists or 

1634
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:04,030
anything where it's like just even a 
whiff of crazy.

1635
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,950
It's like,
how do you address that?

1636
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,050
Had Dog allow it to happen is.
I'll tell Ya,

1637
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:13,070
I've never met nicer folks than Mormons.
Some of the nicest people I know are 

1638
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:17,041
Mormons.
They have a great sense of community in 

1639
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:17,041
the Mormon Church.
Um,

1640
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:18,560
I've actually been to services before 
because I had friends that were Mormon.

1641
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:22,420
I've been to a mormon funeral before.
They are very polite and nice people,

1642
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:24,110
and if you wanted to find like a 
religion,

1643
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:24,550
he said,
well,

1644
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:26,440
here's a religion.
It looks like it.

1645
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:29,890
It enhances family life a little bit.
They do a lot of things together.

1646
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:34,891
There's probably a lot of benefits to it
when you get past the fact that it's 

1647
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,890
based on some nonsense fairy tale 
written by a young con man.

1648
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,070
Mormons are also very,
very,

1649
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:44,071
very smart in that they have focused on 
food storage and food preparation for a 

1650
01:16:45,941 --> 01:16:50,941
long time and that is the single most 
critical factor for who's going to make 

1651
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:51,850
it and who's not in.
You Go,

1652
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:52,420
dude.
You do.

1653
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,130
You have to bring everyone back to the 
end of the world.

1654
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,780
Doom and gloom.
Well,

1655
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:57,190
no.
We need to take.

1656
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:02,210
You might have a wake up.
It was the last time you were at 

1657
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:02,210
Disneyland,
man.

1658
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:02,210
Oh my God.

1659
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,370
No,
it works today.

1660
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:08,610
But you should go to Disneyland before,
like the fucking planet of the apes 

1661
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:12,531
stocks.
Collapse of civilization happens and 

1662
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:14,621
you're out there mad max in it and 
you're fucking bio diesel truck and you 

1663
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:18,041
pass by the Disneyland when Anaheim is a
fucking ghost town and you have to get 

1664
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:18,230
in the car because the zombies are 
common.

1665
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:23,260
This sounds like a movie.
There's a movie woody house and would 

1666
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:23,260
be.
It's like,

1667
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:23,260
what was that?
Zombieland.

1668
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,720
Zombieland deuce.
Zombie land.

1669
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,860
Duke's go.
Disney land brings him Fox.

1670
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,830
Yeah.
Just fuck up some zombies at Disneyland.

1671
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:31,550
Actually.
You know,

1672
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:33,040
if there were places to party,
I,

1673
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,760
I can think of a couple more.
I'd rather party assets.

1674
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:36,650
Beautiful.
Disneyland.

1675
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:37,580
It's fun.
It's great.

1676
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:39,120
Did you end up going the other day?
Oh,

1677
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,580
it was awesome.
I want to go.

1678
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:41,970
There you go during the week day,
man.

1679
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:44,960
It's great to use the APP.
Did you know it was really.

1680
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,170
The lines were easy.
Well,

1681
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:49,220
I go on little kid rides.
A totally different experience.

1682
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:52,010
I'm not waiting for space mountain.
I remember waiting like 10 minutes to go

1683
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:57,011
in the submarine the submarine.
And I liked the teacups that just kids 

1684
01:17:57,011 --> 01:17:57,770
love tea kills her fun.
Those are fun.

1685
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,070
Disneyland.
It's fun when you,

1686
01:17:59,071 --> 01:18:04,071
when they're your kids.
It's really an amazing thing that 

1687
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:05,840
happens when you have kids is that you 
get the actual joy of them having joy.

1688
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:11,050
It's really strange.
Like I used to see kids having fun and 

1689
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:11,050
not go,
oh,

1690
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:11,960
that kid looks like he's having fun.
That looks awesome.

1691
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:14,780
And it would make me feel good.
But it doesn't make you feel good.

1692
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:19,810
Like you're a little kid experiencing 
the happiness when you have a kid and 

1693
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:24,131
they're happy,
like jumping around and laughing and 

1694
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:24,131
having a good time.

1695
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:25,370
You actually experienced that feeling.
It's like you live through it.

1696
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,830
It's amazing.
You know what I don't like?

1697
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:30,410
I don't like when kids have that thing 
where they,

1698
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,450
out of nowhere they just start grabbing 
on your leg and like,

1699
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:38,480
like,
like holding onto you and you're like a 

1700
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,211
random stranger kid.
You're at the garden or something like 

1701
01:18:40,211 --> 01:18:40,211
that.
They're just grabbing it.

1702
01:18:40,211 --> 01:18:40,211
Yeah,
it's uncomfortable.

1703
01:18:40,211 --> 01:18:41,050
You're like,
I'm good.

1704
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:44,830
You're do I start documenting like,
I don't want to be happened.

1705
01:18:44,831 --> 01:18:46,030
Nothing happened.
But Buddy,

1706
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:46,830
yeah,
I will.

1707
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,150
I don't want to pick your kid up and 
have you weird out to some dude.

1708
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:51,380
Just picked up your kid.
You'd be like,

1709
01:18:51,381 --> 01:18:52,670
hey man,
what are you doing with the baby?

1710
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:58,010
Got that.
What a commentary on this world.

1711
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,770
Well,
go automatically there.

1712
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:04,030
It's like there's so many of us,
there's so many of us that the,

1713
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,250
the amazing spectrum of human behavior,
it's,

1714
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,930
it's,
there are possibilities.

1715
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,730
You can run into people that are 
completely crazy.

1716
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:14,290
We all have in our day,
you know,

1717
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:19,420
in the world of martial arts and 
fighters and I run into some fucking 

1718
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,931
crazy people.
I'm sure your world takes that to the 

1719
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:22,931
next level times 10.
You know,

1720
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:27,590
being a police officer in Los Angeles 
and all this shit that you've seen.

1721
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:28,160
I mean,
your,

1722
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:33,430
your like Douchebag to nice people ratio
that you saw in your line of duty is.

1723
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,590
Oh yeah,
it's fucking hard to.

1724
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,530
Hard to keep a,
a cheerful profile.

1725
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,930
Well,
that's one of the,

1726
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,570
there's a jesuit mystic named Anthony de
Mello and he has a great line.

1727
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:51,590
He says there comes a point in your life
when your options are to either go stark

1728
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:53,980
raving insane,
commit suicide or become a mystic.

1729
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,970
Hmm.
I want to be a master.

1730
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:57,650
Well,
you are a man.

1731
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:02,890
Really?
I think I would want to be like the 

1732
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,871
silver surfer dude.
I want to silver surfer reboot if you 

1733
01:20:04,871 --> 01:20:05,180
could.
Yeah.

1734
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:05,690
Fuck.
Yeah.

1735
01:20:05,691 --> 01:20:07,800
I want it to be like digital,
like style,

1736
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,020
like

1737
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,450
where it's like when he's flying or like
digital.

1738
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,890
I enjoyed the first silver surfer.
That's good movie.

1739
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,570
Yeah.
W reboot that.

1740
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:18,080
Who owns that together?
Company don't silvers.

1741
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,610
Well it was,
it wasn't a part of the avengers or.

1742
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:21,780
No,
not the avengers rather.

1743
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:24,150
Um,
fantastic for no testing.

1744
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,210
One thing was where was,
where was the last silver surfer?

1745
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:32,211
I want to say it was one of the 
fantastic four movies singing x men x 

1746
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,390
men.
It was that.

1747
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,260
Yeah,
it is Eczema.

1748
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:34,760
Yeah.
Yeah,

1749
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,940
yeah.
It's been one of the exponent.

1750
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:36,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

1751
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:41,660
[inaudible] got to find out which one 
fantastic brick dude in that stretchy 

1752
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:44,370
dude that was like silver surfer wasn't 
involved in that.

1753
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,460
I don't think so because I think silver 
surfer was straight.

1754
01:20:47,461 --> 01:20:49,820
What isn't he?
I think he's.

1755
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,690
I think he's looking at God or 
something.

1756
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:53,570
Wow.
Remember the story behind it?

1757
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:58,940
Thought you were going to come on for a 
serious discussion about the end of the 

1758
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,990
world.
This is like a download.

1759
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:03,780
I'm just checking what's going on in the
universe around here and.

1760
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,960
Well,
I just think it's possible that a lot of

1761
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:10,410
people.
Okay,

1762
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:11,210
here's,
here's a.

1763
01:21:11,211 --> 01:21:13,470
here's a funny thing.
When you're worried about the end of the

1764
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:18,471
world,
you worried about the collapse of 

1765
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:19,911
civilization and in the meanwhile people
see a smoking cigarettes and they go,

1766
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:25,850
if you want to stay healthy and happy,
why are you poisoning yourself?

1767
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:34,140
Deal with it.
That will now be a meme that will now be

1768
01:21:36,251 --> 01:21:39,400
a meme that was spread spread across the
Internet.

1769
01:21:39,401 --> 01:21:42,480
So beautiful.
But I mean,

1770
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,220
I was talking with my friend Duncan 
about this.

1771
01:21:45,221 --> 01:21:50,221
We were talking about people were like 
looking for chem trails while they're 

1772
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:50,860
smoking cigarettes.
They're fucking poison me from this guy.

1773
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,980
Um,
you're poisoning yourself too.

1774
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,410
Doesn't matter.
Enjoy it.

1775
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:00,080
I've,
I am what I am.

1776
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,960
At 61 years of age,
after all the shit that I've done in my 

1777
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,190
life and I'm alive and healthy,
I got wounds and scars and don't.

1778
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,550
We don't go there and it's like 
cigarettes.

1779
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,380
If civilization falls apart,
do you have a stockpile of cigarettes?

1780
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:19,040
Are you just going to quit?
I don't have a huge stockpile.

1781
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,690
All rationale quit.
If I have to.

1782
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:23,240
Wow.
Would that be the biggest thing that you

1783
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:25,370
would miss about civilization?
What would it be?

1784
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:26,820
The Internet.
Oh,

1785
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:28,850
I would not.
I'm tired of the Internet,

1786
01:22:28,851 --> 01:22:29,200
Dude.
I.

1787
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:31,610
I needed prior to the Internet.
I need to be getting there.

1788
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,620
I'm getting tired at the end,
so we'll both.

1789
01:22:33,621 --> 01:22:35,210
You guys are pussies.
You should go get.

1790
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,570
Go in a room together and make fuck 
you're talking about.

1791
01:22:38,571 --> 01:22:43,571
I love the Internet.
It's the greatest thing that human 

1792
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:43,571
nature is ever invented.
Well,

1793
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:45,230
that's where you're clicking right now,
but see,

1794
01:22:45,231 --> 01:22:50,231
I'm what I'm saying.
I'm starting to click in a different 

1795
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:50,231
direction.
I'm starting to click.

1796
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:51,930
I'm moving more to live in my spiritual,
my inner life and,

1797
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:56,931
and building my own life boat because he
needed a night on the town hookers and 

1798
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:03,780
that's what you need in a limo and a,
and an Asian driver knows how to weave 

1799
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:06,010
through traffic.
No,

1800
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,550
I think I'd rather just have a big party
at my house or we cook a leg of lamb and

1801
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:12,130
all sit around and eat it.
Sounds awesome.

1802
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:17,131
Smoke a little herb.
Eat organic food and then then bigfoot 

1803
01:23:17,131 --> 01:23:21,000
makes it to the board.
Anybody who wants to go off and make 

1804
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,000
love to you,
just do it.

1805
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,730
Don't you live up in big foot country?
There's bigfoot sightings up there.

1806
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:25,750
Say Northern California.
I don't think so.

1807
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,710
Have you ever been to a swinger party?
Uh,

1808
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,210
kind of.
Yes.

1809
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:33,590
And kind of know.
It was like,

1810
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,080
yeah,
I know going in,

1811
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:38,780
but then it turned into one time I broke
out in the middle of it.

1812
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah.
Wow.

1813
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,750
Yeah.
I want to go to wine.

1814
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,960
Yeah.
You think that trying to fuck,

1815
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:47,910
you know,
I wouldn't do that of a man.

1816
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,790
What's the word?
What's the hang up man?

1817
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:51,440
Putting your butt,
man.

1818
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:54,590
No Man,
fuck your wife.

1819
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,780
I'm like,
let's get out of here.

1820
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,640
Is that a broomstick?
Trying to have stone Burbank's though.

1821
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,740
I got a feeling that broomstick stories 
kind of spread.

1822
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:10,670
I would imagine it would get on the 
Internet and that's a ridiculous way to 

1823
01:24:10,681 --> 01:24:11,410
die.
Oh,

1824
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,270
well I have another one.
Okay,

1825
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:18,290
that's pretty good.
I get a call to a dead body and in the 

1826
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,110
ambulance suicide in a,
in a,

1827
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:23,520
in,
in the jungle and Wilshire Division.

1828
01:24:23,521 --> 01:24:25,980
Then,
and we roll up and here's,

1829
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:30,000
here's this dead guy in an easy chair.
It's Kinda like this.

1830
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:35,570
And I walk up and look in risks are 
slashed blood out.

1831
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,890
But then I look up and his throat's also
slashed.

1832
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:47,450
Think about that.
His wife was saying she committed 

1833
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:50,451
suicide.
How you cannot slash your own flesh or 

1834
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:54,630
residency depressed and can't do it.
She went to jail for murder.

1835
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:56,440
He had been beaten or for,
you know,

1836
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,390
for so many years and she just lost it 
one day and uh,

1837
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,980
you know,
8 million tragic stories,

1838
01:25:01,981 --> 01:25:03,630
but he was definitely not a suicide.

1839
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:06,380
Why can't you do that?
Why can't you slash your throat and then

1840
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:11,381
cut your own risks?
Can you do risk and then throw it out 

1841
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:11,381
too fast.
You'll bleed out too fast.

1842
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:12,920
Whoa.
They make the movies.

1843
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:17,921
Make it seem like you could like 
actually play a piano song before you 

1844
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:20,771
die.
She must have been a bad ass bitch 

1845
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:20,771
though.
She could pull that off.

1846
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:20,771
Cut a guy's wrist and his neck.
It's amazing.

1847
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:22,790
And people get tired of kicking their 
ass.

1848
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:25,760
It's amazing what raged can do.
You know,

1849
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,980
it's fucking assholes out there.
We have whatever we have stopped that 

1850
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:35,381
Michael Rupert is.
That's my number one goal in life 

1851
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,841
lately.
So figuring out how to diminish the 

1852
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:37,841
amount of assholes in the world.
Hey,

1853
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,100
I get off the Internet.
The Internet has the secret.

1854
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,010
I became a cop trying to do that.
And,

1855
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,960
and you know,
clearly that's a losing battle.

1856
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:46,840
That was your motivation to become 
himself,

1857
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:48,890
to try to make a difference.
Absolutely.

1858
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:54,460
Do you remember when you started to 
realize that the system was almost like 

1859
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:55,760
unfixable?

1860
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,020
Uh,
well,

1861
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:02,180
you,
you require that in stages.

1862
01:26:02,181 --> 01:26:04,490
I mean,
I pulled worm out of a can,

1863
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,650
CIA bringing drugs into the country.
I said,

1864
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:11,651
this is wrong.
As soon as I get this to the right 

1865
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:11,651
people's attention,
they'll stop it immediately.

1866
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:12,710
Wrong.
Of course.

1867
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:14,940
That was before Iran Contra.
And uh,

1868
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:19,190
and so that worm turned out to be all of
human industrial civilization.

1869
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:24,191
It,
it turned out to be the whole economic 

1870
01:26:24,191 --> 01:26:24,191
paradigm.
It turned out to be.

1871
01:26:24,191 --> 01:26:26,150
Everything was crooked.
Everything was a lie.

1872
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:31,180
Everything was manipulated.
I had a CIA friend recently who I was 

1873
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,140
talking to,
a former CIA guy and,

1874
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,150
and he had been in a meeting,
uh,

1875
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:42,410
that was the first briefing of Bill 
Casey as a DCI under Ronald Reagan,

1876
01:26:42,651 --> 01:26:45,530
director of Central Intelligence.
Bill Casey wore the glasses,

1877
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,240
start,
ran around contract.

1878
01:26:47,241 --> 01:26:50,570
He had been a stock broker before he 
became CIA director.

1879
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,600
There's a clue.
And Bill Casey took a US domestic 

1880
01:26:55,671 --> 01:27:00,671
cocaine consumption from 60 metric tons 
in 1979 to 600 metric tons.

1881
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:06,340
And that money went to Wall Street.
So,

1882
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:11,480
uh,
Casey had his first briefing as DCI and 

1883
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:11,480
he said,
gentlemen,

1884
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,850
we will know that everything that,
that we are successful,

1885
01:27:13,851 --> 01:27:17,720
when everything that the American people
believe is true is false.

1886
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,770
Jesus Christ,
I've been around,

1887
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,810
you know,
I kept good notes.

1888
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:30,811
That's why I'm alive.
I took really good notes and I left a 

1889
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:30,811
good solid record.
You know,

1890
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:37,490
so you think you're alive because you've
said too much already and there's 

1891
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:37,490
nothing they could do about it.
And it's like,

1892
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:37,490
it's,
it's out there.

1893
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:38,550
No big deal.
Let him live.

1894
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:41,300
I also think I'm alive because spirit 
wants me alive.

1895
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:45,080
The spirit I've had,
I've had spirit intervened so many times

1896
01:27:45,081 --> 01:27:47,240
in my life.
And that's part of what the story is now

1897
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:52,241
that I have to tell in my next book 
because there is something powerful and,

1898
01:27:53,611 --> 01:27:57,410
and I think wonderful a foot here.
And all I can do is tell the truth about

1899
01:27:57,411 --> 01:28:02,411
it,
but it would be dishonest of me as a 

1900
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:02,411
journalist to leave that out of the work
that I've already done.

1901
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:06,010
When you exposed all this,
when you expose the CIA,

1902
01:28:06,011 --> 01:28:08,150
when you stepped in front of the,
uh,

1903
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:10,780
what was the man's a designation?
The guy that you,

1904
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:11,230
uh,
that

1905
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,210
and John John Deutch,
he was DCI,

1906
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:17,360
director of Central Intelligence,
appointed by Bill Clinton.

1907
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,690
That was an incredibly courageous thing 
to do on camera,

1908
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,350
you know,
to step in and,

1909
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:26,410
and not just say that you were a former 
Los Angeles police,

1910
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:31,420
narcotics officers that when you were,
that it caught the CIA doing this,

1911
01:28:31,421 --> 01:28:33,230
but you named operations,
you know,

1912
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,060
mean you,
you,

1913
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:35,920
you gave out information.
It wasn't just,

1914
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:38,910
it wasn't just a,
a blank slate.

1915
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,900
I had a lot of shit.
Yeah.

1916
01:28:40,901 --> 01:28:45,840
That must be the worst fucking case 
scenario for the,

1917
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:49,360
the creepy industrialists.
Constant run the world.

1918
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:54,420
Some dude who wants to be a superhero.
Some dude who wants to save the world.

1919
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:59,641
So now I'm just pissed off.
I hear him just fucking pissed off for

1920
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,540
a good reason.
And you don't,

1921
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,730
you don't want to recognize this,
but that's a hero move.

1922
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:08,040
Okay.
When a guy does that and stands in front

1923
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:10,590
of a motherfucker like that and you say 
what you said,

1924
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,170
it's Brian,
do you have that clip?

1925
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,060
Hold up.
Pull that clip up.

1926
01:29:15,061 --> 01:29:19,140
Because for people who don't know who 
haven't heard this or seen this,

1927
01:29:19,141 --> 01:29:20,880
this is pretty intense stuff,
man.

1928
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:22,770
Gonna make me smoke.
Yeah,

1929
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:23,800
go ahead and smoke.
Well it was,

1930
01:29:23,801 --> 01:29:25,320
it's a,
it's a courageous move,

1931
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:26,570
man.
I mean it,

1932
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,610
it takes a note that I know you couldn't
help but your courageous,

1933
01:29:29,611 --> 01:29:33,660
you can't help but you just,
it's what I wanted to get at was.

1934
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:34,980
Sorry,
what was,

1935
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:40,070
what was your thought process and what 
was it like when you finally got that 

1936
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,380
information now when it came out of your
mouth,

1937
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,250
what was the,
what was it,

1938
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,860
what did that feel like when that whole 
courtroom was cheering?

1939
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:44,810
Oh,
that wasn't,

1940
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:46,590
you knew that he was the high school 
auditorium.

1941
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:51,591
There were 12 slash 12 and uh,
it was high.

1942
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:54,030
I was,
it was unbelievably high.

1943
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,170
It was like super peak awareness.
You know,

1944
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,830
how it is when you know how it is.
And,

1945
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,350
and it was like,
whoa.

1946
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,920
It was like one of my favorite maxims is
don't shoot unless you've got a 

1947
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,280
headshot,
and I had John Deutch and a headshot and

1948
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:12,030
I pulled the fucking trigger and that 
cost him his appointment as secretary of

1949
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:13,200
defense.
Really?

1950
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:15,540
Yeah,
and because he clowned him like that.

1951
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,600
Oh,
we didn't have anything like a sound 

1952
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,050
bite is wringing his hands and he looked
like the typical evil white dude's 

1953
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:27,170
that's exploiting.
Yeah.

1954
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:32,180
That's it.
Back back it up so people could see it 

1955
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,550
as soon as November 15th,
1996 as a former Los Angeles police.

1956
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:35,990
Narcotics.
