1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
The problem with Brian's fucking
microphone. Listen to that God damn fan.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,480
God that fence socks. Yeah. Until you,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,470
when you turn your mic up and
down when you're going to,

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,770
you're going to have to do that when
you talk because that microphone is dog

5
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,604
shit.
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,220
Okay.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,380
Be careful you drink there.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,750
Okay.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,640
The Joe Rogan experience.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,290
Try my day. Joe Rogan
podcast. My name all day.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,210
You're right. I think he's loud as heck
out over here. Yeah, we live. Yeah. Okay.

12
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,420
Yeah, the thing's loud as fuck.
We have a problem here folks.

13
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:37,410
It's not a major problem.

14
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:42,411
We have this new tri caster
set up HD Joe Diaz HD now,

15
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:47,070
but unfortunately the tri caster as
fans on it, it's super noisy where, uh,

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,170
Brian's microphone is positioned.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,170
Maybe I could just sit over there until
we fix this because it over there. Yeah.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,490
We'll throw a camera on you. You
don't let Jamie run it. Fuck it. Yeah.

19
00:00:56,491 --> 00:01:01,440
Come on over here bitch. To be one of us.
Come over to the big boys table. Uh, we,

20
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,990
uh, we got this try gas are
set up and it's pretty sweet.

21
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,020
It's because a lot of people watch
this on their televisions. You know,

22
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:11,730
you take like a chrome cast
or you just use an htmi cable.

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,370
There's a bunch of different ways
you could do it and you send,

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,490
or you could use that apple thing where
you throw it to apple TV and you could

25
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:22,110
wash it on apple TV. What does that
called? APPLETV airplay. Airplay. Yeah.

26
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,690
So anything that's on your
computer you could watch on TV.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,100
He just shoot it to that. And if you're
using the uh, air, that's how it works,

28
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,860
right? Yeah. Yeah. Do it from your iPad or
your iPhone or anything like that? Yeah,

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,890
it's pretty fucking sweet.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,950
So we're moving into 2015
show does fucking crazy.

31
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:41,780
But take a chance to the next level.
I've canceled cable. Did she write?

32
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,100
Yeah, she kept some package.
She said that's it. We will
live on Netflix. I love it.

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,680
Well, I gotta tell you I love
it. I love it too. I love it.

34
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,290
I ain't go online and you want
to come home at night comedy,

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,890
Netflix and I unwind and I could
watch whatever the fuck I want. Yeah.

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,790
A buddy of mine worked for Psi
Phi for 20 years and he said,

37
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,170
I got it once he goes,

38
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:04,510
I would watch how my children are watch
TV and I knew that they were on the some

39
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,570
kids. Yeah. And I kept going to siphon
down them and they were like, fuck,

40
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:09,580
do you know we've talked with Mike.

41
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:12,770
He quit and he started his own
youtube channel. Harvest. Shoney's,

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,611
fucking killing them.

43
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:18,611
But it's funny how even my daughter goes
nuts when a commercial comes on when

44
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:22,580
she's watching bubble guppies
and the commercial comes on.

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,620
She do is she looks at me like,
cause she's not used to it on Netflix.

46
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,970
When I put on Dora, whatever, the
Grinch that stole Christmas or whatever,

47
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:35,810
there's no commercial. So
for her it's fucking it. So
I watched her the other day,

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,970
I'm like, look at us. Yeah.

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,990
Even a fucking three year old tells
you that commercial suck ass. Yeah.

50
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,824
They're not fun.

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
It's, it's unnecessary and it
ruins the vibe of the show.

52
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:49,860
I've watched the walking dead almost
entirely on Netflix or an apple TV rather.

53
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,380
But I, um, uh, decided uh, to,

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,410
to record it on my DVR one night
and I tried watching it on,

55
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,120
on regular TV. Oh, it's fucking
awful. Through my watched it. Oh,

56
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:01,631
that's what it was.

57
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:06,010
I watched it live without recording it
because you can't watch it on apple TV

58
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,830
until the next day. So it came out
on Sunday, so I watched it live,

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,250
so we just paused it and walked away
for 20 minutes and came back so we could

60
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,650
fast forward through all the bullshit.

61
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,660
But it's like every fucking 15 minutes
they have this big break in the show

62
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:23,881
stops and it's a dumb way
to intrude on television.

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,300
It's like for whatever reason,

64
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,700
they started doing it like
that and they stuck with it.

65
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,600
And some guys do it like that with
podcasts. Like I love Adam Carolla,

66
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,570
but Adam Carolla does commercials
like a radio show. He just,

67
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,660
he does them all the time. He doesn't mean
every 15 minutes, you know, he's like,

68
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:41,880
he's got like breaks like heartbreaks,
just like a radio show, you know,

69
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,520
I guess that's the world he came from.
So you just do it that way.

70
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,660
Will these new marketing
agencies that contact, you know,

71
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,160
they,
they trying to ruin you dangle big money,

72
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,960
but they want you to read 18 times a show.
You can't do that.

73
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,510
It becomes what we went to
get away from. Yeah. You know,

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,160
so no I don't interrupt.
I won't interrupt.

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,580
I do it before I do it afterwards.
How put Shit on Twitter.

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,220
If I think it's a good product
and I enjoy it, I'll do it.

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,790
But I'll do it with no contract.
Like if I, if I tweet something,

78
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,700
like if you see me tweet something
about naturebox, cause I like it.

79
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,820
Like I got these Sriracha cashews, they're
the shit and I love him. I love him.

80
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,630
So I tweeted like there's no agreement.
I don't have it.

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,830
There's no like you have to
tweet this five times a week.

82
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,910
There's none of that shit.

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,100
So I don't interrupt any podcasts
and I don't because I want,

84
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
I don't want that when
I'm listening to stuff.

85
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,640
I like stuff to go all the way through
to the end and I'd be more inclined to

86
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:40,340
support something that supported that.
Then I would beat inclined sport,

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,630
something that's that same old system.
That system sucks man,

88
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,060
that every 15 minutes
system you don't do it.

89
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,610
You don't have commercials any year
finding a deal. Any commercial. Yeah.

90
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,930
That's silly. Make some money. Well
I used to just say, hey, go do,

91
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,090
if you want to help out,
just go to shop squad.

92
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,710
And then that just takes
care of everything.

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,050
And one little swoop we rock in the
split screen now. Old School, like,

94
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,000
like the old days,
we're going old,

95
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,260
but we're going new again now we have,

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm sure I wouldn't get between
the apple TV and Netflix.

97
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,480
Well Netflix is incorporated in Apple TV.
So if you have an apple TV,

98
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,670
there's Netflix in there.
You just got to sign up for an account.

99
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,770
But you said that apple comes out the next
day. Netflix? No Netflix doesn't have,

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
uh, I don't think they have
the walking dead if they do.

101
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,990
It's probably like the earlier seasons
with apple. You buy the whole season,

102
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,960
like your rent the season and you could
watch like all the episodes at once,

103
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,350
which was lose route if you have a
day. Do you watch walking dead? No,

104
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,580
I'm scared of that. You
know, when I was a kid,

105
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:41,581
that one we would get high and go to go
on to the dead and those type of movies,

106
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,920
you know.
And that was George Miro.

107
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,650
Miro was the fucking crazy
fuck when I was a kid.

108
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,560
That's the guy that made all those
gowns night of the living dead.

109
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,300
And I still remember that one thing with
the black guy's yelling, Mama, Mama.

110
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,010
He stands next to the helicopter
and the helicopter just cuts

111
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,640
the top of his fucking head off. Oh
God. I'm just never, and I, you know,

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,850
I don't know. It's not for me. People
walking around like zombies and shit,

113
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,240
I have fucking nightmares and
stuff so I don't watch nothing.

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,950
American horror story is probably one
of the scariest motherfucking shows I've

115
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,950
turned down and lasting
for like 13 or 14 minutes.

116
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,000
Is it really that ladies fucking
scary though. What is her name again?

117
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,810
He used to be good looking because fuck
yeah, I was fucking, we were young.

118
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,320
What is her name? God Damn.
It's not Angelica Euston,
something like that. None.

119
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,820
Angelica Houston, the other one she
was in the mailman always rings twice.

120
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,820
The Postman always rings twice.
Got Damn. She was hot back then.

121
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,300
What is her name Ma'am? Just tried
Jessica Lange. Jessica Lange? Yes.

122
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:43,070
That's what it is. You know, she was a
Fay Wray and the King Kong remake the uh,

123
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,630
Dino de Laurentiis. Is that his name?
King Kong remake with Rick Baker,

124
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,330
which is like what that was
like the second King Kong.

125
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,180
There was like the old school King Kong.
It's a stop motion.

126
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:57,980
Claymation that looks like shit. But then
Rick Baker did a version of King Kong.

127
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:02,020
It was super sophisticated for
the time. And uh, she was, uh,

128
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,720
Jessica Lange was the fe ranch.
She was loud as fuck bro.

129
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,690
When Jack Nicholson put her on the
table and fucked in that movie.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,620
Tremendous look. She looked great.
She, yeah, she was smoldering.

131
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,610
But you know what man,

132
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,380
she as an actress like or at an actor
I guess you said it doesn't need to be

133
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,650
gender specific.
She fucking hold her own right now.

134
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,790
She is as good as anybody, man.
She is so creepy on that show.

135
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,320
She's so like powerfully creepy.
You know like there's like there's,

136
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,400
there's just a realism to her.
The crazy that she projects.

137
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,910
It scares the shit out of me man.
He's like judge on that too.

138
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,610
The one that played Tina Turner with the,
with the ISG.

139
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,180
She's in the new season. I haven't
watched it. The fat chick from the cutoff.

140
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:51,830
Jack [inaudible] legs. James Cons.
Legging. Kathy Bates. Is it the ball?

141
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,010
My God.
Gary as fucking show my wife watches.

142
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,163
Why

143
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,380
do you have to watch the oldest seasons
to be caught up or is it a new season?

144
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,650
A totally new story.
I don't know how it fucking works man.

145
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,970
You just tuned in to freak
out and get out of the room.

146
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:11,960
And I sit out like eight minutes.
I watched Jessica Lange,

147
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,050
I watched the black chick and
I get the fuck out of there.

148
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,640
That's a Larry of deal with that
shit at all. What pains you a hot,

149
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:23,360
I couldn't sleep for fucking angel
heart was on a couple of weeks ago and I

150
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:26,120
stayed up and watched the
fucking scare the shit out of me.

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,180
It's really well written because
they set up the first episodes.

152
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,600
Well I don't want to give any spoilers,
but family moves into this House and uh,

153
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,241
Jessica Lange,

154
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:37,400
he's like the neighbor or she comes
by and she comes by like unannounced.

155
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,510
It's real creepy how she
does it and it may, you know,

156
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,910
he knows she's fucking nuts.

157
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,500
And so the guys there with his wife and
his children and you're like, oh fuck.

158
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,260
Like this is going to end terrible.
Like draws you in.

159
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,190
Like right away you get nervous and
you feel freaked out like right away.

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,010
Get Hulu. Joey, did you
ever get Hulu? I think

161
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,843
so,
yeah.

162
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I quit my cable also in Hulu is actually
one of the best ones because you can do

163
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,700
shows usually the day after
or then at the same day.

164
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,400
Like south park is a good one on there.
If you'd like South Park.

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,140
What a network.
So they have what?

166
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,260
They have a lot of fox ones,
they have a

167
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,750
lot of NBC like Saturday night live
and stuff like that. It's, it's,

168
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,450
it's a nice blend of all the,

169
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:23,400
the main networks and also
they also have movies on there,

170
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:27,390
so it's a nice little change from
also Amazon prime is another thing.

171
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:31,170
If you have Amazon prime, you get access
to all of Amazon prime stuff. Awesome.

172
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,350
They have their own shows. Uh, and
you can also rent movies through them,

173
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,184
which is nice.

174
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,180
Wow. Yeah. It's the, all the
options that are available today.

175
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,060
You're not the first
person to tell me either.

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,700
I have several friends that
have cancer though. Thank you.

177
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,770
Said I don't want to do a buck and a
half no more. I'm not doing it. Yeah,

178
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,850
it seems ridiculous doing it. Netflix
or seven bucks a month. That's really,

179
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,180
I mean it's $7 like that's so insane.

180
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,140
And they go once eight 99 yeah.
So for 20 you got that right.

181
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,630
And I think CBS just announced that they
have something for like five bucks and

182
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:01,950
you just get all of his cvs,

183
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,750
which is silly because he
can get it for free already.

184
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,150
But I guess the convenience of
downloading whatever you want,

185
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,130
HBO is going right. If you just want to
watch game of Thrones, fuck yeah. Yeah.

186
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:14,970
You just go HBO online. Right?
Pretty much becoming other cart,

187
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,400
which is something that I've
always wanted in a cable company.

188
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,190
Being able to pick and choose
which channels you want.

189
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,030
Cable companies are screwed. Yeah. And
when you develop a show, like if you were,

190
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,650
when I was doing, they'd Scifi
show, but you've filmed Michelle,

191
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,150
you edit it and once it's edited
then it has to wait for, you know,

192
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,370
whatever night it's on, Tuesday night
at eight o'clock, whatever it is.

193
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,930
And then you wait for it to go on.

194
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,610
And then the show broadcast live Tuesday
night at eight and they sandwich in a

195
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,230
bunch of shit that you don't want to see.

196
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,730
So in between that you're
watching priceless sec
commercials and fucking Toyota

197
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,220
commercials and all this shit
that you don't give a fuck.

198
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,760
You're just being there. They're
literally fucking with your experience.

199
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,550
Come on by me. Come on by this.
Hey, what about this? I feel better.

200
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:59,990
Look at my wife, looked at my
car, pick it up to the next one.

201
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:04,020
But what about us? You could buy, I was
told about us. Do you have insurance?

202
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,550
Your insurance run by a lizard and the
evo is fucking goofy shit and you you,

203
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,510
it ruins your experience. They don't
have to do that anymore. Say more.

204
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,260
What are they going to do for commercials?
Product placements.

205
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,830
I think mostly even grosser and I think
that's the reason why we're paying a

206
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:22,910
monthly subscription fee. If you
like holding up a fucking soda. Yeah,

207
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,930
I know why he killed her.
It's done right though.

208
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:30,110
South Park is a good example of them
doing it right. Where they actually,

209
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:34,460
I think have sponsors, but
they just trashed the sponsor
the whole time and real.

210
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeah.
I'm nowhere that they're just one episode.

211
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:41,240
There'll be doing like a Dr Pepper,
but yet the days just talk shit,

212
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,770
mad shit on Dr Pepper the whole time.

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,700
You could talk shit on Dr Pepper and Dr
Peppers base. Basically invincible. Yeah,

214
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,480
like as long as you're talking about Dr
Pepper it, unless it's killing anybody.

215
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:53,980
It's not killing anybody. But if you want
to talk shit about the way pepper taste

216
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,110
and in fact in anybody, you
know, I noticed that one nun,

217
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:00,730
it was watching Diane Sawyer the
day that Fucko said something.

218
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:04,560
Who's the guy who's the guy that said
no? Rush Limbaugh? What did he sells?

219
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,660
He took pills. Oh, he
was one of the years ago,

220
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,630
but then a couple of years ago on
his radio show, he said something,

221
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,620
I'm sitting there watching the Diane
Sawyer and she pops up on the screen.

222
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,650
You know what I'm saying?
They pop up the sponsors that left him.

223
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,930
No sponsors were like, fuck or wash,
lemon ball. We just hit the Jackpot.

224
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,420
That's what they don't really realize.
If they sponsored Joey Diaz,

225
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,160
his radio show and he says,
fuck whoever,

226
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,710
whatever John [inaudible]
group and they get rid of them.

227
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,000
Diane Sawyer is when they come up and go,
did you hear what happened?

228
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,690
Joey d is today and the Muslim, they show
American Airlines, Delta, Delta is gone.

229
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:44,560
We didn't lose we fucking six 30 Diane
Sawyer. That's as good as it fucking gets.

230
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,870
That's it.
They didn't lose.

231
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:50,340
So either way you don't lose because
they mentioned you, nobody loses.

232
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,260
They don't really fucking lose.
Did you see what happened with, uh,

233
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,830
here's a perfect example. I'm not
trashing out of Kroll. I, like I said,

234
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,670
I love Adam, but Adam had this check, uh,

235
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,940
Alison Rosen who was on her show and he
just decided he wanted to try something

236
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:06,700
different, which is his prerogative.
But here's what happened.

237
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,640
Her show shot through the fucking ratings.

238
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:13,930
It was number one out of all
podcasts on iTunes. And you know why?

239
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,290
Because people responded
because she's really nice.

240
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,030
Like Alison Rosen is really nice and
really smart and she's a good podcast her.

241
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,940
So like I think, and I even
sent her an email, I said,

242
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:27,670
you're going to be fantastic on your own.
Like you don't need anybody.

243
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,090
Like it's probably better for her to be
completely independent because I think

244
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,130
her show could be really profitable.

245
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,660
It can be really good and I think when
you that smart and that opinionated,

246
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:39,850
you should have your own show. I mean
she's really good but always light there.

247
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,380
Yeah, she always, she had
her own show for a long time.

248
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,120
She knows she still has it.

249
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,900
Alison Rosen is your best friend or
your new best friend. She's really,

250
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:52,550
she got fired. Show just shot up,
shot through the fucking Raider,

251
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,250
the fucking roof. And I think that
just shows you that like if you're, if,

252
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,960
if,
if it gets out there,

253
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:03,190
if there's controversy like oh Allison
got five port Raul's and pour hours and

254
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:06,030
what are you crazy? She's
number one now. She's never won.

255
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:07,980
She's shot past all of us.
She probably,

256
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,170
because there were so many online
stories about it and you know,

257
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,990
because the timing was really bad for
her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She does die.

258
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,750
Dog died and she was out of town
and it was done by email. You know,

259
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,150
there was like a lot going on
with it, but you know, hey man,

260
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:25,030
I know the guy should be able to do
whatever the fuck he wants to do with his

261
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:25,540
show.

262
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,540
But the bottom line is like she showed
that she was really good on the show and

263
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:34,450
then the controversy of
him firing her was huge.

264
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:39,451
It was way better than him like giving
her like some title or a promotion or you

265
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:44,560
know like if he announced Alison Rosen
been vice president of controversy and

266
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:48,700
Adam Carolla enterprises, nobody would
give a fuck. But her getting fired for it.

267
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:52,760
Like if, if you got on the radio
and you will like fuck the police,

268
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,260
fuck gastro, fuck all these cops suck.
Good, suck my Dick. And then you know,

269
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,570
nature box pulled out
and everybody got crazy.

270
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,050
We are no longer sponsoring the joy and
it was a big dog over these websites.

271
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,940
Naturebox pulls out of the,
Jody has podcasts.

272
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,030
You would get hundreds of
thousands more downloads that week.

273
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,230
Hundreds of that office look at, what's
his name? Uh, two and a half bath.

274
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,650
Metalli he got fired drugs,
hookers blow.

275
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,130
Fuck FX was right there with an envelope.
Not only we didn't have an envelope,

276
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:22,700
they gave him the stupidest deal
anyone's ever given. Anybody ever.

277
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,430
He made all the episodes they had,

278
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:28,580
they did a hundred episode deal and they
make them over a really short period of

279
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:32,930
time. So they're just
churning out scripts like you,

280
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,470
I don't have to tell you,
it takes time to write something good.

281
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,420
Sometimes it doesn't.
Sometimes you have the best idea.

282
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,480
Like you'll hear about Quentin Tarantino.
He did blow,

283
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,650
he ran up to his apartment real quick
and he just spent the next six hours

284
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,200
writing a script to, you know,
pulp fiction two or some shit.

285
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,510
Occasionally that does happen.
Like I'm a hunter.

286
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:55,420
Thompson wrote most of his, uh, Charlie,

287
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,890
the book he wrote about a hell's angels.

288
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,180
He wrote most of it coked up like
in one night. Like most of it,

289
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:06,710
like you finished up the book like in one
night just rattled off. It is possible,

290
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,060
but most of the time you get it.
Spend time, you got to do revisions.

291
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,320
So they're not doing any of that.

292
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:16,430
They just fucking slamming them out
there and if it went past x amount of

293
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,660
episodes,
I forget what the deal was.

294
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,630
They had to film all 90 so
he got this huge DLC. He,

295
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,040
he's like $900 million or
something stupid or $90 million.

296
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,750
Here's some in ungodly sum of money
from that deal. Somewhat a nine in it.

297
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,770
Jamie would know. I Bet Jamie knows the
exact number, but he's got a tattoo.

298
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,080
Well he was talking about
it all morning today.

299
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,830
I love gossip, Jamie. The whole idea,
it makes me laugh, but it's the,

300
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,480
the controversy for anything.
It's almost like worth doing.

301
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,080
That's why you know people,
they stir up shit on purpose.

302
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,490
Like anybody that's in like the
reality show business they like,

303
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,240
they're all they're doing is just
controversy, controversy, contrary.

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,140
Can we get some controversy
if we have controversies,

305
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:05,100
we've got to show
controversy tat tat tat ta,

306
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,090
I mean that's all they're trying to sell.
That's all they're trying to sell.

307
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,160
But you can see right through it. You
can, I can like, this is bullshit.

308
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,930
This is the,
the the white chick,

309
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:19,430
we'll call it the black husband with
a transvestite took them back and the

310
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,580
show's on me and she's like,
what do I do? It's such a tough,

311
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,480
he was going to fucking transvestite. You
get rid of that fucking freak. He says,

312
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,530
now she took him back again and now
they're on season eight and you know,

313
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:33,110
who even cares about that fucking broad.
I don't give a fuck.

314
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,990
People care if they put him
on the cover of a magazine,

315
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,510
like if you're on the cover of a
magazine and that's what you sell,

316
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,730
like those realities,
Star type people.

317
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,810
It just has to be there on the
cover and then something happens.

318
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,750
She dumped him for this guy.
There's a more handsome guy,

319
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:49,470
shit that now he's in the dumps.

320
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,650
That's all you need to know and all you
need to do. And then people go, well,

321
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,890
what happens next? What happens
to him? What happens to her? Well,

322
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,660
they'd be reunited. Well, she forgive
him. Will you forgive her? Ah,

323
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,140
they got me hooked.
I mean,

324
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,290
you don't even know what Kim
Kardashians fucking voice sounds like.

325
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,383
Do you understand that?

326
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,820
Like you would not be able to tell that
if Kim Kardashian was doing a commercial

327
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,100
for Delta, you wouldn't
be like, oh, that's Kim
Kardashians. But if like say um,

328
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,240
what's her name? Uh, from
friends? No, the other one.

329
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,370
Phoebe Cates. What's, what's
her? No, not Phoebe. Casey said.

330
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,840
What's her Kudrow Lisa Kudrow.
Thank you. It was gossip. Jamie.

331
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,230
You how funny it is when he turns to
Mike Honda that turn it off for a second.

332
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:32,700
Just so everybody can hear the fan.
That is so stupid. It's so stupid.

333
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,100
We're working on now. We're working about
the video looks beautiful though. Um,

334
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,820
what is her name again?
According Cox, the general,

335
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,010
basically Sweetser could drink fucking
guys. Thick tip of his fingers of this.

336
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,550
No, I have not. The fucking plastic
surgery. Oh, I've seen her and they put,

337
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,360
they put friends before it. Some nights.
I'm way too young to fuck with her.

338
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,060
Yeah.
They have her on TMT and something on dbs.

339
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,950
They have friends on the TBL and cool.
Good thing.

340
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,290
When you're in a hotel room after doing
this show and you go there, they don't,

341
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,270
you're like, oh my God,
what the fuck happened?

342
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,020
That fucking plastic surgery those chicks
do. It doesn't make them look better.

343
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,100
It just makes them look different.
You know,

344
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:18,390
until like when you start shooting shit
into your face to freeze it up and puff

345
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,870
your cheeks up to hide wrinkles,
it does not make you look better.

346
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,290
It just makes you look different.
And there's the uncanny valley,

347
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,830
the uncanny valley as they do,

348
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,980
this is a term that used for
video games were with CGI.

349
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,400
They're really close to being able to
completely replicate what it person

350
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:39,500
normally it looks like. Don't pull
up her face. Don't be rude bitch.

351
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,750
This motherfucker's
gonna. Um, uncanny valley.

352
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,120
Like there's like,
um,

353
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,890
there's some videos that you could see
now like that Nvidia has created where

354
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:54,360
they are so close to it looking,
what is this, what are you showing?

355
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,320
It shows you all the different steps
they're not seeing. If this is for us. Oh,

356
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:02,670
I saw the different versions
of the uncanny valley, I'll
pop it up. So like, okay,

357
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:05,550
well let me just explain the term. Don't
you don't, don't put, don't pull this up.

358
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,740
Um, the, the term that they use in, in
you confusing the shit. I've got no idea.

359
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,470
Shut. This has nothing to do with that.
That's a different uncanny valley.

360
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,700
The uncanny valley that we're talking
about is the difference between CGI,

361
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,030
like high level CGI in a person.
Like it's so close,

362
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,670
but there's something creepy about
it and that's what they call it.

363
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:27,090
The uncanny valley. There's this
valid that they can't quite cross.

364
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,540
Like did you see him again? I,
yeah. Well did you see the, uh,

365
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,910
the latest Nvidia Shit? Have
you seen that? Uh, not that.

366
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,020
I'm pretty sure we could show that show
Nvidia's latest technology for a CGM.

367
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,420
The guys, the guys face.
We saw it in person,

368
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,000
me and Todd Mesereau from my TV show.

369
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,160
We went to see it in person
in northern California. That's

370
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,860
it.
That's the guy is fucking incredible man.

371
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,450
But it still hasn't bridged that uncanny
valley. We can show this on the podcast.

372
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,060
This is a all Nvidia's
technology and they have pores.

373
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,810
They have sweat.
But what they can't do is tongues.

374
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,310
So when the guys talking they can't quite
do tongues and the teeth look a little

375
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:14,140
fucking weird but look dead. Yeah,
but God damn, that's pretty close.

376
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,490
That's getting real close.
Ripped.

377
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:21,460
But there's still something about it
where you're like, man, I don't know.

378
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,870
They got skin down and they,

379
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,290
but they don't have edge down like the
edge detection around the forehead.

380
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,080
You can see it's a little weird and
yeah, like a green screen, right? Yeah.

381
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,360
It's like the difference between the,
the real,

382
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,940
well it's also why is everything in
the background blurry. Yeah. You know,

383
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,690
I guess that's just a sample, but
still it's, but you're pretending what?

384
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:43,450
This is an old school camera. Is that
what you're doing? Like, why is that?

385
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,870
Why that shit all blurry?
Like

386
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,050
that's ridiculous.
And it's heads floating,

387
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,560
but that's,
that's like real close.

388
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,180
But they still, they can't do
that yet. You know, they can't,

389
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,980
I don't know why we were
bringing up the uncanny valley.

390
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,930
We crude because of fucking people.
Plastic surgery, the bucked, the valley.

391
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,580
But that's what it is.

392
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,100
They all look the same and they're all
standing a little creepy and creepy and

393
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:10,770
they're not all going to be happy till
they all look like walking dead or

394
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:12,130
something like that.
They're all going to be,

395
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,620
they're all going to be
hanging out together.

396
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:17,160
All Yours looks great that
you got it done. No, you
don't have that fucking great.

397
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,020
You look like a fucking something
monstrous. They start looking monstrous.

398
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,660
It's a, it's unfortunate and it
looks, you know, it looks crazy.

399
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,360
Like you're a crazy person
like you're doing, you know,

400
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,500
it's not like some tribal thing where
you're doing like some tribal scarring on

401
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:36,330
your federal women mob wives.

402
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,280
Have you ever seen those women
know the big ones? Big Edge.

403
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,100
I just saw her last night when I was
scrolling. Yeah. Oh my God, they just,

404
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,630
she's shooting shit like jail summit.

405
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,390
She's just shooting the shit constantly.
All of those women,

406
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,130
those east coast women, the fake tits,
the, the fat taken off that body,

407
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:59,190
the tightening of the legs,
the, the ass implants.

408
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,120
You can put the implants in your ass.
By the way though,

409
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,560
got been torturing this
hook up for about a month.

410
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,690
We'll hooker Bobby Slayton style,
just torture, torture that,

411
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:10,070
you know,

412
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,320
who does I want it to sell 11 one night
on Magnolia there and I'd come out and

413
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,860
there's a black girl in the jeep that
is banging when she comes out. She goes,

414
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:20,280
he was staying there. I'm
like, yeah. She goes, hey,

415
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:23,580
really length again to stand though.
I'd like to talk more about it. I go,

416
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:27,570
this is an open mic at the ha ha. Go
down. And she goes, I've been down there,

417
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,610
but the is rude to me and all this shit.

418
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,550
So I go down there like three weeks
later I see it and I'm like, Hey man,

419
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:38,070
you've been trying. And she goes,
no, I'm still taking notes. I mean,

420
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,770
this chick is gorgeous. She
goes, I'm still taking notes,

421
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:42,630
but you can tell there's
something not right. You know,

422
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,260
when there's something not
right. So she's like, you know,

423
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:47,120
I just need somebody to
take me under their wing.

424
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,350
It's doing to me and all this stuff.

425
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:51,200
Can I get you a digit
and I'll give you a call?

426
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,380
And then she started with the calls,
you know, how are you blah, blah, blah.

427
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,280
I'm like, I'm fine. She goes, when can we,
I can't, you know, I can't teach a cat.

428
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,620
And they got to go out there and
go it, you know, blah, blah, blah.

429
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,720
And then finally I would go,
well, go here, you know, go
over there and go to fly.

430
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,750
I don't know what else to go.

431
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,150
And I wouldn't talk to her for weeks
at a time when she called me like,

432
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,770
where are you going to?
I'm going to the comedy store.

433
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,040
Can you talk to them for me? I can't get
you up at the fucking comedy and stuff.

434
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,060
And then when they should start talking
about her jeep blew up and she needs

435
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:21,380
$1,000, you know, I right there. I just
started giggling like I just know now,

436
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,040
once they do that,
you're intrigued to see where it goes.

437
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,280
Now you want to talk to them because
she's trying to play it right.

438
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,770
So they finally got
the call when they say,

439
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,050
you're going to be home in the next
10 minutes, can I call you back?

440
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,920
I'm busy right now and I know she's
got to be like a stripper or something,

441
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,820
you know?
Because she disappears like God though,

442
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,320
because she'll call me like at eight and
go, are you doing comments? I'm like,

443
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,960
yeah, I'm doing a spot 11
I'm going to come and see it.

444
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,170
And then I'll never see it. And then
she'll call me like a week later and go,

445
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,270
she always disappears if it's after
like 10 so she does something right.

446
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:56,870
You know what I'm saying? So finally she
called me one night and I just, I'm like,

447
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,930
I don't even want to talk to this. I
can't even have fun with it. Right.

448
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,830
Because she's trying to
lie to me. Hey, oh yeah.

449
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,850
At least if she was just telling me
she was a hooker, I would torment.

450
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,020
So finally the clouds parted
and she's like, you know,

451
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:13,730
I really need this thousand dollars I
really need 2,700 but I could take a

452
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,481
thousand to help me.
I said,

453
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:19,481
you need 2,700 but I get to
take a thousand a thousand
but I get take a thousand

454
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:23,990
that helped me out. Like you're
like, well I don't know. She's a Dj.

455
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,260
She's a Dj.
Dj is too.

456
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:31,760
That's why I don't see him late at night
cause Dj, you know. Okay, what do you DJ?

457
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,580
Oh, I just do independent
parties. Really? What do you make?

458
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,730
519 with the fucking thousand for,
well,

459
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,290
you know they want 3000 from my
jeep and shit. So I finally said,

460
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,660
this fucking bitch is crazy.
I'm not going to get any money.

461
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:49,010
Some of the other night I call up at
seven 11 I'm not going to get no fucking

462
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,030
money. Joe, you're cried.

463
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,320
I pull up the seven 11 I see her at the
counter and I'm sitting with Lee and she

464
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,840
comes down and she's like, how come
you were returned my calls no more.

465
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,390
What's wrong with you? I go, listen, I've
just been busy. You know I ain't got,

466
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:03,830
I'm doing comedy over the valley, down
over the hill. You're never around.

467
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,970
I can't help you. She's like, you
really got to help me with that money.

468
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,080
Me and Leah Howard, cause I totally
about a lot. Looking at Howard,

469
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,090
she hasn't seen you in
a week and she's really,

470
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,160
really got to help me look it up and run.
You gotta help me with that paper.

471
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,450
So I said, all right, let me drop leave
home and are caught here. So I called him,

472
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:24,290
I go, listen, how much do you need?
She was 1000 bucks. I go, listen,

473
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,130
I'm not just going to give you 1000 bucks.
She goes, then what do you want to do?

474
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,490
I go, well, if I give you 1000 bucks,
I'm going to put it in every and fencing.

475
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,160
And there was like silence. You know, I'm
not going to fuck this check and I know,

476
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:37,790

479
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:47,850
I don't know what your
talking or your listening,

480
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,640

was thinking of your fucking ass.

481
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:53,910
I mean this ain't here.
And she's like, okay.

482
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:58,560
And finally she broke. Oh,
where are we going to go? Oh,

483
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,130
I'll take it through a whole dow.
Wherever the fuck you know that.

484
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,990
So Larry and I go meet me on

494
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:46,160
You know Joey Diaz has been talking
shit about you. I don't give a fuck.

495
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,090
I ain't got to give it to her. Get a
finer putting. Listen, listen to me.

496
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,420
Black chick for months.

497
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,990
That's a fucking 10 with a blonde wig
that I've seen her walk and that studio,

498
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,751
in fact,

499
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:03,950
she hangs out outside of the Gelson's on
weight too for old Jewish read old man.

500
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,350
Really? I've seen it. I've parked
there. My wife has gone to Gelson's.

501
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,810
I waited outside with the baby
and seen her with a blonde wig.

502
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,780
I had been in that coffee shop when
she walks by and everybody looks at it.

503
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,780
She's young,
she's young.

504
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,710
Cause she came into the coffee shop
once and she started asking us questions

505
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,560
about where this, that like playing,
you know, just in case somebody said,

506
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:27,200
you look good, right? Why? I'm
busy right now. What are you doing?

507
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:31,270
You can tell she's right. They get away
with it. Oh yeah, she's a professional.

508
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,670
The young girl does it right.
She doesn't wear the heels.

509
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,120
She has the backpack, you
know, she's the real deal.

510
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,960
I've seen her up and down that fucking
thing for months. So this girl,

511
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,420
if you do it right, they, you know,

512
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,740
they got away with it with the backpack
and no sexy clothes. Blonde wig,

513
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,960
black and blonde wig,

514
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,520
or it makes me think transseptal ginger
black and blonde black. Well, I ran,

515
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:57,470
went the redheaded wig.
They're good as the Brian tasks.

516
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,980
Her Aaron's Bright Orange Blonde
wig is weird on a black lady.

517
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,090
Oh, okay. It just looks kind of
like it's odd to z. Well it's,

518
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:11,180
you know, you should be able to wear
whatever the fuck you want to wear.

519
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:15,110
But when I see like a Chinese check with
blonde hair and Asian chick with blonde

520
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:18,620
hair or black checkered barn here, I'm
like, you look good with black hair.

521
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:22,440
Like you don't have to do that. Right.
But what difference does it make sure.

522
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,330
Blonde hair. Who's Eve? Eve, the
chicken that TV show the wrapper.

523
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,930
What TV shows up? I Dunno. Eve. Jamie.
You know what it is? What's the,

524
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,250
should shitty from like the nineties
early 2000 halls. She's tall.

525
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:37,370
She's in the barber shop.
She has blonde hair.

526
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,770
You got this fucking guy. Don't looks like
the old manager from the comedy store.

527
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,820
Eva's from fell down right then.
Oh, to go with, she's big Joe Rogan.

528
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,750
That's a big model. That's a pretty
girl. Yeah, she's good looking.

529
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,060
I'm like, I look at it.
Yeah, she's in barber shop,

530
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,090
but I think she was a blonde wig.
That's our hair bleached blonde.

531
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,530
Looks like she's banking
guys and she's tall.

532
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,700
So many black checks where weaves,
you know, which is really strange.

533
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:14,530
Like they were hair, like kind of sewn
into their hair. Have you ever smelled it?

534
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,390
It smells funny.

535
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,860
Fact oils and stuff like
carrot top or funny.

536
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:25,480
Probably fucked up like
gasoline and fucking oldest.

537
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,120
Like she'll fucking exploded.
I would join it next day. Yeah,

538
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,000
I got to think to be some
fermenting on. Right. And it's hard.

539
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,250
It's not like I had never mind.
I can't say that story. Well,

540
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:43,010
you feel that the weed, when you
run your fingers through it, yeah.

541
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,730
You can't really, it feels like plastic.
There's a whole bunch of different kinds.

542
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:49,040
Like Tiffany Haddish had one that was
like plastic where it felt like the pretty

543
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,230
looked like the predators hair.

544
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,320
And have you seen Tiffany
Haddish just hair late late now.

545
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:57,520
She just has this humongous like seventies
fro nine and every time she's in a

546
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:01,570
picture with somebody it looks like
in between two ferns. It's great.

547
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,420
Yeah. We know this documentary.
Jamie shut all the shit off.

548
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,670
So we use is like what
the blonde girl had a yes,

549
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,060
that's a weed. I'm talking about
what black girls have like yeah,

550
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:16,810
that's what we've to, okay, it's a, heroin
was confused. We can't get a weave. Yeah,

551
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,380
guys can get weaves. Yeah. They just,

552
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,390
so your hair on other Nicholas cage and
all his mood, he gets a fucking, we've,

553
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:25,630
whenever we think well they also have
these, these wigs that have with,

554
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,540
it's like a lace front,
so it looks like your skin,

555
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,900
they glue it to your head and it looks
like the Harris coming right out of your

556
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:36,440
skin until you get right up in there
and you're like, Whoa, the fuck's gonna.

557
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,450
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. They don't
have that down right either.

558
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,940
Because there's that show undercover boss,

559
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,300
I don't have you ever see that where they
take like a CEO of like Boston market

560
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:51,301
and then he gets thrown in as a regular
employee at one of their stores and it's

561
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:54,940
cool because he catches all the things
wrong with his store and people don't

562
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:55,270
know,

563
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,080
but they always give them like the
dumbest like fake mustache and it looks so

564
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:01,630
fake and all the employees
have to be like, all right,

565
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:02,830
what is this undercover boss?

566
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,240
Like there's something all lawyers
are probably all in on it. Yeah,

567
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,760
it's probably a horse shit.

568
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,970
Then there's so much of those
shows they're faking like what?

569
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,680
I'm in trouble what like so many of them
are set up in advance and especially

570
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:17,890
ones that make people look bad because
you got to think like w how much they're

571
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,840
going to pay these PR,
this purse to ruin their life.

572
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,490
What are they going to
give you 1500 bucks?

573
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,270
Like what scale on one of those shows I
got to ruin your life and you agree to

574
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:27,790
this. They can't just film
you and put you on television.

575
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,370
Like you have to sign a
waiver. Yeah. What they say,

576
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:33,250
how they do that is they say stay.
It's a different reality show.

577
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,230
It's like this is a reality
show about a guy that's,

578
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,010
he's a waiter at this table and we're
giving him the opportunity to own his own

579
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,130
restaurant.
So it's like,

580
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,590
it's like another game should,
that's not undercover boss.

581
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:46,250
That's how they signed the
papers and they, it's also,
it's deception. Deception.

582
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:48,740
That seems like they could get sued.
Well,

583
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:52,700
it's deception by its own company that
they work for. So I think it's kind of,

584
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,040
there's like that loophole. What a
fun show them. They don't go back.

585
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,210
This book gives me 10 bucks an hour.
You give him a check for 600 a day.

586
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,520
Once you cast it, they'll go and
back Jack. You know? That's, that's,

587
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,430
there's a lot of those shows now too.

588
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,530
It's amazing how easy it is
to make one of those shows.

589
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,700
There's still hidden camera show.
Did you know that? My friends still,

590
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,430
I executive produced hidden cameras. Well,
how are we meant? Dell has that show,

591
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,210
right?

592
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,540
He has a show where he does hidden camera
things where we can make with money.

593
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,220
The more you get people to do,

594
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:29,120
like you gotta tell your wife you're
leaving her for a man and you know, like,

595
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:32,300
and you get like 500 bucks for that and
you get more for more things you do.

596
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,560
It's like,
I did that show for CBS years ago,

597
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,260
like six years ago and it was
called game show in my head.

598
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,160
And I would put like this little earpiece
in these people and then they would go

599
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,350
out and we would make
them do shit on camera.

600
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Like we had this guy put him in the middle
of a Hollywood and told him they gave

601
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,570
him a suit and put some,
a news cameras like,

602
00:33:56,571 --> 00:34:00,020
like you'll like it was a news camera
show and had these people come over and

603
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,150
you had to uh,

604
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,460
tell people that you were there to talk
to someone who was a witness for a Ufo

605
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,410
and uh, they took off and you've
got to ask these other people,

606
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:16,460
would you pretend it was you? Would you
pretend that you saw this UFO and a,

607
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:20,960
you got to get them to admit that they
were taken aboard the aircraft and that

608
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:24,920
they were probed that like did some
medical examinations on them and they got

609
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:27,580
people to do it. Yeah. That's
how I knew that all that,

610
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,670
that was like a huge eyeopener for me
about how full of shit people are when it

611
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:34,100
comes to you. LFOS where
everybody's talking about it. Yeah.

612
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:36,620
It came down the field
and it wasn't from Earth.

613
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,060
I've seen a lot of airplanes on TV,

614
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,200
didn't look nothing like that and it was
spinning around or circle and there was

615
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:46,400
no doors. And I saw these little,
those people are full of shit.

616
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,920
There's a giant percentage
of those people.

617
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,400
You put a camera in front of their face
and they just start talking and that we

618
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,210
didn't have no problem. We got like
seven people to just right away.

619
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,610
They just start making shit up
right off the top of their head.

620
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,990
All of them did it. No one said
no. It was ridiculous and we all,

621
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,780
everyone that did that show with me,
we all left there and we were like,

622
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:08,960
what the fuck man?
Like everybody just lied.

623
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,540
Like at least I expected
a few people to be like,

624
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,920
what do you want me to make up a story
about being taken the board of Ufo,

625
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,390
the Fuck Outta here. I mean
that's the reality show. Yeah.

626
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Just to play marshes and got my car and
just go to places like a one of the boys

627
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,060
lake land and way of bitches.
All these mother fuckers that wallet,

628
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,810
the Martians, all these fuckers run down
that street like it's King fucking Kong.

629
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,250
They would start shooting.
Yeah. Today's world,

630
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,730
too many people have guns in
today's world. People. She was fine.

631
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,680
How about in the fucking nineties
they would've shot p Ufos.

632
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,510
They would shoot you if I was any point
in time. Someone's had a gun there.

633
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,020
They're willing to shoot like a Ufo
fit lands like the odds of if you get a

634
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,390
thousand people with guns and
a Ufo lands in front of them,

635
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,740
500 people are pulling that
fucking trigger and let me
and Telligen guy and when

636
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,640
you have a Ufo landing and you
have 10 people that concur,

637
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:06,660
they show the same thing or they
saw something, what is that? Well,

638
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:09,840
I go from door to fucking door
and pay people and what the fuck?

639
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,490
It could be a bunch of things. The thing
is, it could be from another planet.

640
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,390
It could be, look, if it's possible
for us to put a rover on Mars,

641
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,230
it's possible for them to send a
ship from another galaxy. Of course,

642
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,890
it's possible. Not only that,
we assume that these aliens,

643
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:28,440
that everybody keeps seeing these
gray aliens and the big black eyes,

644
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,300
we assume that they're living beings.

645
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,450
They could easily be robots if we're this
close to crossing that uncanny valley

646
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:39,840
and making some sort of an artificial,
a computer generated image. How,

647
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,630
I mean if the technology continues to
accelerate to the point where you can

648
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:45,750
actually get a ship to go through
a fucking warm hall, the Real,

649
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,640
the real like impeding factor I
would think would be biological life.

650
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,900
Like why send something living when
you can make something artificial is so

651
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:58,110
close to being able to make artificial
life. And when I say so close,

652
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,410
within a hundred years, I mean I
think I only anybody disputes that.

653
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,320
They'll have some form of artificial
life than a hundred years robot,

654
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,500
white skin that looks like gun
now go in the future. Let's,

655
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,920
the earth is for something
billion years old.

656
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,060
But we're not the oldest planet.
We're not in the oldest galaxy,

657
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,160
like not even close like the, the universe
is 14 billion years old supposedly.

658
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,460
So that means an extra 10 billion years
for things to form and possibly grow

659
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,260
even out 1 billion years.
Even a million years.

660
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,270
Who the fuck knows we can
do in a million years?

661
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,630
So if these UFO shell up and these
little aliens are inside of it,

662
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,280
they're probably robots.
I would assume that they have,

663
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,320
unless they figured out some incredible
way to bypass space and time and to fold

664
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,650
space and create a
wormhole and punch through.

665
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:45,810
Like they did an event horizon
and all these, you know,

666
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:49,350
physics documentaries and they talk
about the possibility of using worm holes

667
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,870
and it's all like crazy theoretical shit.

668
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,470
But until they figured out how to do
that and send like monkeys back and forth

669
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:57,420
for a few years, they're not, I mean,

670
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,890
why wouldn't they just send robots just
like we're sending a robot to Mars and

671
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,780
it looks like a toaster and it's
got wheels and it's rolling around,

672
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,614
but it's a robot.

673
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,250
If we send a robot that it looked like
Traci lords and it was walking around on

674
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,740
Mars, I mean that wouldn't be
what it looked like. You know,

675
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:14,910
it just so happens that we set one that
looks like a toaster, but it doesn't,

676
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,580
in a thousand years from now,
we could send wherever the fuck we want.

677
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,150
We can send Bob Costas to the
moon. You know, Bob Costas, robot,

678
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:24,030
Bob Costas were be reporting from
the surface and the fucking moon.

679
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,100
And I've never been a big marsh and guy

680
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,810
and I always thought that fucking,
you know,

681
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:35,740
you always think that the high population
of areas area 51 and maybe the south,

682
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,810
right? You know, you just write it off,

683
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:42,640
but it isn't the high populations of
Washington sightings and a Ufo says why

684
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,020
we're up in northern New Jersey. I
fucking couldn't believe it. Well,

685
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:49,600
you know why there's this is the cube,
the conspiracy theories,

686
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,240
you know the conspiracy theory y
that's where bell laboratories,

687
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:57,070
are they the jersey? Yes.
The bill. The big conspiracy.
This is the big conspiracy.

688
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,450
This goes way back,
way back,

689
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:01,780
there was a company on the Internet and
if you remember it called the American

690
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:05,590
computer company and they had
this website, they made computers.

691
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:09,580
There was back in the day where you call
up or you would fill out like specs,

692
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,030
like you know, hey, I want a 300
celeron processor and this and that.

693
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:14,290
And they would put together
a computer for you.

694
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,560
But they also had this website page that
was dedicated to conspiracies about the

695
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:23,590
creation of the the,

696
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,950
was it the transistor Dario laboratories?
Yeah.

697
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,240
Yeah, there was, there
was certain aspects of,

698
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:37,330
of sound and electronics that were
invented in bell laboratories and this

699
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:42,490
website supposedly polls.
There's the big conspiracy polls,

700
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,350
the cover over the creation of
these things and says this all shit,

701
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,060
all this shit came out of area 51 from
some shit that crashed in Roswell,

702
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:56,410
New Mexico in 1947 it was all
about the Rosalind Mexico crash.

703
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,700
They took all those,

704
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,650
whatever those parts of those Ufos were
and back engineered them and that's how

705
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,860
they created all this stuff. And this,
this website was totally dedicated to it.

706
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,160
It was talking about how there's a
military base that's outside of bell labs

707
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:12,040
like that they said was to protect
New York City. They're like,

708
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,890
why would you protect New York City from
way the fuck out there? You wouldn't,

709
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:17,650
it would take way too long for
everything to coordinate that.

710
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:21,970
But it's right next to bell labs and
you know, during the military days of,

711
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:22,600
you know,

712
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,890
I guess this is like bell
labs was probably created
post World War II I think.

713
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,510
So you've got to think,
you know,

714
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,330
there's the Cold War days and the
Russians and there's all this,

715
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,630
there's the technological racist to try
to get to the moon and all that other

716
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:38,140
shit. I mean we were, we were racing
with the Russians virtually everything.

717
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,220
Nuclear power, nuclear
weapons, space travel.

718
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:47,350
And so this, this bell labs apparently
played a very vital role in, you know,

719
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:51,850
United States strategic technology
advancement, like for whatever it was.

720
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,050
But there's American computer company was
convinced that all this shit came from

721
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:01,030
Ufos from the, the crash saucer in
Roswell and they back engineered it.

722
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,320
There's a lot of people that believe
that northern New Jersey is like the cap.

723
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,990
If you look at Martin, I'm fucking
signings. It's not rational and all that.

724
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,010
The Jersey that's fucking cost that
all the way the fuck you'd like Bergen

725
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:14,921
County.
Well,

726
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:19,570
it could also be the air quality in New
Jersey is so fucking bad that people

727
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:22,660
would just delirious all the time.
But they live in those swamp towns.

728
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,710
But there's one story that came and look,
Bergen,

729
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,460
and this is the part of town
where it's fucking uppity.

730
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,460
They interviewed all these people and I,

731
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:34,060
I stayed up with that and look to have it.
This

732
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,190
is a tape on Youtube.
Well, Youtube, they have,

733
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,370
they show where the thing landed on
the baseball diamond and all this shit.

734
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,870
But then they went to all those business
owners and whenever you see a last

735
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,700
night, I was watching something
and they showed a view of New York.

736
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:50,210
It's a circular building that's the
building that complained the most.

737
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:54,650
If they saw the lights, people landing,
taking samples at dirt out. I mean it was,

738
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,270
it could have been anybody.
Be fucking with them,

739
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,710
but not all these people in conjunction
now. All right. The liquor store,

740
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,480
all that'd be had a couple cocktails,

741
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,440
but all these people in the building
saw the lights, the flashing,

742
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,450
they heard the landing there, heard
the booms, maybe all those broads.

743
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,720
We're just seeing stars

744
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,100
moccasins on line.

745
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,660
Meanwhile you've thought about that
before you said that you're like,

746
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:24,070
this is the shit saying that they saw
lights and there you're talking about

747
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:28,330
jerseys, so whatever. You know
what, I don't even explain it.

748
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,560
I know it doesn't work. Um, you know,

749
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,580
I think to the CIA came out with this
report recently about how many of the Ufo

750
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:40,420
sightings that people saw was actually
experimental aircraft that they're

751
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,380
working on and um, that was
uh, that was real recent.

752
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,670
Like they admitted this kind of stuff.

753
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,330
But then you also have like remote
control drones that they've,

754
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,800
they've had that kind of technology
like radio control technology.

755
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:57,820
They've had that for a long time and
they've been able to do things not like

756
00:42:57,821 --> 00:42:59,920
quite to the level that
they can do them now,

757
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,610
but they've been able to
do things like they could,

758
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,040
they used to have drone airliners.

759
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,010
They could send an airliner
with no people on it. Just a,

760
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,800
they were going to use that.
That was part of operation Northwoods.

761
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,110
They were going to blow it up.
They can't land them.

762
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,140
They couldn't land them in like
1962 but they could launch them. So,

763
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:18,600
but then we're going to do is they were
going to have this plane take off and

764
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:20,770
we're going to say all these people were
in and they were going to blow it up in

765
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:22,990
the sky and they were
going to blame it on Cuba.

766
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,100
And that was going to be what led us
to go to war with Cuba because that was

767
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:30,460
when like the Russians were trying to
put military bases there and they were

768
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:33,520
going to have missiles pointed
at the u s from right over there.

769
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:37,240
That was the bay of Pigs and all that
shit like that. It got real hot and heavy.

770
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,253
There was this like,

771
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,730
like real showdown between the United
States and Russia over Cuba and over them

772
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:46,360
having missiles in Cuba. And one of
the things that we're gonna do it,

773
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:47,830
they're going to arm Cuban friendlies.

774
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:49,480
They're going to give like
people that they were,

775
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,130
they had good relationships with.

776
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,220
We're going to give them arms and have
them attack Guantanamo Bay cause we have

777
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:57,040
a military base in Cuba.
And this blowing up,

778
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,960
this airliner was a big
part of their thing.

779
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:01,450
Like everyone's hair make
up a bunch of fake people.

780
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,900
They're all missing and have actors
play their parents crying on TV,

781
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,820
all that kind of shit.
But they,

782
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,140
they didn't have the capability
in 1962 to shoot a plane up.

783
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,150
They couldn't land it,
like I said,

784
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,180
but they could definitely fly that
fucking thing. It's pretty crazy.

785
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,340
So you gotta think how many like remote
controlled like saucers did they have?

786
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:24,610
How many remote controlled, I mean the,
some of the drones that they have now,

787
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,230
they look completely alien.
Early seventies

788
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,160
the Martians landed him not taking
county park or mid seventies

789
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,160
when they landed. So, but
since then it's, it's,

790
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,170
there's a ton of fucking spots and
people spot those things of northern New

791
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,910
Jersey CIA admits.
Most of you have seen most of UFC UFC,

792
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,810
most of UFO sightings in the 1950s
and the 60s where our planes,

793
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,780
yeah, they have all these crazy
jets. Apparently they're working on,

794
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,930
it was confirming in a report that the
u two spy planes and a test flights over

795
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:02,100
the u s coincided with a lot
of, uh, the UFO sightings.

796
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,130
Yeah. I mean, they think
about that fucking,

797
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:08,910
if you ever seen one of those stealth
bombers and real life ever seen one flying

798
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:12,870
overhead. No, dude, it looks like
you're in a science fiction movie.

799
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:15,870
It's like some war of the
worlds star trek type shit.

800
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:21,000
We were in Palmdale and we were doing
fear factor and we saw several of them

801
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:25,650
because fear factor started post nine 11.
So it was like right after nine 11.

802
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,510
It was actually one of the
things that people are saying.

803
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,720
One of the dumb ass fucking report or
questions that I got when I was, uh,

804
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,960
doing press for fear factor.
This lady goes,

805
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:39,000
don't you think that it's in poor taste
to have a show that concentrates on fear

806
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,600
right after nine 11. Wow.
Like you fucking idiot.

807
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,160
They're going to jump off a bridge with
a bungee cord and Eda eyeball like, yeah,

808
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:52,650
it's like the terrorist one. You're
right. The terrorist one. But, um,

809
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,510
um, my point being that like
we, when those things flew by,

810
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,790
we were out there in Palm Dale and those
things flew by because it was like a

811
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,850
lot of military activity. Like it was
right when the war was about to start.

812
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,570
They looked like they were from another
planet. Man. I know they weren't.

813
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,590
I know there were,
they were going,

814
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:09,960
they were going to Ed for Edwards
Air Force Base is right out there.

815
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,410
Didn't matter. When you see him you're
like, oh my God, there's are aliens.

816
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,000
Like it feels like they're alien.

817
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:19,170
Like you see that black
fucking thing shoot sound.

818
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:22,080
I bet dude,
they're fast as shit and they look,

819
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,360
they don't look like any
plane you've ever seen before.

820
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,800
They look like space ships.

821
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,790
It looks like a scene in star wars where
you have some sort of a star port and

822
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:30,181
then you know,

823
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:33,450
in the background all these planes
are landing and taking off into space.

824
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,950
That's what we all thought we would be
seeing by now anyway. Right. We would all,

825
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,140
when you, if you are a
kid and he said, hey Joey,

826
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:42,630
what do you think it's going to
be like in 2015 you'd be like, oh,

827
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,820
fucking space travel for sure.
Right?

828
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,010
Everybody thought we'd have
bases on the moon by now.

829
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,890
Everybody thought we'd
be flying around in jets.

830
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,250
Everybody would it be going all over
the place and hybrid cars back to the

831
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:56,280
future. This was the year that
2015 was back to the future too.

832
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:59,640
When he comes in and ours, all the cards
flying around, we had hung out words,

833
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,350
no flying cars, flying cars they
do have will fucking kill you.

834
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,010
I actually you this one that's
supposed to be pretty good.

835
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,260
There's a couple of different
guys who've made flying cars,

836
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,950
but one of them has like these folding
wings and you drive around like this and

837
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:16,380
then when you take off
the thing goes Jan clink,

838
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:18,370
clink and [inaudible] the [inaudible],

839
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,890
the wings come down and you fly like so
you're driving around with the wings up

840
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:25,020
and you could drive
around town like a normal,

841
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,920
you know as good as like a Prius or
something. And then when you want to,

842
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,040
you lower the wings down

843
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,280
moral drive that traffic.
But this motherfucker up right here,

844
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,850
I would need a large parachute
on that fucking thing. Fuck that.

845
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,840
There's gonna be drunk drivers in the sky
now. That's our all everyone's houses.

846
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:42,850
We'll have like a car in it at one point.

847
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,490
I think once they figured
out like Google drive,

848
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,360
like Google driving cars and they figured
out how to keep cars in their lanes

849
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:53,740
and have them avoid each other, like
no matter what, they can't collide.

850
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,630
Once that technology becomes like
standard, then I think you could,

851
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:02,200
might be able to have some sort of
a flying vehicle. But until they do,

852
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,170
you're going to have people like you
ever watch people and like little private

853
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:08,950
planes just fly around.
They fall into this fucking fly around.

854
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,930
I went with Phil Hartman. He took me up
to, to look at real estate and we uh,

855
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,580
gotten one of us,

856
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,980
he had a little single engine plane and
we took this plane up into the sky and

857
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:21,520
we just flew. He went wherever he wanted
to. Like, I'll show you where Malibu.

858
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:26,410
Ah. He doesn't have to call somebody and
say, Hey, I'm going to fly over by Malibu.

859
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:29,170
Is that cool? No, he
just does it like they,

860
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:32,290
and they hit each other sometimes all the
time. Wasn't just crashed on Van Nuys.

861
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible]

862
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,120
the only reason why more
don't it's because they're
not more people flying. Yeah.

863
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,710
You know? Did you watch people fucking
spin out like retards in this rain?

864
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,280
Oh yeah. So many people. Yeah.

865
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:50,350
I saw so many people crash in the rain.

866
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:53,860
They just forgot how to drive in the rain.
I got some good videos.

867
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,120
I have that dashboard camera now,

868
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:59,700
so everywhere I go it records HD video
and every night during the rain storms

869
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:01,180
just pull out,
save it to computer.

870
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:04,150
There's just tons of clips that people
like running red lights and almost

871
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:07,840
hitting other cars. They don't know
how to stop. They don't slow down.

872
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,060
It's amazing,
California.

873
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,750
We get rain maybe 10 times
a year and a crazy year.

874
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:17,080
People don't believe that, but
that is real. Right? I mean,

875
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:19,390
the last year did we get
rained three times last year.

876
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,820
It wasn't even three times.
It probably wasn't right.

877
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:27,210
They say we need 11 trillion gallons of
water to to even out what we've lost in

878
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:30,020
this three year drought. We're still
in a bad drought. Right? Like that.

879
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:33,530
That rain did anything right.
It's better than no rain,

880
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,910
but we need 11 trillion gallons of north.

881
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,230
That taking the water out of the ground.
Recycling,

882
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,470
usually you're like, I don't know
the vegetation that's up north,

883
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:45,730
you know Baker's field,

884
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:51,330
all those little towns live Wolf Cherries
and whatever the fuck they live on.

885
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:55,790
Strawberries and shit. Yeah, like minutes.

886
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,270
A couple of weeks ago. It was a
new company. They're busy too.

887
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:03,010
Fucking 2020 are they making wells?
Is that what they're doing?

888
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,480
They come up and pull the fucking water
from who'll the deepest parts of the

889
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,860
earth. They recycle it and use
it again. It's not a, well,

890
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,900
don't go deep. Look it up. It was just
on 60 minutes maybe three weeks ago.

891
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,540
Really interesting shit.
I,

892
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,480
I'm amazed that no one's figured out a
way to take salt out of water. I mean,

893
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,860
they do. Right, but it's
not commercially effective.

894
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,070
It's really cool water.

895
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:32,000
They have the Lua with sewer water and
they had the people drinking it right

896
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,880
from the fucking sewer
and people drinking water.

897
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:39,220
It looked like this dog right from
the sewer already was shit. Yeah.

898
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,390
Bill Gates said wrenches spills,

899
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,690
fucking old sneakers and get their drink
and I'm like a fucking mole. Itoh Hey,

900
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,740
you pay for it and you pay for it,
but it's a new machine and tremendous.

901
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,780
Do you think in the future where we're
going to have our own water? It's,

902
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,560
the water is going to be so
bad that we have in our own,

903
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:05,150
like I don't 20 gallons a supply
of water that we can use to cook,

904
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,920
Wash Herself, then we pee it out, clean
it. But it's our personal water. Like we,

905
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:12,680
you have to like keep your own water.
That's totally possible.

906
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,230
And actually might not be the worst idea.

907
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:17,810
I would be happier tricking my piss water.
Right.

908
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,250
Cause then he's someone else's piss water.
He can hack it. Yeah. And would you,

909
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,230
would you use your girlfriend's water?
Like you,

910
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,080
you and your loved one would switch
waters cause it's a little bit,

911
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,290
well here's the deal. All of your
water came out of someone's Dick.

912
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,270
How about that dinosaur fellas?
You think about it.

913
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:36,800
Some animal most likely pissed away,
some water and it evaporated.

914
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:40,670
Came down as rain and you know who
I mean? Cal Water. Yeah. Water that.

915
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,620
I think the amount of water we have is
finite. Like, and even though we're like,

916
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:49,340
oh, we're running out of water, I
think the water's going somewhere.

917
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,400
I mean it's still an earth. It's like
you might not be able to get to it.

918
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,930
It might be pouring in Seattle or I
might be, but it's all just water.

919
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:01,490
Like somehow or another it gets reused,
it evaporates, it comes down again.

920
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,600
It's all kind of contained in this crazy
ball and they say that a lot of the

921
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:06,980
water that we drink,

922
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,660
you know it's very likely some of it
pass through an animal's body and was

923
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,860
pissed out and filter down through the,
the like a stream.

924
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:20,300
Like if you ever like seen a a creek
where you have like crystal clear spring

925
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:24,500
water that's coming down from a glacier,
like that is a woolly mammoth, mammoth.

926
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:29,300
Dick pissed out some of this water and
that water like seeped into the earth or

927
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:30,680
gets sucked up in moisture.

928
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:34,490
It's very possible that a lot of this
stuff actually came from animals. Dicks.

929
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,740
So if we get to a point where we're so
good at recycling water that you know

930
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:40,521
when you're getting water,

931
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:42,890
even though it was poopy water
or piss water or whatever,

932
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,340
there's nothing in there but water,
it's absolutely clear.

933
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:49,970
Pure water and it's baked and spirits,
spirits,

934
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,920
the spirits and the past that can't get
the spirits like imagine if they drained

935
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:59,590
the Hudson river and use that
one. How many bodies? Oh my God.

936
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,230
I went over the bridge and threw
a bag of blow over. Oh yeah,

937
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,710
hook whose finger condoms in that river.

938
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,690
They're not a fucking,

939
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,120
eventually you're going to clean
them out with that machine.

940
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,120
They got a bunch of those machines,
the whole thing.

941
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,580
Don't they already do
that with a lot of water?

942
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,660
They'd take sewage treatment and they
treat the water and then they put it right

943
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:23,070
back into the supply. What they
do right now that's, you know,

944
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,370
our waters are that drainage,
the La River

945
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,910
or whatever. That all gets cleaned
and put back into this. The faucets.

946
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,030
Do you guys even drink
faucet water anymore though?

947
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:35,180
I was thinking about to see how they,
I won't touch my wife.

948
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,990
Don't you cook with it? That's an
issue. Like we all cook with water.

949
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,040
Yeah, I guess, but I don't, I don't use
my kitchen and I just eat out. Right.

950
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,980
But yeah, I guess I do cook with it. What
if you like make tea or coffee? No, I,

951
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,520
I uh, I have uh, arrowheads.

952
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,180
People like to be Bohemia
and use that city water.

953
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,910
I was watching some new show the
other day, I forget what town I'm in,

954
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,310
but it was showing,
I think it was San Francisco.

955
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,490
They were showing all these different
blocks where you couldn't drink the water

956
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:03,324
right now.

957
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,450
Like there was this whole
area where they're saying
don't drink the water if you

958
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,940
live on these treats. Like
what? What are you saying?

959
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,330
Like I have to just be on Twitter or I
have to be paying attention to the news

960
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:13,164
to know this.

961
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,340
What if I'm a guy that likes to read
newspapers and sit at home for a few days

962
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,700
and I'm drinking the water?
You knocking on my door or he,

963
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,960
he telling people you
assuming they have Facebook,

964
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,620
how you're just going to make them
drink this fucking shit water.

965
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,840
They should of storm troopers.
Knock on everybody's door.

966
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:32,040
Don't drank the water but they don't,
I have hard water. What's that?

967
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,720
Cause I like if I washed my car with my,

968
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,500
my car will be white when it dries
minerals. Yes. Is that really bad for you?

969
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:39,030
Are really good.
It seems like it'd be good for you too.

970
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,400
I think some trace
minerals are good for you,

971
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:44,850
but I don't know if like that
quantity of minerals as good for you.

972
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,870
I like hard water.

973
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,020
It's really hard what they say that
that's one of the things that it's bad for

974
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:52,230
people when you have distilled
water as you drink distilled water,

975
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:53,520
it doesn't have any minerals in it.

976
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:56,970
Like you can actually kind of fuck your
body up if you only drink distilled

977
00:54:56,971 --> 00:54:58,820
water,
like distilled water.

978
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,530
Something that wrestlers take
a lot of times before they, uh,

979
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,400
cut weight because when you drink it,
it flushes all your system out of flushes,

980
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:07,200
all the minerals and your butt.
But a lot of people are saying like,

981
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,240
I don't think dolce fucks with that stuff.

982
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,700
I think a lot of guys are saying
like that, that's not good for you.

983
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:15,630
Like you need those like that,
those elements of the water with minerals.

984
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:19,530
It might make it easier to dehydrate
yourself that way because your foot,

985
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:20,520
but it's not good.

986
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:25,550
Like I think all that shit in water is
actually probably good for you blessing

987
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,900
because my old code p Lisa
drink distilled water,

988
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,080
really probably guy was as all fuck up
potential health impacts of hard water.

989
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,960
Here it goes.
This is a a a pub med study.

990
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,480
So it says in the past five decades or so,

991
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:42,450
evidence has been accumulating about an
environmental factor which appears to be

992
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:46,830
influencing mortality in particular
cardiovascular mortality.

993
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:50,670
And this is the hardness of the
drinking water. Oh Shit. In addition,

994
00:55:50,671 --> 00:55:55,671
several epidemic epidemiological
investigations have
demonstrated the relation

995
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,990
between risk for cardiovascular disease,
growth retardation,

996
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,990
reproductive failure,
and other health problems,

997
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,010
and the hardest of drinking water,
or it's content of magnesium and calcium,

998
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,240
which is weird because magnesium and
calcium are things that people take as

999
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:16,950
supplements, right? There's such a fucking
balance to being a person. You know,

1000
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:19,530
like if you have, if you drink
a pound of salt, you're dead,

1001
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:23,290
you know that's fucked.
In addition,

1002
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:27,640
the acidity of the water influences the
reabsorption of calcium and magnesium in

1003
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:31,150
the renal tube tubule. I don't know
what that is, but it's not good.

1004
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,940
Not only calcium and magnesium,

1005
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:38,050
but other constituents also affect
different health aspects. Thus,

1006
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:42,020
the present review attempts to explore
the health effects of hard water and

1007
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,350
constituents. Wow, that's crazy, man.

1008
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,640
Alzheimer's disease is linked
to Alzheimer's disease,
cardiovascular disease,

1009
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:51,580
diabetes, and cancer. Jeez,

1010
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,760
it's all terrible.
Hard water is fucking terrible for you.

1011
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,850
It's weird, man. Well,

1012
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,000
the only thing I use it for is
really just taking a shower,

1013
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,310
so hopefully that doesn't.
But is that bad for you?

1014
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:10,300
Because I know that like you
absorb magnesium through your skin.

1015
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:15,100
That's one of the benefits actually
of a like flotation tanks that absorb

1016
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:19,630
magnesium through your skin.
Yeah,

1017
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,680
but maybe they need to do studies on
that and maybe it's not good absorbed.

1018
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:25,480
Absorb too much magnesium through
your skin. Man, I don't even fucking,

1019
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:28,990
I know you're taking magnesium
though is like, especially for men,

1020
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,370
it's a very beneficial,

1021
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,440
there's correlations between
magnesium and testosterone and zinc.

1022
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,040
Zinc and testosterone as
well. This is weird. Oh,

1023
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:43,360
so it's a ratio of magnesium and
calcium in the water is a crucial factor

1024
00:57:43,361 --> 00:57:47,800
indicating the harness. So I guess it's
just like when shit gets really wacky,

1025
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:51,700
there's concentrations of dissolved
calcium and magnesium and soft and hard

1026
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:55,840
water. Are you dealing with like
hard numbers? I guess? Hard. Yeah.

1027
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,370
It's weird because like minerals are
really good for you. It's important.

1028
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:03,600
Like if you don't have minerals, that's
where osteoporosis comes from. You know,

1029
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,730
lack of calcium. Your body starts
drawn calcium out of your bones.

1030
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,830
Like one of the best ways to prevent it.
You take calcium,

1031
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,620
but they also say that a lot of gold,

1032
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:15,120
a lot of our farm lands like the
vegetables that we're getting and the,

1033
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,470
the plants that we eat,

1034
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,110
a lot of them are nutrient
deficient because a lot of
the farm lands, like they,

1035
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,580
there've been like, they've been
grown shit on them for so long.

1036
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:27,120
They kind of like sucked all the good
stuff out of the ground. You're dead.

1037
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:30,070
It's dead girl. Gaza in Cuba.
They said they're not that good.

1038
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:34,570
No one railing to it. Some of the old
time Cubans said the fucking ground,

1039
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:37,690
but it's been, you know, I believe fucking
leaf, it's kind of, you get out of this,

1040
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:42,670
it's like two fucking fully
good job of protecting the dirt.

1041
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,230
You got to use um, uh, mulch. You
know, you've got to use compost.

1042
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,110
You gotta like your word replenish manure.
Yeah.

1043
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:53,770
And also compost is big to
replenishing the nutrients.

1044
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,970
Like that's the thing about dirt
is it's like you look at soil,

1045
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:00,780
you think of it as dirt, but
it's like liquid. It's alive.

1046
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,730
There's all sorts of shit in there.
There's not just like minerals.

1047
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:07,060
There's organisms.
And worms and but like you need worms,

1048
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,550
like worms are great people add
worms to the garden. You're like,

1049
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,000
want them all living in there.
You know you want all that salt,

1050
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:13,930
you want warm shit,
you want worms to shit.

1051
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,630
You want them to eat the dirt
and Shit and makes it all nice,

1052
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:22,280
easy to grow in those mushrooms.
I in Vegas guys, those fucking

1053
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,360
things with good Jack.

1054
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,780
Joey was up till five o'clock
in the morning and never
seen Joey. I didn't sleep.

1055
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,300
He didn't sleep.
I went right to the airport.

1056
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:32,150
He got the fuck out and seven or
something. Didn't sleep till late to that.

1057
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,070
The visuals, those days are over,
but you got to go deep, deep,

1058
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,050
deep to see visual tracking

1059
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,310
music. I just giggled. I just giggled
my answer off. It was tremendous.

1060
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,300
What is Vegas like on my shirt?

1061
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,360
It's like what is the experience
of the craziness event really?

1062
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,920
We went and did the show, right walk
off stage and I had a fucking handful,

1063
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:58,000
eight up and that was my Vegas. But
then we went out and we had some dinner,

1064
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:02,840
but we didn't really walk and talk
to fucking crazy people. You know,

1065
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:07,220
Duncan had that fucking meth guy after
the show that was telling them about,

1066
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:09,620
you know,
fucking Satan and all that stuff.

1067
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,960
I beside it was giving him
his email address. Yes,

1068
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,760
that's the, you know, the mushrooms. When
you go out in public, any of those drugs,

1069
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,120
it becomes something else. It
really enhances, you know, there's,

1070
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,460
there's a couple of different mushrooms
you could take. I mean, trips, you know,

1071
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:31,970
you could take the mushroom
and home and become very, uh,

1072
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,130
whatever that word is
and t itself and writing.

1073
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,240
Or you can take mushrooms and leave
and go for a fucking complete different

1074
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:39,074
odyssey.

1075
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:43,460
That's an odyssey when you out with like
four friends and you reach fucked up

1076
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:46,940
and you have to be tight with those four
friends. So I don't have to look at you.

1077
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,230
We don't have to communicate.

1078
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:51,590
A lamp to do was look at you and I
can send you the fucking mushroom

1079
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:52,520
telepathically.

1080
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:57,530
We know we'll lose each other in a bar
and every couple of hours we'll just look

1081
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:00,760
at each other. That's
the real dog. You dealt.

1082
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:05,060
What's going on by that look like at
your old body of tell you like you'll be

1083
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,320
drinking,
giggling my son,

1084
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,950
something wears with Joe and you'll
look at that same time and we'll look at

1085
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:13,190
each other and go, you go
back. That's the fun of it.

1086
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,240
It's that certain connection that you're
friends with me. I didn't grow up on, uh,

1087
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,770
on mushrooms. I was more of a
microdot acid guy growing up.

1088
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:25,580
All those type of loosen the [inaudible],
which are basically fucking poison.

1089
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,900
But I had the same experiences with
my friends. We'd go into large venues,

1090
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,700
concerts. We all sit together,
but we'd always find each other.

1091
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:39,240
Duncan told me he took that, um, kind
of acid that has formaldehyde in it.

1092
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:41,690
The pay blotter acid on
paper, you know, he said he,

1093
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:46,280
he had been taking pure stuff for awhile.
They took this stuff and he was like,

1094
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:49,430
it's so disgusting. He was
like, it hurt my bones.

1095
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:53,270
Strychnine strychnine yeah,
that's been around, you know,

1096
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,960
why does it have strychnine when I
taught part of the process like when you

1097
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:01,590
smoke crack this fucking the Turpentine
and that you know acid as opposed to

1098
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,070
[inaudible] supposedly what we were told
it was to stick it to the payment page.

1099
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,930
It really is tricky line.
Is that a Snopes thing?

1100
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,470
It might or it might've been a
snips thing. I do know that when he,

1101
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,730
when I used to have it in my vials and
like sell it and I've just like you got

1102
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:19,230
to sugar cube and I just drop a little
drop on the sugar cube that never had the

1103
01:02:19,231 --> 01:02:19,980
back or

1104
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,000
the bone problems,

1105
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:24,930
you know with the liquid acid and the
microdots didn't either because those were

1106
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:27,830
like those little black ones that
pretty much just had a bubble of acid

1107
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,540
bubble of so liquid

1108
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:34,590
to me, the liquid and the sugar cube
or in the eye right in the eye ball.

1109
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,780
I never did the,
I never thought would fuck me up.

1110
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,540
I was very fortunate I got those. I got
to beat these guys when I was growing up.

1111
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,330
There were a hallucinogenic expert,
you know, that's what they did.

1112
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:49,970
They made that shit on the weekends
all week long and they pumped it out to

1113
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,520
college kids, but they pumped
out, you know, groceries.

1114
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:58,440
They would sell you 144 heads,
you know, and that's all they did.

1115
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:02,250
And they made 10,000 fucking
hits everything a week
and every time you went up

1116
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:03,840
there on Saturday they
had something different.

1117
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:05,811
Yeah,
that's okay.

1118
01:03:05,811 --> 01:03:09,770
Anti-Drug educators frequently tell their
students at some variant of the theme

1119
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,760
of the inevitable strychnine poisoning
through LSD use. For example,

1120
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:17,420
the strict nine is commonly sold as a
cheaper substitute for Lsd by unscrupulous

1121
01:03:17,421 --> 01:03:18,051
drug dealers.

1122
01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:22,730
That strict nine is a byproduct of
LSD synthesis that the body produces

1123
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,380
strychnine as a result of LSD metabolism
or that strict nine is used as a

1124
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:31,490
preservative to prevent the otherwise
natural rapid decomposition of the LSD

1125
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:36,410
allowing it to be stored or that strict
nine is somehow necessary to bond LSD to

1126
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:39,230
blotter paper. None of this is true. Yeah.

1127
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,030
These claims have even been believed to
be propagated by drug users themselves.

1128
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,691
In reality,

1129
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:49,490
most hallucinogens cause some degree of
mental or physical discomfort after the

1130
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:52,610
trip is over.
This is an indirect effect of the drug,

1131
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:56,270
not strict nine or any other
adulterant. Okay, here we go.

1132
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,470
They used to always also say that the old,
uh, which always seemed fake, like, Ooh,

1133
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:03,150
so much strict nine on that,
that it collects in your back.

1134
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:05,730
And if you ever get in a car accident
and hit that part in your back,

1135
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,840
you're going to trip forever.

1136
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1137
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,220
I'm an LSD stores and your fingernails
and you knew who your fingernails

1138
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:18,890
constantly grow. That means you'll
constantly be tripping. It's amazing.

1139
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:25,550
Fucking hate that guy. I met him,
I met that guy last night. Did you?

1140
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,630
It was one of them. Same
Guy. I'm doing a documentary.

1141
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,770
I would love to have you involved
to raise consciousness and expand

1142
01:04:33,771 --> 01:04:38,690
consciousness sort of in an overall
sense of consciousness. Basically.

1143
01:04:38,691 --> 01:04:42,560
Like the vibe I'm on right now is sign.
Didn't even care about money.

1144
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:46,400
I'm just all about spreading
peace and consciousness.

1145
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,910
So funny. Those guys that you meet that
follow you, that are fans of you. But,

1146
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,290
uh, the other day there
was a few of them and uh,

1147
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:59,030
we would play this game where like one
would come up to us and started talking

1148
01:04:59,050 --> 01:04:59,883
to the ghost.

1149
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:04,730
Like Christina [inaudible] Jetski was
there and he starts talking to me and

1150
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,840
Christina,

1151
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,900
Christina said something to him and the
next thing she knows she looks over and

1152
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:11,810
I'm gone. You know, cause I'm just,
you just kind of like hot potato,

1153
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:13,690
you pass off the crazy person too.

1154
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,470
There's one thing I'm not enjoying about
being at the comedy store is how many

1155
01:05:16,471 --> 01:05:19,440
people are pitching me ideas. You
can't just hang out there. Right.

1156
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:23,320
For guys pitched me ideas last
night, came up to me, hey man,

1157
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:26,770
I came here to talk to about this project
I'm doing on a really one guy was the

1158
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:29,380
history of the Fart joke.
I'm not joking.

1159
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,960
It's doing a documentary on the history of
the Fart joke and um, I will, yeah, I'm,

1160
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,750
and this is true, I have no time for
anything. I have no time for other stuff.

1161
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,690
I have exactly amount of time for
the stuff that I'm doing right now.

1162
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,330
And you know, anyway, that comes
up to me, hey, can you do this?

1163
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:45,700
Can you do my podcast?
I literally don't have the time.

1164
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:49,680
I just not available so I can't do
it. And so the guy goes, well, um,

1165
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,950
can I go through proper channels and
talk without watts? What does that mean?

1166
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:58,360
I just said no. Like, I don't want to do
a history of the Fart joke documentary.

1167
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,660
We don't have, there's no proper channel.
Like good luck. Maybe it'd be great.

1168
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,210
I mean,
look,

1169
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:06,280
they knew that a documentary on corn
would be great and you could have an

1170
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:09,010
awesome documentary on the history of the
Fart joke. I just don't have the time.

1171
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,470
What's he like? Whatever did it just
blows apart on you and walks away. Well,

1172
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,970
here's a joke.
You pull my finger.

1173
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,400
It was, it was a good guy. It
wasn't a bad guy. He wasn't.

1174
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:25,000
He was like really cool about it in
comparison to how many other different

1175
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:28,480
people have come by with ridiculous
ideas where they weren't cool about it.

1176
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:31,240
Where it's just like, you know, I had
to tell a guy last night and like, dude,

1177
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,390
you've got to stop pitching me. I'm not
pitching you. I go, yes you are. I go,

1178
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,950
I'm trying to have this
conversation with Ari.

1179
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,650
You've sandwich yourself in between us
and you're telling me about this movie

1180
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:40,960
you're doing or this thing you're
doing. I'm like, I can't do it.

1181
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,360
Like you stop and it's
like you can't hang out.

1182
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:48,110
I don't get those. You know
what I get now? The business
propositions, oh well you,

1183
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:48,320
you,

1184
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:53,320
you need to move to Denver with Rogan and
opened up a weed store and when people

1185
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:53,790
come,

1186
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:57,950
you pick them up at the airport and do
a tour of the city and donate half your

1187
01:06:57,951 --> 01:07:02,630
money to the charity. And I told the guy,
listen, I live in La. You do know that.

1188
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,700
You know, I've lived in La.
I can't, I'll be not wanting,

1189
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,510
even Canada and I can't help it.

1190
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:10,820
Well that means you really don't want
to spray it unless I really don't give a

1191
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:15,410
fuck. What the fuck? I really
don't give a fuck. I really don't.

1192
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,530
You want to smoke dope, smoked
dope. You don't want to smoke dope.

1193
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,250
Y'All not taking you around. You're
not helping me. Show you a call.

1194
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,920
Get the fuck Outta here. What about
believes in the that shit anyway.

1195
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,710
I never bought high times in my life.
I just don't.

1196
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:32,140
I don't look at bugs and have
pictures of buds shirt with,

1197
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:36,440
read out my shirt. I just
smoke motherfucking dope. Okay.

1198
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:39,740
I don't know nothing else. I don't know.
Not. I don't know about consciousness.

1199
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,700
I don't know about fucking, you
know the Lord. I don't know.

1200
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:47,960
I'm not roll it up or shut your
fucking mouth. That fucking easy.

1201
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,990
I don't want to hear about nothing.
Nobody gets that shit.

1202
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,530
You go to a town now you get
19 people want to do a podcast.

1203
01:07:54,531 --> 01:07:57,350
I don't have the fucking time.
And they want you to jump in that car.

1204
01:07:57,351 --> 01:08:00,070
I don't even fucking know.
You fucking know you. Well,

1205
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,320
I'll take it 20 minutes away,
20 minutes and you're fucking the world.

1206
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,390
That's 40 minutes in my fucking world.

1207
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,550
When I go to a town I
don't want to do Dick.

1208
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,790
Once I get on that plane to
go to anywhere the fuck I go,

1209
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,950
I don't want to do deck.
Yeah.

1210
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,530
I wouldn't do the radio that
they have for me and it,

1211
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,050
I've already done my podcast for the
week. I've done everything. I go in and,

1212
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:20,660
and fucking got to compute.
I got that little,

1213
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:22,790
what's that new thing that the substance,

1214
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:26,510
I don't even know what the fuck it is
and surface surface trauma that you got

1215
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:31,070
one of those little windows can be
perfect for me. Nobody bothers me.

1216
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:31,791
I go to my room,

1217
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:34,940
I watch all this shit that I can't watch
at home because there's a baby around

1218
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:38,880
and a white fasten your questions about
the hemisphere when you're in the middle

1219
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,520
of the right fucking something,
you know,

1220
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,940
and you can't say no to the kid
because they don't get, what the fuck?

1221
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,790
They don't get a joke. They don't
get nothing. Right. You got to stop.

1222
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:49,820
What the fuck you doing? She runs into
the computer room and jumps on my lap.

1223
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:54,180
That's the end of the computer. It's
youtube and they got to watch fucking, uh,

1224
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,980
something about the window of what's
rainy or something about animals.

1225
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:01,250
And I love it, but that's just how
it goes. So when I go to a town,

1226
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:05,700
it's the fucking sit down and write a few
jokes and fucking focus on the act for

1227
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:09,290
tonight and tomorrow night and I don't
want to fucking drive 40 minutes.

1228
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:12,370
You're telling me that they want to stop
and introduce you to their uncle who

1229
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:17,070
was a fan of the his yard. I don't give
a fuck. Alright, let's go. I've delay.

1230
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,080
I don't want to do nothing.

1231
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,440
Well I guess you just don't care
about spreading the message.

1232
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:24,200
The message is suck my Dick.
That's the fucking message.

1233
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,890
Or what about the cause man? Is it
all just about sucking your Dick? Yes.

1234
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:30,530
It's not really what you're bound in
a fucking week yesterday is, yeah,

1235
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,740
it's about what?
I didn't want to blow job.

1236
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:35,810
I just want to smoke dope and be fucked.
Him left alone.

1237
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,200
I don't know what the fuck are
you talking about? They do what?

1238
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,460
They have been coming out to
the comedy store, full force,

1239
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:43,040
full force action lists,
swarms of a choke.

1240
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,760
Every show I've done in the past three
weeks I've been hit up for something.

1241
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,640
They don't bother me. They just, you
know, I love talking to those people.

1242
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,940
I don't mind talking to people.
That's a problem.

1243
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:54,380
It's the people that are pitching shit.

1244
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,640
Just regular folks who want to come by and
say what's up? That's cool. That's fun.

1245
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,160
That's great mean you have great
conversations and some of those people,

1246
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:05,450
it's the people that like interrupt other
conversations just sandwich themselves

1247
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,450
in and gay. I've got to talk to you about
this movie. We're about to jump off.

1248
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:11,450
Seth Rogan's involved. It's
very big. It's going to be huge.

1249
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,880
I've got a lot of Bobcat
Goldthwait we're in negotiation.

1250
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:14,990
Looks like shut the fuck up.

1251
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:19,460
I had a guy show up with a camera through
economic storm on camera, like a film,

1252
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,730
a film camera, kiss me, took
a picture of cool and it goes,

1253
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:27,020
you mind saying something
about my TV show,

1254
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:31,160
my web series and I'm like,
man, I never watched it.

1255
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,750
I don't even know what you're
saying. It doesn't matter. Just,

1256
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,590
you know what I'm saying? He's like, and
they fucking jumped the thing at the,

1257
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,740
they were in that car on the side
going down a hill and the store,

1258
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,190
like they went up the hotel ramp and
turned around and they were waiting for me

1259
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:46,090
outside and they just jumped out with
a camera and they killed was like,

1260
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:51,060
hold on one second. If the kid fucking
jumped and came and the kid had a, a camp,

1261
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:54,020
you didn't even say yes. I didn't even
say yes. He just got and I was like, God,

1262
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:58,370
I don't know. How can you want me to
say something about your web series?

1263
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,840
I don't know what the fuck it is. No.
Yeah, no. All the weed people also,

1264
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,380
that's another wine. People just like,
Hey got this joint company, you know,

1265
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:10,430
he tastes could take some joints and it's
like shitty weed with oil on it by the

1266
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:14,250
way. So that's another problem. Yeah.
People were to give your shit to smoke

1267
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,000
or you have no idea what kind of monkey
business you're doing it that joint.

1268
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,500
Did you just give me this,
have cocaine in it? Like what?

1269
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:23,990
Like now I'm going to get pulled over
and I'm, I have some heroin laced. Yeah.

1270
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:28,080
Who knows? Yeah. We'll, the other day
some guy gave me one of those tubes. Yeah.

1271
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:31,200
And I buy those tubes sometimes
when I'm in a rush by my house,

1272
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:34,320
they have the tubes to the joint letter.
It had a little bit of Ash. I bet.

1273
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:37,050
I bet they're like 12 bucks.
You smoke them and I fucking bad.

1274
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,940
So I thought it was the same thing.

1275
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,330
Well I fucking took him like really
want to get high on the way back to the

1276
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:42,661
store.

1277
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:47,070
We got fucking blast and we have to
stop at seven 11 and get water and shit.

1278
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,660
Fuck that. Amazing. We, you know, and I,

1279
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:56,100
I drive leads to the car
and I go home and I'm like,

1280
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:59,520
I'm saving this fucking dude.
And the next day I go to the weed store,

1281
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:03,120
like give it to the guy to go, I want
fucking 10 of those. And he looked at me,

1282
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:06,780
he goes, I don't have these. I gave
it to the girl. That's my friend.

1283
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:11,730
She went in the back and they go, we
can't sell these. These have waxer. Yeah,

1284
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:16,470
that's what it is. Wonder. I was so
fucking I what was going on? He goes, no,

1285
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:20,850
you have to look. CVW Kid went to
give you two of them the other night.

1286
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:24,180
Yeah. Yeah. That was standing next to
you. I told him I couldn't take him like,

1287
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:28,710
I don't know. You did. Sorry. You
know, come on man. Like yo listen,

1288
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:33,300
I don't know you. You could be a cop.
And the girl gave you the buffet. Terror.

1289
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,090
Yeah, that was, that was really
ridiculous. She gave me a cake,

1290
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,730
a Bundt cake for my
daughter. And I'm like, look,

1291
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:41,250
I'm not giving my daughter a cake
from someone I don't even know.

1292
01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:44,760
So I don't want to be rude
to you, but thank you very
much. I don't want the cake.

1293
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:48,390
I don't eat that stuff. And I'm not going
to give it to my kids. She was like,

1294
01:12:48,391 --> 01:12:49,830
why not?
And I was like,

1295
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:54,240
I don't know you like I'm not going to
just accept a cake from you to give to my

1296
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:58,950
kid, you know? I mean this is, that's
weird. That's weird. It's weird already.

1297
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,410
You know,
if you gave me a cake to give to my kid,

1298
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:04,830
well I know you were still wouldn't.
I probably,

1299
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,380
I don't want them eating that much sugar.

1300
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:10,980
I mean I give them dessert every now and
again, but that's not even the point.

1301
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,630
The point is like why would I do that?

1302
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:17,010
Why would I give some food to my kid from
some strange lady that the first thing

1303
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:21,840
she says is I have a cake for
your daughter. Like not hello,

1304
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,670
not how's your night going? Not
What are you guys up to? Hey,

1305
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,880
that was a really funny show, Joey.
You know what are your, where are you?

1306
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,580
Where are you at next? Or
You'd go on the road. No,

1307
01:13:32,581 --> 01:13:34,380
it's like right away I've
got a cake for your daughter.

1308
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:37,080
Like what the fuck out of here?
God crazy shit is up.

1309
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,640
I don't think people understand how
creepy that actually sounds cause they're

1310
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,570
from probably from a small
town where it's like,

1311
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:45,680
you know they're bringing an apple pie
over to strangers. Like I'm your neighbor.

1312
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:49,110
Yeah. And Shit like that. In the middle
of talking to someone last night,

1313
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:52,920
this guy comes over, interrupts in the
first words are, it's about, hey man,

1314
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:53,820
can you do me a favor?

1315
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,820
And he's got his camera out and he wants
me to make a video for him. I'm like, no,

1316
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,430
no, no. I can't do your favor.

1317
01:13:58,431 --> 01:14:01,530
Like you didn't even care that we're
talking like it doesn't even bother you.

1318
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,220
You're not. Excuse me. Can I
ask you a question real quick?

1319
01:14:04,221 --> 01:14:08,520
Is You guys free right now? Can I, can
I ask you something like right away,

1320
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,120
can you do me a favor? Oh, well I'm
to make a video and want you to be

1321
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,810
like, get outta here. No, I got place.
Needs a green room. It does have one.

1322
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:21,430
Yeah, but nobody uses it there.
Yeah. You use it to the main room,

1323
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:24,700
but in the main room you have the night
a guy came in like I weaseled and he was

1324
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,760
already already in the back and me and
Russell were talking about the other

1325
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,950
night.
It was ridiculous like talking to people,

1326
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:33,370
but there's a line that I
would live cross with somebody.

1327
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:37,090
I'd love to go up to somebody lean red
band. We breakfast in that Atlanta.

1328
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:40,860
We saw Tommy Heinsohn from the herself
and I had, excuse me, he was tying, said,

1329
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,670
yeah, it's an honor to meet
you. I didn't bother him.

1330
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,150
I don't want even want to fucking picture.
Stop with your fucking tight.

1331
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:48,250
Just stop with the fucking pictures.

1332
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:52,710
What's the picture you to fucking
dope fucking picture but a bother.

1333
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:56,080
It's fucking guy and breakfast.
Mr Hindsight was a fan. I went,

1334
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,890
he's getting the city. I was north Bergen.
Your second cousins with the Holloway.

1335
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:02,800
Yeah. Thank you for your time
and he left. I didn't stop.

1336
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:05,620
I'm not going to stop him and get
a fucking hug. I don't give a fuck.

1337
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,860
I really don't. I've never given a
fuck. I've seen people a lot. It's like,

1338
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:13,270
all right, whatever. I'm going
to go bother this fucking
person. You know? I just,

1339
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,700
I don't mind talking to
people. I love talking. I'd be,

1340
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:19,360
that's why I became a comic. I love
it. But there's a line that, you know,

1341
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:21,670
when I go out at night, I wanted
to do standup. Nothing else.

1342
01:15:21,671 --> 01:15:23,170
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

1343
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,100
We think I did on the way to the show.
You'd think I smoked 15 joints,

1344
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,490
the weight dot Laurel Canyon.
I already got high, you know,

1345
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:34,120
and I already ate a fucking buck cookie.
I'm where I need to be. You know,

1346
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:36,490
if I want to smoke and I this
time because I smoked with people,

1347
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:40,110
but there's other times and I'm already
baked and I got to get back on Laurel

1348
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:40,120
Canyon.

1349
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,600
What if I get pulled over when I got your
shitty weed on my fucking breath and I

1350
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:47,080
got to do 90 days because you want to
hit me with that fucking purple fucking

1351
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:51,010
fake weed. You got your shit
together. You know? It's just,

1352
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,690
I enjoy it. I just, I don't want to get
pitched. I know where you're coming from,

1353
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:58,030
but I don't want to,
I like talking about people.

1354
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,970
It's the weird people before you go
on stage too. That's the only tool.

1355
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:02,410
Sometimes people at the comedy store,

1356
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:05,500
like literally there'll be introducing
you and those people say, hey man,

1357
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:06,810
can I get a picture?
Like do you,

1358
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:10,120
you don't hear that guy like bringing me
up on stage right now. Like you don't,

1359
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:10,983
they don't care.

1360
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,440
They just want to get that thing on
their Facebook and that's a real fucking

1361
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:17,290
problem with the access to cameras.
People want to use them.

1362
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,370
Even if it doesn't make any sense.

1363
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:22,180
Like people weren't bringing cameras out
and like 2000 when we'd go on the road,

1364
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,160
people weren't bringing
that many cameras with them.

1365
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:25,750
We didn't take that
many pictures of people.

1366
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,120
Most of the time when you talk to
people off the show, you said hi to him.

1367
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,140
It took a few pictures of the folks but
not, and not everybody had a camera.

1368
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,200
Now every fucking person you meet
every day has a camera that's up,

1369
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:41,440
mindblowing,
change between days ago.

1370
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:45,150
Yeah. Can you imagine like 20 years ago
everyone just having cam quarters walking

1371
01:16:45,151 --> 01:16:49,500
around the street and the worst part
is that you don't know when people are

1372
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:51,360
recording.
So like that,

1373
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:54,390
that people where people are sitting
there texting but they're just recording

1374
01:16:54,391 --> 01:16:58,020
you. I was out with my
girlfriend the other day and
it was one of those guys that

1375
01:16:58,021 --> 01:17:00,390
just sitting there staring
like, oh, I know this guy,

1376
01:17:00,391 --> 01:17:01,780
I know this guy and he's a [inaudible].

1377
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,890
He's sitting there with his camera just
up like he's looking and I know he was

1378
01:17:04,891 --> 01:17:07,680
just sitting there recording
or doing something. Yeah,

1379
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:10,250
people are fucking weird
air on. It's, it's a weird

1380
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,150
time, but people have lost
like their etiquette like,

1381
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:16,550
and because this is such a new world,

1382
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:19,360
like there's no etiquette
as far as like cameras and,

1383
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,250
and sticking them in people's
faces are asking for photos.

1384
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:25,610
Like how many times you get to ask while
you're eating mouthful of food. Hey Man,

1385
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:29,390
can I get a picture of like who the fuck
would ever come up to in the middle of

1386
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:31,970
eating your, you've got to
in the middle of, hey man,

1387
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,100
can I talk to you about something like,
no,

1388
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:37,280
this is not the time to talk to people.
These are people who are eating food.

1389
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,890
They're having a meal and not only that,
they're,

1390
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,950
they're sitting at a table looking
at each other having a conversation.

1391
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:46,340
It's one of the most enjoyable things
we do as friends sit around and have a

1392
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:49,730
meal together. You know, it's like, that's
like that expression breaking bread.

1393
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,740
You break bread with people
and what are you saying?

1394
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:55,220
I can't do it in public or I'm going
to be interrupted every five seconds by

1395
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:56,930
somebody who wants to take a photograph.
Of course not.

1396
01:17:57,110 --> 01:18:00,320
Most people realize that and they don't
interrupt you while you're eating,

1397
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:04,490
but some people do not give a fuck.
You can be eating with a baby on your lap,

1398
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,810
mouthful of food, answering the phone
and they tap you. Hey Man, get a picture.

1399
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,840
Can I get a picture? Hey Man, can
I get a picture? Hey, excuse me,

1400
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:14,210
can I get a picture? I hate to be
that guy, but can I get a picture?

1401
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,820
You hate to be that guy,
but you're being that guy.

1402
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:21,700
I bought a new car. No, not
this. Subaru. The one before it.

1403
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:26,410
Particularly with some of the show. I
bought it off the lot. I was in a rush.

1404
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,670
I left the indoor light
on my car was dead.

1405
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,820
Koinonia and fucking
Hollywood at rush hour.

1406
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,130
Do you go that the guy
that came over and said,

1407
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:41,000
do you need help in the process
goes, hey man, can I pitch you

1408
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:47,190
my mother's grave?
That was the worst thing ever.

1409
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:52,940
When Aba, Hawaiian Guy, the car won't
start. I have fucking groceries. The key,

1410
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:53,813
the key,

1411
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:58,590
the fucking phone was in the car and
my car won't start and I got these

1412
01:18:58,591 --> 01:18:59,880
groceries.
I got to put them down,

1413
01:18:59,881 --> 01:19:02,670
pop the trunk and wait for
somebody with a fucking,

1414
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:07,350
this motherfucker pulls over. I go, you
got jumper cables? He goes, no, I don't,

1415
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:10,470
but I gotta ask you something.
Can I drop off a script to your agent?

1416
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:13,980
And I looked at him
like, go, you're fucking,

1417
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:18,120
it was like a Jersey boy thing where he
wanted me to dance. I couldn't fucking,

1418
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:19,770
and he had met me one time.

1419
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:24,540
He just happened to see me out of the
street and pulled over in the middle of my

1420
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:27,790
pocket and came up to me. He
goes, hey man, do you think, uh,

1421
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,160
you couldn't go anywhere? So you were
trapped. And I looked at him like, go,

1422
01:19:30,161 --> 01:19:34,140
you gotta get the fuck out.
Like you're not fucking serious right now.

1423
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,930
You have to go through the
proper fucking channels.

1424
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,420
I take pictures with everybody.
I did everybody.

1425
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:45,540
I do theaters and after the show,
I don't charge anybody.

1426
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:50,040
I stayed for hours. I'll take
hundreds of pictures. There's lines.

1427
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:50,910
We have videos of it,

1428
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:54,660
of all these theaters where there's
lines around spiral staircases.

1429
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,660
And I wait until everybody's done
before I go get something to eat.

1430
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:00,810
I do it all the time. So it's not
like I don't want to meet people,

1431
01:20:00,811 --> 01:20:02,220
I want to meet everybody and be friendly.

1432
01:20:02,221 --> 01:20:05,550
But there's a certain little line that
people cross that just shows their

1433
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:06,810
socially goofy.

1434
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,350
They're just klutzy clumsy and
those are the exact type of people.

1435
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:12,330
They're always trying to pitch
you something. Who the fuck?

1436
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:17,250
Have you ever pitched anything to who the
fuck have you ever pitched anything to?

1437
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,240
I've never pitched anybody
in idea of never come up to
someone and said, hey man,

1438
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,700
there's this project.
If we had a name attached to it like you,

1439
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,160
I really think you could jump off like,
I don't even know you.

1440
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,570
Like you're supposed to have an agent.

1441
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,540
Like there's a whole system of things
that are in place for a reason.

1442
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:33,480
You have a script, the script is good.
The script get read by reviewers,

1443
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:36,660
a reviewers take it, the agency
represents it. They bring it out.

1444
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:40,470
They'd contact other people.
They say, Hey, we've got
this script. We think that a,

1445
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:41,400
this could be a really good script.

1446
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:43,020
Do you have any actors that would
be interested in doing this?

1447
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:45,660
And then they contact the agents
at the actors. You have meetings.

1448
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:48,750
That's how shit gets done. You
don't just show up. When Joey Diaz,

1449
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:52,020
his car's broken down and took what I'm
trying to break into the business like,

1450
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,900
well, you're doing it wrong. It's like
coming up to me and saying, hey man,

1451
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,270
can I open for you? Absolutely
not. I don't know you,

1452
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:01,170
but you want to come with me on the road.
What a great idea. A Guy, I don't know,

1453
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:05,040
flying around with me being fucking
weird and who knows how bad you suck.

1454
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,330
You know,
you can be terrible.

1455
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,050
I've had people that told me
they've never gone on stage before,

1456
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:12,120
but they know that there
would be fucking awesome.

1457
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:13,830
And if they could just
go up during my show,

1458
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,010
it would be the right kind of show
to go up for because we have the same

1459
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:21,270
sensibilities. Oh, what a great idea.
You should do. No Open Mike Nights.

1460
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,930
You should just go directly to a bunch
of people that paid to see me and I'll

1461
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:26,880
just let you on stage and you do
whatever the fuck you want to do.

1462
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:30,450
I don't even know you a cool
ass that who says, hey man,

1463
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:33,690
I'm the best basically baseball player
of all time. And, uh, just to like,

1464
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,940
Dodgers should just let me play one day
and just get out there and showed up and

1465
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:40,200
do, do you want to audition? No,
man. Just let me hit the ball bro.

1466
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,380
I'll fucking hit a home run a guarantee.
There's people out there,

1467
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:45,720
there that goofy. There's
a lot of them, man.

1468
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:50,930
And this town is like a magnet for
them because some of them get on TV,

1469
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,480
some of them get on a reality show
and they're so retarded that they're

1470
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:56,790
compelling. And then you
listen to him. I mean,

1471
01:21:56,791 --> 01:22:00,930
how many fucking look at windy city heat.
How about that fucking movie?

1472
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:05,250
That's exactly what we're talking about.
Wendy city heat is a diary of a madman.

1473
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:09,080
I mean, it's a fucking biography. Don
Barris, Jimmy Kimmel put together,

1474
01:22:09,081 --> 01:22:13,350
it took this guy who was
out of his fucking mind and
they had this guy convinced

1475
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:16,220
that he was a movie star and that he was,
uh,

1476
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,840
some special and he was a
celebrity and they, they, they,

1477
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,950
they hosed him the entire way. I
mean, the guy wasn't in on it at all,

1478
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:26,420
in that fucking guy still around.
Man. And he still thinks he's a,

1479
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:30,030
he gets people coming through his shows.
He's a real headline.

1480
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:33,360
And you have to hear what this shit that
comes out of his mouth. He's all areas.

1481
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:37,560
It's kind of fucked up man, because they,
they've essentially taken advantage.

1482
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,290
There's a bobcat Goldthwait that's sick.
Fuck. Look at that. Look at his face.

1483
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,860
He loves it. And Dawn Paris is the
master of dealing with retards.

1484
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:48,030
Don Barris has a phd and nuts.
He knows how to deal with it.

1485
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:50,750
Who's was the guy with
the wig? Uh, that's the,

1486
01:22:50,751 --> 01:22:53,190
the guy that fucks with
scary period all that time.

1487
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,210
Ridiculous.
One of the big three.

1488
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,990
But like those type of people with the
people that you get at the comedy store.

1489
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:05,070
I don't mind the picture taking.
I tell you what at all the mice get.

1490
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,300
So you've taken 300 pictures.
I've given out hugs.

1491
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:13,810
I've smoked pot.
I'm thinking the heads off six pipes.

1492
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,730
We go inside.
I hugged the staff.

1493
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:24,790
I get paid as I'm walking out the door.
There's four fucking people in an alley.

1494
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:28,270
Can we take a picture?
Where the fuck were you?

1495
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:33,460
Where the fuck were you before?
Like once I'm done, I'm done.

1496
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:37,860
I'm done. That's it. Once
it's over, it's over for me.

1497
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,910
You guys know it once it's over.

1498
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:43,810
You got a minute to make up your
mind cause I'm gone. It's over.

1499
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,110
There's no more nothing. And those
are the ones, the only ones that I go,

1500
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,461
I don't get this,

1501
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:51,520
that we've been here for two hours and
you've been standing there like a fucking

1502
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:53,170
bump on a wall.
They get nervous.

1503
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:56,460
They want to be with you at the end is
now at the end as I'm about to go and I

1504
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,320
gotta stop what the Fuck I'm doing.

1505
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,190
But Vegeta wise and fucking like go head
wasn't living it no more. That's it.

1506
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:05,860
Yeah, I'm done with the fucking
pictures. I'm stumped talking.

1507
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,030
I just did two shows.
We just talked to 500 people for fuck,

1508
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:11,830
I be [inaudible] seven fucking 30

1509
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:17,800
that's the only part of the fucking thing
that doesn't, I'm the Sunday nights.

1510
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:21,760
One of the purposes, but I stay in
on Sunday night is to answer emails.

1511
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,240
I answer anywhere from 80 to 125 emails.

1512
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:29,920
Good recent that I do it because I
don't have what everybody else has.

1513
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:33,520
That's my little edge. People come to the
shows and they go, I hate your material,

1514
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:37,510
but you answered my,
I ain't give it very often.

1515
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:39,281
I don't think you're funny,

1516
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:42,150
but you answered my email will say
that you and I ain't been on six out of

1517
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,170
comics. They didn't answer
me. Well. People are shitty
people. That's rude. Yeah,

1518
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,121
don't answer.

1519
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:50,560
They'll come to your show or buy your
shirt just because you answered an email.

1520
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:55,270
You know? That's how far I go. I go the
whole fucking way with these people,

1521
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,580
but when I say that's it,
that's it.

1522
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:02,140
Like I get hit obviously for
10 fucking podcasts a week.

1523
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,500
I don't even know who these people are.
I don't even know who they are.

1524
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:09,400
I have no idea. They're calling
me. It's and they get angry Joe.

1525
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:13,420
That's what burns me up that they don't
understand what we go through here.

1526
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:17,440
That you know, if I get in a car, it's
45 minutes to go somewhere. That's time.

1527
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:21,910
That's an hour and a half. Then I
have a baby. I got no babysitter.

1528
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:24,550
I got a podcast. I try
to work out, you know,

1529
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:27,850
not to mention whatever wants to talk
to me legitimately about something.

1530
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,850
Then I got a wife and then
we got to do stand up. Oh.

1531
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,620
Then there's a thing that you have to do.
Call writing.

1532
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,820
What the fuck do you want me to, you know
these people that call you up and go,

1533
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:40,720
can you get my podcast? Yeah, we do
five o'clock by the airport. Listen,

1534
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:44,710
you've got no a no dang cause
that's not happening at all.

1535
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,100
Five o'clock by the airport.
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

1536
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:50,320
You're not getting me out
for a fucking podcast.

1537
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:54,820
It's either early or late at night.
Take your pick. I can't do it.

1538
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:58,750
Four o'clock I can't do it. Guy. The
Culver city. That's an hour each way.

1539
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,190
You just killed.
If you're lucky,

1540
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,800
that's three hours for your
fucking podcasts out of my time.

1541
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:04,310
If you do Culver city,
you literally

1542
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:08,000
have to do 11 in the morning so that
you're out by two at the latest and then

1543
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:10,000
you get on the road cause even
to you're pushing your tool.

1544
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:14,660
It used to be three of this town that
was two to 15 you'll fucking cup boats.

1545
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:19,130
I drove at five once from Venice and I
got, I said, let's see what it's like.

1546
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:21,380
Let's just see what it's like to be
on the four or five at five o'clock.

1547
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,110
It was insane. It's insane. It's really,

1548
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:27,170
I feel so bad for those people
that have to do that every day.

1549
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:31,060
My Mexican does that every single day.
You're Mexican, you're girlfriend union.

1550
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:35,870
Jesus Christ. Dude, we'll call
your Mexican because my boy,

1551
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:38,990
but he takes that podcast by the
airport. Oh, it was crazy. Oh,

1552
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:40,160
that's where the Fox studio is.

1553
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:45,310
They do in the same place where Brendan
and I think Fox and five o'clock yeah,

1554
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,530
you could suck it. You can stop. I
don't want to. Fox Studios are fine.

1555
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,980
That's all good fighter. And the
kid over here. I was like, know,

1556
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:55,070
I'll do your podcast, but we'll, we'll
do it over here. Like, C'mon guys.

1557
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,900
That's retarded.
That's too far away.

1558
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:01,930
It takes her an hour and 45 minutes
every single day and it's only 23 miles.

1559
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:06,140
Oh my God.
Where the way from Venice to Burbank.

1560
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,900
Did she do a back and forth?
It takes that much or, oh no,

1561
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:13,640
that's just one way home. One way is
an hour and 45 minutes home. Oh good.

1562
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:15,800
She gets off at five and she gets,

1563
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:19,760
she gets home about six 37 Oh my God.

1564
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,990
That is fucking insane. And I'm
the way there. It's only an hour.

1565
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:28,210
So three hours. I know. On a
bad day she's in the car. Yeah.

1566
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:31,430
She's pretty much going to Vegas every
day. That's insane. You have to be,

1567
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,600
we'd be messed up. Pedal to the
metal. I made it back from Vegas,

1568
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:38,900
wants to three hours,
but uh, I shouldn't have,

1569
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:45,230
I used to make up from San Diego and I
was 35 really nice when that happens.

1570
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,360
I have a lot of people
could make my records.

1571
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:50,390
One 20 that's she's the drug
dealer was closing that one.

1572
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:53,950
That drug deal was closed.
That one dog.

1573
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:57,530
I used to get off the stage at the comedy
store in La Jolla. I would have line.

1574
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,190
I didn't give a fuck. What a bunch
of, what time you want me to do. Oh,

1575
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:04,610
we want you to do 45 to one hour.
Listen, whenever 1140 years,

1576
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,133
that's what I'm doing.

1577
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:11,290
So all these guests sets and all these
people you're putting up at 1140 I get

1578
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,370
off the stage and I walked
right through the car.

1579
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,820
The cars are already filled up with gas.
There's no need to stop.

1580
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,330
It's pointed to the fire from La Jolla.
So what were they trying to do?

1581
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,410
Is Sandwich a bunch of people on
him? Yeah, like they would just Tom,

1582
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:25,370
how are you gonna have
to stay til $12 an hour?

1583
01:28:25,371 --> 01:28:29,780
20 my drug dealer, closest
one. I gotta hit lows.

1584
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:33,010
Felice by fucking five to one.
This situation going nowhere.

1585
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:37,310
I would do 70 75 from the
La horror comedy store.

1586
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:41,960
They'd be gracious and once
you an immigration Jack,
the Irvine, it's a hundred

1587
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:46,240
certain things that some clubs would like
to do where they want to put on there.

1588
01:28:46,241 --> 01:28:49,660
Good local guys in front of a guy like
you because they know a guy like he was

1589
01:28:49,661 --> 01:28:53,000
going to have a good audience.
So a bunch of like local guys were like,

1590
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,260
Joey deans, do you want to shell? Can I
get on that Shell? Can I get on that show?

1591
01:28:56,261 --> 01:28:58,000
Like you know he used to
do that shit all the time.

1592
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:00,340
It's Tom Sawyer in San Francisco.

1593
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,110
I remember we used to Tom book the
Gig and then somewhere along the like,

1594
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:07,710
Yo dude done. There's no more this no
more. Because he was like, you know,

1595
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,430
I really want to be able
to put the show together.

1596
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,140
Like why would you want to put the show
together when it doesn't cost you any

1597
01:29:12,141 --> 01:29:15,660
more? If I bring my friends and I
know they're hilarious, like listen,

1598
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:16,350
just trust me.

1599
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:21,240
I've got some great local talent and
these put on this nightmare of an opening

1600
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:25,020
show and be like, Oh fucking Christ. Two
three guys. In a row that you're like,

1601
01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:29,930
what am I listening to? Oh God.
And then you'd bring, you know,

1602
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:34,940
I'd bring you or I bring Dunkin or I'd
bring Ari and we'd have a fucking amazing

1603
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:39,930
show. But they were like, wow,
Joey Diaz upsets people. And like,

1604
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,330
I don't know if that's the kind of
Kinda Act we want of our club and like,

1605
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:48,330
Oh hey, he's the one that fucking
nobody. He was the worst. Oh.

1606
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:51,690
And I used to go there just to irritate.
I knew he was gay.

1607
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:53,910
I knew he was dying to suck your Dick.
He was,

1608
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:59,160
if there was a guy that was dying
to suck your Dick, it was that guy.

1609
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:04,950
He was
fucking jump though.

1610
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:09,020
The day he showed up with the two seater
to pick you up to do radio in the Pfr.

1611
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:11,970
We came up and I already go to Joey
d is, you might be right. That guy,

1612
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,790
I like a small car. He went out and
rented a two seat so he could have,

1613
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,710
he was trying to get gigs.
Triggers are like Cosby comedy.

1614
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,290
I don't want to hear, it's not
going to like calm. We got out.

1615
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,940
When somebody likes comedy,
they stick with it.

1616
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:30,960
That dude was a deck to a lot of
people and with that guy got fired.

1617
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,360
I law that people are happy,
Bro.

1618
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:36,960
He fucked over a lot of people
and I don't know about all that.

1619
01:30:36,961 --> 01:30:39,820
I liked that guy and he's still like,
um, what's taking good time with him?

1620
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,610
Like two or three people.

1621
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:45,990
How he hated when you
brought me fucking hey,

1622
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,510
because he knew he
couldn't suck your Dick.

1623
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:53,490
He knew he was dying and suck your
jobs back. Guy was opposed, spoke up.

1624
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:55,380
I fucked the word go.

1625
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:01,590
It's amazing how many guys on the road
look at all the guys when we were touring

1626
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,160
that set things. None of them
are around. I know. Yeah.

1627
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:09,570
They never fucking mattered.
When I see a comedy club owner though,

1628
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:10,740
they comes and talks to me.

1629
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:14,580
I look right fucking through and I don't
give a fuck a bed listening to the show.

1630
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:18,150
Fuck you. You're a fucking pimp
and the heat is what you are.

1631
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:19,980
I just looked frigging that warning

1632
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:25,500
makes him a fucking game name.
You know from Mark Babbitt.

1633
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:29,280
I have to go in and listen to
shut the fuck up. Mark Babbitt.

1634
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:34,350
That's your cocaine buddy. Oh, oh,
it was booze bags were the same.

1635
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:38,460
That made believe that was something so
important. And at the end of the week,

1636
01:31:38,461 --> 01:31:43,260
we outlasted them. We outlasted
those fucking pee. Those
people are important too,

1637
01:31:43,261 --> 01:31:46,690
because look, when Mark Babbitt
was around, I hate to be defended.

1638
01:31:46,691 --> 01:31:49,210
Mark down a walked back. It
was a great guy. He was a Greg.

1639
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:52,530
The importance that Houston, look at
Houston County when can put after that.

1640
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,710
It did go cup point. That's what I'm
saying. But he wrote notes about the fuck.

1641
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:59,770
But no, but he kept it alive. He was
like the Jim Jones of calming down that

1642
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,080
he was doing blow and you know, recruit
young kids. Somebody busted them,

1643
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:07,060
put an ad out for young kids and shit.

1644
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:11,890
You know what you're talking about kids,
you know like fucking how creepy.

1645
01:32:11,891 --> 01:32:16,540
He was a guy from Tempe as
much as a bastard. What he,

1646
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:19,160
I would listen to the man
like his whole vocabulary was,

1647
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:24,330
he couldn't wait to say spade. He
loves saying the word the spades. Oh,

1648
01:32:24,331 --> 01:32:26,770
like David spade, spade, David's baby.

1649
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:31,620
David's Spain was thinking Phoenix hard
conversation and he couldn't wait to

1650
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,740
who? You're not going to believe
[inaudible] pray their family.

1651
01:32:35,741 --> 01:32:38,850
They're not coming to your stupid
fucking club and Arizona. Okay?

1652
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:43,810
They're not coming to your dumb fucking
comic club in Tempe that year like that.

1653
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:46,470
All of those columns, you know,
I'll get them out and let them,

1654
01:32:46,471 --> 01:32:49,630
and you're friends with the guy that
said that all women wearing funny,

1655
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,630
once he got fired,
you'll let them a juice got lost.

1656
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:54,860
That's the only reason why he would
go to New York and go to Letterman.

1657
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:59,440
It's amazing the self-importance they had
armed themselves and at the end of the

1658
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,400
day they were worth nothing.

1659
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:05,050
And what they don't know about comics
is that 90% of comics a fucking horse,

1660
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:09,070
they have zero loyalty. So once those
motherfuckers are gone, they're gone.

1661
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:12,220
Like they tried to call people and
say, hey, how you doing comics?

1662
01:33:12,221 --> 01:33:15,160
Just hang up on them. We have
nothing to get from, you know, more.

1663
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,270
We had nothing in common with you.
I've spoken to 20 club on this,

1664
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:22,550
that the God that I've said that Jesus
had called, tried to call it pilot.

1665
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:24,580
He never returned my call.
You got nothing for him.

1666
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:29,710
Well putting together this a one
night yeah. From Pete to to to him to,

1667
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:34,000
to, to, to uh, Mark Babbitt
or the guy in Phoenix call me.

1668
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,390
I've reached out to 20 comics. Not one
of them a hot, but you don't have a club.

1669
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:39,460
No more guy.
I'll be only more than that.

1670
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:42,670
Calls you back cause I feel bad for
you because you were very good to me.

1671
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:46,180
You know Sarah and I was
the biggest con ever.

1672
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:50,890
She bought Chinese check that
work for the Improv guys.

1673
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:54,070
You don't know what the word
coach was the Saturday night.

1674
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:59,470
She was an Asian chick that book Cleveland
and Buffalo in the 90s and she would

1675
01:33:59,471 --> 01:34:02,560
abuse you.
She would abuse you.

1676
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:06,910
Like if I ever see and now I will give
you better call domestic violence cause I

1677
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:09,670
will smack her in the
mouth. Whoa. Threatening.

1678
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:12,520
You know what a lot of threatened people
on the Internet. Fuck, this is terrorism.

1679
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:16,630
This is against the Patriot. She would
book Miami, Buffalo and Cleveland.

1680
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:19,750
And what she used to do to comics
was fucking rude statements.

1681
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:23,200
You hear the opinions of Joey Diaz and
Joey Diaz and it's my opinion and my

1682
01:34:23,201 --> 01:34:26,100
fucking heart mine. That's Zack. You know,

1683
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:29,110
these people actually picked up this
thing like they were important and they

1684
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:31,560
were no more important than
talent. Well I guess, yeah.

1685
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,650
Well I got to tell you though,
the, the, the, the Co argument,

1686
01:34:35,651 --> 01:34:39,010
the counter argument to that, is it Mark
Babbitt? I think it's crazy as he was,

1687
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,190
was responsible for creating a
scene, like a creative scene. No,

1688
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:44,920
I ain't mad with you.
They had a god Damn Open Mike Night,

1689
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:48,640
that laugh stop that was
packed. I remember it would
start at like eight o'clock.

1690
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:49,040
We'd go once,

1691
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,180
it was a lot of warning and next door
and they would be doing another show.

1692
01:34:52,181 --> 01:34:55,150
So they'd have a show in the main room,
which was a perfectly shaped,

1693
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:57,130
perfectly sized room that laugh.

1694
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,860
Stop in river oaks is one of
the greatest clubs of all time.

1695
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:02,090
And that fucking maniac ran it.
And yeah,

1696
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:07,091
apparently there was some inconsistencies
with the books and there was all sorts

1697
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:09,680
of issues according to blow owners.
Yeah.

1698
01:35:09,681 --> 01:35:13,760
There was a lot of [inaudible] off the
back of bill con shit that he had the

1699
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:17,090
basement that I have no knowledge of,
but it was fun.

1700
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,250
I had, he broke my book.
Mark Babbitt was one of the,

1701
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,720
let me just tell you
the mark Babbitt story.

1702
01:35:23,721 --> 01:35:27,140
Mark Babbitt went to Freddy Soto and said,
I'm looking for free tracks.

1703
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,870
So Freddy came up to me at the comedy
store one day. He goes, hey man,

1704
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,880
mark Babbitt looking for free try. I send
them a tape. I refuse to send the tape,

1705
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,900
especially if I'm at the motherfucking
copy store. Okay. I'm glad you said that.

1706
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:42,290
You know fucking the tape. Why is
that? I got busy shores comedy store.

1707
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,140
You want to tape you take a ride up here.
You want,

1708
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:48,980
I'll send you a copy of the 10 45 spots
I get. I ain't sending you no tape.

1709
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,740
I just, I've never said
don't be a tape. I refused.

1710
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,730
Especially people from La that
were calling me up. Again,

1711
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:57,800
we're putting together a TV show. We get
to tape, uh, loving 50th Acom and stuff.

1712
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:01,600
No, really? Yeah. I don't fucking
send the tapes. Mark Babbitt.

1713
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:04,970
I sent him a blank tape.
Okay.

1714
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,510
I sent that jerk off finally because
the manager I had Kevin Phillips,

1715
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,090
he kept calling me and saying, that guy
come from Houston, keeps calling you.

1716
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,890
He wants you to send them a blank tape.

1717
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,990
I fucking didn't send
them a tape for a year.

1718
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:16,910
Finally went that went to fucking Ralph's.

1719
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:20,440
Bought a tape but an envelope and sent.
But Joey d standard was done a tape,

1720
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:23,540
you know that motherfucker Columbia
week later and say love my tape.

1721
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:26,060
And he hired me as a feature
at the upper for Bobby slate.

1722
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,410
So fuck all you mother fuckers.
That whole tape thing is a power booth.

1723
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:33,170
When you go to a comedy club and
you go to his office to get paid.

1724
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:36,020
He's got a TV and he's got a
thousand tapes with does not them.

1725
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:40,040
You don't watch those fucking things.
That's his fucking power move. Okay, Sam,

1726
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:44,540
be a tape. I sent them the fucking
tape. So the first time he booked me,

1727
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:47,240
he asks, I called him, he goes, I
don't have a feature spot for you,

1728
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:50,330
but I have an embassy spot. I'm
gonna pay you 300 bucks, bitch.

1729
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:54,440
The plane tickets to weighty at
that time was two 20 or something.

1730
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:57,560
So I took the week, but I was
always looking for a better week.

1731
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,840
And I got a guy in Toronto, the paint
me like 800 for a feature week, uh,

1732
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,740
uh, Bollywood, whatever the fuck it was
called up there. So I did two weeks.

1733
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:09,030
So I call it bad, but like a man,
I told him that you think are bad,

1734
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,970
but I got a week up in Toronto.

1735
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:15,440
I got two weeks for 800 fuck you and
your $300 super bowl week with David.

1736
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,430
Tell him to fuck trying to pet me
off, but you know, and he goes, okay.

1737
01:37:19,431 --> 01:37:22,850
And about a month later I heard he's
never going to hire you again. You can't,

1738
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,120
I don't give a fuck. He told me, he told
people I wasn't going to work again,

1739
01:37:26,121 --> 01:37:30,010
all this shit and I fucking called him
up. Bro. I fucked can call them up.

1740
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,310
And I said,
so that's what you're doing.

1741
01:37:31,311 --> 01:37:33,260
You mean to tell me that
you're not going to fuck. Fuck.

1742
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,630
You called me back a week later
they gave me through gigs,

1743
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:39,620
opening up a port with a biggest field
and then this is that. We were cool,

1744
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:44,050
but I sent them a blank thing that's
heavily, he said, I'm a blend.

1745
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:48,530
And then he called me. I loved
it. It was amazing. Joey DNA has,

1746
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:52,010
and I did a free show there once
and he lost his fucking mind.

1747
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,350
Then we decided it was,
I came down,

1748
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:58,860
it was when my first CD I
recorded a CD in Houston. We,

1749
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:02,490
Pete from Houston. That's how fucking
cool is that. You must be listening.

1750
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:06,060
I don't know. Maybe. So they called him.
Yeah, I bet. I bet that's good. Pete.

1751
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:11,570
Pete was the owner's son and the they all
day they found out some discrepancies.

1752
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,160
Babbit came in the middle of the night.
I left with everything.

1753
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:16,690
See Babbitt was uh, do with, uh,

1754
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:19,590
Carlos Garcia concert
with the lap stops money.

1755
01:38:19,591 --> 01:38:23,340
Then he will put the check back in
on Monday morning. So nobody knew.

1756
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,590
This is an old fucking trick,
but when I was a kid,

1757
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:30,330
I knew a guy that worked at a bank that
would give you cash 30 grand on a Friday.

1758
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:33,960
You better have that cash back by Monday
at 9:00 AM or some people are going to

1759
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:36,270
come knock you the fuck out.
But he did have the bank pro,

1760
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:41,310
so we take the money out and
give him like $35 40 kilos days.

1761
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,500
I'm going to give you 30 grand for a kilo,

1762
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:47,010
but you better be back here Monday with
my 45 so he pulled out of the bank,

1763
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:50,250
phone it right out of the fucking bank.
I should give it right back to you.

1764
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:54,900
Back to what? My Monday. I was
friends with that guy for years.

1765
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:58,370
I met him my sophomore year. I was
mailing something and something fell out.

1766
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,650
I was working at a lumber yard and never
below fell down and when I went to pick

1767
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:05,490
it up or do you ever going to go? I
didn't say nothing. I ripped that,

1768
01:39:05,491 --> 01:39:06,980
put it in my pocket.
That night I went home.

1769
01:39:06,981 --> 01:39:08,670
There was two credit cards in two checks,

1770
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:13,680
one for like 20 or one for like 18 and
I was going to use the credit cards.

1771
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,720
I was a young kid.
My mom had just died.

1772
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:19,340
I didn't know what the fuck to do and I
went through a buddy of mine who I knew

1773
01:39:19,341 --> 01:39:22,770
his brother was a little fucked up and
he knew those people and I said, Doug,

1774
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:26,580
I these two checks, one for 18 months
or 22 he wrote his brother's number.

1775
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:29,880
You just called my brother, he'll take
care of it for him. He called a brother,

1776
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:30,541
brother met me,

1777
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:33,970
the brother had to be like 20 he came
with like three other fucking my field

1778
01:39:33,971 --> 01:39:35,340
seats and they go,
what do you want from this?

1779
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:38,430
Like well I want one of the tracks and
you keep the level cause you'll have your

1780
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:39,470
cash tomorrow,
Doug.

1781
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:43,490
Those motherfuckers came be
20 grand is a backup below.

1782
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,760
When I was 16 years old the week John
Lennon got shot. Don't you think though,

1783
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:52,761
like we think about like how many guys
that benefited from having Babbitt run

1784
01:39:53,371 --> 01:39:56,390
that club or it was a great clubs that,

1785
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:01,860
I'm just saying that I'm not
talking about the job they did.

1786
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,430
I was talking to how most people ran
around and thinking they were the end all

1787
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:09,570
bill. Like there's a lot of club owners
that they get to a point that they get so

1788
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:13,010
cocky, they're like, oh, I'll call him
Hollywood. You'll never work again.

1789
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,090
And people really trip.
You know when,

1790
01:40:15,091 --> 01:40:17,760
when I first started in this
business as a guy, that's the Holly,

1791
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:19,290
the drummer from buddy Holly,

1792
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,160
he books in Texas and
he's a real coach bag.

1793
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,170
What he does is he calls and he goes,

1794
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:28,380
I'm going to pay your two 50 at
night from Tuesday to Saturday.

1795
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:33,150
And then once the Gig we comes
up, we only have Saturday. Wow.

1796
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:38,310
Why can't drive from Boston to fucking
New Orleans for fucking Saturday night?

1797
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:42,630
No. You know, I'm not doing it.
So I was working with the guy,

1798
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:46,230
I had a great relationship with the guy
and when I moved to Seattle and he gave

1799
01:40:46,231 --> 01:40:46,790
me this weekend,

1800
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:49,920
New Mexico and I wanted to go down and
had great clubs in New Mexico at the time.

1801
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:50,740
Sure enough,

1802
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:54,010
the motherfucking calls me cause there's
only one night and Saturday night I go

1803
01:40:54,011 --> 01:40:57,370
dog, I'm live in Seattle now. I could've
gotten on there for the other money,

1804
01:40:57,371 --> 01:41:01,690
but I can't go for one day
this motherfucking Toby. If
you fucking cancel on me,

1805
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:05,050
you'll never work and Improv,
you'll never work for nobody.

1806
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,420
I waited until the night of the GIG

1807
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,220
and I call this motherfuck
at a quarter to eight.

1808
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:15,490
He kept calling me page or are
you and I kept calling them back.

1809
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:20,320
I'm 30 miles and miles
south at about correlate.

1810
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:22,990
I call this motherfuck. I said,
don't you ever threaten me again?

1811
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:27,520
It looks like your mothers had line in
that motherfucker hung up the phone.

1812
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:31,360
What? You ever threatened me
again? You thought mother Fucker,

1813
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:36,420
your mother's son. A couple years
later I go to Houston. It's that one.

1814
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,970
There's some guy you're looking for
somebody to go to Mississippi the morning

1815
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:44,800
and I feel like 300 bucks and I go out
and do it and they told me the guy, God,

1816
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:47,360
that's the guy I beat.
Well he forgot called him by now.

1817
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:53,350
What did he say?
Equals your name sounds familiar,

1818
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,550
but I haven't line up at the store.
I'd done movies.

1819
01:41:57,551 --> 01:42:00,550
Just give it a Gig for three
bills. He goes, oh, your
name is Sasha. Really Kwame.

1820
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,400
Tomorrow. The next day I called
him because I remember you.

1821
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,180
You're the guy that called me
eight told me to protect my mother,

1822
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:11,470
that headline and he still
didn't take any gig. Fuck though.

1823
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:16,000
He wouldn't give it to him.
That's the shit that bothered me.

1824
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:19,120
That's my thing, that
we're young, we're stupid.

1825
01:42:19,121 --> 01:42:21,880
We're naive and we believe in
those people take advantage of us.

1826
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:25,120
It's like anybody else taking advantage.
He Babbitt was a great guy,

1827
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:28,510
but the reason why the Houston comedy
scene the way it is because bad fuck with

1828
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:32,170
those kids had at some point he had
them like, bitches don't look at me.

1829
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,080
Don't make eye contact the fucking floor.

1830
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,440
Look at the kid that bonded the comedy
store. He never did call me again.

1831
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:40,980
Babbitt had them telling them,
you are going to be bigger than Carlos.

1832
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:42,910
You're going to be bigger than this guy.
You know I mean bigger than this,

1833
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:47,460
you know the next Bill Hicks, you know,
but he did have bad tastes. He had,

1834
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:50,020
he had some bank.
You would tell you a guy,

1835
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:53,410
I want this guy to open for you and
you'd go, what are you talking about?

1836
01:42:53,411 --> 01:42:54,910
Like what are you fucking crazy,

1837
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,400
I'm not going to have people
pay to hear that guy talk.

1838
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,450
Like you would have guys that were, they
had nothing, there was nothing there.

1839
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,860
It's one guy who would just
memorize these like fake rants.

1840
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,620
It was like this long for,
he'd be like,

1841
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:12,700
have these big deep breaths in between
the rants and just ramp this thing out.

1842
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,540
Like all these stats and numbers
and we'd say all this shit.

1843
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,480
And it was because he had memorized
at all that. It was so impressive.

1844
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:24,280
But there was no funny in it. There was
no comedy in. It was a trick. It was like,

1845
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,790
he memorized all this
stuff and it's crazy brand.

1846
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,690
We'll send it and then everybody
go, oh, that was great.

1847
01:43:28,691 --> 01:43:32,380
He did that thing and that was
his whole act was these rants.

1848
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,340
But they weren't like,

1849
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:38,430
it wasn't like a rant where he had a
point where it made like a bill burr rap.

1850
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,640
Like you know where it's a rant,

1851
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:44,140
but there's all these jokes in it pointing
shit out and you're laughing and no,

1852
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:47,350
there was nothing until the end and
the end you would clap. He was, well,

1853
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,010
he was one of the beginnings
of alternative comedy.
Like people go see him.

1854
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,100
My God, that's such a
brilliant, you know, because we,

1855
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:55,790
Jesus Jones wrote that song
and you're like, Jesus,

1856
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:57,580
fuck the fuck you talking about.

1857
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:00,190
He faded away and he cracked
it became a bartender.

1858
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,230
There was something and that's
what, you know, a couple my,

1859
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:08,380
my breakthrough in my life really came
when I did analyze that and I met that

1860
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:11,510
the rector,
when I met that dude,

1861
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:14,240
that was that they told him to go
fuck himself on saying that alive.

1862
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:18,470
But dude is that Harold Ramis
here now really changed my life.

1863
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:22,550
That only two hour. I had a great talk
with him about comedy and he goes,

1864
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:26,270
I watched your tape. Why don't you go
to Montreal? And I, oh wait a minute.

1865
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:29,540
You had a tape. I had to stand up tape
at the time. You have a tape to him.

1866
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:33,530
Fuck yeah. That's how Reagan to stay.
That's how rapists I put together.

1867
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:37,370
I can go fucking. So at that time
I went to, I went to see this,

1868
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:38,690
get to know the rules,
don't know.

1869
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:42,500
I went to see this lady
for a movie and she goes,

1870
01:44:42,501 --> 01:44:44,580
you're not perfect for this movie,
but my next movie,

1871
01:44:44,581 --> 01:44:46,700
you going to be good for her. She goes,
I want you to keep in touch with me.

1872
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,450
And it was hell.
And with that bitch is bad.

1873
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,090
Like that bitch just
hangs out with Deniro.

1874
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:55,100
She was just doing it because she
didn't, Bronx County, she did Bronx tale,

1875
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:59,840
those types of movies and she really took
a liking to me. So she would tell me,

1876
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:03,230
sent me everything you got.
I want to push you for this morning,

1877
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:07,200
but I need you to send me what you got.
So I only had at that time,

1878
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:11,300
they only had the mezzos. I had that
gay mafia thing. That's all I had.

1879
01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:12,680
So I put standup on it.

1880
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:16,330
I had a really good set somewhere and
sent it to him and I have about how rape

1881
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:20,420
is pulling me over and he goes, your
natural, these pricks I see in Montreal.

1882
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:22,910
I ain't got Dick on you. I
mean, this guy said, shit,

1883
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:24,420
this is how fucking my hammock.

1884
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:26,420
And he's the one that look
me the eye and he goes,

1885
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:30,430
don't take shit from these books either
because they're all a bunch of clothes.

1886
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:33,620
Oh my God. He was like, don't
take shit from these books,

1887
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:36,620
the next shift from build these
bushes because once you take it,

1888
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:41,330
it's like the blends Clemenza told
Michael if they should've stopped Hitler

1889
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:43,010
imulitic Munich once you take this shit.

1890
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:47,720
And I remember I shot that
movie in like September. And uh,

1891
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:50,390
that October I did that.
No.

1892
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:55,370
That December Pete from the goodness of
his heart used to headline me in Houston,

1893
01:45:55,371 --> 01:45:57,500
the first guy to ever headline me.
It was Pete and Houston.

1894
01:45:57,501 --> 01:46:00,340
That's why he still calls me and
I give him the respect as a man.

1895
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:03,460
I still call him the fact
nobody else feels feature me.

1896
01:46:03,461 --> 01:46:05,690
He was headlining and he's like,
you're a bad motherfucker.

1897
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,190
He saw me with Pablo and
Houston and he's like,

1898
01:46:08,191 --> 01:46:11,240
I bet the headline just so he wouldn't
headline being Christmas for two weeks

1899
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:15,740
and pay me job before anybody paid me and
I went down there. Did blow went crazy,

1900
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,120
but that wasn't the point.

1901
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:24,100
The point blow. I went crazy. Oh, I
used to go crazy and not for nothing.

1902
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:28,400
I just watched my episode of Coke case
after two weeks in Houston I was like 400

1903
01:46:28,401 --> 01:46:29,234
pounds.

1904
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:34,370
My neck was swollen from the sodium and
the fuck and I not so tall and Khloe

1905
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:38,500
line and the cocaine. My back was
swollen. I would go to Houston,

1906
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:42,050
just eat that barbecue everything and do
blow every night and drink shot to yoga.

1907
01:46:42,051 --> 01:46:44,480
My style. You know what
happened in state. It is awesome

1908
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,620
spot burritos from Houston, your point,

1909
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:53,400
some fucking pounds on it and I haven't
been coming back with Dan and I got a

1910
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:58,401
call from a guy at at the Improv and
this guy is pretty cool guy to an extent.

1911
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,950
He goes, hey man, you know
this is a true story Joe.

1912
01:47:02,951 --> 01:47:07,950
This is like January 6th of 2003
and I had just done the allies that,

1913
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,520
and this is the first time I was in a
test with Harold rape has said to me,

1914
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:12,811
he goes,

1915
01:47:12,811 --> 01:47:15,750
both things shift from though these
company guys and tell them all to go fuck

1916
01:47:15,751 --> 01:47:19,230
themselves. You're a funny
guy. Don't ever look back. Go.

1917
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:24,550
And I got a call from one of the heads
of the Improv and he goes, hey man, uh,

1918
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:27,840
we just got a call that we
have a club in Houston but you,

1919
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,540
you're working in the other
club. And I said, yeah,

1920
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:32,770
that's what they were trying to make.
Bean will not work that use.

1921
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,050
This is early on.

1922
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:39,120
This is 2003 before anything and it
was driving on Melrose and he goes,

1923
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:42,000
you know, it's not right that you do
that. We've always taken care of you.

1924
01:47:42,001 --> 01:47:44,210
And I go and I snapped Joan.
I go,

1925
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:47,220
taking care of me were in Miami
for six 50 a fucking week.

1926
01:47:47,221 --> 01:47:50,850
I do 13 shows and I outsell the
fucking headline because I'm Cuban.

1927
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,090
How the fuck do you take cab? He
wasn't, you take care of me. I go,

1928
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:56,430
look at your fucking schedule
right now for the next six months,

1929
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:00,600
go look at Irvine and my in Irvine and
[inaudible] Ontario and my fucking Breyer.

1930
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:05,520
No, no, no, you give it to all your boys.
So don't say you fucking take care of me.

1931
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:07,380
And he goes, well, you don't understand.

1932
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:10,500
All you have to do is ask when I'm
fucking asking, open your book right now.

1933
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:14,520
Oh I can't. I have to know right now
your pocket book. And they're like, no.

1934
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:16,860
And I go listen to
conversation to fucking over.

1935
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:18,720
Well that's anti competitive practices.

1936
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:22,230
I go to the competition and I go to the
conversation's over and he goes, no,

1937
01:48:22,231 --> 01:48:24,550
it's not because you just
won't work any of our Improv,

1938
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:28,230
and I could say that again
to me. I go, say that again.
I'm going to go down there.

1939
01:48:28,231 --> 01:48:31,800
I'm going to bang your head off that
fucking desk. Joe Rogan just like that.

1940
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,040
I wasn't one of those
cocaine morning moves.

1941
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:39,450
He called me at like 10 15 a bad time to
catch me in those cocaine days because

1942
01:48:39,451 --> 01:48:42,550
I was probably broke and thinking of
where am I going to get my next fix, rob,

1943
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,531
and you're calling me,

1944
01:48:43,531 --> 01:48:47,240
threatening me at 10 15 in the morning
telling me I can't work Euston when you

1945
01:48:47,241 --> 01:48:50,400
don't do to me, and I said,
say another word. I'm three.

1946
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:53,280
I'm three blocks from your office.
I'm going to go.

1947
01:48:53,281 --> 01:48:55,440
Then I'm going to bang your
head off. You know? No, I said,

1948
01:48:55,441 --> 01:48:57,240
you're going to say something.
I'm going to say something.

1949
01:48:57,241 --> 01:48:58,051
You're going to say something.

1950
01:48:58,051 --> 01:49:00,480
I'm going to say something that
I'm three blocks from your office.

1951
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:02,680
I'm going to go down the back of
your head off your fucking best.

1952
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:06,990
And the girl got her to hang up and
I went home. That ain't call nobody.

1953
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:08,370
I thought I was done at the Improv.

1954
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:12,300
And do you know that two days later I
got a motherfucking car with three weeks

1955
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,450
from the Improv as a feature
spot in southern California.

1956
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:19,070
So sometimes you've got to put your foot
down with these creepy motherfuckers

1957
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,650
dog because they get a pile up to an la.

1958
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,500
Nothing happens to you until
they see you on television.

1959
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:28,860
They treat you like shit once
they see you in a commercial,

1960
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:33,360
now they know. You know what? You
may not be that mother Fucker,

1961
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:37,260
but you might become that motherfucker.
So they don't give you everything.

1962
01:49:37,261 --> 01:49:41,460
They still break your balls, but they
don't. Now they know that you're real.

1963
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:44,910
This mother fucker could strike.
That's the most important thing with me,

1964
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:48,100
that every year I keep throwing
jabs at him so I could cope all

1965
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,400
the shit they won't. But I'm still
alive, mother Fucker, you following me?

1966
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:54,700
So he can say all this shit. They why
behind it. Yeah, but I'm still here.

1967
01:49:54,701 --> 01:49:57,610
What the fuck have you done when a company
has too many rooms like that and they

1968
01:49:57,611 --> 01:50:01,510
want to big of a piece of the pie and
then they want you to stop doing the other

1969
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:03,730
rooms that are in town that
you've had a relationship forever,

1970
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,160
whether it's Atlanta or Denver,
Denver.

1971
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:10,030
They had a big issue in Denver
where you know when you go there,

1972
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:12,190
Wendy will tell you the whole
fucking story about it. She,

1973
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:16,240
she had this meeting with people that
were going to open up another club in town

1974
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:18,100
and they wanted to tell her they were,
you know,

1975
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:20,170
they're going to either
go into business with her,

1976
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:23,140
allow her to buy in or you know, they're
basically going to run out of town.

1977
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:24,730
She was like, oh yeah,
good luck with that.

1978
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,250
What are you guys going to
do for open Mike Nights?

1979
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:27,880
One of the things she
asked him and they said,

1980
01:50:27,881 --> 01:50:29,590
we're not going to have an
open mic night. She goes, okay,

1981
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:33,190
so let me get this straight. You
sell. It's like if you sold widgets,

1982
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,730
why wouldn't you make widgets? You gotta
get your widgets from somewhere else,

1983
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:38,110
like why don't you make your own widgets?

1984
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:41,640
Like you're not going to develop
any widgets and they like you.

1985
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:45,010
They're not thinking in
terms of like long term,

1986
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:49,390
especially like someone like Wendy's.
The best case example, Wendy,

1987
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:54,280
my opinion is the reason why there's a
Denver comedy scene like her supporting

1988
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:57,130
those two clubs, the comedy works, which
two of the best clubs in the country,

1989
01:50:57,131 --> 01:51:00,730
she's a reason why there's a scene in
Denver, but she's the best case scenario.

1990
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:04,270
She's a cool person. She loves comedy.
She's fun to be around. She does it right,

1991
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:07,450
but then you got like a
Babbitt that you've got to
deal with his shit or you got

1992
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,060
Tom, you got to deal with his shit
when I didn't have to deal with it,

1993
01:51:10,061 --> 01:51:12,550
but you had to deal with it. You
know, and these, these people,

1994
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:15,820
they're responsible for the fucking scene.
There are a big part of the scene.

1995
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:18,580
Babbitt was responsible for the scene.
It's obvious once he,

1996
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:23,050
once he left the scene went away. He
was a, he was a key cog in that wheel,

1997
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:27,220
you know. And when you got a person
like Wendy or a person like Babbitt,

1998
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:29,950
that's like a big player
in the whole scene.

1999
01:51:29,951 --> 01:51:33,700
Like there are so important
because otherwise all you
have is la in New York and

2000
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,730
Chicago barely has a scene.
What's the Chicago scene like?

2001
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:40,030
Chicago's record ripping the rocket. Is
it ripping a rock and milk yet? Where?

2002
01:51:40,031 --> 01:51:43,720
Which club?
You got the xannies which is downtown.

2003
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:48,130
They have an open mic night. I don't know.
But the laugh factory is doing great.

2004
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:51,550
Brilliant boy. My buddy, his fucking
kicking ass went with as the manager,

2005
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:55,620
they have it open. Are
they developing dog? He is.

2006
01:51:55,650 --> 01:51:58,530
He sells out on Friday and Saturday
with no headline. No, Emma.

2007
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:02,110
That's how good Brian Boards go with
after Brian Boyd walked into that laugh

2008
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:06,290
factors that would it be a county manager?
It Jay was saw the said, well buddy,

2009
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:07,930
who is your favorite comedians?
He said,

2010
01:52:07,931 --> 01:52:11,830
Joey Diaz and every motherfucking shit
for you. He said the guy turned pale.

2011
01:52:12,130 --> 01:52:15,700
He hired them and the dude's over
there rip it that fucking place apart.

2012
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:19,510
So who does he have local guys helping
you guys? Oh, so he's got a local scene,

2013
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,440
but xannies his gray that
wanted rich or the other ones.

2014
01:52:23,441 --> 01:52:25,960
And Sandy's has three of them.
Yeah, there's, there's um,

2015
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:29,790
what's the one that's just outside the
airport is tremendous. That's true, man.

2016
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:31,840
I've done the other one that's
just outside. What does it,

2017
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:34,990
what does that all that
I would shoot a special,

2018
01:52:34,991 --> 01:52:38,140
then I went off and so who was doing
the open mic nights stuff? This,

2019
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:41,250
the [inaudible]. There's a couple
of clubs now. There's a couple of,

2020
01:52:41,251 --> 01:52:42,940
there's one other club in Chicago.

2021
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,300
The laugh factory is doing a
lot of open CISM a commies.

2022
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:49,700
You know a lot of places now. You'd be
surprised. You don't might get what?

2023
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:54,560
A club in Miami he did Miami, Huh?
Yeah. Does he live down there?

2024
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,080
I'd go, no. I don't know the
particulars. I just heard that.

2025
01:52:57,081 --> 01:52:58,700
But there's a lot of comedy going on.

2026
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:02,600
Do you think you would ever
want to own a club? Yeah.

2027
01:53:02,601 --> 01:53:05,270
Seems like it would be
a huge fucking headache.

2028
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:08,990
It would be a huge headache
depending on how you did it.

2029
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,300
I think that the clubs
that are opening now,

2030
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:16,301
a huge headaches because
a couple of weeks,

2031
01:53:16,830 --> 01:53:20,280
a couple of years ago, I was in the
mood for dairy going, I called Terry,

2032
01:53:20,281 --> 01:53:22,500
there's no fucking dairy queen. He's,
we're going all the way to North Ridge,

2033
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:24,840
one of the North Ridge.
I did very quick taste of like deck.

2034
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:31,010
The reason why is because these had these
fucking people that never grew up on a

2035
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:33,990
dairy queen.
They bought it as an investment.

2036
01:53:33,991 --> 01:53:37,380
They mixed it with Orange Julius and
they don't know that they're from another

2037
01:53:37,381 --> 01:53:40,590
country and they went to somebody and
they thought that was the best thing.

2038
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:44,370
When you go, when I go to the
dairy queen and Tennessee,

2039
01:53:44,410 --> 01:53:47,240
that motherfucker is only there
for 41 years. When you go in there,

2040
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:48,900
you could tell he knows his ice cream.

2041
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:52,710
Same thing with some of these
comedy clubs now for some people,

2042
01:53:52,711 --> 01:53:56,250
their investments and they come and go.
It's the people really love comedy.

2043
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:59,790
And I will tell you one
thing when he was there,

2044
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:03,310
when I walked into that
club in 1991 January,

2045
01:54:03,690 --> 01:54:07,340
June 18th, 1991 when I walked into
that club Comedy Club One d was that,

2046
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:08,700
I'm a tell you something else.

2047
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:13,850
When he was doing things at that club
24 years ago and nobody else was doing,

2048
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:19,140
she was putting motherfuckers like Bobby
Collins on a Tuesday and Wednesday.

2049
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:22,380
Nobody was doing that and then having a
different headline and come in Wednesday

2050
01:54:22,381 --> 01:54:25,800
and Thursday then have a different
headline and come in Friday and Saturday.

2051
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:30,450
Don't tell me, cause I was there when
the is really good at what she does.

2052
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:35,520
What the is one of the top three comedy
people in this country when you could

2053
01:54:35,521 --> 01:54:40,110
make a call and shut your fucking lights
out if she really wants to win the

2054
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:44,200
deals where everybody, everybody likes
when the, when the loves comedy, when,

2055
01:54:44,201 --> 01:54:47,610
when the dreams at night she
dreams of an orgy. There's a car,

2056
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:52,410
there's a comedy guy on TV stand
up while she's getting fucked

2057
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,210
when the doors,
I respect when the,

2058
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,080
I never had a problem when they,

2059
01:55:00,081 --> 01:55:02,800
when they asked me to leave and I
wasn't mad that it was business.

2060
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:07,120
It wasn't my comedy or wasn't that she
hated me. It was something that happened.

2061
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:09,730
She's a real, I've never, I never used,

2062
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:13,390
when I'm talking about
50% of these people,

2063
01:55:13,391 --> 01:55:18,391
people that they actually become the
end all be all in Cami and we're scared

2064
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,000
them and they fuck with us.
They fuck with you Joe.

2065
01:55:22,030 --> 01:55:23,470
They fuck with you in a lot of levels.

2066
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:28,030
But do you imagine what it would be like
to fucking deal with comedians? I mean,

2067
01:55:28,031 --> 01:55:31,510
they developed this. It's like if
you deal like if you're a woman,

2068
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:35,020
Okay and you're walking down the street
and everywhere you go man are fucking

2069
01:55:35,021 --> 01:55:38,500
cat call and yell and yelling shit at
you and freaking you out and you run into

2070
01:55:38,501 --> 01:55:42,040
a guy in an elevator, you're automatically
going to be like, what? You know?

2071
01:55:42,041 --> 01:55:45,000
You're automatically going be
like Jesus Christ. Another guy.

2072
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:47,070
Like I'm tired of getting hit on by guys.

2073
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:51,090
If you're a fucking owner of a comedy
club and you're dealing with Wacko

2074
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:53,860
comedians all day long,
constantly.

2075
01:55:53,860 --> 01:55:57,390
We think about all the people that we
know that are fucking crazy, crazy,

2076
01:55:57,391 --> 01:56:00,060
crazy people that we've dealt
with over the years at the store.

2077
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:04,740
I look at areas where the
craziest bunch of the world,

2078
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:06,390
but there's a certain way to deal with,

2079
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:10,560
they used to be a guy in San Francisco
at the punchline that you catch or

2080
01:56:10,561 --> 01:56:14,220
whatever his fucking name was another
country that you go up there and there was

2081
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:15,054
no list.

2082
01:56:15,150 --> 01:56:18,720
He pointed you to tell you he was next
and you had to sit there and like an ugly

2083
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:23,070
girl at the prom and hope that he would
put ya and after there was 50 people at

2084
01:56:23,071 --> 01:56:25,380
the end of the night,
he got everybody gone see you next week.

2085
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:28,930
It was like the waterfront. When those
people went, they would get called on you.

2086
01:56:28,931 --> 01:56:32,070
You Ain't getting jobs right the
morning. You're working, you're working,

2087
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,870
you're working,
the rest of you go home.

2088
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,910
He did it in a way that make you feel bad.

2089
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:39,030
God Sawyer did the same thing
that the people are cops.

2090
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:40,530
They used to do an open Mike on Mondays.

2091
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:43,170
I heard people used to call
them club owners would go,

2092
01:56:43,171 --> 01:56:45,030
I'm sending Joe Rogan
enough data to do it. Okay.

2093
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:47,310
And then he'd come up think I
don't have a spot for you bitch.

2094
01:56:47,311 --> 01:56:49,120
I came all the way up to
San Francisco and I'm a,

2095
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:51,780
and I'm saying that
was the douchey things.

2096
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,860
Well how about Jamie and makes people
waiting in front of the laugh factory that

2097
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:59,900
makes them sign up in the morning
and wait all day in the sun in La,

2098
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:04,620
it's a hundred fucking degrees outside
and there's a line around the side of the

2099
01:57:04,621 --> 01:57:08,450
building and people waiting to go on stage
for three minutes and that's actually

2100
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,260
waiting in line to go next week.

2101
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:14,190
You don't need you and you have to wait
in that whole entire line just to sign

2102
01:57:14,191 --> 01:57:17,760
up for next week show where you have
to wait in line again so that it didn't

2103
01:57:17,761 --> 01:57:21,150
used to be like that. It used to
be the week of you can't do you a,

2104
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:24,540
you go someplace and they sign you up
and you come back and I say, listen,

2105
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:28,350
you get as many minutes as people you're
bringing, you're earning your keep.

2106
01:57:28,351 --> 01:57:31,670
That's one thing I rather know
where I stand and get fucked with.

2107
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,830
That's the leg I'm talking about.
Really? You need a tape of me.

2108
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:38,140
You just saw about the store.
What the fuck do you leave?

2109
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:42,750
If I'm good enough for Mitzi shore.
Why do you want to tape?

2110
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,520
Oh the fuck are you and your fucking
Shit town. Don't want to take from me.

2111
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:51,900
I'm not gonna fucking, I'm
fucking comedy. The comedy store.

2112
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:55,290
You caught me.
You want to tape go fuck yourself.

2113
01:57:55,410 --> 01:58:00,330
I'm not sending you a fucking day.
It's against my fucking, well,

2114
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:04,500
it's like these people now
and with movies and TV, Joey,

2115
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:06,030
they want you to do a coach store,

2116
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:09,450
but they want you to send the real
don't though sudden Shit Joey.

2117
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:13,920
But they know it's a Costar. They could
offer it to them and if they don't, fine,

2118
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:15,720
I'll do my podcasts and
I'll live another week.

2119
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,250
That's the mind and eventually will go,
this motherfucker isn't gonna.

2120
01:58:20,251 --> 01:58:22,350
We might as well give it to them.
I'm not doing it for that.

2121
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:24,750
You want me to fucking
be a guest star Rickard.

2122
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,950
You want to give me a series regular?

2123
01:58:25,951 --> 01:58:28,650
I'll give you a fucking paper and I'll
fucking come down and talk to you.

2124
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:32,490
But for a Costar, we've been doing
this. Look at the IMD. Be What?

2125
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:36,580
Fucking tape you.
You took aside.

2126
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:40,350
Let me see your fucking tape.
I see y'all fucking tape.

2127
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:42,010
How are you sending,
you

2128
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,790
know, fucking paid. Even then I
had my fucking pride. Even then,

2129
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:50,620
I wouldn't send the fucking paperwork
I refuse. I finally sent a blank tape.

2130
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:53,710
He gave me that anti. Never. I have
respect for none of them again,

2131
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:58,300
because I found that it was a power play.
It was like, you're on my court. Uh,

2132
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:01,330
you know, you want to give me some
respect? What? Respect? What do you do?

2133
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:04,630
You're a pimp. You take 20% of what
people come to the fucking door.

2134
01:59:04,631 --> 01:59:07,750
What the fuck to you? One of you don't.
You can't even play the fucking Ukulele.

2135
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:12,220
The fuck are you doing?
You can't put a fucking Ukulele.

2136
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:15,670
What the fuck have you done? That's
my, that's where I'm coming from.

2137
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:19,120
I didn't want them to sub club owners
are bad, but they did great jobs.

2138
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:22,270
It was the ship.
They bold that I didn't fucking like,

2139
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,440
I used to bring Joey on the road.

2140
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:25,980
Me like way back in the day we started
going on the road together. What,

2141
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:27,140
like the late nineties yet.

2142
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:30,190
We started going on the road together
and I would bring him to clubs and they

2143
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:33,520
would go, you know, I just don't think
your friend is a good fit for this club.

2144
01:59:33,521 --> 01:59:36,000
I mean it's uh, you know,
he's be like, what do you,

2145
01:59:36,001 --> 01:59:39,380
did you not hear the people laughing?
I go there. They're all laughing here.

2146
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,650
All those people laughing. Yeah.
It's just not our kind of comedy.

2147
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:45,310
Like what kind of comment is that? I go,
you don't like funny comedy. And like,

2148
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:47,800
I've had guys tell me
that he makes me look bad.

2149
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:50,980
This is like way back in the days before
people knew who he was and they were

2150
01:59:50,981 --> 01:59:51,581
like,
you know,

2151
01:59:51,581 --> 01:59:54,610
let's just say we just don't think he's
that good and it's just like not what we

2152
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:57,760
want for our club. And I'd be like, I'd
open the door and listen to that here.

2153
01:59:57,761 --> 02:00:01,450
Everybody laughing. What's that? You
know? And they didn't have these ideas,

2154
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:06,451
especially in the 90s they had ideas of
like what comedy was and there was a lot

2155
02:00:06,461 --> 02:00:09,820
of pressure to be clean.
There was a lot of,

2156
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:13,210
a lot more push now before the Internet,
once the Internet came along,

2157
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:17,170
slowly but surely, it sort of expanded
everybody's idea of what's acceptable.

2158
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,070
Like even things on television or salt,

2159
02:00:19,071 --> 02:00:22,240
like look at the fucking scene in the
walking dead. I don't want to tell you,

2160
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:23,083
spoiler alert,

2161
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,600
when they hit the people over the head
with a bass and they cut their throats,

2162
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:29,170
that was on fucking cable
television. It's not an HBO. I mean,

2163
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:31,870
and they showed it in the
most graphic way possible.

2164
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:35,770
I don't think people would have accepted
that before the Internet had come along.

2165
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:39,010
I don't think people accept that.
But now like our ideas,

2166
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:41,110
I like what you can say
and what you can't say.

2167
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:46,330
They're all so different and you can
get famous from the Internet and because

2168
02:00:46,331 --> 02:00:49,680
Joey's become famous from the
Internet, you know, I get to say like,

2169
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:53,140
see I fucking told you,
I told you you were wrong.

2170
02:00:53,141 --> 02:00:57,910
You had this idea that everybody had to
fit in your cookie cutter world and they

2171
02:00:57,911 --> 02:01:00,640
thought that I was like a sick fuck for
thinking that you were funny. I'm like,

2172
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,000
I'm not the only one. Like you're
not hearing the rest of the crowd,

2173
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:07,930
but until someone comes along and puts
you on a television show or puts you in a

2174
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:10,660
movie,
then they don't want to take that chance.

2175
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:13,960
They don't want to take the chance on
this wild man. You know it was you.

2176
02:01:13,961 --> 02:01:16,300
It was our Dunkin was the only one
that nobody ever complained about.

2177
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,910
Nobody ever complained about me taking
Dunkin. Someone there, you know, like,

2178
02:01:18,911 --> 02:01:23,140
cause he's, he's a good joke writer,
but he's also not, well he is now,

2179
02:01:23,141 --> 02:01:26,530
he's gotten much more offensive like
lately, over the last like three years.

2180
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:30,160
That's new joke he's got, again,
I don't want to spoiler alert it,

2181
02:01:30,161 --> 02:01:32,050
but he's got some great fucking jokes.

2182
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:36,280
But it was this idea that comedy couldn't,

2183
02:01:36,281 --> 02:01:40,040
it couldn't be like what goes on at
the store. It had to be like what they

2184
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:44,450
saw on MTV. It had to be what they
saw on comedy central, you know,

2185
02:01:44,451 --> 02:01:48,560
it had to be censored. Shit. Joe,
they saw what they want to see.

2186
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:51,770
I saw a fat little ugly Mexican
woman for years, kill it late.

2187
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,510
But Maryland Martinez.
Oh yeah.

2188
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:57,680
Then one day and the girl couldn't pay
her rent and then one day a girl by the

2189
02:01:57,681 --> 02:02:00,710
name of Lisa Lampanelli came around
with the same act on and she was a white

2190
02:02:00,711 --> 02:02:04,220
girl. She fucking killed him. They
went crazy over. Well, Lisa told me,

2191
02:02:04,221 --> 02:02:07,430
really good marketing. You don't
know what they're going to go for.

2192
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:09,770
What comes out of my mouth and what I,

2193
02:02:09,771 --> 02:02:13,670
I've seen people say worse than me
and they love them and they love them.

2194
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:14,360
You know?

2195
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:18,040
I remember going for a showcase for
two and a half men before the show even

2196
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:18,501
started.

2197
02:02:18,501 --> 02:02:21,110
You know that they were looking for
Comedians for side kicks at the laugh

2198
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:25,430
factory 10 years ago. We all went on a
Monday night. They're thinking about me.

2199
02:02:25,431 --> 02:02:28,160
That was, they really liked me, but
he's a little too dirty for our show.

2200
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:31,470
I never watched the show until about
five years ago when dad was in the hotel.

2201
02:02:31,471 --> 02:02:33,710
They put it up.
The whole show was about sex,

2202
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,700
was all about Charlie Sheen being a
purveyor apartment. That was like,

2203
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:41,070
so what were you, what was your
point that night? Embarrassing me.

2204
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:42,890
Taught me I was dirty
and it wasn't for you.

2205
02:02:42,891 --> 02:02:46,510
I think I always found
that you got chosen,

2206
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:50,900
picked on and little and
as an exam way magic club.

2207
02:02:50,901 --> 02:02:52,910
I remembered he thought
you were too dirty.

2208
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:58,040
Artery was allowed to go on after he
went to a gentleman because he told me to

2209
02:02:58,041 --> 02:03:00,470
my face,
that guy from the comedy magic club,

2210
02:03:00,471 --> 02:03:03,800
I give them the utmost respect because
he told me on a Saturday night after I

2211
02:03:03,801 --> 02:03:06,490
went there and bombed, he
pulled me aside and goes, Joey,

2212
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:10,150
I think this is the last time you
came down. You know, they just use,

2213
02:03:10,151 --> 02:03:13,140
you know what the fuck up and him
asking me and I'm not mad at that.

2214
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:17,000
He's got that Jane Lando crowd and he
told me to my face and that's all I want.

2215
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:18,260
Oh Dog,

2216
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:22,550
Joe Rogan and I know that you I been
fucked with a little bit and that's why I

2217
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:24,140
am as defensive as I am.

2218
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,600
I don't have time for these people
and I didn't have time for them.

2219
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:31,040
Once I made up my mind that I was working
hard and that I was doing the right

2220
02:03:31,041 --> 02:03:33,770
thing, I didn't let people influence. I
didn't want to go to Montreal no more.

2221
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:37,010
They can't then a whole lot since
2004 I haven't wanted to do nothing.

2222
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,900
I don't want to be, they were a part of,
you don't see me. I don't bother nobody.

2223
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:44,290
Him In my own circle. Nobody sees me. I
go to the store, I'm not a part of the,

2224
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:47,480
I don't want that. They don't want
me and I don't want to include,

2225
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:50,540
but I'm going to keep doing what the
fuck I do and I'm just gonna keep getting

2226
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:53,450
funny and I'm going to keep getting
funny and I'm going to get a hold of this

2227
02:03:53,451 --> 02:03:55,280
and then you're going to be,
what the fuck are you going to be?

2228
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:57,580
You're going to keep saying you
don't like my style economy.

2229
02:03:57,740 --> 02:04:01,100
How bad are you going to work?
That's been my life since day one.

2230
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:06,080
I've always been trying to prove
somebody fucking off of something.

2231
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:07,820
They don't like me. I
can't be trusted. Well,

2232
02:04:07,821 --> 02:04:11,750
I'm still fucking here 15 years later
and there's been no problems and nobody's

2233
02:04:11,751 --> 02:04:15,640
missing a fucking head. So for you, people
couldn't trust me. You're wrong too.

2234
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:18,950
If I wanted to rob you, I would have
run. I'd be a long fucking time ago.

2235
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,670
It would be my pleasure to rob
somebody who talk shit about me.

2236
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:24,830
That's how I row. It's, you know,

2237
02:04:24,831 --> 02:04:28,140
stuffed up or is there something
it somebody knows, you know,

2238
02:04:28,150 --> 02:04:32,360
it's just not working at all. It's like
I forgot what I liked it. I went before,

2239
02:04:32,361 --> 02:04:35,900
but do you want some tissue paper
so I, excuse myself. I'm sorry guys.

2240
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:37,890
I just thought there was
something wrong with doing

2241
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:39,810
that weird crackling noise.

2242
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:43,500
I thought it was like it was static
thing out or they do to people.

2243
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:46,320
I see what they do.
I know when I could sit here and cry some,

2244
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:48,240
some amount of energy is,
you know,

2245
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:50,250
it's good to recognize
it and to see what it is,

2246
02:04:50,251 --> 02:04:53,760
but you know some amount of energy you
start talking about too much. It becomes

2247
02:04:56,250 --> 02:05:00,840
best line that he Griffith ever said was
when he went to see how Mr he saw white

2248
02:05:00,841 --> 02:05:02,640
people walking out covering their faces.

2249
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:08,300
I love seeing people now that didn't
like me 10 years ago. I smiled,

2250
02:05:09,010 --> 02:05:12,930
waved my thing. Well do you remember
that one time was not mentioning names,

2251
02:05:12,931 --> 02:05:16,890
but there was this one agent that would
tell me that you weren't talented and

2252
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:20,100
then one day you and I weren't FirstClass
and he walked past us and the coach

2253
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:24,220
and Joey was laughing at him.
Look at this fucking Mall Mall.

2254
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:28,860
Get back there where you belong.
You know it's, it's the animal.

2255
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:33,600
I think these guys get a little God
complex and they're not God because they

2256
02:05:33,601 --> 02:05:35,550
don't know the work and
the effort we put into it.

2257
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:39,420
It hurt my feelings and a lot of it hurt
my feelings. Well, you when Joey man,

2258
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,110
as they ever did, because it's like
they made it hard for you. Yeah.

2259
02:05:43,111 --> 02:05:45,120
They made it hard for me to know.
They're not around.

2260
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:49,500
Nothing is so many people were not around
anymore who I thought would be around

2261
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:49,951
forever,

2262
02:05:49,951 --> 02:05:54,390
including a lot of comics who came to
the store fucking barreling through the

2263
02:05:54,391 --> 02:05:58,080
store. Montreal deals, this and that,

2264
02:05:58,081 --> 02:06:02,010
and they fucking disappeared.
And then there's guys like me and honoree.

2265
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:02,821
Let me tell you something.

2266
02:06:02,821 --> 02:06:07,030
I'm going to tell you something to your
face right down to red band with our we

2267
02:06:07,031 --> 02:06:09,930
did in front of me in Vegas and some of
the best material I've heard in the last

2268
02:06:09,931 --> 02:06:13,080
two years. I'm going to tell you that
right now. The biggie small stuff.

2269
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:15,470
So when you think about shitting in China,
guys,

2270
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:17,610
maybe that's material I've
heard the last two years,

2271
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:20,690
and for you motherfuckers that had
your complaints about it, I been,

2272
02:06:20,691 --> 02:06:23,110
but somebody coming up, a club
owner telling me, I remember hit,

2273
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:27,030
one of his first big jokes is texting
and shitty playing video games.

2274
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:30,260
I'll never forget that oldest
thing. That was the worst. Ben,

2275
02:06:30,261 --> 02:06:34,200
he ever heard of this life and me going
another fucking moron that doesn't know

2276
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:37,290
anything about what we're doing.
What was the same thing?

2277
02:06:37,291 --> 02:06:40,920
It was like there was no TV credits and
I would bring you guys to open and they

2278
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:44,280
would just decide that you weren't
ready or you weren't good or that I was

2279
02:06:44,281 --> 02:06:46,920
picking the wrong horse. You
know? They would tell me that.

2280
02:06:46,921 --> 02:06:49,720
They were telling me that like these
guys, they're not that talented. I'm like,

2281
02:06:49,721 --> 02:06:53,070
here, you're out of your fucking
mind. Like I know what funny is,

2282
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:56,790
I've been around funny for a long time.
If I was a talent scout, I mean my,

2283
02:06:56,791 --> 02:06:59,630
my record for like picking guys
to open for me that are funny,

2284
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:02,940
that turned out to be like big
headliners. It's undisputed. Oh he just,

2285
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:06,660
every one of them, everybody became a
big headliner. You know all of them.

2286
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:10,800
It's like comics know what's good and
you're not going to be good every night.

2287
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:14,160
He's not gonna be good. Every
joke, every time you try new shit,

2288
02:07:14,161 --> 02:07:15,690
you run the risk of it not working.

2289
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:19,500
But the guys who try new shit or the
guys who are good and the guys, you know,

2290
02:07:19,501 --> 02:07:22,500
sometimes the sets go back,
sometimes things go ride.

2291
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:26,090
But that's because you're taking chances.
It's these,

2292
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:30,400
this cut cookie cutter,
bland, non offensive.

2293
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:31,650
So that's not exciting to me.

2294
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:35,100
What's exciting to me is people
that do wild shit and take chances.

2295
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:39,360
But when you nor have credits, man,
they automatically assume, look, I,

2296
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:43,030
I experienced that. The difference
between and my expertise if I have,

2297
02:07:43,031 --> 02:07:45,680
it happened for me really quickly.
But the,

2298
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:50,650
the difference between how people reacted
to me before I was on TV and how they

2299
02:07:50,651 --> 02:07:53,830
reacted after I was on television,
like the, the gigs that I could get,

2300
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:56,050
places that I could work at the same act,

2301
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:59,980
but all of a sudden just one or two TV
credits and all of a sudden they let me

2302
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:01,760
in all those like,
uh,

2303
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:06,250
early TV credits that I got
like Caroline's comedy hour
and MTV half hour comedy

2304
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:10,540
hour. As soon as I got that I was in,
it's just like they needed a pass.

2305
02:08:10,690 --> 02:08:14,620
They needed to be able to say, Oh,
this guy is approved by a higher power.

2306
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:18,040
You know, whether it's MTV or whatever
it is. And then you're on a sitcom.

2307
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:19,180
Like you could work anywhere.

2308
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:24,240
When I was a kid by watch pri Jamie
Vernon can hold his bladder and I used to

2309
02:08:24,611 --> 02:08:27,520
watch prior whatever Kennis
Ryan Red Band got a pee on him.

2310
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:28,660
I always thought that was good

2311
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:30,740
five for copy in our lives.

2312
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:36,350
But I gotta tell you something right
there in the last 100 years and I'm not

2313
02:08:36,351 --> 02:08:37,640
talking to this out of my ass.

2314
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:41,510
You could go home and think about what
the fuck I'm done with you right now is

2315
02:08:41,511 --> 02:08:45,990
the best time that of has ever been.
Oh yeah, but tell you why. Yeah,

2316
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:49,910
they gave is great. They gave us
Gleason, they gave us this guy,

2317
02:08:49,911 --> 02:08:52,430
they gave us that guy and
how good really where they,

2318
02:08:52,610 --> 02:08:57,610
you know now today what we have is we
have what you fucking idiots by into the

2319
02:08:58,401 --> 02:09:02,000
shit that they shoved down your throat.
But guess what's also happened?

2320
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:05,420
The underground has become
mainstream because of the Internet.

2321
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:09,290
So you the shit that they were
pushing at you 20 years ago,

2322
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:12,500
the shit then pushing that you at
these fucking comedy channels anymore.

2323
02:09:12,830 --> 02:09:14,000
It's not the end all be all.

2324
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:17,690
You mother fuckers have figured it out
for yourselves that they've been shoving

2325
02:09:17,691 --> 02:09:19,100
shit down on a fucking throats.

2326
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:20,150
Well, we, you know,

2327
02:09:20,151 --> 02:09:24,690
and what I know is there was this period
of time for more than 10 years where

2328
02:09:24,691 --> 02:09:26,460
they were focusing on what they thought,

2329
02:09:26,610 --> 02:09:31,610
what the agents and the managers
thought was clever or inside comedy,

2330
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:36,420
like comedy that the comedians
thought was appropriate there or that,

2331
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:38,730
that like certain groups
thought was appropriate.

2332
02:09:38,731 --> 02:09:42,660
Like you got that alternative movement
and they were trying to push that hard.

2333
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:46,920
Like this was the hip guy to be
attached to. This was the hip gotten,

2334
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:51,530
how many of those guys did
we want just fucking die,

2335
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:56,520
die, welcome, die. And they walked around
like they would do something different.

2336
02:09:56,640 --> 02:10:00,240
Yeah. Like what they were doing, even
though it wasn't funny, it was better.

2337
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:03,960
It was better because somehow
or another you were, you were,

2338
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:07,110
because you talked about getting your
dick sucked or doing coke like, oh,

2339
02:10:07,111 --> 02:10:11,490
he's too, so who wants
to hear that? It's funny.

2340
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:13,410
This is what you're missing.
You're missing. Like,

2341
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:18,450
and that's one of the things that freed
us with podcasts because you don't have

2342
02:10:18,451 --> 02:10:23,451
to constantly like express yourself
in a way where people have this,

2343
02:10:23,611 --> 02:10:24,590
uh,
you know,

2344
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:28,950
this idea of you on stage and you
don't have to present who you are.

2345
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:30,990
Everybody already knows you,
they know who you are.

2346
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:33,440
So when you're talking about
something on stage, you just,

2347
02:10:33,441 --> 02:10:36,030
this is what I think is funny about this.
You don't have to like,

2348
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:39,620
this is what is his philosophy? How
does he feel about the new world order?

2349
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:43,760
What is his thoughts on chem trails?
How does he feel about his e equal rights?

2350
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:46,250
Is he pro choice? You don't have
to say any of that. Like do,

2351
02:10:46,251 --> 02:10:50,300
you don't have to establish yourself
as a left wing guy or a right wing guy.

2352
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:52,580
But that was like a big
part of comedy for a while.

2353
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:55,490
It was like people would do stuff
that would establish themselves,

2354
02:10:55,491 --> 02:10:59,960
like guys would say things that weren't
funny at all. But like, you know,

2355
02:10:59,961 --> 02:11:04,850
if you want to like Bill
Hicks had a fucking bit about,
if you want, you know, a,

2356
02:11:04,851 --> 02:11:08,240
if you want people to not have abortions,

2357
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:12,440
you fucking raise those kids. You
fucking raise those kids. Yeah. Okay.

2358
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,790
Where's the joke?

2359
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:17,120
There was no joke in it because back
then if you had an important point,

2360
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:21,410
you wanted a sandwich that point in
between jokes. Because in people,

2361
02:11:21,411 --> 02:11:24,620
a lot of times to this day, people get
upset at that comedy and rightly so,

2362
02:11:24,621 --> 02:11:27,230
and they say it's preachy.
You're using your, your, your,

2363
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:32,030
your time on stage to preach instead
of to be funny and you can do both.

2364
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:33,710
And if you wouldn't,
if you're not doing both,

2365
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:37,340
you're taking a shortcut because
you, you, you, you have an advantage.

2366
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:38,061
You're on stage.

2367
02:11:38,061 --> 02:11:41,180
If you're onstage and you start talking
about something and you have a point of

2368
02:11:41,181 --> 02:11:44,990
view about Republicans or Democrats and
it's not funny, it's just your opinion.

2369
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:49,100
If I'm in the audience I'm
like, I disagree. You know,
I think this, my opinion,

2370
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,140
the differs here. I don't want
to hear your opinion. How come?

2371
02:11:51,141 --> 02:11:52,190
I can't talk about my opinion.

2372
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:55,460
But if you go on stays with your
opinion and you make me laugh,

2373
02:11:56,240 --> 02:12:00,650
well that's different because then like
you've planted an idea in my head that I

2374
02:12:00,651 --> 02:12:05,120
might not ordinarily accept ever. But
you've maybe laugh with it, you know?

2375
02:12:05,121 --> 02:12:08,540
And like Ari says fucked up shit all
the time that I don't agree with.

2376
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:13,490
But it's hilarious because he's not
necessarily even saying it cause he agrees

2377
02:12:13,491 --> 02:12:16,130
with it. He's saying it because
it's a funnier thing to say,

2378
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,800
you know you do that too.
You say shit on stage.

2379
02:12:18,801 --> 02:12:23,300
I know you don't really mean but you,
it's fucking funny. And I talk about it.

2380
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:26,330
I talked about in my last special,
it's a very important point that we do.

2381
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:30,950
We say shit, we don't really mean because
it's funnier. That's what comedy is.

2382
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:36,340
And for the longest time there was this
idea the comedy had to adhere to like a

2383
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:41,960
certain rules in order for it to be
high brow or certain rules for it to be

2384
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:46,310
considered alternative or
sophisticated or you know,

2385
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:49,400
this is a, you know, this is
progressive standup comedy like,

2386
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:51,260
but you're missing the funny part.

2387
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:55,430
It's missing a lot of that to become
this other thing to like fit into this

2388
02:12:55,431 --> 02:12:58,940
ideology to be accepted. You've,
you've missed in a lot of the funny,

2389
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:02,150
like it's not in there like your
certain things you don't talk about.

2390
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:06,590
Like you won't talk about sex. You don't
ever talk about sex. You're on stage,

2391
02:13:06,591 --> 02:13:10,310
you don't talk about sex. That
seems ridiculous to me, but that's,

2392
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:14,180
that seems outrageous. And someone says
like, oh, how could this guy be good?

2393
02:13:14,181 --> 02:13:15,050
He's doing jokes about,

2394
02:13:15,051 --> 02:13:17,930
I've heard people say that like you're
telling me this guy is doing jokes about

2395
02:13:17,931 --> 02:13:20,900
jerking off. Like yeah, that's
really challenging. Um, I don't,

2396
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:23,510
I'm not asking them to climb
Mount Kilimanjaro. All right.

2397
02:13:23,511 --> 02:13:26,270
I'm asking him to tell jokes that
are funny, that make me laugh.

2398
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:30,800
I want good stuff. You know, it doesn't
matter what it's about. If it's funny,

2399
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:35,830
it's funny and those people had this
idea and for the longest time they pushed

2400
02:13:36,891 --> 02:13:39,880
that idea but now the flood
gates are broken now live.

2401
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:42,720
I fucking the Brody
Stevens or running through,

2402
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,560
I mean everybody's running through
and Brody could be mainstream.

2403
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:49,230
He Brody's like squeaky clean but it's
like nobody could figure out what to do

2404
02:13:49,231 --> 02:13:52,770
with Brody and then all of a sudden people
realize like we've got to put him on

2405
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:56,100
TV in some way.
Like he's fucking Goddamn hilarious.

2406
02:13:56,101 --> 02:13:59,820
Like how can we figure out a way to get
that guy on TV and you're the same thing

2407
02:13:59,830 --> 02:14:01,500
and do the same thing.

2408
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:06,090
It's like the Internet has allowed
people to see what you really are.

2409
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:09,360
You know the allowed people to see the
unit and all he had to do is like see the

2410
02:14:09,361 --> 02:14:12,210
numbers of the podcast that get
downloaded and then they go,

2411
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:15,480
well I guess we got to get on board here.
And then they all just get on board.

2412
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:19,280
It's 2015 there's a lot of these
comedy clubs I don't even know about.

2413
02:14:19,290 --> 02:14:22,830
A podcast is, yeah, it's
amazing cause I'm like,

2414
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:27,900
this is your realm of business and
you have no idea how to, you know. No,

2415
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:30,840
I'm not doing the puck. You have guys have
no, you just want somebody to come in.

2416
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:34,100
No, no. You guys have no idea. No
concept. How can you not have no,

2417
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:36,870
God said you went to the
fucking entertainment business.

2418
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:39,150
They'll know within a year or two.
Within a year or two.

2419
02:14:39,151 --> 02:14:42,840
Everyone will know and it'll be the
most important thing that they invest in

2420
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:45,510
every comedy club.
If you have a local scene,

2421
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:48,870
every comedy club should have a podcast.
You should have your own podcast.

2422
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:51,510
How hard is that? You've got a guy
coming in for a week to tell them, hey,

2423
02:14:51,511 --> 02:14:53,820
come down.
You're going to do this radio station.

2424
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,310
You're going to do that radio station
and you gotta do our podcast for now.

2425
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:59,940
We'll put our podcast up that day.
Everybody is addicted to the podcast.

2426
02:14:59,941 --> 02:15:02,400
They know who the guys are that
are going to be on that week. Hey,

2427
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:06,160
nick Dipaolo is in town, he's going to be
doing the blah, Blah Blah club podcasts.

2428
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:06,750
You know,

2429
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:11,750
the fucking ice house chronicles podcasts
or the a fucking flappers finale for

2430
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:15,910
hot fest. Whatever the fuck, you know,
name it up. The comedy store countdown,

2431
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:20,000
you know, whatever the hell every club
should have its own shit. So like you,

2432
02:15:20,001 --> 02:15:22,830
you have the guy who's, you know,
maybe not the store because we don't,

2433
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:26,130
it's not like a headline club for the
weekend, but any club that's like the,

2434
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:27,900
like [inaudible] and Nashville,

2435
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:31,380
they should have an hour podcast they
released every week with the headliner.

2436
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,090
How hard would that be?
You know,

2437
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:37,530
have a local guy hosted and have them
understand that the idea is to just shoot

2438
02:15:37,531 --> 02:15:39,810
the shit with, you know, if
you had a good local guy,

2439
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:42,740
you could do it and you do it
under the name of the comical.

2440
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:44,190
But maybe even switch hosts out.
Like,

2441
02:15:44,191 --> 02:15:46,410
maybe you have the middle guy
in the headliner every week,

2442
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:51,360
do a podcast together that you would get
a lot of people addicted first of all,

2443
02:15:51,361 --> 02:15:55,880
addicted to that podcast and excited
about going to the club that week. Yeah,

2444
02:15:55,890 --> 02:15:57,010
I mean how hard is it to do?

2445
02:15:57,310 --> 02:15:59,900
He's been doing that for a
while. Is the Atlanta? Yeah,

2446
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:03,190
I haven't day cause I remember the
punchline interviewing you long time ago,

2447
02:16:03,220 --> 02:16:06,730
Jamie. Yeah. Fuck yeah. That was a Jesus.

2448
02:16:06,731 --> 02:16:11,680
That was like when we first started doing
podcasts even longer than that maybe.

2449
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:14,470
Did you have a podcast before?
We did, yeah, I think so.

2450
02:16:14,471 --> 02:16:15,530
I remember him interviewing,

2451
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:20,790
interviewing you in the office and this
was like when you threw me up on stage

2452
02:16:20,891 --> 02:16:24,670
the first time, uh, back from
my break, which was like,

2453
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:27,340
I'm going to say six years ago or so.
You're right.

2454
02:16:27,370 --> 02:16:29,850
It was probably before we
even started ours. Yeah,

2455
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:34,330
yeah, yeah. He had a, he had a good
sense of it. Well that's a good club to,

2456
02:16:34,331 --> 02:16:35,740
that fosters local talent.

2457
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:38,710
There's a lot of local guys that come
out of Atlanta that they're actually

2458
02:16:38,711 --> 02:16:42,220
moving the punchline. You
hear that they're losing
their location? Oh No. Yeah,

2459
02:16:42,221 --> 02:16:43,970
they're moving to another spot.
They apparently had,

2460
02:16:44,050 --> 02:16:47,800
they had always had an issue with parking
there and apparently just got an open

2461
02:16:47,801 --> 02:16:50,660
up a new browser and that green room,
they probably opened up.

2462
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:56,020
Oh did he? They have that laughing
stall too. It's a great fucking spot.

2463
02:16:56,440 --> 02:17:00,070
Laughing skulls are great spot and I'm
gonna tell you something else about with

2464
02:17:00,071 --> 02:17:05,071
you and her defense in 1994 when the
high two headlines to her help the open

2465
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:08,650
micros developed.
Do you know that?

2466
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:10,510
Hired them like to help
you write the material.

2467
02:17:10,511 --> 02:17:14,020
You would be that six at the comedy
works. She buy, she'd cater it,

2468
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:18,540
get like Tacos and you sat around and
your rope material with the headline.

2469
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:22,040
Then you went and did the open Mike
have line. They're grading you. Wow.

2470
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:27,130
A lot of clubs. 1994 back woods was the
guy who gave me the talk who told me,

2471
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:29,740
get your life together and don't
come back here. You're funny,

2472
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:34,240
but you're wasting your time. That's how
I got that. She used to pay Matt Woods.

2473
02:17:34,390 --> 02:17:37,600
Why? And she paid a
couple of other guys, man.

2474
02:17:37,601 --> 02:17:42,310
So that's how much she had foresight.
Like she really believes developing,

2475
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:47,560
they'd give you three minutes
once a month at the comedy works.

2476
02:17:47,561 --> 02:17:50,710
That's what it used to be,
that you had to work around town,

2477
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:54,080
you gotta do Miguel V's with Ted, you
got to do those open mics, you know.

2478
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:58,840
But when they always did try the
home, grown her own comics, you know,

2479
02:17:58,841 --> 02:18:01,300
all those holidays, she
puts locals, you know,

2480
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:03,590
and anytime she could
sneak locals in there,

2481
02:18:03,591 --> 02:18:05,410
you know the whole lineup is killers.

2482
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:08,560
A lot of people used to bring their own
people because they like working there

2483
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:11,830
because you'd have Rickards,
you know, tie Jordan,

2484
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:15,310
Steve McGrew and some guy had to come in
and follow it and it was hard for them.

2485
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:16,091
It's really,

2486
02:18:16,091 --> 02:18:19,300
so they guys would bring in their own
acts because the local guys were too

2487
02:18:19,301 --> 02:18:23,410
strong. She always had help.
So if like the comedy store,

2488
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:26,470
so what if I call the comedy
store and say, all right,

2489
02:18:26,471 --> 02:18:30,220
I'm coming in for the weekend. Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, I'm working it.

2490
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:33,790
But there's no feature or MC.
It's the comedy store liner,

2491
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:38,380
so I'll go into that. You buried and
Sebastian and I'm going up to that line.

2492
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:42,220
I don't want to file all that
mass. Yeah, see that's worked Jack,

2493
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:46,540
so a lot of people started bringing their
own Wendy's very smart when they had a

2494
02:18:46,541 --> 02:18:49,450
club in Tampa with the copy forks first.

2495
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:51,130
When I first got involved
with the comedy works,

2496
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:55,690
they had Tampa and Fort Collins real and
where they used to send me up, Tampa,

2497
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:58,390
Florida, Tampa, Florida and Fort Collins.

2498
02:18:58,391 --> 02:19:00,280
I used to go to Fort Collins
when I first started,

2499
02:19:00,281 --> 02:19:02,050
when they sent me to Fort
Collins every Tuesday,

2500
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:05,830
every Monday and Wednesday they
did an open Mike for Comics,

2501
02:19:05,831 --> 02:19:10,831
did five minutes and then they started
the regular show and then they closed

2502
02:19:10,841 --> 02:19:11,674
Fort Collins.

2503
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:16,530
They close to hamper and they kept the
death because that was her bread and

2504
02:19:16,531 --> 02:19:20,110
butter when she, wasn't she going to open
in Chicago at one point in time to, yes,

2505
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:22,180
yes,
but Wendy's very smart man.

2506
02:19:22,181 --> 02:19:24,760
When do you knows that you're
not going to do the job?

2507
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:28,100
Nobody's going to do the job. You're
doing a lesson. They love comedy as much

2508
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,640
as you do when these very hands on.
Yeah.

2509
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:35,340
And to get somebody to run your club
that loves you, go, you know, you,

2510
02:19:35,341 --> 02:19:37,150
you've been to a club. When
you walk in, you're like,

2511
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:41,590
these people don't know what the fuck
they're doing. They, this guy was at a,

2512
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:46,280
an olive garden. Fate years pushing
the spaghetti. He's doing calm.

2513
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:49,070
It doesn't fucking translate
the Chicago Improv.

2514
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:51,830
Remember the guy was watching us,
we couldn't smoke dope.

2515
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:56,810
We couldn't drink people up on stage.
And then when we came out to, uh, to,

2516
02:19:57,110 --> 02:20:00,770
to, uh, we had some craziness going
on once and they were freaking out.

2517
02:20:01,050 --> 02:20:04,490
Got People on stage with them.
We can't have it be the green room.

2518
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:09,320
We came out to Bob Marley exit, thus, oh,
I don't know. We have this dentist music.

2519
02:20:09,650 --> 02:20:12,920
Well went to what kind of
world? Like, no, this is, yeah,

2520
02:20:12,921 --> 02:20:16,550
they were trying to do some goofy shit.
You know that, you know what's funny?

2521
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,330
There's two things that happened.
There was like two shifts and uh,

2522
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:21,650
bringing you guys on the road with me.

2523
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:25,190
The first one was like people didn't
want you guys because you were too dirty,

2524
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:28,130
but the second one was why are you
bringing these guys? They're too good.

2525
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:29,480
This is like there was a,

2526
02:20:29,481 --> 02:20:32,720
there was a shift somewhere like in
the two thousands where, you know,

2527
02:20:32,721 --> 02:20:35,090
I tell people, you know, Joey
Diaz comes on the road with me.

2528
02:20:35,091 --> 02:20:37,760
I like to like you have Joey
Diaz Open for you on purpose.

2529
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:39,470
Like why the fuck would you do that?

2530
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:42,200
But it's what you were talking
about with his Denver thing.

2531
02:20:42,201 --> 02:20:45,050
Like people don't want to follow
people that are strong like funny acts,

2532
02:20:45,051 --> 02:20:49,430
but it does not make it fun for everybody.
Fun for everybody.

2533
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:53,140
Like why is that? Why is that a
bad thing? You know? I mean that's,

2534
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:56,000
it should be the opposite attitude.

2535
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:58,820
I mean if you've worked on your
comedy and your comedy is good,

2536
02:20:58,970 --> 02:21:03,020
he should be excited that the whole show
is really good and you just ride that

2537
02:21:03,021 --> 02:21:03,980
wave go on after.

2538
02:21:03,981 --> 02:21:07,550
Especially if you are friends with
the guys who are on the show with you.

2539
02:21:07,551 --> 02:21:09,470
If you love them,
you want them to have fun.

2540
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:11,990
You want everybody to laugh
at them because you love them.

2541
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:12,980
And then you just like,

2542
02:21:12,981 --> 02:21:16,430
we did this show it we just did in
Vegas was that fucking show was amazing.

2543
02:21:16,670 --> 02:21:20,270
That was a fun show.
It was Ari Donkin Joey,

2544
02:21:20,390 --> 02:21:22,580
me and the Mirage,

2545
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:26,510
that fucking Terry fade or
showroom is so good. They have,

2546
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:30,320
they set it up for that ventriloquist
dude. So the voice has to be perfect.

2547
02:21:30,321 --> 02:21:32,870
You know, you have to be able to
hear his voice, his act. So they,

2548
02:21:32,871 --> 02:21:36,500
the speaker system is amazing. You're
in the, I was in the back of the room.

2549
02:21:36,501 --> 02:21:39,890
I could hear everything like crystal
clear when you were on stage.

2550
02:21:39,891 --> 02:21:41,330
I was in the back of the room.
Not this time,

2551
02:21:41,331 --> 02:21:44,720
but one of the other times we did it.
You hear everything you say crystal clear.

2552
02:21:44,721 --> 02:21:48,470
It's perfect. So amazing room.
But just to emphasize that,

2553
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:52,520
you know, a lot of comics listen
to these shows, these podcasts,

2554
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:56,390
and they walked around like I
did fucking scared. You know,

2555
02:21:56,410 --> 02:21:58,970
and then one day I got it,
I'm like, fuck these bitches,

2556
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:02,810
this is my mother fucker playing
field and that they don't like it.

2557
02:22:03,130 --> 02:22:06,740
They're going to go down. And my
life changed. My comedy changed,

2558
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:08,780
my outlook changed.
You know,

2559
02:22:08,781 --> 02:22:12,230
I let them scam me the same way I let
people scare me about life. You know,

2560
02:22:12,231 --> 02:22:13,240
when I was younger they would,

2561
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:17,480
dad said fuck you mother fuckers and
it's the same thing and I'm happy I did

2562
02:22:17,481 --> 02:22:19,430
that with copy.
I would have been really scared.

2563
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,920
You know this club owners that
are coming to you and go, hey,

2564
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:25,650
next time there's a club
owner that I worked four years
ago, what's he like, man,

2565
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:27,750
you should put something on that joke.

2566
02:22:27,751 --> 02:22:29,340
And then after you got off
the second show, he was like,

2567
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:33,810
you got to have my tag bitch.
I don't fucking know you

2568
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:38,160
fucking jerk call. That's still
around. I don't want that. You know,

2569
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:42,750
he would come up to me and say, oh,
this tag would sound better. I get the,

2570
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:45,150
you know, get the fuck out of my,
and then that, none of the way home,

2571
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:48,060
he told me again, you got to really use
my thing until one day I said, Doug,

2572
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:51,030
what was the last time
you will fucking stage?

2573
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:54,900
What can I use your fucking
tag the fuck Outta here.

2574
02:22:54,901 --> 02:22:56,880
And then after that he would hire me,
wouldn't talk to me,

2575
02:22:56,881 --> 02:23:01,200
the hope we can get the fuck
out of my face. That guy,

2576
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:04,530
you know, we work hard at what we
do and you got to respect that.

2577
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:07,920
It's like a plumber or an electrician
coming to my house and be telling them how

2578
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:11,430
to fucking do his job.
I'm gonna fucking mind you booked me.

2579
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:15,030
Now you're going to tell me how the fuck
the dude get the fuck out of my face.

2580
02:23:15,031 --> 02:23:18,780
A lot of them used to be comics. There
was a lot of guys. Those are the works.

2581
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:22,090
Those are the worst.
Those are the worst I to call it

2582
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:27,210
early on.
But he became a good fucking manager.

2583
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:32,130
You know these guys hire you right
now. Big comes Jesus. These guys. Well,

2584
02:23:32,131 --> 02:23:35,160
the proof is in the pudding. He had,
Danny had a lot of good people that's had,

2585
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:36,900
it's a good word.
That's my point.

2586
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:39,960
But still he had him and he developed
them and they did something. Well,

2587
02:23:39,961 --> 02:23:43,560
he had uh, uh, this people
who are comedy club,

2588
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:46,530
the go comedians that one
day go, Whoa, wait a second,

2589
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:49,290
I'm going to figure out how to
make money on these drug calls.

2590
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,050
Then they become comedy club owners.

2591
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:54,330
There's a couple of them were local clubs
around here that tell you what to say.

2592
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:58,420
You can't work clean dog work clean,
but you can't work dirty.

2593
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:01,080
You can't work there. And then I
want to pay you or come to radio.

2594
02:24:01,081 --> 02:24:02,940
We're not going to give you a hotel.
When the one woman,

2595
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:07,050
what are you talking about? You're a
comic. So when I worked for a comic,

2596
02:24:07,051 --> 02:24:09,360
I let them know right off the bat,
listen, before this goes any further,

2597
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:13,290
you're a comic. So I'm not going to
have to tell you how to act correctly.

2598
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:15,630
What's that mean?

2599
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:19,380
That there's a TV in the green room that
everything's copacetic cause you're a

2600
02:24:19,381 --> 02:24:23,700
cop. And that's when I just don't, well,

2601
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:27,330
every time I don't understand
what you're saying. She's a comic.

2602
02:24:27,331 --> 02:24:30,990
Does a TV and if you're a fucking cop
be dumping something standings cause

2603
02:24:30,991 --> 02:24:33,120
you're a comic and you know the business,
right.

2604
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:35,160
You know how we act and
you know how it works.

2605
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:38,790
I don't want to hit no misunderstandings
about checks or how the green roof

2606
02:24:38,791 --> 02:24:41,700
should be of, they should be sold as an
agreement will be. You're a fucking comic.

2607
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:44,880
If you're a comic and I go to your
agreement, it's a size of a closet.

2608
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:48,600
You're not a fucking, you're a
scumbag. Just trying to make money.

2609
02:24:48,601 --> 02:24:52,770
I'll fucking comics.
If a comic opens up a room at,

2610
02:24:52,771 --> 02:24:56,810
want that room to be that
much better because you're
a calming. If a comic opens,

2611
02:24:56,830 --> 02:24:59,010
opens your rule.
Well how many comics open a row?

2612
02:24:59,590 --> 02:25:00,120
Yeah,

2613
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:03,690
a lot of Brad Garrett. A lot of
Vegas. You know, just being gay club,

2614
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:06,480
it's supposed to be the shit
and Brad Garrett was the shit.

2615
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:08,730
That's a big difference.
He wasn't a bad stand though.

2616
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:12,330
I'm talking about guys that were
bad standups of what they go.

2617
02:25:12,331 --> 02:25:14,940
I'm going to become a standard.
Then they tried to tell you shit,

2618
02:25:14,941 --> 02:25:16,740
when you get there you're like,
you'll be a favorite bro.

2619
02:25:17,220 --> 02:25:18,330
This is not what you're doing.

2620
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:22,060
You had the line June 4th of July and
Christmas coming back. Then tonight,

2621
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:25,360
Uncle Joey's here get fuck out of my face.
If we were going to buy a club,

2622
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:28,390
it'd be the Ice House.
The ice house would be the car.

2623
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:31,870
Flappers flappers libraries
is a beautiful club.

2624
02:25:31,871 --> 02:25:35,080
Just the bullets hard to fucking
get people to go to a club.

2625
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:37,630
You know like think about it.
Everybody that goes to the store,

2626
02:25:37,631 --> 02:25:41,380
everybody goes to the Improv is like
there's only so many guys, you know,

2627
02:25:41,381 --> 02:25:43,330
there's so many clubs
that we can work out here.

2628
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:46,390
You know like when I was preparing
for the last comedy central special,

2629
02:25:46,391 --> 02:25:49,120
I was doing the [inaudible] on Tuesday
nights. I was doing the Improv,

2630
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:50,830
I was doing Irvine occasionally.

2631
02:25:50,831 --> 02:25:54,850
I was doing all these different clients
like constantly ice house hopping all

2632
02:25:54,851 --> 02:25:59,290
over the place. Like there's a lot of
clubs here. This is like, it's far,

2633
02:25:59,291 --> 02:26:01,990
it's like a hot bed of of places to work.

2634
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:03,610
This is one of the best
spots in the country.

2635
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:07,340
If you'd been in the new ice house yet.
What you talking about the nuance?

2636
02:26:07,410 --> 02:26:11,260
I mean new Aha. There's a new huh?
Oh, the one across the street.

2637
02:26:11,261 --> 02:26:15,240
Supposedly they just had a cold
open on a January 1st and it's,

2638
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:16,950
I heard it's beautiful.
I heard it's like to go.

2639
02:26:17,050 --> 02:26:20,810
They were doing shows there now they
had a show that they just didn't happen.

2640
02:26:20,850 --> 02:26:25,720
Didn't have there. Were those
the ones on the corner? Sros?

2641
02:26:25,721 --> 02:26:28,490
Like an invitation only party.
There was no,

2642
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:31,990
I haven't seen him but I heard it was a,
I heard it's like the ice house.

2643
02:26:31,991 --> 02:26:35,110
I heard it's like the ice house main room
stage bigger though. It's bigger. Yeah.

2644
02:26:35,111 --> 02:26:37,330
It's like the ice house only
sits like a hundred something.

2645
02:26:37,331 --> 02:26:39,970
This was like 200 something
now. Yeah, but still small.

2646
02:26:40,450 --> 02:26:42,640
Still like maybe a little bit
bigger than the or you know,

2647
02:26:42,641 --> 02:26:43,810
but not as big as the main room.

2648
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:47,050
I did the main room of the night and
then I did the or afterwards. Dlr.

2649
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,340
Such a better writer. Such a
better room. It's the best.

2650
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:52,420
That's the way you're supposed
to do comedy jammed in there,

2651
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:55,240
stacked on top of each other.
Low ceiling. It's the most fun.

2652
02:26:55,310 --> 02:27:00,010
They'll closest thing for your, it's a San
Francisco bunch of fuck. Yeah. Tell Ya.

2653
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:03,540
They just tried to offer me
the book to do the cops. Cops.

2654
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:09,490
Cops is a great club, but the puck's
line, this show with the band.

2655
02:27:09,550 --> 02:27:13,090
I don't care about the money. Yeah,
that have a great fucking give a fuck.

2656
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:15,380
Just let me go up. They go crazy.
What do I give a fuck? Yeah,

2657
02:27:15,410 --> 02:27:19,600
it's worth paying or getting
paid less to do that climb.

2658
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:24,700
If I opened up, I think they were opening
up a club with two buddy moving parts.

2659
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:27,340
Now I think they get the head
of themselves and it's like,

2660
02:27:27,341 --> 02:27:30,430
I always say you put the all these smart
guys together to do a double is think

2661
02:27:30,431 --> 02:27:34,090
of the fucking world. You know.
I still love this. That's what I,

2662
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:37,840
I want to do comedy right there in front
of that wall. Breakfast. Anything else?

2663
02:27:38,750 --> 02:27:43,180
You're wasting my time. He wanted to
serve food. Go serve it on your own time.

2664
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:47,560
Just give these motherfuckers
stay fucking drinks, stiff drinks.

2665
02:27:48,690 --> 02:27:52,990
Fuck that. Okay. You know really well.

2666
02:27:53,210 --> 02:27:56,440
It's 600 seats.
You get 600 people and he really,

2667
02:27:56,441 --> 02:27:59,740
Kevin Hart is going to play in your
fucking dreams. You've dumped fuck.

2668
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:03,160
Well they wind up paper and a lot of them,
it's a waste.

2669
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:07,570
You need to 5,202 of the
quarter for a great room. Brick,

2670
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:12,250
a tremendous sound system. So hot dogs
next door would do something special,

2671
02:28:12,251 --> 02:28:13,120
but after the show,

2672
02:28:13,121 --> 02:28:16,110
if you don't have to fuck with the
wait staff and let them go with this,

2673
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:20,500
the drinks bro, two shows, you know, and
get up. That's what I would do as a comic.

2674
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:24,350
The would be paradise. You know,
there's things that you do.

2675
02:28:24,830 --> 02:28:28,820
These people now open it up. Clubs
thinking that 600 people going to show up.

2676
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:30,960
You know, last night I saw
something interesting again.

2677
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:34,730
I was in the room last night and I came
up, my wife was watching the fucking,

2678
02:28:34,731 --> 02:28:38,990
that means whatever the fuck was out last
night and who's in the fucking habits

2679
02:28:39,050 --> 02:28:40,910
up there standing killing it.

2680
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:44,810
But Margaret Cho dressed as the Korean
guy with white powder on their face

2681
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:47,570
walking across days like Fidel Castro.

2682
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:51,500
And I'm thinking about what they put her
through 20 years ago and how they did

2683
02:28:51,501 --> 02:28:53,510
their,
and then when they gave me that ABC show,

2684
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:57,700
because to now rush after
the Tub, Alan Rush. Okay.

2685
02:28:57,990 --> 02:28:59,930
They are after the Tim
Allen and Roseanne rush,

2686
02:28:59,931 --> 02:29:02,910
something happened and networks that we
got to get a bunch of comics. That's it.

2687
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:03,753
That's the idea.

2688
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:08,150
So they gave Greg Geraldo a show that
gave top row just show on NBC Butler.

2689
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:11,870
Brett Butler, a show on ABC. And
they gave that poor Bogard show.

2690
02:29:11,871 --> 02:29:14,660
And are they insulted her?
They told them not to be Chinky.

2691
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:18,110
They were saying all this shit
go, you know, be bored Chinese.

2692
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:21,350
They just didn't salt in her insides.
Then they canceled everybody.

2693
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:22,880
And you know what?

2694
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:26,900
Half of these fucking punks today
would fucking crawler the tree.

2695
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:29,130
I'm looking at Margaret show last time.
Go with,

2696
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:33,080
I bet Margaret Cho's happy that she didn't
fucking quit a bail out or got hooked

2697
02:29:33,081 --> 02:29:36,090
on drugs. Margaret Cho said,
fuck you motherfuckers.

2698
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:37,880
I'm just going to get stronger as a comic.

2699
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:41,420
She built up a huge following other row,
whether they're gay or not.

2700
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:46,690
They span the books and she sells out
that bitches tatted from my head to a

2701
02:29:47,331 --> 02:29:52,070
fucking towel with fuck you and Korean
letters to all these fucking jet dials

2702
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:55,160
and 20 years later that
chick was killing it.

2703
02:29:55,161 --> 02:29:58,040
Last night on stage with
Amy Poehler and Tina Fey,

2704
02:29:58,041 --> 02:30:02,120
the two hottest comedy checks in the
fucking world. How you like me now, bitch,

2705
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:06,980
what'd they put that fucking chick who
20 years ago they embarrassed or they

2706
02:30:06,981 --> 02:30:09,110
made them feel like shit.
He told her to lose weight.

2707
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:12,340
Do you remember the shit that
she came out with years later?

2708
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:14,150
They told her she was
never going to work again.

2709
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:16,370
You do for going against the network.

2710
02:30:16,371 --> 02:30:18,740
Well how'd she go against the
network where so she told them,

2711
02:30:18,741 --> 02:30:23,090
but they would tell them to lose weight.
There's no fat Asians. Oh my God.

2712
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,230
Cause Shit. They was saying that Margaret
Children, she came out and said later,

2713
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:31,700
then I don't think last night if I
was Margaret Cho that took this Cuban

2714
02:30:31,701 --> 02:30:36,020
disgusting Dick Guy with them fucking
forced get on it and said, here you go.

2715
02:30:36,021 --> 02:30:40,550
America. Yup. You ups for a
week. This ain't no fucking
malfunction of a wardrobe.

2716
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,350
This is just to tell you that you can't
stop comedians, Bro. We just get better.

2717
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,240
Don't you know that you dump motherfucking
club owners and you TV dumped fucking

2718
02:30:50,241 --> 02:30:51,074
cuts.

2719
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:55,940
We just get while you're giggling and
Auntie and next mindfuck would taking that

2720
02:30:55,941 --> 02:30:59,540
joke and breaking it down and
getting on stage and getting better.

2721
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:00,650
These fucking people,

2722
02:31:00,651 --> 02:31:03,890
David tell nobody goes to see David
thought he's funniest as he's ever been

2723
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:08,150
because that's all we do.
Unless we're fucking cunts a go away,

2724
02:31:08,151 --> 02:31:11,990
but we don't go away. We don't go
away. We'll worst than fucking roaches.

2725
02:31:12,290 --> 02:31:14,690
You know how proud I was
last month from Margaret Cho.

2726
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:16,970
Do you have any fucking idea?

2727
02:31:16,971 --> 02:31:21,420
Dressed up there with a hat on and white
fucking thing on a phase dog that 20

2728
02:31:21,421 --> 02:31:23,760
years later she probably
thought she was done.

2729
02:31:23,761 --> 02:31:26,190
What do you think where they can't
see your show up? The three seasons.

2730
02:31:26,191 --> 02:31:29,250
What the fuck do you think you're done?
Who's going to hire me?

2731
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:30,240
Look at that bitch.

2732
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:34,500
She then quit and that's what these comedy
club owners and that's what all these

2733
02:31:34,501 --> 02:31:37,920
guys and have an opinion on comics
always remember. You fucking go away.

2734
02:31:37,921 --> 02:31:42,480
You worthless fucking faggots go away.
You go away.

2735
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:43,440
We keep going.

2736
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:47,550
How long the burns do copy with two
what a fucking cigar in his mouth.

2737
02:31:48,090 --> 02:31:50,850
These motherfuckers don't
know nothing about nothing.

2738
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:52,980
They don't know nothing about nothing.

2739
02:31:52,981 --> 02:31:55,140
That's why now every morning I
wake up and I go to some of these,

2740
02:31:55,141 --> 02:31:59,700
suck my dick today somewhere. One of
these TV guys are going to hear my name.

2741
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:03,240
Last week I had to drive by the Melrose
Improv and see my name. They're all,

2742
02:32:03,241 --> 02:32:08,220
we can go that fucking coke, that fat
motherfucker. I didn't do anything.

2743
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:11,400
I just stayed here. Well, you
kept working. I kept working.

2744
02:32:11,401 --> 02:32:14,850
I didn't give up and keep working.
Right. I don't, some people get tired.

2745
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:18,480
I never gave a fuck about none of those
cuts with that threats that you're not

2746
02:32:18,481 --> 02:32:19,980
going to,
I don't give a fuck dog.

2747
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:24,330
I'm going to get strong and once I got
off the blow now they really got to suck

2748
02:32:24,331 --> 02:32:27,180
my ass hole.
Now it's two live crew now.

2749
02:32:27,181 --> 02:32:30,280
They got to suck my dick in your ass too.
Right?

2750
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:35,670
Well you knows, but he knows you're
killing me. Fuck this. Don't,

2751
02:32:35,671 --> 02:32:36,670
don't crackling Casey.

2752
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:39,060
Motherfuckers don't know how
you're going to breathe like that.

2753
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:43,760
Reminds me of your old knows her one
year before you had your operation. Those

2754
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:48,890
are was very, I was very nasally.
Just throw it on the ground there. No,

2755
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:49,733
there's a garbage

2756
02:32:52,220 --> 02:32:56,990
fuck there's a car. Yeah. My old
knows was your awesome show you.

2757
02:32:56,991 --> 02:32:58,470
Maybe you should get
your net is carved out.

2758
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:01,730
I'll be had it does your separate mark?
I don't know.

2759
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:05,500
I don't know what the can you usually
breathe out of your nose once I get out I

2760
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:09,570
got a brick spurred me to Jujitsu. You
gotta Bring Watch spray with the Jujitsu.

2761
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:14,370
Really always go into a little closed
guard. I got that pop, go spray my nose,

2762
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:17,700
steroids, something about
leverage with me or something.

2763
02:33:17,701 --> 02:33:19,200
Then once I cleaned it out,
it's good.

2764
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:22,710
I ever since I had an ear infection a
couple of years ago, I went swimming.

2765
02:33:22,711 --> 02:33:27,680
I had an ear infection. Then
I went in and uh, I flew, I,

2766
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:31,830
I fucked up and I went to the doc and
he's stuck the fuck the probe, my nose.

2767
02:33:31,831 --> 02:33:34,680
My nose has been all fucked up
and they sent me that sprays,

2768
02:33:34,681 --> 02:33:39,180
but this sprays suck. I live on fucking
Africa. You get addicted to that stuff,

2769
02:33:39,181 --> 02:33:42,690
to the real issue with those appraisers.
You're, you're the inside of your nose,

2770
02:33:42,691 --> 02:33:46,210
gets addicted to that spray and
won't open up unless you have it.

2771
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:50,220
That's very common. People
get in when you're, you know,

2772
02:33:50,221 --> 02:33:54,660
your body's responding and wants that
shit. It swells up and it makes it worse.

2773
02:33:54,750 --> 02:33:57,030
It's terrible. There's your
neighbors ever rage, rage,

2774
02:33:58,290 --> 02:34:02,340
rage against the dying of the light.
Oh, it's not that kind of steroids.

2775
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:05,700
If they gave me, I have steroids at the
house and it was mostly sprayed two times

2776
02:34:07,210 --> 02:34:09,540
to show spray.
It's a shame.

2777
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:13,780
But I'm writing addicted than I was spread
here. And Yeah, nasal spray addiction.

2778
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:18,280
Is it real Mayo Clinic? Yeah. It's that
right or clean it right out though.

2779
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:21,850
Like if you do a bump will that
we'd be able to breathe immediately.

2780
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:25,060
God cocaine's the best fucking
though the spray they gave me.

2781
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:26,770
Now the doctor gave me the prescription.

2782
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:31,690
If I hit my those two times
for like five minutes,

2783
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:36,960
I go into confusion because it feels
like that it has that thing to it.

2784
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:42,100
What they're saying is it's not a true
addiction because a, a true addiction,

2785
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:45,400
what happens is like you,
you get sick if you don't have it.

2786
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:50,800
A true addiction is a compulsive
physiological need for and use of a habit

2787
02:34:51,581 --> 02:34:56,100
forming substance known to be physically,
psychologically or socially harmful. Um,

2788
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:56,410
the,

2789
02:34:56,410 --> 02:35:00,310
what the nasal spray happens is that you
put that stuff in and after a few days

2790
02:35:00,311 --> 02:35:01,031
of using it,

2791
02:35:01,031 --> 02:35:04,300
your nose may become less responsive to
the effects of the medication and as a

2792
02:35:04,301 --> 02:35:08,410
result you need to use more and more of
the medication to control congestion or

2793
02:35:08,411 --> 02:35:12,730
your congestion may worsen if you stop
using the medication that happens to

2794
02:35:12,731 --> 02:35:15,490
people. Apparently that happens
to people with Xanax too.

2795
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:18,580
Like they say there's like some sort
of a rubber band effect of Xanax.

2796
02:35:18,581 --> 02:35:21,160
Like if you, you know,
Xanax calms your anxiety,

2797
02:35:21,161 --> 02:35:22,930
but when you start getting off of it,

2798
02:35:23,170 --> 02:35:26,560
like your anxiety like heightens and
worsens to a place where it probably

2799
02:35:26,561 --> 02:35:29,920
wouldn't even be if you were on it
if you weren't on in the first place.

2800
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:34,180
And I think that's what happens with
these sprouts sprays to they get you to

2801
02:35:34,181 --> 02:35:35,800
come and go and join the Diaz.

2802
02:35:35,980 --> 02:35:40,420
They get your income and then go on
these fucks spraying shit up your nose if

2803
02:35:40,421 --> 02:35:43,690
you get your nose carved out though, you
know, if you ever want to go and do it.

2804
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:48,400
My guy retired, my guy, Feinberg
and Encino, he was the best he,

2805
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,220
he, he had like he was, he was so fucking,

2806
02:35:51,221 --> 02:35:54,880
he would so patient meticulous when he
would talk to them and take notes with

2807
02:35:54,881 --> 02:35:58,500
them. But he would talk about what people
did wrong and what people did right and

2808
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:02,160
here's a common errors and here's where
they fuck up. And you know he's been,

2809
02:36:02,161 --> 02:36:03,760
he had been doing it for fucking years.

2810
02:36:03,761 --> 02:36:08,170
He was like in his sixties when he did
my operation, but he made my nose wider.

2811
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:11,270
Like if I look at photos of
my nose before the operation,

2812
02:36:11,300 --> 02:36:15,220
after my nose was all sucked good at,
I didn't, I just didn't talk as well.

2813
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:17,100
I couldn't breathe out
of my nose very well.

2814
02:36:17,150 --> 02:36:21,400
My voice sounded different and he stuck
these fucking plastic things in there

2815
02:36:21,670 --> 02:36:24,550
and cut everything out.
Cut The turbinates down,

2816
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:28,080
remove chunks of meat.
I used to take the,

2817
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:30,610
I felt I took photos of it
and I did some of them online,

2818
02:36:30,611 --> 02:36:33,400
but the video won't me blowing
my nose with a waterpik.

2819
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:37,660
I have felt I had photos of the buggers
that I would blow out these bloody giant

2820
02:36:37,810 --> 02:36:41,500
honks, their thumbs. I would
blow it. I showed it to Tom.

2821
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:44,320
It's the girl wants in the airport. He
almost threw up. I go, look at that dude.

2822
02:36:44,321 --> 02:36:47,320
It just came out of my nose.
It was like he ran away,

2823
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:51,610
but that guy clean my nose out. I have
to Holland tunnels, man. I'm just like,

2824
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:56,680
before that, how was your Jujitsu breathe?
Terrible. My Cardio got 20% better.

2825
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:59,620
They vet you just Regan's guy
go. He goes, I think with you,

2826
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:04,900
it's a deviated septum. Oh, I guarantee
you that's an issue. Do you? He goes,

2827
02:37:04,901 --> 02:37:07,480
I get it with you. You'll lose weight
cause war. It goes to that. Well,

2828
02:37:07,481 --> 02:37:10,210
that's what Vandelay Silva,
when Vandelay Silva had his nose fixed,

2829
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:11,500
he had all that facial surgery.

2830
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:15,010
They took a piece out of his rib and
reconstructed his nose and made his nose.

2831
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:16,090
I'll give

2832
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:20,060
you look at Vandellia knows it's way
bigger than it was before because he had a

2833
02:37:20,061 --> 02:37:23,700
big chunk of their open up his nose
like Vandelay and trying to look better.

2834
02:37:23,701 --> 02:37:27,530
He's still trying to fuck
you up. Like when he got his
nose fixed, it wasn't good.

2835
02:37:27,531 --> 02:37:31,640
He wanted to look cute but his nose was
completely smashed in and flattened.

2836
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:35,390
It was like no cartilage at all.
It was just smashed and flattened.

2837
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:38,840
And if you look at like what his face
looked like when he started fighting and

2838
02:37:38,841 --> 02:37:42,980
like the late nineties as opposed to
what he looks like in the early two

2839
02:37:42,981 --> 02:37:47,981
thousands like his nose was just a pancake
and so he had it fixed and stuck way

2840
02:37:49,161 --> 02:37:49,940
the fuck out,

2841
02:37:49,940 --> 02:37:54,160
like way bigger than it was before and
all just so he could breathe better and

2842
02:37:54,161 --> 02:37:57,850
smash your fucking face have.
So it's funny shit man.

2843
02:37:57,880 --> 02:38:02,050
We taste right now they should
just go over and legal look truce.

2844
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:04,730
Just true what the FCA
and that she just can't,

2845
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:07,190
it's in Nevada state athletic
commission to do is this.

2846
02:38:07,191 --> 02:38:09,470
We don't want you to come
back through the UFC tonight.

2847
02:38:10,310 --> 02:38:12,920
We're going to tape you every
week just doing a segment.

2848
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:17,810
That's it because that just talk about
stuff because now he has a remark for

2849
02:38:17,811 --> 02:38:22,230
everything that happens. So
he stuck up for Judge Jones
last week. Right. You know,

2850
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:25,010
he stuck stuff for everybody and
it's always at the end of the day.

2851
02:38:25,011 --> 02:38:28,650
That's at the end of a bunch
of bag of the UFC. You know,

2852
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:31,510
like what do you think of John Jones?
They just go to the van.

2853
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:32,920
[inaudible] he's like shooting Deca

2854
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:38,900
guys rubbing his back and some
ladies shooting them in the yard.

2855
02:38:38,901 --> 02:38:41,430
But then eventually, what do
you think of John Joe? Hey,

2856
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:45,770
I can give him my heart that he had
a blog if then UFC and that's it.

2857
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:50,440
Cause it always has you see, you
ever see did it? Nobody else did it.

2858
02:38:50,441 --> 02:38:55,010
Van [inaudible] Goodheart drain very,

2859
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:58,310
very well but then wide. Thank you
for Dana a wide thank you for help.

2860
02:38:58,580 --> 02:39:02,690
Thank you for UFC. Yeah, that
guy. Um, he fucked up man.

2861
02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:05,270
You can't run from a drug
test and then if you ran,

2862
02:39:05,330 --> 02:39:08,060
he ran from a drunk test and then it was
talking about all the UFC doesn't pay

2863
02:39:08,061 --> 02:39:10,580
its athletes and all I'm
saying and then the UFC. Okay,

2864
02:39:10,730 --> 02:39:14,600
you made nine point $7 million
fighting for us. Here's your record.

2865
02:39:14,601 --> 02:39:16,790
The UFC put his record out
like here's your record,

2866
02:39:16,940 --> 02:39:19,850
here's how much money we paid you.
You made nine point $7 million.

2867
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:21,620
I don't know what you
think a lot of money is,

2868
02:39:21,621 --> 02:39:24,710
but a lot of people think $9
million is a lot of money,

2869
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:27,770
like two years or something.
But he was several years,

2870
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:32,450
probably five years he was fighting.
But the point is he didn't five years,

2871
02:39:32,451 --> 02:39:34,850
the only fought six times. It was the
other thing. Like you're saying you,

2872
02:39:35,130 --> 02:39:39,230
we work you so hard, you're fighting once
a year essentially. But not only that,

2873
02:39:39,231 --> 02:39:40,070
on top of that,

2874
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:44,630
like Vandelay didn't have a winning
record like Vander Lee got beat by Chris

2875
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:47,000
Liebing.
Vandalia got beat by a rampage.

2876
02:39:47,001 --> 02:39:50,090
Jackson knocked him out like he
got beat by all. A lot of guys.

2877
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:55,180
He's a great fighter in a fan favorite
and personally like my all time favorite

2878
02:39:55,611 --> 02:39:58,670
guy to watch. I think. I think if
I go back to like the pride days,

2879
02:39:58,910 --> 02:40:02,180
I love the pride days for two
guys especially. Well, three men,

2880
02:40:02,260 --> 02:40:04,700
Tara in his prime for Cro,

2881
02:40:04,701 --> 02:40:09,230
cop in his prime fade or for
sure Fado was the motherfucker,

2882
02:40:09,231 --> 02:40:12,810
but Vandelay was a destroyer.
He was a,

2883
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:18,330
he was so aggressive and psychotic
and you would watch a Vandelay Phi.

2884
02:40:18,331 --> 02:40:21,690
You always knew you were going
to see some fucking crazy shit.

2885
02:40:22,290 --> 02:40:26,550
That's when they had stomps and soccer
kicks and he's stomping dudes in the head

2886
02:40:26,551 --> 02:40:30,120
holding onto the robe, stomp into
more in the face when he's down.

2887
02:40:30,350 --> 02:40:34,590
I mean Vandelay she was amazing man.
His fights were awesome to watch.

2888
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:37,740
But you,
you know that hard,

2889
02:40:37,741 --> 02:40:41,490
hard career and then comes over to the
UFC and I always got like really strict

2890
02:40:41,491 --> 02:40:43,290
drug testing and all this other shit.

2891
02:40:43,291 --> 02:40:46,350
And so when he took off
from that drug test, man,

2892
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:50,820
I mean that was a just a colossal fuck up.
You're better off testing positive.

2893
02:40:51,130 --> 02:40:54,780
If you test positive they, they, they
ban you for nine months. That's it.

2894
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:57,510
That's fine. You, they
ban you for nine months.

2895
02:40:57,511 --> 02:41:00,180
They tell you can't fight that guy
and you know you have to go through a

2896
02:41:00,181 --> 02:41:04,140
suspension. But when you take off they
had to send a message. They're like,

2897
02:41:04,170 --> 02:41:07,020
this is for life.
Like you can never fight again.

2898
02:41:07,290 --> 02:41:09,030
I personally think that's too much.

2899
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:13,320
But the fear of it and the fact that he's
going to be out for who knows how many

2900
02:41:13,321 --> 02:41:15,360
years while he fights it and if he wins,

2901
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:17,790
a lot of people think
you will win in court.

2902
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:21,750
The Nevada state athletic commission
doesn't have the jurisdiction to test him

2903
02:41:21,751 --> 02:41:25,350
against his will, you know,
in between contests cause
he wasn't licensed for them.

2904
02:41:25,770 --> 02:41:29,270
Like in preparation for a licensing,
the idea of random drug testing,

2905
02:41:29,310 --> 02:41:32,130
a lot of people have issues with that
including like van Julie's attorney.

2906
02:41:32,370 --> 02:41:34,740
But the bottom line is they're
going to make you go to court.

2907
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:36,750
You're going to have to do
battle and even if you win,

2908
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:39,630
they'll let you fight again.
You still wasted all those years,

2909
02:41:39,650 --> 02:41:41,970
your light and no one's going to run
from a drug test again because they're

2910
02:41:41,971 --> 02:41:46,530
gonna know that the drug test like
running for it is way worse for you than

2911
02:41:46,531 --> 02:41:49,170
taking it and failing it.
That's the message they're trying to send.

2912
02:41:49,230 --> 02:41:51,480
They're trying to clean up the
sport and there's only one way.

2913
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:55,080
You got to take your test and if you fail,
well you have to be punished.

2914
02:41:55,230 --> 02:41:58,230
It's that simple.
Otherwise you're not playing by the rules.

2915
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:00,690
If you're not playing by the rules,
you can't fight for us.

2916
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:04,560
You can't just run away. You know,
I don't agree with the suspension.

2917
02:42:04,561 --> 02:42:07,560
I think a lifetime suspension
is ridiculous, especially since,

2918
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:10,130
look vandelays not gonna fucking he's,

2919
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:12,270
he's not going to become a
composer or he's not going to,

2920
02:42:12,271 --> 02:42:13,770
I mean you're taking away
the guy's livelihood.

2921
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:17,040
I mean he can teach and
you can train guys I guess,

2922
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:19,890
but Vandelay still has fighting him.
He still wants to fight.

2923
02:42:20,130 --> 02:42:21,670
He had some good fights lined up at Shell.

2924
02:42:21,671 --> 02:42:25,710
Son In flight would have made him a fuck
load of money. That shale son and fight,

2925
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:28,530
I dunno. Like what they're
going to pay him for that,

2926
02:42:28,531 --> 02:42:29,760
but how much that fight will be worth.

2927
02:42:29,761 --> 02:42:33,030
Especially if he could beat Chael
Sonnen and it do it in Brazil.

2928
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:37,380
That would be gigantic. But he fucked
up too man. When he was on that show,

2929
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:40,980
he got embarrassed.
Like the Brazil was upset at him.

2930
02:42:41,010 --> 02:42:45,060
There was a lot of people in Brazil
that are upset at his performance and

2931
02:42:45,061 --> 02:42:47,550
behavior on the show where
he attack Chael Sonnen. They,

2932
02:42:47,551 --> 02:42:50,130
a lot of people thought he made
them look bad and she'll sign it.

2933
02:42:50,131 --> 02:42:51,960
Took them down real easy on the show.

2934
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:55,260
You know Vandelay took a swing at
shale and shell duct and took him down.

2935
02:42:55,261 --> 02:42:58,410
It's like come are we see and what's
going to happen on the show like you,

2936
02:42:58,411 --> 02:42:59,940
you're in and you're
making us look like thugs.

2937
02:42:59,941 --> 02:43:04,080
Like you're starting to fight
in the middle of a fucking
a television broadcast.

2938
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:07,470
Talk all the shit you want, but be
there when the actual fight goes down.

2939
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:12,130
So both the guys tested positive for
shit. It wasn't just, I mean Vandelay

2940
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:13,570
might not have tested positive,

2941
02:43:13,571 --> 02:43:17,080
but essentially did and Shell son was
10 he was positive for everything.

2942
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:20,860
Everything that existed, everything
other than testosterone, he was on,

2943
02:43:20,890 --> 02:43:24,230
it was on all these different
testosterone boosters and the EPO,

2944
02:43:24,231 --> 02:43:28,720
which the Lance Armstrong Shit to make
more oxygen, your blood, you know,

2945
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:29,770
they have to clean up the sport.

2946
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:33,430
It's unfortunate they're Vandelay has
to go out like that. Cause the guy was,

2947
02:43:33,431 --> 02:43:37,540
you know, so he can't find even
Atlantic city like nope, yard nowhere.

2948
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:39,490
He can't fight anywhere now.
I'm only kidding.

2949
02:43:39,491 --> 02:43:44,110
I not finding where Bella tour was going
to hire him to do promotional shit for

2950
02:43:44,111 --> 02:43:47,170
them and the UFC is like, Eh,
you're under contract with us.

2951
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:51,760
Like not only can you not work
for, you know, US fighting,

2952
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:56,910
but we won't let you work
for the competition in any
sort of a promotional way.

2953
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:00,400
But that was also because of, Angela
talked a lot of shit. You know,

2954
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:05,550
he was talking to a lot of shit
about the UFC and who the fuck knows?

2955
02:44:05,681 --> 02:44:08,950
Man, it's sad. I hope he, I hope
it all gets cleared up. I mean,

2956
02:44:08,951 --> 02:44:10,900
I think the guy should've
got suspended for a while,

2957
02:44:10,901 --> 02:44:14,520
but I don't know what the number is.
A drug test was the GIA.

2958
02:44:14,650 --> 02:44:17,290
The feds came right to my house.
I wouldn't open the fucking door.

2959
02:44:17,770 --> 02:44:21,520
I wasn't even hot. I was
high fuck being hot. Fuck.

2960
02:44:21,521 --> 02:44:26,500
Last night or two nights ago, I was
fucking high on weed or coke. Everything.

2961
02:44:27,970 --> 02:44:31,470
I sent my wife subway, where the
fuck did I go by? Friends came out.

2962
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:34,960
I was on probation, but I did
something. I told my wife,

2963
02:44:35,070 --> 02:44:36,640
me and my buddies would go to aspen,

2964
02:44:36,641 --> 02:44:40,120
so she left that after to her parents
or something with the baby and I fucking

2965
02:44:40,121 --> 02:44:44,770
stay at the house, both plastic
and they called me. They go,

2966
02:44:44,771 --> 02:44:48,070
what are you leaving like? Well, I'm
already at the fucking gold right now.

2967
02:44:48,071 --> 02:44:50,590
The car is coming. We'll
leave with like, okay,

2968
02:44:50,591 --> 02:44:53,910
we thought you said five o'clock no, no,
no. One o'clock I believe in right now.

2969
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:56,170
I've got to go and I don't
know about 10 this way.

2970
02:44:56,171 --> 02:44:58,810
The guy knocked out the fucking door.
We were talking in the kitchen.

2971
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:02,590
We got a high and I had to go upstairs.
They kept knocking.

2972
02:45:02,980 --> 02:45:07,790
I think I could hit somebody and
then nothing. Are they allowed to,

2973
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:11,860
you're not allowed to break again, just
drug test. You just come to your house.

2974
02:45:12,340 --> 02:45:14,890
But if he would have knocked him, I
said, I'm gonna give them a drug test.

2975
02:45:14,891 --> 02:45:19,530
She would came back with a share a right,
right, right. They call the sheriff

2976
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:24,910
test, open the fucking door. The,

2977
02:45:25,270 --> 02:45:29,350
you know what's the most fucked up his
drug test for companies where they test

2978
02:45:29,351 --> 02:45:31,750
you for weed and you're not even like,

2979
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:35,080
it's not even like while
you're on the job, like ups,

2980
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:36,520
something like along those lines,

2981
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:40,120
like they'll test you to make sure
you're not doing drugs while you work for

2982
02:45:40,121 --> 02:45:43,720
them is if someone can tell
you what to do with your time.

2983
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:45,310
Like when you leave,

2984
02:45:45,790 --> 02:45:49,810
like you could start drinking at Monday
at five o'clock you could ask everybody

2985
02:45:49,811 --> 02:45:51,850
at work, Hey, you guys
want to go do drugs.

2986
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:55,540
Let's go down to the bar and do liquid
drugs. And everybody's like, yeah,

2987
02:45:55,541 --> 02:45:58,690
we're going to go meet Joey for a
couple of liquid drugs. You know,

2988
02:45:58,691 --> 02:46:02,990
and everybody's fine with that because
it's all alcohol. It's all legal. And,

2989
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:04,570
but if you said, hey, you know,

2990
02:46:04,571 --> 02:46:07,270
you guys want to smoke some joints
after this silver, everybody be like,

2991
02:46:07,271 --> 02:46:09,290
what the fuck man,
you're gonna get fired from ups.

2992
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:13,100
They're going to drug test you. You're
fucked. And they will, they, they could,

2993
02:46:13,101 --> 02:46:16,570
they could hit you with a random drug
test him and they can fire you bait.

2994
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:21,610
And you could get drunk as fuck from
5:00 PM to 10:00 PM Sunday night crash,

2995
02:46:23,691 --> 02:46:27,440
wake up, head pounding, drive
into work, hungover as fuck,

2996
02:46:27,441 --> 02:46:31,430
drinking pedialyte and Gatorade
and water and, and you're fine.

2997
02:46:32,150 --> 02:46:34,140
Nobody know where you can say a word.
They'll drug test you.

2998
02:46:34,141 --> 02:46:37,850
You pass a flying colors. As long as
you're not actively drunk on the job,

2999
02:46:38,090 --> 02:46:38,923
you're fine.

3000
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:39,630
Yeah.

3001
02:46:39,630 --> 02:46:42,740
So that's some goofy shit.
A kid hit me up from boulder.

3002
02:46:43,310 --> 02:46:48,140
He went together job at fish. Huh? They
take your fucking hand out Jack. Oh God.

3003
02:46:48,141 --> 02:46:51,950
Of the please take your
hair and that goal,

3004
02:46:52,190 --> 02:46:57,020
that's an invasion of privacy to Vegas
to at those casinos hair. Come on,

3005
02:46:57,080 --> 02:47:00,230
give us the answer. You can't
smoke weed, can't do nothing. Dog.

3006
02:47:00,830 --> 02:47:03,160
What if you have a medical prescription?
There's a lot of places.

3007
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:06,450
Don't even give a fuck.
Even if you haven't had as big D as well,

3008
02:47:06,490 --> 02:47:09,440
because they give a fuck about a
medical prescription fuck about nothing.

3009
02:47:10,130 --> 02:47:12,170
I was thinking the same
thing I was thinking about.

3010
02:47:12,171 --> 02:47:14,180
Let's say a guy that's in
the California in prison,

3011
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:19,030
not getting the right
medication for whatever it is.

3012
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:20,740
I guess eventually that's going to happen.

3013
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:24,610
Some guy in prison is going to
raise his hand and go the attorney,

3014
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:26,410
I don't know what he's going to win,

3015
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:28,600
but you lose your rights
when you're a felon.

3016
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:32,420
You really lose your rights to
what do you lose your rights?

3017
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:36,230
But I don't think you lose your
rights to proper medical attention.

3018
02:47:36,470 --> 02:47:39,860
So if you get that diagnosed
with ADHD or something like that,

3019
02:47:39,861 --> 02:47:43,880
a doctor says cannabis as medication.
What do you think? And it's a state law.

3020
02:47:44,030 --> 02:47:47,540
It's a state law. This is a federal,
the federal law is the real issue.

3021
02:47:47,780 --> 02:47:51,100
The federal.
So somebody in California eventually gone.

3022
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:54,140
I'm not getting the right medication in
prison because they know we're almost

3023
02:47:54,141 --> 02:47:56,630
out of time. So I got to ask you
about this because this just came out.

3024
02:47:56,720 --> 02:47:59,000
What the whole John Jones thing,
you know,

3025
02:47:59,240 --> 02:48:02,120
knowing your past and your
past experiences with coke,

3026
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:04,190
what did you think about
that when that all went down?

3027
02:48:05,790 --> 02:48:06,410
Okay.

3028
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:08,600
I had heard rubish not gonna lie to you,

3029
02:48:08,690 --> 02:48:13,610
I just didn't say that to you because I
didn't want you drilling me that night

3030
02:48:13,611 --> 02:48:15,290
we were in Vegas and we ate the mushrooms.

3031
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:17,600
We came back and John
Jones had done a table.

3032
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:22,770
I told Darra with Jon Jones got up this
room cause he's doing a blog from him.

3033
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:27,680
Ally to people told me, you know, be,

3034
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:30,560
I don't care. I never repeated
it. I'm not that type of person.

3035
02:48:30,561 --> 02:48:34,750
I just foot did surprise me.
I'm not mad at him.

3036
02:48:35,330 --> 02:48:36,260
It breaks my heart.

3037
02:48:37,720 --> 02:48:40,420
People are sitting in adult
do blow and I watch Erin.

3038
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:44,980
How can a champion risk his family and
everything? Cocaine has no nothing.

3039
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:48,820
I had a baby inside the
rule with my wife in there.

3040
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:52,960
I been on federal probation and I'm
snoring blow outside of hide the B as this

3041
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:55,840
though, I would let the dog
out. That's what I would do.

3042
02:48:56,930 --> 02:48:59,090
She'd be in the room, read, what
are you doing? I'm letting it go.

3043
02:48:59,091 --> 02:49:02,930
Got that dog was the only dog that went
out every 15 fucking minutes go out.

3044
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:07,270
I open the, crack it, drink it
down and put it back in the snowed.

3045
02:49:07,290 --> 02:49:10,740
I do two wines and go back in the house
was a hilarious knowing that they were

3046
02:49:10,741 --> 02:49:12,540
going to throw me in jail,
knowing,

3047
02:49:13,430 --> 02:49:17,310
knowing that we're going to throw me
in jail if I piss test knowing I would

3048
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:17,851
drink vinegar.

3049
02:49:17,851 --> 02:49:21,630
I told the story on him before what I
went through that year in the halfway

3050
02:49:21,631 --> 02:49:23,150
house,
drinking vinegar and putting food,

3051
02:49:23,151 --> 02:49:28,151
cleaning up my deck and a cranberry juice
and vinegar and Gatorade and just let

3052
02:49:28,981 --> 02:49:33,510
it get go. When you're addicted, right.
That nothing means anything, you know?

3053
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:35,130
Here's the question.
Here's the question.

3054
02:49:35,310 --> 02:49:38,460
Is it possible that a guy could just
enjoy a little coke every now and then?

3055
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:43,620
Yeah. You'd say yes, he's, yeah, but
you, you don't have a addiction thing.

3056
02:49:43,621 --> 02:49:45,120
You've done coke before.
You've never been a day,

3057
02:49:45,121 --> 02:49:47,920
but he's found himself in dark places.
If not, he'd do whatever he like.

3058
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:51,690
He knows how scary it is. I see. You
wear it every night. I can see. Yeah,

3059
02:49:51,691 --> 02:49:53,730
I can see where it can for certain people.

3060
02:49:53,731 --> 02:49:56,860
Once you get scared with
them that you respect it.

3061
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:58,530
But don't you get scared with alcohol too?

3062
02:49:58,531 --> 02:50:00,590
Like if you get really
drunk and fucked up,

3063
02:50:00,591 --> 02:50:03,090
I been really drunk and fucked
up before it was like, wow,

3064
02:50:03,091 --> 02:50:06,570
you could die from this. You
know, I've thrown up garbage cans.

3065
02:50:06,571 --> 02:50:10,080
I mean I've been hammered before where I
really, oh, I think I'm wondering like,

3066
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:13,320
isn't that just as
destructive as cocaine now?

3067
02:50:13,321 --> 02:50:17,160
Because you're not spending hundreds
and hundreds of dollars every night on

3068
02:50:17,161 --> 02:50:20,280
alcohol usually. You know, here's a drink,

3069
02:50:20,281 --> 02:50:22,710
a bottle of Jack and he'd
QCC where cocaine there.

3070
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:27,570
You'd be up til 10 in the morning still
buying it, you know, cause you keep going,

3071
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:31,020
you keep on going because it's, it's
energy. It's pretty much just like, hey,

3072
02:50:31,080 --> 02:50:33,730
I'm awake. I feel great. I want
to get shit done and I want to.

3073
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:36,300
So that's the issue is
that you keep going. Yeah.

3074
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:39,210
So like a guy like Jon Jones
who has a lot of money,

3075
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:42,360
like the money's not an issue for him,
but to keep them going.

3076
02:50:42,361 --> 02:50:45,980
It's an issue keeping guard and
bitches man, because they just love on.

3077
02:50:46,170 --> 02:50:47,050
What was he going?

3078
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:52,230
I feel very bad for Greg Jackson's
camp because somebody had to know that.

3079
02:50:53,430 --> 02:50:53,881
Yeah,

3080
02:50:53,881 --> 02:50:58,570
well people probably knew but they also
knew he's the baddest motherfucker and

3081
02:50:58,820 --> 02:51:02,520
deciding right now nobody just goes
by as a package does it by themselves.

3082
02:51:02,690 --> 02:51:05,910
It's going to be doing it with somebody.
And my heart goes out though.

3083
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:08,430
But does it, but do you think he
could be fine with it? I mean, Brian,

3084
02:51:08,431 --> 02:51:10,740
do you think he could be fine with it?
Do you think that if you,

3085
02:51:10,741 --> 02:51:13,030
if you're a disciplined guy,
you know because you,

3086
02:51:13,031 --> 02:51:16,150
you haven't had the problem that,
that maybe Joey's had, you know,

3087
02:51:16,151 --> 02:51:19,860
you've never been like full on addicted
like for long periods of time now.

3088
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:23,370
So do you think that a guy like him was
an athlete? Is, was a strong mind to dude,

3089
02:51:23,371 --> 02:51:25,980
is very disciplined. I mean,
Jon Jones, when he's training,

3090
02:51:25,981 --> 02:51:28,200
like when he trained for this
fight for Daniel Cormier,

3091
02:51:28,201 --> 02:51:30,330
he was fucking disciplined.
The word on the street,

3092
02:51:30,510 --> 02:51:35,250
the word from Albuquerque was this fucking
guy's training hard twice a day doing

3093
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:38,420
everything he can to beat this model.
He got to pump this up before I'm,

3094
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:42,270
he wasn't trained that hard. He got
popped for weeks before the fight is true.

3095
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:45,570
That's a good point. He wasn't training
that hard. He was still doing the cocaine,

3096
02:51:45,571 --> 02:51:48,210
which is by boggling to a guy like me.

3097
02:51:48,211 --> 02:51:51,180
But I understand that
because I was addicted. Uh,

3098
02:51:53,030 --> 02:51:55,500
it just, it just depends how much he
does. I know people that just do it.

3099
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:59,760
A couple of months I had a friend that
was a tremendous athlete and one night in

3100
02:51:59,761 --> 02:52:02,520
front of me, he whipped out a
package, levels died and I go,

3101
02:52:02,521 --> 02:52:06,010
what the fuck are you doing? And he
goes, at the of the nine, I always

3102
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:08,330
do two bumps. I could drink
with the rest of these assholes.

3103
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:10,630
And I throw it away or I give it away.

3104
02:52:11,080 --> 02:52:15,500
He could do two bumps at Drake like it
was no tomorrow for two or three hours p

3105
02:52:15,501 --> 02:52:19,850
at a golf because Drake, boy,
that's children different.

3106
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:23,800
Everybody has a different hardware
and different way of doing coke.

3107
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:27,730
Some people could do a little coke,
but as we take the starch off he is,

3108
02:52:27,731 --> 02:52:32,470
he in the drug world. Everything's a
party. I'm happy they caught him down.

3109
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:34,650
I don't know what level of the
addiction he was up to him.

3110
02:52:34,651 --> 02:52:38,110
Maybe he just done it the first time.
None of us know until he tells the truth.

3111
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:42,010
And it's also a thing of
John is so fucking good.

3112
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:46,360
That may be while he's doing it and he's
still winning, he's still beating guys.

3113
02:52:46,361 --> 02:52:49,690
He's so good. He can do coke
four weeks out. You know,

3114
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:54,640
he could dunk coke three days before Doug
Lawrence Taylor was fucking, you know,

3115
02:52:54,641 --> 02:52:57,400
Friday night in New Jersey.
You're playing Sunday. Really?

3116
02:52:57,880 --> 02:53:01,000
We think Lara's Taylor went home and
drank Gatorade. Well, how bad is it?

3117
02:53:01,001 --> 02:53:05,760
Fuck you up. If he did do it on Friday,
not Schwab Bank, let's say fuck Trump.

3118
02:53:05,770 --> 02:53:09,330
Your heart, your breathing, it fucks up
laughing, but once you get back in there,

3119
02:53:09,331 --> 02:53:11,410
your fucking back in there.
I know as a comedian,

3120
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:14,830
if I did it two nights in a
row and affected me as a comic,

3121
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:16,960
I couldn't really control by words.

3122
02:53:18,440 --> 02:53:21,430
I could control a lot of things and I'm
very good with a lot of things in my

3123
02:53:21,431 --> 02:53:24,370
system. The THC in edibles,
what's that? Good coke. Two days.

3124
02:53:24,371 --> 02:53:27,910
You could tell it as a cop. You're talking
about raging two days all night long.

3125
02:53:27,911 --> 02:53:32,340
All morning. Like I'm grabbing a half
till four in the morning. I Bet I was.

3126
02:53:32,490 --> 02:53:36,550
You know, I could do two
grams in the night before the
morning, go back to sleep.

3127
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:40,240
I'm talking to him. The doe drinking
I do on Thursday. That Mike,

3128
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:44,230
I do that by standing up was
falling apart with fighting.

3129
02:53:44,231 --> 02:53:46,630
It's something different. You
want to be crazy. But then again,

3130
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:51,670
when I sold sports information, I always
did better with a hangover. Braille.

3131
02:53:51,730 --> 02:53:56,620
I was unconscious. I worked off
technique, I worked off technique,

3132
02:53:57,310 --> 02:54:01,240
technique. I was unconscious. Everything
had to be so he didn't overthink things.

3133
02:54:01,270 --> 02:54:03,790
I didn't know the thing thing. I
closed him. I stuck to the pitch.

3134
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:08,020
I took those beats. So maybe when
you're unconscious you're more,

3135
02:54:08,320 --> 02:54:11,740
I'm not saying that this poor kid did
it before he fought. I can't see it.

3136
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:15,990
Listen right here with the route. We've
been 24 years I've been doing standup.

3137
02:54:16,030 --> 02:54:20,190
I did cocaine and one on
stage one time March 17th,

3138
02:54:20,190 --> 02:54:21,610
1992 was my second year doing comedy.

3139
02:54:22,270 --> 02:54:24,460
I feel like I could do coke
like Richard Pryor and talk.

3140
02:54:24,550 --> 02:54:27,460
It doesn't work so that Michael
Richards. Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

3141
02:54:27,900 --> 02:54:30,220
It doesn't work that way.
You do coke and go on stage.

3142
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:32,600
You might kill one time as Kennison.

3143
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:35,920
If he killed at the end it was a
nightmare and you have no emotion.

3144
02:54:36,310 --> 02:54:37,210
You have no abortion.

3145
02:54:37,390 --> 02:54:41,150
The cocaine cuts to your heart and the
material so all you are is right back.

3146
02:54:41,151 --> 02:54:45,700
Give me your jokes, right? I
hear what you're saying. Pop,
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

3147
02:54:45,701 --> 02:54:49,900
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. When I say
a joke, I, man, I let goes on the,

3148
02:54:49,990 --> 02:54:52,720
I've seen guys that have cropped
up on stage two and there are,

3149
02:54:52,750 --> 02:54:55,450
they are very robotic robotic.
It's over. You're just,

3150
02:54:55,510 --> 02:54:57,910
you're working off
technique and with stand up.

3151
02:54:57,940 --> 02:55:02,590
You can't work off technique with
Jujitsu and be punching. Yeah. You know,

3152
02:55:02,591 --> 02:55:05,900
I could grab all right, but not the whole,
which stand up. There's no technique.

3153
02:55:05,901 --> 02:55:10,190
The technique is by emotion. The
technique is my pain. I have to fuel that.

3154
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:14,150
I have to feel that energy
once I have the bridges broken.

3155
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:19,250
Once I do blow, once I do blow
my brother, the bridge breaks,

3156
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:22,400
there's no disconnect.
And I could still yelled at jokes at you.

3157
02:55:23,390 --> 02:55:25,690
What are you going to chicken crosses.
You know what I'm saying? Right.

3158
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:30,590
But there's nothing there. So I don't
see it. I just hope he gets better.

3159
02:55:31,010 --> 02:55:34,460
You know, I hope that,
uh, it was, uh, you know,

3160
02:55:34,461 --> 02:55:38,510
it's just something that he was doing
every couple of weeks just to burn some

3161
02:55:38,511 --> 02:55:41,740
energy. It's amazing that he partied
like that and still kick everybody.

3162
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:45,140
We don't know what he did. We
don't know how he party. Well,

3163
02:55:45,141 --> 02:55:47,900
we know he was doing coke four weeks out.
We don't get up.

3164
02:55:47,901 --> 02:55:51,300
Just haven't been with a girl. They have
like, we could have done a blast. Good.

3165
02:55:51,530 --> 02:55:52,520
Listen,
you want a girl?

3166
02:55:52,521 --> 02:55:56,960
She got a tremendous piece of
pussy fucking diamond studded.

3167
02:55:57,030 --> 02:56:01,760
I'm belly button. Uracil
smell like flowers. You know
what? Maybe even do coke.

3168
02:56:01,830 --> 02:56:06,410
Maybe she put a coke rock in a pussy. You
looked at, you know, baby, you touched it.

3169
02:56:06,411 --> 02:56:09,440
There's so many fucking things.
But if I came to you and said Joe Rogan,

3170
02:56:09,770 --> 02:56:14,330
I didn't do blow. I just put it on
the girl's belly button. She always,

3171
02:56:14,331 --> 02:56:17,420
Jesus, I've known you 20
years you got with that one.

3172
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:20,650
What was only metabolites
that tested for it?

3173
02:56:20,651 --> 02:56:23,930
So somewhere between two and four
days before that is was, well,

3174
02:56:23,990 --> 02:56:27,680
it was a great test because usually
the cocaine's gun, 72 hours.

3175
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:31,050
This test got you till about
eight or nine days. All right?

3176
02:56:31,100 --> 02:56:35,240
We're running out of time. We
did our three, uh, when, uh,
when can people see again?

3177
02:56:35,390 --> 02:56:38,020
