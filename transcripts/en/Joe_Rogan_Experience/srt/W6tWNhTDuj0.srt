00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,890

mad flavor,

12
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,460
Aka Ciotti as if it's
two in the afternoon.

13
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,300
If you ain't how I go,

14
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:18,931
fuck yourself.

15
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,764
Got On my face.

16
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,770
I want you around me like I want cancer,

17
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,640

18
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,160
and I'm saying,

19
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,993
have you ever heard,

20
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,751
oh,

21
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,710
I fucking hate rant.

22
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,920
I don't know how the fuck people are gonna
eat that shit and see the blue cheese

23
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,290
with wings and go fuck your mother.

24
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,500
That's the next year.

25
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,801
All right,

26
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,250
please.

27
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,380
I knew you were going to give me
that slush plan a fucking week.

28
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,550
Look at my fucking eyes bled.

29
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:35,691
Look,

30
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:35,970
Heidi,

31
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,480
you got,

32
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,980
I tell the story now and stage.

33
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,660
The guy who used to drive us,

34
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,490
he started smoking and then he goes,

35
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,020
I can't drive unless I'm fucked up.

36
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,580
That's a quo

37
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,010
I want.

38
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,060
I'm going to put you on the Rogan.

39
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,650
Hold on a hey.

40
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,420
Have you ever watched her Rodeo
and felt sorry for the bowls?

41
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,083
No Sir.

42
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,940
He grew up extremely religious and they
told you when you masturbated that you

43
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,490
were impregnating a demon.

44
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,181
When you're doing it,

45
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:03,260
some demon comes and like,

46
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,750
she's like a round you fucking
you as you're fucking your hand.

47
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,040
Did you masturbate as anyway even knowing
all this [inaudible] you ever throw up

48
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:10,874
on a check?

49
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,670
No,

50
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,350
I did right as I was about to eat it

51
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,020
when I was like I had girlfriends
they'd sleep over and uh,

52
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,680
I would,

53
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,513
I would

54
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,490
kicks in the middle of the night like,

55
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,180
like my,

56
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,390
my whole body would choke like a kid
cause I was having a fighting drink.

57
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,600
That's the name of good
Bruce Springsteen album.

58
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,240
Make,

59
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,570
make my own spirit when I
threw kicks in the night.

60
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,003
Yeah.

61
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,020
Girl that was hot that
you were friends with.

62
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,860
You weren't somehow or another trying to
think how am I going to get the fucker?

63
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,003
My mother,

64
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,471
sorry,

65
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,304
the bad joke.

66
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,333
Sorry.

67
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,120
Duncan just went straight red band seven,

68
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,871
seven,

69
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,310
seven,

70
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,050
all of Guardian.

71
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,120
I think as a business,

72
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:56,850
the only way to protect herself
from like these like hacks,

73
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,260
like anonymous and stuff like that.

74
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,160
It's just to have a shitload of cats on
your website just because that's like

75
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:02,341
saying,

76
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:02,611
Hey,

77
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:02,761
I,

78
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,270
I,

79
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm on the Internet too.

80
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,410
I like cats and hamburgers and,

81
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:08,880
and what the fuck are you talking about?

82
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,410
All right.

83
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,201
You want me to explain it?

84
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:10,410
It says,

85
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:10,621
no,

86
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:10,741
no,

87
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,130
no,

88
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,963
definitely not.

89
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,470
A really bright retort at the
Faneuil hall comedy connection.

90
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,270
A black woman called the club and she say,

91
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,260
who wanted to show tonight?

92
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,891
And they said,

93
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:20,101
well,

94
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,090
it's Anthony Clark,

95
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,890
Jackie Flynn and Greg for 10 months.

96
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,723
And a lady goes,

97
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,860
is grapefruit Simmons the headliner

98
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,800
roll call?

99
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,160
He is your friend Joe Rogan
is the mom until Rhogam.

100
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,800
He's got the best damn podcasting.

101
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm flashing forward here
at Joe About 30 years,

102
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,590
the year in the hills of
Colorado at this point,

103
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,630
podcast still going strong.

104
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,760
You're sitting there with a full beard,

105
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,410
like a full gray beard.

106
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,110
You're just waxing crazy poetic old man.

107
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,771
Talk,

108
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,340
lashing out against the government.

109
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,230
You're right next to me,

110
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,064
motherfucker.

111
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,140
So as a young comic working at
the Boston Comedy Club one night,

112
00:02:59,141 --> 00:02:59,871
Tracy Morgan comes in,

113
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:00,130
he goes,

114
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,251
hey,

115
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,001
you want to get high?

116
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,541
And I was like,

117
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:01,830
yeah,

118
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,471
it gives it to me.

119
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,210
I hit it and it tastes like shit.

120
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,601
And I'm like,

121
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,590
what the fuck is this?

122
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,011
And he's like,

123
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,020
PCB who never smoked before.

124
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,770
And I'm like,

125
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,100
you just give me fucking
Igor opens the door.

126
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,190
And all I say to Igor in
Russian is I am the machine

127
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,470
lobby,

128
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,580
a single cell organism.

129
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,260
We're all having a good time down here.

130
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,330
The bottom of the ocean flow.

131
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,810
Anybody wants to change her?

132
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,660
You got to come through me.

133
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,340
I love being a carbon molecule.

134
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,840

162
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,040
He said,

163
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,470

164
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:20,770
