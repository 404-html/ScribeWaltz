1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,090
Hello Sweet bitches out there in
cyberspace or wherever you are.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,900
Maybe you're on a treadmill right now.
Maybe you're in your car, maybe driving,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,230
maybe a board is fuck at work. Wherever
you are, we're here for you bitches.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,950
Well, that's the delay. That's my laptop.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,290
That's the difference between what
I say and when it reaches you.

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,290
So think about that while this is
going on, what's you're hearing?

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,300
Is it fucking timewarp?
Okay,

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:31,170
it's seconds behind the actual
reality of my words. Like,

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,420
oh no asteroid at soc,

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,480
we got hit and then the power went off
and then use stream gets it five seconds

11
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:44,040
later. Well, if an astroid
hit like Arizona, it would
take a while for, we'd knew.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,370
Well, no, not really. That's too
close. But if it hit like Sweden,

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,370
we probably wouldn't know
for like a second or two.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,760
We'd probably would hear about it
like a week in advance though. Well,

15
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:56,190
if one of those dinosaur
killers is on the way we,

16
00:00:56,191 --> 00:01:00,840
that'd be fucking looting and rioting and
there would be no more squarespace.com

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,110
like how a segue. It's like a professional
should be on the radio. Squarespace, uh,

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,870
by the way, uh, we, um, they
made a mistake in their copy
and I was wondering why,

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,110
uh,

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,030

Squarespace.

25
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:33,420
Brian has made literally dozens of
websites while we've been doing these

26
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,670
commercials and they're excellent.
It's like the,

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,900
there was a time where it was
sucky, man. It was hard. You know,

28
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,560
I had Andrew created some
of my, uh, my original,

29
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,170
Aka menthol from the quake days,

30
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,560
created some of my earlier a websites
and Brian created one of them,

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,940
but it's not fucking easy,
but now it is.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,590
Now it's really easy.

33
00:01:55,591 --> 00:02:00,591
You could make your own bad ass website
just with the just regular understanding

34
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:06,300
of how to use a computer drag and drop
and shit like that. Super easy to do.

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,730
And it comes out amazing.

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,520
So amazing that Squarespace
wants to have a contest. Uh,

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,890

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,710
Tac toe thing. If you're like,
what the fuck is a Hashtag?

42
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,290
And you don't have anybody that can
tell you if you're the smartest one,

43
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,490
you know,
and you're an idiot,

44
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,120
it's very possible you could
live in like somewhere bad. Jay,

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,150
Hashtag this tic TAC toe jre Squarespace
do it before January 17th and we'll

46
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:49,050
pick four winners who have designed the
most beautiful websites. Um, Squarespace.

47
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,350
We'll give these went, we'll do a
whole little thing about it. We'll,

48

we'll examine your websites.
We even give you some props.

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,110
Maybe if it's a website for your business,
we'll start a fucking explosion.

50
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,930
That will lead really to a financial
windfall. You better if I said that.

51
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,490
Well that's Lauren.
Anyway,

52
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,790
these people who were in these four will
get a free year of Squarespace and we

53
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:14,110
will send those winners a swag bag with
items like a Squarespace apple keyboard,

54
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,410
a tee shirt,
a mole skin and more.

55
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:22,411
So visit squarespace.com right now and
use the code Joe and the number one

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,080

Do that.

57
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,520
And then tweet your website
to Hashtag Jerry Squarespace.

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,220
Poor pound signs. Yeah, no love anymore.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,460
It's a Hashtag now exchanged
like out of nowhere.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,180
How come they have matured and moved
on and why did they allow that?

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,253
It's the prince.

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,520
It's probably someone who like had like
Hashtag like they own the name Hashtag

63
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,740
and the fucking hated the pound time.

64
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,400
Like that pound guys at Dick
Guy owns pound fuck pound.

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,340
It's not pallets fucking Hashtag now.
And it worked.

66
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,730
We're going to repurpose this
whole need for existence.

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,230
They figured out how to do it though.
That's what's amazing.

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,550
Like they pulled it off.

69
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:05,410
They actually pulled off the the Hashtag
cu and now you'll get people in the

70
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,750
next few years. Where kids now, why
is there a Hashtag on the phone?

71
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,650
What do you use this once? It's
there once it's named, it's named.

72
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,990
How the fuck did they change it? It's,
that's amazing. It's got confused.

73
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,610
So many kids.
It's going to confuse the shit out of him.

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,090
They did a really good job.

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,630
If you really looked at it from
like a conqueror standpoint,

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,620
hashtag dominated the pound sign.

77
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,860
We're not going to have it dialpad in
the future. I'm surprised we still do.

78
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,550
You know? Yeah. Most likely.
Yeah. Um, anyway, uh,

79
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,640
stamps.com is our other podcast sponsor.

80
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,650
stamps.com is where Christina Palicki
in Thompson, girl from your mom's house.

81
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,100
They send their stuff out using
stamps.com Bert Kreischer,

82
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,110

you bought any of those desk squad tee

shirts from Brian Red Band,

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,460
he sends them out through stamps.com we
have massive experience with stamps.com

86
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,670
we love them. We trust them. We
recommend them wholeheartedly.

87
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,080
It is a way easier solution.
If you send things,

88
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,490
especially if you have a small business.

89
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,160
If you're like making your
own macrame or some shit,

90
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,410
you're doing something weird and
you want to send it out to people.

91
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,280
You used to have to go to the post office,
wait in line,

92
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:16,060
they weigh the different packages. Each
one's d. It takes a long fucking time.

93
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:16,900
You don't have to do it any more.

94
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,820
You could do it from the comfort of your
own home and if you use the code word

95
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,900
j, r e they will give you a free digital
scale that will get you started off.

96
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,650
It's super easy to do. You weigh
your packages on the digital scale.

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Then you print off real us
postage from your home computer.

98
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,250
Slap that bitch on. Boom.
The Post Postman comes,

99
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,770
you give it to him and you're off.
That's it.

100
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,070
You cut out that whole disgusting process
of waiting in that horrifying line and

101
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,370
just riding your life away. Don't
do that part. Don't do that part.

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,110

by [inaudible] dot com if you haven't

109
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:23,270
been on it for awhile.
We're constantly adding new things.

110
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:26,090
We're constantly finding new supplements,

111
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,960
new strength and conditioning equipment
and just do stuff that we find that we

112
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,980
feel is beneficial.

113
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,830
One of the big ones is we've started a
whole series of a artistic kettlebells

114
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,020
and I know a guy like Scott Sigler horror
author can appreciate that the fantasy

115
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,230
behind the Zombie kettle
bells or the primal bells.

116
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,030
The idea behind them is you will work
out harder if you really were fighting

117
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:53,270
against the fucking Zombie invasion. If
you're preparing for the Zombie invasion,

118
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:56,770
you have to keep your family alive.
You will have that extra revenue.

119
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,650
You will have that one extra set where
you don't want to do it anymore. And uh,

120
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,540
if you swing around these fully functional
Zombie Bell Kettle Bells that can,

121
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,590
that can give you that feeling,
they can give you that, that,

122
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,430
that fear that you need
to complete your workout.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,810
My favorites of the primal bells, cause
I'm a big fan of the monkey community,

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,720
big fan of the apes. Mad shout
out to all the primates. Uh,

125
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,960
I just love the fact that they're artistic
and they're actually fully functional.

126
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,530
We Act,

127
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,530
we had them besides being designed and
drawn and created by this Guy Steven

128
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,460
Shubin Jr. We also had them
three d printed. We all,
we, we hit three d balanced.

129
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:39,170
Rather we had to make sure that when
you're swinging this kettle bell,

130
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,300
it'll have the same functional use as a
real kettle bell that just looks like a

131
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,870
smooth cannon ball.
So it's not just a design.

132
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,850
They work just as well as a real credible
and they will fucking last for the

133
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,500
rest of your life.
I mean,

134
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:59,501
look at the giant metal sculptures that
are heavy as fuck and you get to see a

135
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,370
look on the Postmates face
when he delivers that shit.
Like what the fuck son?

136
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,590
What are you doing here?
Um,

137
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,950
you don't even need a big one to get a
good workout in. I do one of my workouts,

138
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:13,910
the entire workouts with one 35
pound kettle bell. We sell that DVD.

139
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,840
That's the Keith Weber Kettle
Bell Cardio extreme workout.

140
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,480
It's fucking madness. That dude's a
savage. He does it with a 45 pounder.

141
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,960
That fucking animal.
Um,

142
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,780
we saw all sorts of different
things that we feel, uh,

143
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,030
help with a athletic performance and
what you would call functional strength.

144
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,200
That's the trend these days when you
see all this crossfit type stuff and all

145
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,610
this people that are training,
you know,

146
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:41,180
you see mixed martial arts training with
club bells and battle ropes and shit

147
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:41,750
like that.

148
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,130
The idea behind all of that is that in
the olden days when they used to do just

149
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:50,570
like, you know, preacher curls and you
know, things, things along those lines,

150
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,700
there were things that were good
and there's things that were bad,

151
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,120
but there was a lot of people
that were imbalanced. In a few uh,

152
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,870
view laugh at the,
the,

153
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,710
the classic meathead is the guy who is a
meatball with two toothpicks holding it

154
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,670
up. Guy Who's got a gigantic upper body
and a small lower body. He's not balanced.

155
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,730
He's not, that's not an athletic body.
That's not a body, a little work for you.

156
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,280
That's your, you're being silly
bitch and your tits are huge.

157
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,390
You don't need that in your life,
okay? You want functional strength.

158
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,560

173
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,380
Tiffany is going to be with our,
our only or Austin and Dallas show.

174
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:07,320
So it's a Houston.

Yeah.

176
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,050
Tony Hinchcliffe.

177
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,930
And we're doing a podcast before a show
and then the following day we're going

178
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,310
to be an Austin.
And then Dahlia,

179
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,490
so you do a live podcast,
live podcast.

180
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,470
Which one are you gonna
do you gonna do kill Tony?

181
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,190
Are you going to let like local comics go

182
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,280

183
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,700
we're just going to make it a mess.
Perfect. Yeah, bringing alcohol.

184
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,640
Don't try and do it. So, but yeah,
exactly. Be careful here in Texas,

185
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,160
they don't play games.
They party hard.

186
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,280
Texas parties hard and I do a
blackout podcast before the show.

187
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,860
I feel like you will,
whether you want to or not.

188
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,440
Why are you pretending like he played
on the side of some piece of art.

189
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,870
It's just going to be what it is.
Don't be silly son. Uh, so, uh,

190
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:52,440
where are these dates? Where
the uh, the actual clubs?

191
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,070
It's January or this Thursday.
It's going to be in Houston.

192
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:59,280
It's going to be at
Fitzgerald's. Uh, and then, uh,

193
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,120
the following day it's going to be an
Austin with Tiffany Haddish at the spider

194
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:03,960
house ballroom.

195
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:08,130
And then a Saturday it's going to
be at the curtain club in Dallas,

196
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,110
Texas with a squad TV

197
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,380
for all the info on all Brian stuff.

198
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,660
And that's where you can also
buy those t shirts, you know,

199
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,710
all the kitty cat desk squad tee shirts.
Um, I mean the Houston this weekend. No,

200
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,830
I'm not in Houston. I'm in Phoenix this
weekend. Jesus Christ. You're in Houston.

201
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm in Phoenix. Where am I?
I'm in the valley. Um, I mean,

202
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,970
uh, the Phoenix standup live,
which is fucking awesome venue.

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,230
I love that place. And I'm there with
the lovely and talented Thompson Guerra,

204
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,930
who's one of the most fucking
hilarious dudes on the planet.

205
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,170
So I'm really psyched. I Love
Phoenix. Phoenix is a fun town.

206
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,770
They don't take themselves too seriously.
They like to party. They like to drink.

207
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,130
They're close enough to la. The not
retarded. They get, they get the vibe.

208
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,220
It's a fun place. Uh, I'll be there
this weekend with a Tommy Cigar

209
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,220
and then January 24th I'll be at the
Chicago theater with the Super Jew.

210
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,190
Are you should fear slinging Dick.
He's definitely moving. He's a,

211
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,080
he's going to be here for the winter.
Look, it's minus 10 in New York right now.

212
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,490
Cool. December, right? Yeah. I Dunno
call this. I've ever heard about it.

213
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,260
I never heard about minus 10 minus 10
is ridiculous, Scott Sigler. It is,

214
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,860
it's not necessary.
Right.

215
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,600
I moved away from Michigan specifically
cause I don't like minus 10. Yeah.

216
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,680
Or 20 or 30. Michigan's rough dude. How
you lived there your whole life. Yeah.

217
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,460
I live there. A write up to about,
uh, early, early thirties or so.

218
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,030
We're just going to after that San
Francisco, uh, that's a good place to go.

219
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:37,140
Was Dead, you know, traipse
about the country, three
months here, six months there.

220
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,710
Never made it out of San Francisco
is a big difference between the,

221
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,510
the general mentality of
Michigan versus San Francisco.

222
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,190
It's very unusual when you go to two
places that are so completely different.

223
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,310
You Go,
oh look,

224
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:52,560
this can happen to a bunch of people
can just act like this or you know,

225
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,510
you can go to like Vancouver or something
where everybody's nice and friendly

226
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,201
and you're like,
okay,

227
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,830
you could just be in this weird town
where everybody's nice and friendly or you

228
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,500
could go to Boston and they want to
beat the fuck out of your way. Like, Oh,

229
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,190
you know,

230
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,420
this could happen to there really there
really is a cultural signature to every

231
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:11,590
place. The difference between Michigan
and San Francisco was pretty dramatic.

232
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,410
What did that feel like when
you made that transition?

233
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:17,500
All of a sudden you're around all
these like I mean San Francisco,

234
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:21,690
super liberal and really
like open minded about,

235
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,710
I mean I always feel like as far as like
socially when you look at the entire

236
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:31,570
country, like as far as like the most
progressive parts of the country,

237
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,650
you have the coasts always, you know, the,
the most progressive, but at all of them,

238
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,360
San Francisco seems to
be the most extreme,

239
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,110
the first to be like super
accepting of gays. The first,

240
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,590
I mean the whole Berkeley psychedelic
movement, all that shift from the CFTS,

241
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,560
the echoes of that still feel like
they're hanging around that place.

242
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,580
And it's even changing again now with
all of that.co texts version on the tech

243
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:57,380
people and rents are rising and
real estate's never really slow.

244
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,170
I mean it leveled out
at a couple of places,

245
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,860
but it's never dropped and it's
come back up. And um, you know,

246
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,430
the inability for people working a regular
job to even be able to afford to live

247
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:10,870
in a city is worse now. So it's the
whole, I think the whole liberal,

248
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:15,220
just salt of the places is changing again
and now it's just becoming about money.

249
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,020
You're totally right. Yeah. The real
estate prices there are fucking crazy.

250
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,490
Yup. There was a, there's one neighborhood
that I was looking at. I was just a,

251
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,160
I was there visiting a friend. I was
like, wow, this place is beautiful.

252
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:31,360
It's like near San Jose.
This houses were like a regular,

253
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,540
it was like a regular house and it
was $9 million. Yeah. And I was like,

254
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,410
what the fuck is that? That's a regular
house. It's not even a crazy mansion.

255
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,800
It's a beautiful house,
but it's just a house house house.

256
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,730
The biggest shock we had was,
uh,

257
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,370
we came to San Francisco and start looking
around and one of the places phones,

258
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:52,010
literally, it converted. It's a one
bedroom apartment that is now a tenancy

259
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,450
in common or a condo and it's a
one bedroom bout 750 square feet.

260
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:57,710
It was $800,000.

261
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,810
And I had worked in Michigan for a
company that built homes and for basically

262
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,650
for 800 grand in Michigan. You own
everything you see. Yeah. Like God,

263
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,930
you have like one of those Ted
Nugent compounds. You've got,

264
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,240
you've got your own herd of elk on campus.

265
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,210
It's just nuts and that that's a one
bedroom and it really hasn't changed all

266
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:18,140
that much since then, but you'd have
to live in Michigan to ignore it,

267
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:23,150
to enjoy it rather. Yeah, well, yeah,
you have to like 10 below and there's,

268
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:27,530
you know, there's no comparison for the
cultural broadness of San Francisco.

269
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:30,500
There's a ton of crap to do there
and a ton of things to experience.

270
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,100
I don't know. That's worth 800,450 square
foot apartment, but it's pretty sweet.

271
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,750
Yeah. That's a bizarre thing when the
amount of wealth in an area and becomes so

272
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,290
concentrated that regular
people just can't live there.

273
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,120
He just literally can't afford to.

274
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,380
It's getting crazier and crazier because
there's so many people that have made a

275
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,040
lot of money and technology and they,
they're centered around that area.

276
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,970
I mean the amount of wealth,
the concentrated amount of
wealth in San Francisco,

277
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,580
just tech wealth is,
and a lot,

278
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,430
a lot of stuff's coming up from silicon
valley now back in his San Francisco and

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,200
that close enough that I feel like
it's the same thing. It's pretty,

280
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:10,190
it's pretty similar now there's even
protesters blocking like the Google bus,

281
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,020
the Google buses that pick up all the,

282
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,070
the 20 something Ivy League graduates
who are just wicked, wicked, smart,

283
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:19,580
hardworking people who go to work for
Google and they get on their bus with

284
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:20,940
their Wifi.
You know,

285
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
it's so it's perfect little limo bus and
then you've got regular working class

286
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,220
Joe's parking in front of it
with a picket sign and you know,

287
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:32,570
sometimes rattling the bus or throwing
stuff at the bus. They're really,

288
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,660
people are blaming the silicon valley
tech companies for the rents rising to the

289
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,010
point where if you just want
to work at like a bookstore,

290
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,690
if that's what you're calling is,
you want to do that.

291
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,840
You can't afford to live
in the city at all anymore.

292
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,080
Those people are are super mad that
they can't live where they want to live.

293
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:51,290
It's a, it's a strange
situation. That's very strange.

294
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,220
I don't think I can recall any place
where that's happened before that I know

295
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:58,160
about. I can't think of it.
I can't think of it either.

296
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:01,270
But you know to be one of these people
on the bus and all of a sudden you know

297
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,000
the populous is rising up against you
in burning torches and banging signs

298
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,910
against the bus. That's got to be pretty
scary. Yeah, and all you there is working.

299
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,180
Yeah.

300
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,370
They're trying to do what you gone to
school for and which you're practicing

301
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,360
with. People are so
fucking strange. It's hard.

302
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,370
It's super hard for the people
working in these companies to relate.

303
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,260
I think because I've had the opportunity
to go do a couple things in the Google

304
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:26,000
campus with a company I used to work for
and they are super hardworking people.

305
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,460
Super Nice,
really creative and clever.

306
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:32,840
I mean all of these cultures are very
open and letting people pursue what they

307
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,900
want to pursue and they, they just
bust their ass. They work really hard,

308
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,260
so it's how you can't really relate.
I have a good friend who works for Google,

309
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,360
she loves it there. I think that what
you're dealing with when you, you,

310
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:48,361
you see a situation like this
is this insane new wealth,

311
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,160
the this insane tech

312
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,920
wealth,

313
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,530
this industry that it's over the last
couple of decades become so gigantic

314
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,190
because the amount of money that
it generates is just freakish.

315
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,950
When you think about like cell phones,

316
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:04,320
think about any other product
that you sell. You know,

317
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,640
you might have one and this guy might
have while like say if you make like a

318
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,660
vacuum sealers for food,
I like to keep my vegetables fresh.

319
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,040
How many of those are going to sell, sell,
sell phones though? You're going to sell

320
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,200
ah, fuck clothes they catch on. Yeah.

321
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,700
[inaudible] of people on the planet.

322
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,650
Like the amount of money you can make if
you sell cell phones is fucking beyond

323
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:30,770
comprehension, right? Well, they're,
they're, they're like one of these,

324
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:31,441
like how many of these,

325
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,680
and they saw the lumber barons and the
steel barons and the oil barons of all

326
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,800
the, all those different times
and it history. One bigger.

327
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,450
The Vanderbilts came out and just had
in crazy amounts of money and all the

328
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,580
steel and everything else.
It's exactly the same thing.

329
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,630
It's this brand new thing that all of
the world needs and it's controlled by a

330
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:51,290
limited amount of people, but the
people are smart as fuck. Yeah,

331
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,450
it's really a good, good
amount of Pete. You know,

332
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:56,300
if you're going to be controlled by the
right amount of people or the right kind

333
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,530
of people, the Google people,
not bad robots though.

334
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,020
Now they've got a share per kilo.
They're preparing because seriously, man,

335
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,510
if other people get killed,
the robots

336
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,230
first, we've got a real problem.
It's the Oppenheimer dilemma.

337
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,650
Do you make the atomic bomb knowing it's
going to kill millions of people or do

338
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:17,190
you let the Russians make it first and
kill millions of people over here or the

339
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,024
Germans rather?

340
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,770
It's the same dilemma.

341
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,860
Well Google Google's cutting out the
middle or the government, just like,

342
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,110
we're going to be able to protect
our own stuff. It'll be fine.

343
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,010
What do you think Google?
Yeah,

344
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:29,760
Google is going to start buying arms
companies next or making their own.

345
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,900
The robotics people like, oh, I
know a couple of people. You know,

346
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,830
I make a robot dog, but I also know Mike,
Mike, my neighbor, he makes missiles.

347
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,660
When would you guys want to do things?

348
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,860
Thinking that you could fucking hiring
the greatest engineers of our day to

349
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,210
build missiles for Google?
Come over. We'll have a kegger.

350
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,280
We'll put all this stuff together.

351
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:50,690
And one day in like 2024 Google just
shows up at the Federal Reserve and Gos

352
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,160
stop. It's over yet. Get
Out. Everybody get out.

353
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,120
We run things now. We don't want,
when I want your money anymore.

354
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,260
Does it mean anything incredibly?
I mean,

355
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:02,780
this is not conspiracy theory to
say it's not all that far fetched.

356
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,900
If they buy up the weapons,
making technology and have all this stuff,

357
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,380
their ability to influence policy could
get pretty, pretty significant. So

358
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,420
our ability to,
uh,

359
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,820
to first of all as citizens to,

360
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,920
to recognize that we're getting screwed
over on a daily basis and also recognize

361
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,760
that the government is invading our
privacy on a daily basis. You know, when,

362
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:28,680
when people start recognizing those
kinds of things and you'll look at the,

363
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:32,250
like some of the, some of the lawsuits
that had been brought up against people,

364
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:33,084
some of,
uh,

365
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,610
some of the people that have lost like
giant chunks of their time and their life

366
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,780
fighting off the government,

367
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:44,170
whether it's because of taxes or because
of regulations or whatever the fuck it

368
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,013
is.

369
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,350
If you stopped and thought
like engineering that and
making it the way it is,

370
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,350
you would never, you'd never design
it this way. That's the way it is.

371
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,070
It's so gross. And the IRS can
go after people that, you know,

372
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,740
if you don't pay your taxes,
they just throw you in prison.

373
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,760
They want you to be so scared that you
have to pay them their money if you don't

374
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,361
pay them their money,

375
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:08,620
they treat you as if you're a dangerous
criminal that you have to take out of

376
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,610
society. And lock in. You are a
dangerous criminal to them. They're,

377
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,760
they're an organization and a company
just like anybody else. And if it gets,

378
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,710
if the information gets
out there that yeah,

379
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,950
there's really no repercussions
for you not giving us our revenue,

380
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,260
then they're screwed. Then
enough people say, yeah,

381
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,900
we're not paying you and you've lost
your income and your company goes under.

382
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,860
Did you hear about the beanie
babies thing? No. The guy
who created beanie babies,

383
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:34,660
he paid $1 billion in taxes and they're
like, hmm. Not Enough. What I like,

384
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,980
we need like 1,000,000,005 million.
He hid some, some money somewhere.

385
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:42,040
He had some money. This mother Fucker,
if he paid $1 billion in taxes,

386
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,640
he's probably on coke all day.
It has no idea how much money he has.

387
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,680
Probably nothing to do. Nothing to do with
this thing. You know, like hiding money.

388
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:53,650
Like, what are you talking to please
fucking made beanie babies. He's not like,

389
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,740
you know, he's not a nuclear
engineer. He's a crazy fuck.

390
00:21:56,741 --> 00:22:01,180
That made something that for some reason
made him so much money that he paid $1

391
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,890
billion in taxes.
But they're like,

392
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,020
that's the look that one up
and he dd to pay some more.

393
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,520
That's a lot of money in taxes.

394
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,970
You think $1 billion in taxes would be
for frigging beanie babies would be good.

395
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,130
It's ridiculous.
It's completely ridiculous.

396
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,610
So when Google takes over
and skynet goes live,

397
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,470
you know that guy will get his money back.

398
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,710
That is all the Federal Reserve pay him.

399
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,080
Google's the Robin Hood of Beanie baby
founders. But uh, maybe would she,

400
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,650
I mean I don't think it's outside the
realm of possibility that our government

401
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,750
and our,
not just our government,

402
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:36,751
but our military is run through technology
and just a few years to the point

403
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:41,920
where it's gonna get real gray.
Whether or not like who has power?

404
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,470
Is it going to be country?
Is it going to remain countries?

405
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,660
Is it going to eventually
shift into corporations?

406
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:50,740
Are Corporate entities and we were talking
about like how much money there is in

407
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,680
technology and creating things
at a certain point in time.

408
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:56,770
The technology is going to reach the
point where people can essentially do

409
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:59,890
whatever the fuck they want. You
know, there's the ongoing question is,

410
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,400
are the corporation is actually running
things now already as the government

411
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:07,420
come relatively puppet structure based
on who's pumping the most campaign money

412
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,350
in et cetera.

413
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,740
And now you're talking about artificial
intelligence coming into the place.

414
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,840
I say yes, yes, yes.

415
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
And I think it's absolutely the case
of the corporations have gotten to an

416
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,720
insanely influential place,

417
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,820
insanely powerful ability to control
the results of elections and the,

418
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,560
the way the world works.
I mean it's really incredible,

419
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:36,180
but what's most incredible is that
it's a bunch of people, corporations,

420
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,520
just a bunch of people,
bunch of people are doing some things.

421
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:43,420
It's like really bad for humanity can
make you fuck loads of money for the

422
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,130
corporation, for the
corporation. You at it from, you

423
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,770
know, the artificial organism
structure of a corporation.

424
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,700
You know how low the Coca Cola company
has been alive longer than any human

425
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:55,880
being on the planet. You know,
and now you've got whatever these,

426
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:59,930
and it's a lot like the means of
religion or, or national nationalism.

427
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,340
These structures,

428
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,670
the self replicating and self supporting
structures have been built up and they

429
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:08,450
live longer than we do.
So now corporations, yeah,
well they're not people,

430
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:09,350
but at the same time,

431
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,360
that's a successful organism right there
and it's fighting to stay alive and

432
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:17,660
dominate how it wants to dominate. Yeah,
that's the real skinny on it, right?

433
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,250
It's a thing. It's a system.
It's an operating entity and it,

434
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,180
it's made out of people, but it really
likes money more than it likes people.

435
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:26,661
I mean,

436
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:29,870
it's really amazing that people have
created something that's not entirely self

437
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:34,871
serving and it protects itself as it
weird structure of ones and Zeros and

438
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,420
buildings and paper. And it's, to me,

439
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:42,530
it's really a borderline organism
because it's a, as a collective organism,

440
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,450
all of the people working within it,

441
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,190
there's a certain pattern of behaviors
that have led to those corporations being

442
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:53,810
successful and living for a hundred
years or longer and only people who are

443
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,050
following those patterns of
behaviors mostly are going
to be successful in there.

444
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,620
So it's self perpetuating. So you've
got this certain type of behavior,

445
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,770
which has always put the company first,
screw the rule of screw people,

446
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,380
go out and make things
profitable that works.

447
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,580
So these companies grow and continue to
live and spawn off other companies and

448
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,210
it just keeps on going. So I mean,
to me they're, you know, they're,

449
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,670
they're not living organisms only
by a technicality of definition.

450
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,030
That's a fascinating way of looking at it.
Now as an author,

451
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:23,450
when you see something like this that
you see may perhaps like a good majority

452
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:27,260
of the people have probably overlooked
you when you look at it like that.

453
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,550
I mean that's, it's, it's got to seem
like almost like a work of fiction.

454
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,413
I mean if,
if,

455
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,570
if the system in and of itself like the
way it's constructed now and just the

456
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:39,170
idea of sending people to go kill people
they don't even know on the other side

457
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,330
of the world,
like all of it is just so bizarre.

458
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,040
If it didn't exist in this form and
someone brought it to you as a script,

459
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,260
you'd be like, whoa. To
fucking cooperate. It's a lie.

460
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,340
It's alive and it's eating. People look
at how many people the corporation comes.

461
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:57,660
Oh my God, it's eating
painful. Yeah. Well you know,

462
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,710
even going back to the sky net concept of,
you know,

463
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:05,000
that's science fiction 25 years ago and
you are now getting to the point with

464
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,610
the globe, you know, the,
the global nature of the
Internet and everything else.

465
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,900
If you were able to get some kind of
powerful online entity or an artificial

466
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:14,480
intelligence that's not at
all far fetched anymore,

467
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,050
that somebody could control everything,
not even a little. So it seems inevitable,

468
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:22,490
right? I don't know about inevitable.
It's definitely, definitely possible.

469
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:26,960
The leap from having a system that can
communicate everywhere all over the world.

470
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,260
At one time and then jumping to
something that can actually make its own

471
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:33,170
decisions and decide its own destiny.
I think that's an,

472
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,620
I know very little about it but
that's way bigger than people think.

473
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,873
It's not just,

474
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,040
oh we're going to make this smart
robot and it will go through and make

475
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,170
decisions.
You know,

476
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,100
self determination is a whole different
ballgame that they haven't been able to

477
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:48,900
tackle yet. So, uh, I it,
it's definitely possible. It
doesn't seem inevitable to me.

478
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,790
To me it seems inevitable.

479
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,360
It seems inevitable just based on
the exponential growth of technology,

480
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,690
meaning the, you know, one
equals two and two posts,

481
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:59,280
one he's three and then three
plus two is five. When you,

482
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,990
when you start seeing how quickly
things are developing and how quickly

483
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,060
technology is improving and enhancing,

484
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:10,050
you realize that like if we were in a
horror movie and there was a horror movie

485
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:13,380
about robots that eventually took over
and just start raping people and eating

486
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:18,000
them, it would probably start off a
lot. Like what we're seeing on the news.

487
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:22,260
We'd have like quick flashes of like a
new robot technology and then six months

488
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:26,220
later Sony releases another one and then
five months after that they create some

489
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:29,550
sort of an artificial brain cell that
actually works better than a real brain

490
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:29,970
sale.

491
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,800
They started inserting them into people's
bodies and then you cut to 50 years

492
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:38,250
later,
apocalyptic nightmare scenario,

493
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,750
robots eating cinder blocks, you
know, running down the street,

494
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,560
finding the last vestiges of humanity,
hiding under sewer pipes. You know, my,

495
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,240
my hope isn't whatever does come down
to that. There's still, you know,

496
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:55,830
people are really good at doing labor
and figuring things out and they also

497
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:58,740
breed and make more copies of themselves.
So if you're a robot,

498
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:01,560
artificial intelligence
killing all the peoples,

499
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,440
a complete and utter waste of time,
why would you do that?

500
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:08,910
Here's this relatively free labor pool
that makes more copies of itself and

501
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:12,090
continues to do what you want.
Which goes back to the concept of coke,

502
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,930
the Coca Cola brand or IBM or British
companies that are five and 600 years old.

503
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,000
You know,
that's sort of already happening.

504
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,670
There are self determined
human being sourced,

505
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,670
serving the greater purpose
of the overlord organization.

506
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,220
So your artificial intelligence
could easily be like that.

507
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:30,640
So I'm hoping that when we get taken over
they'll just want to give us jobs and

508
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:31,620
they'll want us to be happy workers.

509
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,490
I think they'll find us so inefficient
and stupid. They'll want to eat us.

510
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,880
I mean to think they'll treat us
the same way we treat chimps. Yeah.

511
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,160
Like shut the fuck up and get in the cage.
I think if they use us at all,

512
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,630
they'll have like a show that amuses them.
Well they'll have the,

513
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,210
these are actual real people.
This the last of the real people.

514
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:55,260
We keep them in his cage, make them
fuck but treat them like killer whales.

515
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,303
Here's the music.

516
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,430
Here's a museum to show you the way
things once were a long time ago,

517
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:04,050
people needed food. Ha ha ha. Everybody
will laugh. They'll think it's hilarious.

518
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,590
They'll think natural people are just
ridiculous. The idea of a natural person,

519
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,180
it can easily become redundant.

520
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,030
And this is a trope that's played
on science fiction all the time.

521
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:13,740
And I have it in some of my books too,

522
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,820
which is once you get your artificial,
uh,

523
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,180
race or artificial intelligence, the
point where it can reproduce on its own,

524
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,420
when robots can make
other versions of itself,

525
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,520
that's when we're no longer necessary.

526
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,650
When something can breed
to make copies of itself.

527
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,350
And I'm not necessarily talking
a big factory crank things out,

528
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:35,310
although that works when robots can
basically basically make baby robots that

529
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:39,000
harvest energy and resources from the
environment and get bigger and become an

530
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:42,010
adult and fully functional and
capable of carrying work, then

531
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,220
we're screwed. There's no
need for us anymore. Just
competition at that point. He,

532
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:48,130
as soon as they figured out
how to make better robots,

533
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,820
like you guys made a fucking
terrible design with us.
Let's just fix all of that.

534
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,540
I mean, I wonder if we're arrogant
and thinking that our, our, uh,

535
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,050
special abilities as people,
whether it's our emotions,

536
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,430
our creativity or whatever,

537
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,330
that they're actually really special
and that they're not replicable.

538
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,950
But what if robots are like, oh dummy,
it's so easy to make something like you.

539
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,860
Yeah. Like you're not even that
complex you guys are based on like,

540
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,020
it's really pretty obvious emotions,

541
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,570
very predictable behavior
patterns under stress.

542
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,390
Like you guys are fucking simple.
You like,

543
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,220
you like to thank your super
complicated cause it makes you happy.

544
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,080
Well there's all this stuff we've always
thought was complicated or impossible

545
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,570
and the now we do all the time and yeah,

546
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:28,810
somebody at some point could crack the
chemical code of our behavior be like,

547
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,760
oh he just mixed a little bit of this,
a little bit of that boom.

548
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,990
Next thing you know he's crying.

549
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,110
This robot's crying cause he got his
heartbroken at the prom and then boom,

550
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,100
blade runner, blade runner. Then
those scenes with Rutger Hauer.

551
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:42,400
What'd your Howard is dying and he
doesn't want to kill Harrison Ford,

552
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,070
but he was thinking about killing him.
But he,

553
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,750
he loves and respects life
so much so he doesn't,

554
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:51,250
he winds up ultimately not killing him.
That's a fucking powerful movie, man.

555
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,400
And not far off from what would actually
happen if you had something and you

556
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:59,530
engineered emotions into it. And
if he didn't, then what do you got?

557
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:02,770
You got to fucking city filled with
robot psychos that have no emotions.

558
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:06,760
You would want to engineer all the same
flaws that people have if you wanted to

559
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:10,420
create artificial people when in fact if
you did that, wouldn't they be a person?

560
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,630
Yeah. Wouldn't they be subject to
jealousy and poor decision making?

561
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,680
And there's everything outside of
drugs cause they would be robotic.

562
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,130
I'm sure they'd have their own
robotic drugs of some kind. You know,

563
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,890
various buyers isn't reprogramming
and anything you want,

564
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:28,630
but they'd probably the point battery
or batteries at some point. It, well,

565
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:31,180
when they put their tongue of the battery,
it's a whole different experience.

566
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,530
At some point it would become
indiscernible. You couldn't
tell the difference. Um,

567
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,540
gosh, I'm forgetting it.
But there's that, uh,

568
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,890
something test where you put a blindfold
and put a blind between people.

569
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:45,670
And if you can't tell the person on the
other end of that computer is a robot or

570
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,910
a person as a human being, you
can't tell, am I talking to a robot?

571
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,660
Am I talking to human being texts for him
in Texas and Warren voice or text form.

572
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,610
But if you get to that point,

573
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:58,540
that's one of the definitions of we
have gotten closer achieved artificial

574
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,540
intelligence. When you as a
human can't tell the difference,

575
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,430
that's when you're really close to that.

576
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,740
And a emotions would be a big
part of that in the movie.

577
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:09,040
It will show people talking into
their phones, asking Siri questions,

578
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,850
googling things and while they're driving
so it'll show those sort of things

579
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:16,990
like that. They willingly
accepted into the robot fold.

580
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,680
We're letting them in. We as no question.
Yeah, we're completely symbiotic now.

581
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,810
Completely leave your phone at home. It's
like you left your Dick Behind. Yeah.

582
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,920
Like what do I do now?
Do not leave home without my Dick,

583
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,750
so I'm going back for that. Good.
Yes. Keep my phone screwed on. Yeah,

584
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,650
and before long they're going
to come up with some solution.

585
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,400
It runs on your own body's energy,

586
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:40,010
no longer needing to charge
itself in the wall. You

587
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,530
know, you could always get it
surgically removed and like, hey honey,

588
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:44,930
I can always get it surgically
removed and next thing you know,

589
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:49,040
you've got some robot patch on your arm
that you're dialing and it goes straight

590
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:53,480
into your ear. It's calming, it's
calming implants or the next.

591
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,780
That's the next big wave of,

592
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,750
of all of these things that
we carry on all the time.

593
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,030
We're going to have a little
USB ports on our forearms,

594
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,350
stick it in that little
wireless man. Everything will
be wireless. Ocular ocular,

595
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:05,990
either contact lenses or
inserts below the IRS.

596
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,750
I would suggest you see everything.
You turn your Wifi off.

597
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,290
His people are going to hack you. Yup. You
don't want that. Why? This is not good.

598
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,570
If you're going to match,
it's going to have to be hardwired.

599
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:18,250
We're going to need ports within a matrix.
Ports, Lazy. That's like you want that.

600
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,900
You want the Matrix sport.
Everybody else can be like, man,

601
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:24,200
I got to reach this from here to
there and plug it in. Screw that.

602
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,530
Just give me a wireless option. Do you
really think that people are that lazy?

603
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,380
Oh God, it's ridiculous. There's
plenty of people probably lazy.

604
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,160
There's plenty of people that would plug
their headset in that I think there are

605
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,610
vastly more who would totally go at.
People were a lazy,

606
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,290
lazy bunch as a species,

607
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,090
but they got to that point where they're
not willing to like plug something into

608
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,900
their heads. It's going to let them, do
you know, anybody who's ever complain,

609
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,930
they can't find like the remote control
I have to get up and change the channel

610
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:54,440
or something like that or it just
helps you. But I think there's more,

611
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,060
there's less people than that. Less
people like that. Then we would like, see,

612
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,260
this is seditious talk you're having now.

613
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:03,380
You're one of the people wants to plug in.
You don't want the wireless.

614
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,290
They're going to be what Google
will be watching you, sir. Um, no,

615
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,770
I don't mind the wireless look.
Ultimately it's all going to be,

616
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,860
it's going to be probably Tesla fired.
You know,

617
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:14,990
like Tesla wanted to have
electricity in the atmosphere.

618
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:17,690
You want to broadcast electricity and
Westinghouse found out what he's trying to

619
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:20,630
do and like get the fuck out of
here and they shut his program down.

620
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,510
His idea was to wildly transmit
electricity. The same way people wire,

621
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,510
you know, they, they transmit radio
waves or transmit wifi signals,

622
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:30,740
right?

623
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,630
He was going to wirelessly
have electricity fucking
floating around us in some

624
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:38,390
strange way. I don't, I mean I don't
even understand the technology behind it,

625
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:42,320
but I assumed that if it was
Nikola Tesla that came up with it,

626
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,710
this was legit stuff that's
never been picked up. So he,

627
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,960
he wanted to give it away.
What's the other frame?

628
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,200
And that's the corporations
going back to that talk,

629
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,600
the self defense mechanism
of the corporations kicks in.

630
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,320
If there's a resource that's
being given away for free,

631
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,150
any corporation providing that resource
is in danger of being diminished or

632
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:02,984
being destroyed.

633
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,150
So the natural reaction of the group mind
of the people in the company is we got

634
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:08,630
to shut that shit down right now.

635
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,460
This is some Alex Jones talk
doing on us, but we, you know,

636
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,830
we seen it with the Edison
company and their reaction to the,

637
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:19,010
to Tesla and trying to find ways to
stop this technology from coming out.

638
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:20,360
Cause if the technology comes out,

639
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,230
they no longer have that giant cash cow
and that's, that's worth fighting for.

640
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,610
What was the downside?

641
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:29,810
Was there any downside proposed downside
to projecting electricity in the air?

642
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,000
Do you have any idea?
I don't know that much about it.

643
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:34,220
I'm not sure that he had
proven it in a large scale.

644
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,340
Like can it really transfer over
long distances and be economically

645
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,173
viable?

646
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,990
And then there's just the general shock
of people seeing bolts of lightening

647
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,180
flashing across the countryside.

648
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,820
They're not very comforted by it even
though it's exactly the same thing

649
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:50,760
happening. You just can't see it because
it's in a wire. Is that what it would be?

650
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:53,850
You would see the electricity, I'm
pretty sure that's, that's what it was.

651
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,440
It was just blasting
things through the air.

652
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:58,740
I mean you probably have to get refilled
like a lightning bolt hits your house

653
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,580
every time you need more electricity.
It's scary. What about a bird?

654
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,030
What if a fucking bird was flying by
right when you hit the power switch?

655
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,660
I don't know. They burns me just
exploding off through the sky.

656
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:10,680
All throughout cities.

657
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,140
Birds are birds are the collateral
damage of the power industry.

658
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:14,880
They're getting killed by
wind mills right now, so,

659
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,300
but could you imagine if people were just
turning on their lights? Switches in.

660
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,490
Birds are just exploding.

661
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,640
This guy cause of bolts of electricity
would come out of your house and connect

662
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,060
you to the tree.
You know the big metal lightening tree,

663
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,560
some poor burb just be in that path. It
boom. You tough living for the birds.

664
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,140
You'd be walking down the street
and birds exploding over your head.

665
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,950
Birds would just start walking and they
become one of us like a dog or you know,

666
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,770
flying. They would read
eventually. It's good point.

667
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,140
That would eventually
realize through evolution,

668
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,720
the robots team up with the birds
and then we're really screwed.

669
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,970
Sort of like how butterfly develops
that fake eyeball on his wings to make a

670
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,900
prayer. Listen Bitch, I'm
looking at you. You know,

671
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,470
they're not really looking at their,
their stupid butterflies. Yeah.

672
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:59,610
Nature developed that. That was, it
became good for that. Designed to exist.

673
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,120
You know what a bizarre thing that is
and you just stop to think about it.

674
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,980
Like how do you explain that? Just
they develop eyeballs and their wings,

675
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,600
they just happen.
There's those pictures.

676
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,500
There's some mutation where they have a
pattern on their wing that makes them,

677
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,290
that reacts with the Predator.
The Predator looks at it and goes,

678
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,890
that either looks like something I've
eaten that tastes horrible or that looks

679
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:22,260
like something bigger than me and
it's dangerous. And then that,

680
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,230
that butterfly continues on and it
happens again and again and again.

681
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,330
That's the scientific explanation,

682
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,270
but I think there's
something nefarious at foot.

683
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,850
So I think something is afoot,
something studious.

684
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,010
I don't trust them fucking butterflies.
I don't trust them.

685
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:41,220
They're up to something. They made
eyeballs on their wings. I just,

686
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,620
I have a hard time believing that was
just some sort of a random setting.

687
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,980
It's more disturbing as the
caterpillar with eyeballs on its,

688
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:50,010
but it like listens ass up and
it's got two big eyes on there.

689
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,360
I don't like butts looking back at me.
I don't want to, I'm not buying it. No.

690
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:59,130
Find ones that have eyeballs. There's a,
there's some incredible ones where they,

691
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:02,380
they look like like it looks
like cat size. Yeah. That's,

692
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,680
it's so weird. It's, it seems
like someone's trolling us. I see.

693
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:11,760
It seems like more evidence that the
world is made out of magic and somehow or

694
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:12,031
another,

695
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:16,170
some insect is able to develop these
camouflage eyeballs on its wings that are

696
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:20,070
just fence. The robot's already took
over. We're already experiment now.

697
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:20,940
They're like,
we got,

698
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:23,040
we're going to keep giving him something
and sooner or later they're going to

699
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,510
figure this out.
They get the eyeballs,

700
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,120
like they've got to figure it out
now they've got to know it. Yeah.

701
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:31,410
We just make the world's so preposterous
that everybody just stops and goes,

702
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:36,040
wait a minute, what the fuck is going
on? And then Dan [inaudible], the music

703
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,390
starts playing like the curtain draws
and the aliens come out clapping. Well,

704
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:44,680
we didn't think it was going to take
you this long guy go, there's no,

705
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:49,510
people were all looking at that. There's
the owl eyes. Oh yeah, that's nuts.

706
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,760
We're all in the matrix. I've never seen
that one before. Harold Brown Matrix.

707
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,280
Look at those. I'm like the first
reaction I have looking at that,

708
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:00,130
that's gotta be Photoshop is that,
that's for as a whole series of them,

709
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:03,850
there's a bunch of different kinds of
moths or butterflies rather develop these

710
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:07,090
eyeballs on the, on the back
of their wings. So fantastic.

711
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,980
I just love the beauty. Yeah, amazing.
Like a cat. Those are cat's eyes.

712
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:15,970
That's looks like a tiger. It looks
like a baby tiger hiding in the woods.

713
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,100
Ready to Jack you so you
better step birdie. Don't
beat me. I'm a fucking tiger.

714
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,740
Frigging amazing. It's incredible.
I mean, look, it has eyeballs.

715
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,430
If you look in the eye,
it looks like,

716
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,890
like if you had that tattooed on you
and it was an eye, you'd be like, oh,

717
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:33,580
that artist is good. Yeah, that's a good
look at that. Get the fuck out of here.

718
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,590
Just get the fuck out of here. It's a
cartoon fairy. Totally. That's so weird.

719
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,520
And that's real. I don't buy that.
That's, I mean, I know that's the answer.

720
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,280
I know science would tell you that's the
answer, but they didn't see it happen.

721
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,900
There's no, there's no actual
documentation of that particular change.

722
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,320
This man chick in the world,
my friend as an author,

723
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:56,470
I'm sure you must agree with me, you,
you create fantastic works of fiction.

724
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,910
You create an entire worlds in your
own mind. Well, you get into, you know,

725
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,220
the definition of magic can be so broad.

726
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,020
And the fact that any one of us being
alive at this particular moment is such an

727
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,650
astronaut.

728
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,240
The odds against you being here and
living this long are so astronomical.

729
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:15,450
You can't even calculate it.
But here you are.

730
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,920
If we were just here a couple
of hundred years ago. Yeah.

731
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,150
And the fact that we've really only come
into our modern day culture in the past

732
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,500
two centuries or so.

733
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,120
So there's a lot of things I look
at as an author are just staggering.

734
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,340
And even looking at something
like the butterflies, of course,

735
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:33,100
my first reaction is always,
what can I do with that?

736
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,420
How can I work that into a story?

737
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,420
Because that's real and that's cool and
we can do something with it. But yeah,

738
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:37,721
there's,

739
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:42,520
there's a lot of things I look at and
even having a decent knowledge of science

740
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:44,710
and evolution and those things,
you look at it and go,

741
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,660
how the fuck could that happen?

742
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,600
There's a lot of times I find myself
arguing myself like, no, yeah, I'm not.

743
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,330
The one that gets me is like the
crabs that put crap on their shell.

744
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:56,440
Have you ever seen these things?

745
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,590
They put crap on these crabs will grab
whatever happens to be around them and

746
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:06,721
then use the their saliva and glue it
to their claws like a boxer crat and in

747
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,990
the glue it'll glue anatomies, which
are deadly to it, onto its claws.

748
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,080
So if another Predator comes up,
they're like, they put up their dukes,

749
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:16,060
they put up two and enemies,
look up boxer crab.

750
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:19,870
If you guys want to show this wards
off predators and now you can see that

751
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:23,650
anything with that behavior of course as
a survival advantage, that makes sense.

752
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:28,510
But at what point does some crazy crap
eat a bad piece of fish and get so high

753
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,740
that it's like,
I'm gonna go,

754
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,830
come gonna cut this off here and put
this on a closet and waving around for a

755
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:37,040
little. So I see stuff like that. That's
one that always throws me for a loop.

756
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:41,570
Like how did that first actually
happen? That and, and you know,

757
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,950
when I talked to my science consultants,

758
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:46,490
they break it down into finer and finer
detail. Once you say, makes perfect sense.

759
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,680
However, he's got frigging seeing enemies
on his claws. I'm not buying it, bitch.

760
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,420
Look at this. They taught him how to
do that. The power, the pump on grab,

761
00:41:56,421 --> 00:42:00,380
that's a live in enemy on his claws and
anybody screws with them is going to get

762
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:04,040
a mouthful of nomadises
that is up to crazy. Yeah.

763
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,920
The ocean itself might as well
be an alien world. I mean,

764
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:12,900
it really might as well be on
another planet. Yeah. Just stopping.

765
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,960
Oh, that's one thing that I really
wanted to talk about with the ocean.

766
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,130
This is a crazy fucking thing than I just
discovered. You know, a sea shepherd,

767
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:24,320
you know, that, uh, those companies
that go out and fight those whalers, um,

768
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,600
they caught this Japanese whaling
ship and the Japanese whaling ship,

769
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:35,370
they have this really sneaky thing they're
doing where you are allowed to under

770
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:38,580
some provision,
some unilateral agreement.

771
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,920
You're allowed to whale hunt.

772
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,130
You could take a whale if
it's for scientific research.

773
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,070
So they left in some weird
loophole for scientific research.

774
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:51,510
So what these guys do is they go out
and they slaughter these whales and then

775
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:55,020
they say it's for scientific
research and they just sell the meat.

776
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,780
Like they're wailing it
just killing these whales.

777
00:42:57,781 --> 00:43:02,040
But the way they're doing it
is under this weird loophole.

778
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,050
So they're selling some part of the whale,
maybe for science and then selling.

779
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:06,943
Now there's a salad.

780
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,140
The meat for food. They're
selling it as, I mean there's,

781
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,980
they're selling it commercially,
but you can see the, uh, the photos.

782
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:18,540
Did you see the, uh, the images, Brian,
if you go to like sh sea shepherd, uh,

783
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,220
one of the more recent stories about
it, you could, they have, they took,

784
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,810
they've got a helicopter and they flew
over the boat and took photos of these

785
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:28,140
dead whales.
There it is just sitting on it's dark man.

786
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,410
It's really dark.
And um,

787
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,550
if you look as they pull back and they
show you there's a website address and if

788
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,750
you go to that website address,

789
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:41,370
there's an English version and an American
and a Japanese version. But the, uh,

790
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,540
the, the images are pretty shocking
if you go and look at it online,

791
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:49,890
they even have video of them slaughtering
one of the whales. But to me,

792
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,000
when I look at that,

793
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,210
that to me is just like us
going to another planet and
killing some alien being.

794
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,870
We would never stand for that.

795
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:01,470
If we showed up on Mars and Mars had
wheels on it and we just started gutting

796
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:04,950
whales and using it for scientific
research, people would go fucking crazy.

797
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:08,580
Like what are you doing? We found this
intelligent life form that communicates,

798
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:11,370
it has a voice, it has language, it has,

799
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,990
they have some sort of a
weird differentiation between
different sections of the

800
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:17,640
world and they have different accents.

801
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,960
Yeah.
But at the same time,

802
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,940
if there's a resource there that we need
or someone can make money from and the

803
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:29,470
propaganda machine kicks in and we find
this alien intelligence and then your

804
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:30,850
president is on the radio,

805
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,160
this is a significant danger to the
human race and we have to act right now

806
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,080
cause they do all of
these horrible things.

807
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:41,400
We've watched it on our planet dozen
times in our own lifetime where somebody

808
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:45,480
comes out with a propaganda machine and
we're so manipulatable that we'd be like,

809
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,900
oh well if we don't bomb them first,
they're going to bomb us. We are scared.

810
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,780
People get scared. Especially
when they have kids. Yeah. Kids,

811
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,640
I get real scared and they
want to just fucking bomb them.

812
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:56,400
They're dangerous out there. The martians
have weapons of mass destruction.

813
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:58,950
We got to take them bitches out.
But imagine if we went to Mars,

814
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,640
we found some intelligent life forms
that communicate with language and we

815
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:06,240
decided to start eating them.
Imagine the protest.

816
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,890
Imagine how bad people would freak out.
But we don't have any problem. The whales,

817
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,570
whales pretty much aren't hurting anybody.

818
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,690
We've established that they aren't
hurting anybody. So not hurting anybody.

819
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:18,060
And smart. We know that. We
know those two things for sure.

820
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,750
But you know what the thing is?
Nature's so evil herself,

821
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,460
like nature sets whales up.

822
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,850
It makes it so whales can't
defend themselves against
killer whales. You know?

823
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,530
That's why they call him killer whales.

824
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,220
A lot of folks don't know that they kill
whales. They're not whales or dolphins,

825
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,760
but they kill whales.
They're in the you,

826
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,350
the videos of them killing
whales are fucker. Crazy,

827
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,860
crazy cause they know it doesn't,
they don't do it quick. You know,

828
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,740
like they just started eating
this, chewing off a hug. I,

829
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,890
the one I saw when I was a little kid
who was a national geographic and the

830
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:51,710
first time anybody had ever documented
an Orca pack taking out a whale could

831
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,160
have been, I can't remember
what kind of whale it was,

832
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:58,161
gray whale or sperm whale
and they literally chew on
it until it opens its mouth

833
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,300
like in pain and then one swims inside
the mouth and starts non down on the

834
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:05,260
tongue. Oh God. Cause that's,

835
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,040
and as far as they could tell
like that's the good stuff.

836
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,470
That's what they actually want
is the tongue tastes the best.

837
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,320
So somebody gets to go in there and start
chewing on that tongue and then they

838
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:18,240
just, they just kill it. It's hard to
take their side. That's a cunty fish.

839
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,970
Obviously it's hard to
take the killer whale side.

840
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:25,170
I mean I would like to take their side,
but the way they treat whales is fucked.

841
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:30,060
And then you realize, well you know that's
just nature. Nature is just like that.

842
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,330
There's going to be,
it's going to be horrific crimes.

843
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,930
That's what nature is all about. Nature.
Nature is an endless fight for survival.

844
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,470
And if you aren't killing,
then you're going to get
killed and yeah, that it goes.

845
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,470
And if you have no way of
recognizing your culture,

846
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:47,670
if you have no way of objective
Lee assessing your, your situation,

847
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,750
if you're stuck in a world where you
need constant movement, even to breathe,

848
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,700
you're constantly, I mean they're,
they're carrying a lot of body mass.

849
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,930
You need to get fish and they
need to feed all the time.

850
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:01,140
So they're constantly in movement. They
don't have any time for self reflection.

851
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:04,320
They don't have a fucking couch with
a kickback with their pipe and watch

852
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,290
masterpiece theater and
ponder and write poetry.

853
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,240
And then that poetry
can be read by others.

854
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,060
And if we existed in a world like that,

855
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:14,280
we were just flying around
the three dimensional space.

856
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,420
I don't think we'd be very much different
than dog. Well, we weren't. And it's,

857
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,600
it's the development of agriculture and,
and society and,

858
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:26,460
and cities and getting that safety
that comes in in with a large number of

859
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,390
people working together.

860
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:30,220
That's the only thing that's
allowed to do those things as well.

861
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:34,090
You go back 40 50,000 years with us
and it was, there was no different,

862
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:37,210
we'll kill anything that moves,
kill and kill and eat anything that moves,

863
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,580
and if you don't do it,
something's going to kill you.

864
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,030
And it was only the development of society
that allowed people to start writing

865
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:44,950
poetry and making art and
doing all those other things.

866
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,600
Yeah. The development of a place where
you can hang out and not get eaten. Yeah.

867
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,870
And where you had food
stockpiled and you're like, okay,

868
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:55,890
I've got all that covered. Yeah. I got a
wall. I got a gun, I got a steak. Okay,

869
00:47:55,891 --> 00:47:58,980
I'm good. I got nothing to do for at least
the next week. And next thing you know,

870
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:00,570
you're drinking wine
and writing things down,

871
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,840
and then people read that shit
and go, dude, I thought that too,

872
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:07,710
but I just never put it to words. And
then the whole culture expands from there.

873
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,050
Yeah. That's never going
to happen with dolphins.

874
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,600
They've got to keep moving ever
going to like shit, dolphins,

875
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,720
I don't think they're very much
different than us. I know. I know.

876
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:17,250
That's a very hippie thing to say,

877
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:22,350
but I had a experience once on a boat
with dolphins playing wild dolphins in

878
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:26,400
Hawaii. It changed me for life, changed
me for life, just looking in their eyes,

879
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:27,091
experiment,

880
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:31,230
experiencing like laughing with them and
yelling at them and them doing tricks

881
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,861
for you.

882
00:48:31,861 --> 00:48:35,550
I mean they was when they were with us
for over an hour and I was high as fuck

883
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,250
God damn, I was high, I was so hot. I
definitely shouldn't have been on a boat.

884
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,310
But there I was.
And when you're that high,

885
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:46,710
you're very vulnerable and
very sensitive and very,

886
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,800
very introspective and almost
painfully so sometimes.

887
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,210
So me looking in the eyes of though
that Dolphin had me absolutely convinced

888
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:55,380
just watching these things play,

889
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,680
that I'm probably being
extremely prejudice and how
highly I value human human

890
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:05,190
cognition and our ability to change our
environment being the ultimate measure

891
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:06,024
of intelligence.

892
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,200
Well they, they, they couldn't
change her environment.

893
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,110
They have absolutely no need to because
the African adapted to their environment.

894
00:49:12,111 --> 00:49:14,180
They're perfect.
We don't have to worry about sharks.

895
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:15,020
They don't have to worry about shit.

896
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,360
All they have to worry about is those
conti killer whales. Whales eat them.

897
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,870
That's what's interesting about dolphins.

898
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:24,380
They're one of the few species on the
planet that kill for fun because they've

899
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:27,710
got so much brainpower. They're like,
I'm just going to go kill that. They'll,

900
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,380
they'll kill other dolphins.
They'll infanticide.

901
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,930
If you know there are baby dolphins
that aren't produced by them,

902
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:36,080
they'll kill him. Dolphins, rape, which
is messed up, one of the few species,

903
00:49:36,081 --> 00:49:39,350
it goes down and raped.
So with big brains comes big problems.

904
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:43,970
I guess all species kind of raped. I don't
know. I don't think so. No, it's not.

905
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,700
It's not a very common,
it's not a very common thing.

906
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,880
You're heard about the
puffer fish right there.

907
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,450
The getting high with puffer fish,
but like champs to chimps. Rape.

908
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,720
The chimps do too. Yeah, they
will. Yeah. And what about cats?

909
00:49:56,721 --> 00:49:59,810
Can't cause the female cats are too
bad ass. That's a dangerous move.

910
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:02,450
I don't think you want to go there.
Yeah. Fuck that. You get cut up.

911
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,960
He's a fucking her cue.
You mentioned tried to rape a lion.

912
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,180
You'll get in in pack animals.
You'll get drive,

913
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,530
it's driving out the Alpha male of
the pack and then the new new guys,

914
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:14,960
the Alpha Male,
and he gets the spoils of war so to speak.

915
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:18,650
But I don't think there's an enormous
amount of of straight up rape in the

916
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:20,870
animal kingdom outside of the hype.
More intelligent animal.

917
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:25,440
Well it's also, there's probably
no social stigma to fucking,

918
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:28,640
and probably the female tigers
want to have sex as well,

919
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:31,880
so there's not as much of a need
to fuck or to a rape each other.

920
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,940
Doesn't that make sense?
Like if wild animals,

921
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,350
if it just became real rapey like a
rabies, they would never eat anything.

922
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,660
They wouldn't get any work done.
Right. It could be, you know,

923
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,280
speaking out of my ass here,

924
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:45,450
but the dolphin that could be
part of that free time thing.

925
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,520
That's our whole shows.
They don't have anyone in 36 episodes.

926
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,770
No significant predators other than
humans. They don't even really,

927
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:56,490
they're not even really all that afraid
of sharks and they don't have to worry

928
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:59,310
about their environment.
The perfectly adapted and they are smart.

929
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:01,290
So they got time to think
about stuff like, you know,

930
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,410
look at the dorsal fin on that girl.
You know, like maybe they think

931
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,170
too much welded the killer whales don't
give a fuck if they think they'll eat

932
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:11,810
them. Yeah. They go around eating
dolphins, they kill everything. Yeah.

933
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,910
They're the best. They don't
care. They know they're smart
and like, so what? Yeah.

934
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,650
So you're smart to fuck you so you're not
a fish. Oh you so you breathe air. Yeah.

935
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,320
It seems like everything's smart
breeds they're interesting.

936
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,730
Nothing smart figured out gills. Uh, no.

937
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,850
It's all my millions.
It's all a marine mammals.

938
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,640
There's some people who think that the
octopus and squids are really wicked

939
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:37,720
smart,
like being,

940
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:41,410
being able to be tool users and figure
out puzzles significantly. But yeah,

941
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:44,950
that's the only quantic breathing
animal that I can think of.

942
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,300
Here's the problem with that argument.

943
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:49,000
They don't have any houses and they get
eaten by fish. Yeah. That's ridiculous.

944
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,930
Not that fucking smart. They're not that
smart. So they know how to open a jar.

945
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:55,800
Whoa. Fucking now can teach
a dog to open the jar,

946
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,620
close the lid behind you and
you're home free. God is not hard.

947
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,130
I'm a three year old can open a
fucking jar. Right. That's so stupid.

948
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,020
Think that they are super intelligent.

949
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,660
They have also ability to
communicate with their skin,

950
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:10,990
which I find incredibly fast.
Amazing to watch. That's just nuts.

951
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,330
The visual communication, they, they,

952
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,510
they used to think at one time that
was just camouflage that they were just

953
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,930
adapting to their environment,
which they also capable of doing it,

954
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:23,080
but they also somehow or another
communicate with each other by their skin,

955
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:28,081
by the way they look and they
think that that squid ink may be,

956
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:32,800
it serve two purposes. It may one,
try to ward off predators in some way,

957
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:37,510
create confusion and allowed to escape,
but also might be like eraser fluid. Like,

958
00:52:37,511 --> 00:52:42,030
forget what I just said. That's all
bullshit. Let's just wipe that out. Yeah.

959
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,360
There's some interesting work done on,

960
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,350
on the octopus and Octopi commune.

961
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:51,210
Uh, I don't know if you've
ever seen videos of cuddle
fish hunting but using the

962
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:54,090
patterns in their body to
hypnotize their pray. But I,

963
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,460
I've got a book called EarthCorps fiction
book and the whole race in that book

964
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:03,540
is based on the cuddle fish. So all
of their communication is almost non.

965
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,710
There's almost no verbal,

966
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:07,770
it's all visual and it's the patterns
changing on their skin would just how they

967
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:11,070
talk to each other and how they hunt
as a pack. Wow. Yeah, it's pretty,

968
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,920
pretty sweet. It's pretty sweet. That's

969
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,960
so why I wonder how wolves communicate.

970
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,840
Like when wolves decided to
going to sneak up on somebody,

971
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,960
like if they do something,
like if they have a situation like wolves,

972
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:23,900
like they'll corner an animal.
Like they'll have like some,

973
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,040
some will go this and
others we'll wait for

974
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,830
him on the other end like this somehow
or another communicate with each other.

975
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,290
Well
that's,

976
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:36,510
that's probably of all the six we did
this and it worked so, but they are,

977
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,420
they are smart as shit and they
are capable of remembering. Okay.

978
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:42,840
You guys got do you guys got the rounder
roll? Make sure they don't blank out.

979
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,190
They don't flank out to the side.
Here's the guys pushing and then yeah,

980
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,990
these things have cascading
color on their body.

981
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,730
What do you think they do it with though?

982
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:53,430
I mean are they doing it with this when
they're talking about wolves and doing

983
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:57,470
it with smells or using pheromones,
like how would they communicate? They,

984
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,880
from what I know about it,
they're actually,

985
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,870
they teach the puppies and the young
ones how to do it, like teaching.

986
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:04,201
They're like,

987
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:07,060
you're going to go here or they
will follow the adult and they look.

988
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:11,690
It's a learned skill. It's
just like a pack of humans
hunting and they, they, they,

989
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,780
they're brought up like your role is this
and then as they become more dominant

990
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:19,290
in the pack, they changed their role
in the hunting pack. You've seen them,

991
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:24,291
I'm sure you've seen the video of the
chimpanzees organizing an armed party to

992
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:28,960
go after monkeys. No, I don't think
I've seen this so crazy. It's,

993
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,170
it's one of the weirdest videos.

994
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:34,010
And it was one of the first instances
where they were completely sure that

995
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:36,030
chimpanzees were not just vegetarians,

996
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,910
where they knew the chimpanzees
were not just carnivorous,

997
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:42,420
but they were eating primates.
And you've seen that Brian,

998
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,670
we ever showed that video?
I think so.

999
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,540
We'll show the video of the chimpanzee
eating a monkey cause it's, it's fucked.

1000
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,030
Just wondering the team of two. Yes.
BBC from the BBC. Yeah. So they, um,

1001
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,600
they have all these monkeys in the trees
and what they do is they send chimps

1002
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,510
after them to chase him and they start,
you know,

1003
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:05,190
like swinging on the trees and then on
the other end they have chimps waiting as

1004
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:06,750
the monkeys tried to escape.

1005
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,430
So they've heard them into this
area where these dominant chimps,

1006
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:15,240
we'll be waiting and the chimps will,
uh, attack the monkeys in the trees,

1007
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,880
but they, the corner them and
trap them. They have like,

1008
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,000
they get him on the sides and they get
him in the front and they corral them

1009
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:24,030
into an area where other chimps are
waiting. And then they grabbed him.

1010
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:29,190
They figured that out like how did they
organize that? Do they talk about it?

1011
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:29,970
How do they know?

1012
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,850
How do I know there's going to be people
on the other end or chimps on the other

1013
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:36,000
end waiting when I chased these
monkeys down, that's pretty advanced.

1014
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,170
That's super advanced.

1015
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:41,130
They've somehow or another figured out
a way to talk to each other and say,

1016
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:43,060
look man, I want to eat a monkey.
You guys when to eat some lunch.

1017
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,840
This is how we do it.
They hide in the trees.

1018
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,540
We got to do is chase him
down there and Mike and Bob,

1019
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:49,450
you guys will stand on the corners,

1020
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,750
chase him this way and
then a Tommy at the end.

1021
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:54,630
It's just going to gather them all up. I'm
going to eat. That's a killer question.

1022
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,740
How do they communicate that?

1023
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,610
That would take people like if a bunch
of random people were stranded on a

1024
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,440
deserted island and they had
to figure out how to hunt,

1025
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,990
it would take them until like they were
on the brink of starvation till they

1026
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:06,900
figured that out. They'd be like, well,
let's go try and get some food. And,

1027
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,550
but we took a long fucking time,
really strategies,

1028
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,230
a trippy thought with that to me is not
knowing how long they've been exhibiting

1029
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:13,801
this behavior.

1030
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:16,820
That's exactly how they catch monkeys
and orangutans and chimpanzees.

1031
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,670
So was somebody watching the humans
do this and go, that shit works great.

1032
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,220
I don't think so, but it might because
it's like we have a lot of evidence

1033
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,370
to them killing chimpanzees before and
they might literally a developed that

1034
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:31,210
from watching how we do it to
them, which is fun. It's crazy.

1035
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,160
Most likely though that they're just
smart and they figured you're smart if you

1036
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:34,994
got that video.

1037
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,790
Yeah. A Jimmy just told me that, uh,

1038
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,390
that's the video that every time we played
that they yank. I saw youtube though.

1039
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,580
Oh really?
What we could show grape ape and a monkey

1040
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,870
that's very realistic. They Yank
us off youtube just for that. Yeah.

1041
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:50,620
That was a BBC One fucking BBC.
It's the Internet bitch.

1042
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,540
You're never going to win. You're
never gonna beat the Internet. But, um,

1043
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:00,040
the mean the way they treat monkeys
and the way we treat whales,

1044
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,910
the way we treat killer whales,
it,

1045
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,110
it really is a perplexing question.

1046
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:07,060
Like what will the next thing,

1047
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,470
how will that treat us if there is an
artificial artificial intelligence,

1048
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:16,270
super genius robot that becomes some
sort of a synthetic organic thing that's

1049
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,180
almost indistinguishable from
humans but infinitely smarter?

1050
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,100
How is it going to deal with us?
You know,

1051
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:23,380
is it going to deal with us the way
we deal with the chimps or the way the

1052
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:26,830
chimps did with the monkeys are the way
we deal with the dolphins or the way the

1053
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:29,340
killer whales deal with the dolphins?
How's it going to deal with,

1054
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:30,700
they're not setting a very good precedent.

1055
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,000
Why would he want to keep us
around and make us be lazy, Shitty,

1056
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:37,870
unproductive workers that are really
angry that our robot overlords have taken

1057
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,140
over? Or there's just the basic
problem with work. We're too smart.

1058
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,390
Would you want to keep some if the,

1059
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,650
if we had monkeys in the La area and
they walked around with switchblades and

1060
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:50,470
guns and every now and then we'd
start killing people. He'd be like,

1061
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,940
we gotta get rid of those monkeys.
And you know,

1062
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:54,850
this is a funny conversation because
whenever you have this conversation about

1063
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:55,930
artificial intelligence,

1064
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,960
you're going to get a lot of naysayers
and a lot of people that claim that they

1065
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:02,350
know what's going to happen. Like,
listen, that's not going to happen.

1066
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,950
We would never allow it. We would
never engineer that. We would never,

1067
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,470
I get ya, I get ya.
However, it might have been,

1068
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,790
that guy would never allow it.
That guy, whenever engineering,

1069
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,710
there's always somebody out there who's
just either for the money or it's like,

1070
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,670
God, I wonder if I can do that. That's
the driving force behind discoveries.

1071
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:26,650
I wonder if I can make that happen. And
this insatiable need to push technology.

1072
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,570
Just insatiable.

1073
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:33,571
The drive that people have to to
continue to innovate is spectacular.

1074
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:37,380
Every day there's some new
goddamn hundred 10 inch TV.

1075
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:42,280
That's 44 k Michael Bay. Yeah. What
happened with that Michael Bay was doing,

1076
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,020
he was doing a presentation and
the prompter fail and he locked up.

1077
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,430
It is he, he couldn't even
just wing it like he could eat.

1078
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:51,920
Like all he had to do is talk
about what he does as a director.

1079
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:54,020
Like I make movies and he tried to do it,

1080
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,650
but then he stopped and then
the guy's like, you know,

1081
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:59,450
why don't we just talk about these
new TVs? You know, these curved TVs?

1082
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,670
And he could have just said, yeah,
they look beautiful or something,

1083
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,630
but instead he starts mumbling and
then just wa and goes, excuse me,

1084
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,140
it's on stage. Oh, so he bombed.
He got panicky and happens.

1085
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,550
Happens to the best of us.
I don't want to watch some really creepy.

1086
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,250
That's all good to see.
It's like,

1087
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,060
it's like watching a really bad
comedian right before you go on stage.

1088
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:20,510
Like if someone's up there just bombing
and then you have to go on stage.

1089
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:21,800
You don't think could be funny.

1090
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,670
It's dangerous for you if you
get a sniff of his craziness.

1091
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,400
Some guys like t petrified,
you might think of that.

1092
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:30,050
That might like enter into your head.

1093
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:33,500
It's like a single cell and start
dividing like a little virus,

1094
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:37,490
a little mental virus. Very dangerous.
That can take your performance down.

1095
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,230
Most likely. No, but I don't like
the feeling. I don't like watching.

1096
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:45,770
Like I don't like watching people
bomb. It's, it feels gross. Yeah,

1097
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,440
I know what it feels like. I've
got to get out of there. You know?

1098
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,750
I don't think it's very hard to go
on after. This is why I think it's a,

1099
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,480
it might actually be affecting people
and this is also why I think people enjoy

1100
00:59:56,481 --> 01:00:00,170
inspiration. I think when you
see someone who's really bad,

1101
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,340
you really don't think that
anything's good. You think
like, this is what life is.

1102
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:06,770
Life is like really terrible.
Life is terrible comedy.

1103
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:10,550
Someone's bombing on
stage and on the opposite,

1104
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,770
when you see something really spectacular,

1105
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,550
it raises your standards for
things that you could accomplish,

1106
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:20,930
things that you could be excited to
see it. It raises your standards.

1107
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:25,100
If you go to see Avatar, so some
spectacular movie, it's, you leave that,

1108
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,400
you would think it would
be the inverse of that. Oh,

1109
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:30,860
I want to follow the guy who bond.
Even if I phone it in,

1110
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,950
I'm going to do well and I don't want to
follow avatar because it's spectacular

1111
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:38,330
and I'm going to look for ha. Well,
some people do have that, that mindset.

1112
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,240
Some people have this really ultra
competitive mindset and they, uh,

1113
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,630
like a lot of comics like to bring
terrible comedians with them on the road.

1114
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,380
They bring guys who just really
shouldn't even be going on stage.

1115
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,370
And the comic is like really pretty good.

1116
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:53,480
So it'd be like this death show for 20
minutes and then the comment comes in

1117
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,880
like a hero and everybody's
super excited to see him.

1118
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,680
I've seen that happen on numerous
occasions, but that's famine mentality,

1119
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,040
that famine mentality,
that there's not enough for everybody,

1120
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,020
that the famine mentality that,
you know,

1121
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:09,890
you have to get all the accolades and
anybody that's threatening whatsoever to

1122
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:13,660
your, you know, your talents,
your abilities. So it should
be just minimalized. Hmm.

1123
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:18,140
You know, that's a, that's a
dangerous mindset to have in a,

1124
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,330
especially in the world of
comedy. No, but I think, uh,

1125
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,510
if you instead choose to be
inspired by good performances,

1126
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,930
then everything becomes inspirational.
It's not like everything's competitive.

1127
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:31,250
Instead of it being competitive,

1128
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,390
you get all the same juice that you would
get from the competitive aspect of it,

1129
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:39,840
but you get it in a positive form. Instead
you're inspired and happy for people.

1130
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:44,720
Success, happy for great movies, happy
for great music, happy for great comedy.

1131
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,300
When you see great things inspired
by them, so everywhere around you,

1132
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:53,060
you see inspiration instead of everywhere
around you. You seeing competition,

1133
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,780
people doing better than you,
something that diminishes your,

1134
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,980
your idea of who you are as a person
because you don't measure up on paper to

1135
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:05,600
Michael Bay or this guy or
that guy. Instead of that,
it's the opposite. You know,

1136
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:08,400
the mentality is you're
constantly being inspired. Just a,

1137
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:12,740
it's a matter of engineering
your thoughts. That's all.
It really got significant.

1138
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,400
I've had, it's better now, but I've had
significant issues with other authors.

1139
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,070
You know what? The people start
out, same time I did roughly

1140
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,820
and have similar,
similar career arcs moving up.

1141
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,030
And then they just catch lightening by
the tail for something and the next thing

1142
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:31,410
you know, they're huge. And I'm like,
we're basically working equally.

1143
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,930
Everybody's working their fingers to
the bone like every other profession.

1144
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:36,090
Anybody who succeeds anywhere,
it's probably working their ass off.

1145
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,520
And then you just watch them
blow up and you're like, that's,

1146
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,620
that's difficult to
overcome. You're like, oh,

1147
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:45,360
that guy got all the goodies that guy
got there first. Um, and you know,

1148
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,690
hockey these for you? Oh yeah. Yeah.
And it's like you say, it's a lot,

1149
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:52,650
a lot of it has been adjusting
the perspective. You have
to step back and say,

1150
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,850
I'm still doing really well and I'm making
a lot of people really happy with my

1151
01:02:56,851 --> 01:03:00,900
stories and my books and I can
now aspire to get to that level.

1152
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,350
So I have to write something better and
market it better and connect better and

1153
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,790
finally get that out there.
Well,

1154
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:08,790
I think sometimes it's just a matter
of people finding out about it.

1155
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:12,030
It's really that simple. It's like
the product is there for a long time,

1156
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:15,280
but there's so much product you walk into,
Barnes and noble,

1157
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,960
start roaming through the fiction section,

1158
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,920
find a bunch of authors you don't know
when you read the back of the book and

1159
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,920
you see a few recommendations that
you probably respect too. I fuck it,

1160
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:25,500
I'll take a chance.
But for the most part they're,

1161
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,950
the choices are endless and new
books are coming out constantly.

1162
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,330
It's difficult to get scenes difficult
to get discovered and that the,

1163
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,860
the exposures is the biggest thing and
people hearing about what you do and then

1164
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:39,750
maybe hearing two or three times for,

1165
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:42,690
they're familiar with like this is my
second time in the show and the first time

1166
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,870
we got a ton of new readers,
people are like, God,

1167
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:46,920
that guy sounds pretty cool to me.

1168
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,990
Check out his books and
we've got all these fans now.

1169
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,950
Now in the second time maybe you get
more and you know all of that effort.

1170
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,900
The next book's out,
it's called pandemic.

1171
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:59,901
It's out January 21st and just trying
to get people exposed to it so that they

1172
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,520
can say, that sounds like
my cup of tea or, yeah,

1173
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:05,310
I don't think I'd be interested in that.
That's the real game.

1174
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:08,370
It's not getting people to read
or forcing people to read it.

1175
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:10,770
It's just a matter of if
nobody's ever heard of me,

1176
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,970
they don't get the opportunity to make
that decision if my stuff is a is in

1177
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:15,630
their alley or not.

1178
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:18,750
Does that get in the way at all
of the creative process for you?

1179
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:21,750
Is it like an unwanted annoyance,

1180
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:25,200
like this extra thing of trying to
promote and trying to figure out how to

1181
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:29,700
promote and then would it be easier for
you if you could get past that and get

1182
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:33,030
to this like Stephen King point where any
oil you have to do is just write shit,

1183
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:36,780
dude. You know, anybody getting to the
Anne Rice, Stephen King, Dean Koontz,

1184
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:41,100
you know, uh, any of those
levels where they just flat out,

1185
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,270
he doesn't have to worry about anymore.

1186
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,820
Stephen King could give a crap about
marketing because that's all going to get

1187
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:47,640
taken care of for him. And He's, he's
earned that and he's totally fine. Yeah.

1188
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,370
But uh, so we do, yeah, we,

1189
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,000
I put a lot of time in a marketing
and trying different things, um, to,

1190
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,180
to get the word out and all of that.

1191
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,420
Every minute I spent
doing that as a minute.

1192
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,470
I'm not creating or refining a story.

1193
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,820
Like one of the things we did
today was for all of the listeners,

1194
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,220
remember that book I told you
about last time title fight,

1195
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:09,780
which was the science fiction MMA.

1196
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:12,960
We decided we're just going to give
that away to all your listeners through

1197
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:17,290
January. If they go to our
website. I'm Scott sigler.com oh,

1198
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:20,290
it's up on the screen, right? Who
was that? That was not a fighter. No,

1199
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,080
that's the one you said you asked me
if I was writing gay porn last time.

1200
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,420
That's right.
That's right.

1201
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,290
That looks like who smaller par Horez
there's a couple of guys that looked like

1202
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:33,670
that, but mark, Mark Coleman used to
look like that to some extent. No,

1203
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,120
he wasn't even that big.
He huge,

1204
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:41,740
if anybody goes to that store and puts
that in their cart and then uses the code

1205
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:44,770
death squad, they get that
ebook for free. Beautiful,

1206
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,970
beautiful read on their computer.

1207
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:48,530
They can read it on their tablet
and their kindle, etc. Awesome.

1208
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,740
So these are the kinds of things that,
and it's not like,

1209
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,260
you know the Stephen Kings in
the Joe Hill's don't still do,

1210
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,770
or their people do that marketing
stuff for them. But yeah,

1211
01:05:56,771 --> 01:06:00,610
we have to do things like that to be like,
just like, I know if you read my shit,

1212
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,830
I'm going to own you. It's
just that simple. Pull up

1213
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:07,310
Mark Kerr, mark curves the only MMA
fighter that really looked like that.

1214
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:11,220
They actually did a fascinating
documentary on mark courage. No,

1215
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,830
I have the smashing machine. It's called
the smashing machine. It is fucking dark.

1216
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,180
It's deep because mark was like super,
super open with them and they're like,

1217
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,120
while he was filming this documentary,

1218
01:06:23,121 --> 01:06:26,000
they were doing this documentary
on this unstoppable MMA fighter.

1219
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,640
This guy who was this wrestler
who was just destroying people.

1220
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:31,370
He's built like a fucking
superhero super athlete,

1221
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:33,620
taking people down and smash
them. No, that's when he's fat.

1222
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,620
You've got to get him when he's young.
You got to get him when he's young.

1223
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:38,750
Mark her huge.
Just find,

1224
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,200
find an image of him when he was
just unbelievably huge. So anyway,

1225
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:45,530
this documentary, they start doing this
documentary and along the lines, the,

1226
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:49,610
it exposes his drug use and he's opened
when he shoots up right in front of

1227
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:54,611
these people and they capture this guy
completely spiraling out of control.

1228
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,920
They just come into the right moment
as they're filming this documentary and

1229
01:06:57,921 --> 01:07:00,140
catch this guy who was like one
of the best fighters in the world,

1230
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,860
completely spiraling
on camera shooting up.

1231
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,540
You got to just get a picture of him
when he was in his prime. There's a,

1232
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:12,380
you know, there's some photos of him
like fighting in the UFC. Yeah, that's,

1233
01:07:12,381 --> 01:07:15,440
that's him. Holy Cow.
Oh, that doesn't work.

1234
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,760
Look at the size of that
motherfucker that, I mean, that was,

1235
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,770
that was when they were calling
them the smashing machine.

1236
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,350
He was 265 pounds of American
muscle and Mexican supplements.

1237
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,130
And he was some mashing people,
but along the way developed a,

1238
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,930
an addiction too. I believe it was
opiates. I think it was shooting up.

1239
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,380
Look out fucking big. He was,
dude, are you shitting me?

1240
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,980
And did he just kind of take himself
out or did he get beat and go?

1241
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:45,670
He started going down. I started getting
beat, you know, well he was doing drugs,

1242
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:45,821
you know,

1243
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:49,540
he's having like a real drug problem and
he was fighting while he was a addicted

1244
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,920
to drugs. Okay. And then, yeah,

1245
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,640
I think he eventually went and
became a car salesman. But the, um,

1246
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,880
I think it's an important documentary.
It's an important,

1247
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:01,510
not just from the point of view
of someone who, um, is, uh,

1248
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,960
having a serious problem with drugs, but
it's all steroids. He had a, you know,

1249
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:08,950
he's absolutely on massive
amounts of steroids. Yeah.

1250
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:10,450
He was also fighting and MMA,

1251
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:15,290
which is the thing about traumatic brain
injuries and punches and kicks it you

1252
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,124
take,
it's like

1253
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:21,170
sometimes the of damage can lead these
guys to be like really depressed and

1254
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:25,340
suicidal and crazy if they
sustained too much damage,

1255
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,780
if they're not really careful about it.

1256
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:28,430
If they don't give themselves
enough time to recover,

1257
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,900
they can get really depressed.

1258
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,960
So here's this guy taking
shots to the head all the time,

1259
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,770
taking morphine or heroin or whatever
the fuck is taking, you know?

1260
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:38,990
And they caught him in this doc.
Perfect,

1261
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,090
perfect timing for right
when it all fell apart.

1262
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,960
They came in thinking he was the baddest
motherfucker on earth and they left

1263
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:49,961
with this really in depth piece on a guy
whose life is being absorbed by drugs.

1264
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,480
Drugs are just stealing his life, just
taking it in little pieces, you know?

1265
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,480
And he wound checked that out.

1266
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,840
He wound up fighting later in his
career like no steroids, no drugs,

1267
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,290
completely different body looked
like a guy just stepped out of a bar.

1268
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:06,200
It was really strange. How did he
do at the end? Is he still terrible?

1269
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,860
It's getting destroyed. Oh Geez. Um,
pull up a picture of mark her fat.

1270
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,010
I don't want, I liked the
guy. I'm not teasing him.

1271
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:17,300
I mean this is just the reality
of who he was at the end.

1272
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,710
Look at him. That's what he looked like
at the end. Wow. Yeah. Quite a difference.

1273
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,500
Yeah. Oh, the before and
after. It was incredible and a,

1274
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:29,330
I saw him fight a couple times live
when he was in that state and I saw him

1275
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,050
fight live when he was the
destroyer. You know, it was shocking,

1276
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,210
really shocking stuff. But
uh, you know, that world is
shocking. It's a crazy world.

1277
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,530
The world with your body.

1278
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:42,590
Do you think eventually they're
going to get to the point where,

1279
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:46,150
cause usually guys are losing their three
of their last four of their last three

1280
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:47,690
years and then they retire.

1281
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,250
Is it going to get to a point
where you know you have,

1282
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:51,530
so he's going to step in and be like,
yeah,

1283
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:53,450
we're just going to go ahead
and make a decision for you all?

1284
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:56,060
They certainly have. They've done
that in many fighters. Yeah. Yeah.

1285
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:58,460
They've retired quite a few fighters.
Chocolate.

1286
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:02,480
Dell is the most obvious example
because he was like one of the greatest

1287
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:06,320
champions ever and Dana and him at very
good friends and at the end of Chuck's

1288
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,530
career, Chuck asks for one more
fight and wonder if I rich Franklin.

1289
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:12,800
He lost that fight and he's like,
that's it. We're good. That's it.

1290
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,410
I got to step away.
And so he realized it was time.

1291
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:20,500
The Arnold Arnold's 62
it look like that now.

1292
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:23,330
He also is a training
for the Conan movies.

1293
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,280
Kona King cone in finally.
Yes. Oh that's right.

1294
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:30,020
You're a Robert Howard fan.
Yeah.

1295
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,290
Can we talk about Robert Howard last
time when I don't. I don't think so,

1296
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,420
but that,
that,

1297
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,690
that was my goal ever of watching the
first two Conan movies and even red stone

1298
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,361
back in the day.
I'm like,

1299
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:42,200
I want to write king cone and I never
got to the point where I could talk to

1300
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:43,700
anybody, have any contacts. I'm like,

1301
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:46,700
that movie's got to get made cause it's
perfect. Now he's the perfect age for it.

1302
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,580
It can be spectacular. Yeah.
Folks don't know that Robert E.

1303
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:53,810
Howard made Conan in many different
areas. It wasn't just a young, virile,

1304
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:54,710
powerful Conan.

1305
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:59,660
He also made King Conan when Conan was
the king of scenarios is I think so.

1306
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:02,050
W opponent. The Sumerian?
Yeah. Well he was the Samarian,

1307
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,150
but I don't think he was a king of that.
I think he took over some new place.

1308
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,510
I don't remember. I don't remember. Yeah,
they were great fucking books though.

1309
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:13,250
Those, those books sort of in my mind,
like kind of defined my childhood.

1310
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:18,100
I really got fast fascinated with
fantasy and that kind of shit. It was,

1311
01:11:18,101 --> 01:11:22,440
it was the Robert E. Howard books crawl,
was it called a conqueror? Conquer. Yeah.

1312
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:27,240
That was so good. Yeah. Cyclops in
that movie. The movie was just, uh,

1313
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:31,020
a shit version of the books. Really?
The books. Yeah. The movie is fine,

1314
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,500
but it's probably dated now. If you've
probably watched it now, you'd hate it.

1315
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,110
Well, at the moment, yeah, I don't, I
don't go back and watch some movies.

1316
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,820
The movies,
the Scifi movies I loved,

1317
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:41,730
and I was a kid with the exception of
like Predator and aliens just don't watch

1318
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,190
them anymore. You can't ruins
everything. You really can't.

1319
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:49,191
But Robert Howard created some amazing
Conan books that never really have been

1320
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:54,830
captured correctly. They try, they did
a little bit better with the new Conan,

1321
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:59,340
the new guy. Oh yeah, like I think the
new guy is, first of all. Yeah. Yeah.

1322
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:04,350
Way More realistic. Way more like the
actual Qa. Like he's an enormous guy.

1323
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,130
Like he's not billing a bodybuilder.
He's bill. Go to the new Conan guy,

1324
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:11,160
Jason Momoa, who's, I've met a
minimum of UFC two very nice guy,

1325
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,420
and he's fucking huge.
This kid is like six foot six.

1326
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,290
It's just this perfect
specimen of manhood. He's
never gonna make it out alive.

1327
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:22,410
He's gonna fuck so much that
he's going to die. There's,

1328
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:26,040
there's no way he can avoid it.
If I was here like Jason Momoa,

1329
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,900
he fucked himself to death to death.

1330
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:30,960
He's six foot six and he's a
beautiful man and he's a movie star.

1331
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,450
There was no way he doesn't have,
there's no way he gets it together.

1332
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,170
Look at that it get the fuck out.
Get the fuck Outta here. Come on.

1333
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:38,203
That kind of didn't,

1334
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,490
I didn't watch the news because they
just didn't want the old one to be,

1335
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,850
I didn't want them to sell a, the original
Coney, because I'm a giant fan of them.

1336
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:48,300
They only sullied it
in like half the movie.

1337
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,270
You could just cut out half
the movie and have that movie,

1338
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:56,190
have no ending and like it was a
good effort. It was a good attempt.

1339
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:01,320
I think ultimately what Kona and needs
and deserves is that guy is the perfect

1340
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:04,830
Kona and he's a good actor. He
looks like a savage. Keep that,

1341
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:09,690
keep him as the Kona and just get a
real writer who's a real fucking crazy

1342
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:14,340
person who can come up with something
bad ass and follow the robbery Howard

1343
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:15,174
script.

1344
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:19,140
Follow what that guy and then do it
through the eyes of like a real visionary.

1345
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:24,140
Get a real James Cameron type dude or
how about Martin Scorsese does Konan how

1346
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:24,910
about you?

1347
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:29,910
You have a movie where it's like a really
dark fantasy movie that plays out like

1348
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:33,930
a real film instead of plays
out like some bullshit comic.

1349
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,080
That's always the thing that's confused
the crap out of me with the marvel,

1350
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:38,910
the crappy marvel movies
that made when I was a kid,

1351
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,690
like why or the the old Spiderman TV
show when I was a little kid. I'm like,

1352
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,110
I'm like,
when is he going to fight a super villain?

1353
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,700
I don't give a shit if he's
stopping bank robbers and it was,

1354
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,020
it never made any sense to me.
That's like comic books.

1355
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,330
Tell these stories that
are massively popular.

1356
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:56,430
Why don't you just tell that story?

1357
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,500
Why do you think you have
to reinvent everything?

1358
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,270
And the Kona and books
will be a similar thing.

1359
01:14:00,271 --> 01:14:04,200
Like this already entertained a large
percentage of the planet at one time.

1360
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,470
It's not dated because there's no,
you know, 19th century technology.

1361
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:09,270
It's tell the same frigging story.
Yeah.

1362
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:14,270
Tell the story and now with the new
technology, the fucking monsters saying,

1363
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:18,570
did you see the hobbit? No, I
haven't seen to have it yet. Oh yeah,

1364
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:22,180
that dragon is worth seeing the
whole movie. Just to see that dragon.

1365
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,280
That reminds me, that's what I
want it to. I haven't seen it,

1366
01:14:25,281 --> 01:14:28,280
but one of the funniest things ever is
when news reporters have to talk about

1367
01:14:28,281 --> 01:14:29,150
that movie because that,

1368
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:34,160
that Smaug snuggled up
next it distillations of
[inaudible] and the [inaudible].

1369
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:40,940
I want to tell you the sense that
since the law, speaking of monsters,

1370
01:14:40,941 --> 01:14:43,460
because we're closing in on
the option for nocturnal,

1371
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:47,150
one of my books that's going to be done
by Lloyd 11 as a TV show and he's the

1372
01:14:47,151 --> 01:14:50,320
guy that did Hellboy and
Hellboy two fucking dude knows,

1373
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:55,010
knows his monsters like nobody's
business, but amazing. Congratulations.

1374
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,040
Thank you. But this happened
because of your show. We had, uh,

1375
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:02,540
one of your listeners name is
Nikki Monta, my gosh. Darn it.

1376
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,740
[inaudible] is that right
now? Yeah. Nicky Ahmond,

1377
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:09,640
she works for a alumnae,
Lucy Steele.

1378
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,740
I who's an agent at the paradigm agency
in New York. So I was on your show.

1379
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:17,840
Mickey heard it and said, wow, that
nocturnal sounds really cool and reads it,

1380
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,770
and then it goes, goes to her boss
and says, I think this is significant.

1381
01:15:21,771 --> 01:15:25,340
You need to read it. Her boss reads it.
Lucy reads it. Contacted my print agent.

1382
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,670
We were done with our current
film agent at the time.

1383
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:31,040
We'd worked together five years. Great
Guy, but we didn't make anything happen.

1384
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,890
So time to change something.
So we talked, Lucy,

1385
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:38,960
Lucy takes over and now we're almost
not only almost closed on nocturnal,

1386
01:15:38,961 --> 01:15:41,360
but then the the guys,

1387
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:46,400
the people who make a
justified an elementary are
closing and an option for the

1388
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:51,020
infected series, which pandemic is
the last book. That's incredible.

1389
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:54,770
This lady's kicking ass and it came
because of Niki listening to your show.

1390
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,560
That's incredible. Cut to three years
from now. It's like God's on coke

1391
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:02,750
laying in his mansion and his
underwear doing a new red.

1392
01:16:02,751 --> 01:16:06,440
Sonja remake was Miley
Cyrus? Yes. Smashing. Look,

1393
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:09,260
a champagne bottle on the ground
because there's nothing left.

1394
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,780
There's my fucking drank.

1395
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,920
So just a quick thank you out to Nikki
if she's listening to this because just

1396
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:18,350
one person listening to it,
running up the tree as a, you know,

1397
01:16:18,351 --> 01:16:19,370
change a lot of things for us.

1398
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:22,610
That's all it takes, right? I mean,
like I said, your product is amazing.

1399
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:26,030
I've gotten nothing but positive
responses from people that read your book.

1400
01:16:26,031 --> 01:16:28,840
After that, you came on the
podcast for some time. Do you just,

1401
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:31,190
people need to find out about
it. So now they go. Good.

1402
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,560
That's going to be crazy man.
Well if we get, you know,

1403
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:36,200
and of course either one of
the TV shows could not happen,

1404
01:16:36,201 --> 01:16:39,440
which is how things work in Hollywood.
But if he gets super rich,

1405
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:42,260
you're going to buy a ball or spot in
San Francisco. Oh yeah. You kidding?

1406
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:44,900
Well I don't hold block.
I don't know about San Francisco,

1407
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:48,380
but if you get super rich you could
buy basically Roman small country in

1408
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:50,670
Michigan and call it Detroit
cause it's already named.

1409
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:51,890
He could buy the whole thing.
But again,

1410
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:54,590
you'd have to be in Detroit
and be cold as hell. Yeah.

1411
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,770
All their castles built in the
middle of San Francisco. You know,

1412
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,510
you're pretty sweet, you know, like you've
ever been to Stephen King's place? No.

1413
01:17:00,511 --> 01:17:03,740
Main nope. When I used to
work in main ways to stand up,

1414
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:07,820
we used to do a Gig in Bangor and you
couldn't go to Bangor without driving by

1415
01:17:07,821 --> 01:17:10,470
Stephen King's house. He had to to know
that's where Stephen King labs. Right,

1416
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:14,120
right, right. Cause like he had
this giant cast doubt on mark.

1417
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:16,340
Mark Twain's will house and
he by Mark Twain Says Daddy,

1418
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:20,000
I think that's smart planes house. I'm
not sure about Mark Twain lived in Maine.

1419
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,780
I could be wrong. I, it's what I've
heard. But continuing continue. Well, um,

1420
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,340
he has like,
you can tell it's his house.

1421
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:28,940
He has this a rod iron fence outside of
his house and he's like gargoyles and

1422
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:31,610
shit on it. Oh sweet. Pretty
obvious to anybody comes by.

1423
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,900
Well it's a big house too. It's, you know,
but it's not ridiculous. Like he doesn't,

1424
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,250
he doesn't have like a castle.

1425
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:41,000
He lives in a nice big house and he
doesn't have any seven rooms or something

1426
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:44,960
like that. Not really. I mean it's a
very nice house, but it's nothing crazy.

1427
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,970
Like I guess that's how
he fits in up there.

1428
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,020
Cause you know Bangor is a fairly modest
environment and for fairly modest city.

1429
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,760
That's his house. Yeah. Nice.

1430
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,020
So you drive by and you see this
metal fence with the gargoyles on it.

1431
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,030
See if he can get a photo
of the, the, the alliance,

1432
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:04,060
I wonder about that is he's got some
crazy fans and that's 20 feet from the

1433
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:07,250
sidewalk to the front door.
So you wonder if Steve,

1434
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:08,930
some of Stephen King's money goes to,

1435
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,180
there's a couple of dudes lurking around
that property at all times. There's,

1436
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:15,200
you know, if you jumped that fence,
that's your ass. I would have,

1437
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:20,150
I would have for sure evil
dogs everywhere. Everywhere.

1438
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,500
I would hire ninjas to just practice
on people. Come up with a fence,

1439
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:27,800
dudes with swords. I wouldn't fuck
around guys on the roof. See the roof,

1440
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,350
crossbows silence.

1441
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:34,550
Just poison Arrow Samurai in the front
porch just announced that this is what's

1442
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:36,770
going to happen to you. That's what
the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah,

1443
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,130
but it devil Zombie. Samurais but he
would have, that'd be a, actually,

1444
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:43,390
that's the name of my next
book is Samurai Hooker. Yeah.

1445
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:47,510
Scott Sigler. Cause you need that heart
of gold in there to sell the book, right?

1446
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,960
Yeah. You can't just have a devil's
Zombie Samurai. Who am I rooting for it?

1447
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:54,830
They're all cunts. You have
a country, country, country.
If you have it, you know.

1448
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:58,580
Harte gold extra x hooker. Yeah.
Now you're, now you're talking,

1449
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:01,430
there's a good story there.
She did it because her dad
had cancer. How about that?

1450
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:04,340
That's why she did it. She needed money.
Her Dad is, games are against that.

1451
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,600
Camera it against Zombie. Plus.
What's really wrong with hookers?

1452
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,650
Let's stop. Let's leave them
alone. Yes, yes. No, I have
no problem with this issue.

1453
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,740
Well there it is. So that's how uh, the
Scott Sigler legend was launched. Yes.

1454
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:21,890
And apparently you already know how it's
going to end with the Zombie Samurai

1455
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:24,200
Hooker and a smash champagne bottle
and a baller pan and San Francisco.

1456
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,010
It could end like that or the artificially
intelligent robots could take over

1457
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:30,810
first. And we have high, if I
get rich, the first thing to do,

1458
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,410
he is investing in Google
so they don't kill me. Yeah.

1459
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:36,240
And concrete because the robots are
going to eat concrete. Remember? Okay,

1460
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,860
thank you. Okay, great. Building a lot
of concrete around here you go boys.

1461
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:44,780
I'll be over here. I wonder if it would
be, I mean Google by all, if you know,

1462
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,460
you know,
you look at what they've done,

1463
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,300
they don't seem to have done anything
evil. They seem to be very conscientious,

1464
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,270
very rich and wealthy,
but also very conscientious.

1465
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:56,900
You always hear about how great their
campuses and how people will work there.

1466
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,660
Really enjoy the environment.
Like this is a,

1467
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,640
there's a guy works at Google who's a guy,

1468
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,570
but in the daytime he decided he wants
to be a woman. So he shows up at work,

1469
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:08,070
dressed as a woman and changes at

1470
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,290
the end of the day and goes home
and he's a man again and they,

1471
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:13,410
so they changed his name at work.
They totally accepted it.

1472
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,500
And the Guy Guy's married and has kids
and he's a wife. You know he's at,

1473
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,990
he has a wife and when he gets
home he becomes a man again,

1474
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:22,140
but while he's at work, he decided that he
wants to be a woman. They're like, okay.

1475
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,153
It doesn't surprise

1476
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,440
from what I know of Google,
that doesn't surprise me. Like,

1477
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:26,274
do you still get your work?

1478
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:29,550
Yeah, we could give a shit. I
don't care. I think it's good.

1479
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,360
As long as he's not crazy, it doesn't
even fucking dwell on it. It's weird.

1480
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,810
Secret world of men who dress like
dolls and think that's the same story.

1481
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,650
That's equally creepy. That
one Google might be, yeah,

1482
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:44,730
we're going to have to have a meeting
about this robot mass dressing up like the

1483
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:48,210
doll is distracting, so let's
have, let's have a meeting. Yeah.

1484
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:51,420
That's way creepier dressing up
like a woman. It's like, okay.

1485
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,390
Guess you wanted to know, you know?
Have you ever had the fantasy?

1486
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,510
What would you do if you
could be a woman for a day?

1487
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,300
Apparently work at Google.
Yeah.

1488
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,850
That's what you can do a
little and put a mask on or be,

1489
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:04,770
it would be a fake robot.

1490
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,740
People are fucking weird man. The
things that people enjoy, you know,

1491
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:15,050
whatever floats hour long. As long
as getting hurt. Exactly. Yeah.

1492
01:21:15,051 --> 01:21:18,840
As long as you're not being an asshole.
When you start writing a book, do you,

1493
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,590
do you like sit down and it's like say,
okay,

1494
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:26,430
I want to figure out something to write
about or do you just have like a flash

1495
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,270
of inspiration and then you know,
record it,

1496
01:21:30,271 --> 01:21:33,270
write it down and then take off with it?
Like how do you, how do you start a buck?

1497
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,810
I, mine is much is more
structured, so the,

1498
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,900
the ones I write for random house,
um,

1499
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:43,050
they're thrillers with a lot
of horror and Psi Phi in them.

1500
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,150
But the thriller structure is,
you know,

1501
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,940
things are planned out to get to this
really crazy over the top ending.

1502
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,040
So a lot of times I'll have the concept,

1503
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,950
then I'll try and work through a loose
structure to come up with an ending

1504
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,350
that's going to be just
balls out spectacular.

1505
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,980
And then sort of work backwards from
there. So if I do that correctly,

1506
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:03,420
if I reverse outline it correctly
by the time and go from,

1507
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,210
this is insane,
I would never buy into this too.

1508
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:09,180
This is a guy having a cup of coffee
at his kitchen table in the morning.

1509
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,140
It feels like a seamless transition.
You never noticed that your grant,

1510
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:17,040
I'm gradually upping the level of madness
to get to that crazy end and you're

1511
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:20,880
just fully hooked and believing every
moment of it. So it's mostly structured.

1512
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:22,040
I don't think I,

1513
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:25,830
I don't think I have an immediate just
right and then let it go and see where

1514
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:28,440
the story goes cause I need to have,
you know,

1515
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:31,680
30 or 40 threads that all
funneled towards that last ending.

1516
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:34,950
Even pandemic,
which is the third book in a series.

1517
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:38,070
It goes infected than
contagious. Then pandemic. Um,

1518
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:42,240
each of those three books has a
relatively calm beginning and, uh,

1519
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,620
earth shattering end.

1520
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,950
But they are complete story unto
themselves simply because I don't,

1521
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,800
I don't believe in extorting
fans out of their money.

1522
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:52,170
You get a full story for this book.
If you don't want to read the next book,

1523
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,920
you don't have to buy that to see what
happens at the end of the first bucket.

1524
01:22:54,921 --> 01:22:58,110
I don't just cut it in half.
So for pandemic it was,

1525
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:01,800
it's largely the end of pandemics.
Just ape shit crazy.

1526
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:06,010
It's the whole world screwed. And you
had to come up with, how do I do this

1527
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,050
much damage and then
work it back from there.

1528
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:10,120
So it all feels like it
flows together naturally.

1529
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,530
When you talked to other authors,

1530
01:23:11,531 --> 01:23:14,710
is there like several different schools
of thought as far as creating a story?

1531
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:17,170
Cause I know Stephen King Oil,
which I found really fascinating.

1532
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:21,160
His book on writing. Did you read it? Yep.
Really like a Bible. It's great. Really,

1533
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:22,260
really good book.
Well,

1534
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,390
what I found fascinating is that he
doesn't have a structure at all. Nope.

1535
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,980
He just starts riding. I heard
an interview with um, uh,

1536
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,680
a writer named Joe Abercrombie,
interviewed George Rr
Martin, the game of Thrones,

1537
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:36,880
author Joe Abercrombie's stuff you
like fantasies ridiculously good.

1538
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,180
And of course George Rr Martin's
game of Thrones. And George R.

1539
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,890
Martin described it.
I don't know if he came up with this,

1540
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,720
but this is where I heard it.
He said there's two kinds of writers.

1541
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:47,020
There's the Gardner and there's
the architect, and he's a gardener.

1542
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,100
And Stephen King,
our Gardner,

1543
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,160
where they put the seed in the
ground and they cultivate it.

1544
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:54,100
Then they just let it grow wherever
it grows. I like this, fine.

1545
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:56,410
I'm gonna follow this fine. I liked
this flower would follow this flower,

1546
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:01,660
whereas the architect, which is more like,
you know, Tom Clancy or my stories, you,

1547
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,590
you'd blueprint and then you build the
foundation. Then you build a framework,

1548
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:08,050
and then gradually, okay, now
we're gonna put in dry electrical.

1549
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:10,670
Now we're going to put in plumbing,
now we're going to put it in dry wall,

1550
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,460
and now we're going to finish it.
Now we're going to paint it.

1551
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,560
You know what it's going to
look like before it's done.

1552
01:24:14,561 --> 01:24:16,570
But there's all the work
to make it complete.

1553
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,970
So those are the two kinds of
writers and king's definitely in the,

1554
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:22,560
in the Gardner. Righty. He just lets
us shit roll. That's fascinating. Um,

1555
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:27,610
have you ever tried to do it that way or
do you enjoy the structure aspect of it?

1556
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:31,500
Like have you thought about doing it
different ways? I mostly enjoy the,

1557
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:34,450
the tetris game of getting
it all to come out.

1558
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,620
And it's really a love hate relationship
because if you're as anal retentive

1559
01:24:38,621 --> 01:24:40,660
about like this has to,

1560
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:44,110
you have to feel closure at the end of
this book and a half to tie up all the

1561
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:48,160
threads when you do that, as you're
working through some of the characters,

1562
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:50,830
change who they are and all
of a sudden you're like, okay,

1563
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,990
now this guy would never do this thing.

1564
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:55,390
He would never go into the haunted
house alone. He just wouldn't do it.

1565
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,550
And then you got to say, I,
how do I get around that?

1566
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,280
And usually break stuff so you have to
tear the building down and go back and

1567
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:04,210
build it up all over again. And when I
do that, uh, with the book nocturnal,

1568
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:08,320
I was just talking about my business
partner. Uh, a Kovacs had to deal with me.

1569
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:08,830
I was,

1570
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:13,450
I was miserable for like six months
cause I wrote three full dress and at the

1571
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:15,580
end of every full draft I'm like,
this just, this doesn't work.

1572
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,520
This is not believable. I could not get
through this book and go, that's what,

1573
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:19,390
that's what would happen.

1574
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,510
So I had to rip it all down and start
over and move all the parts round again.

1575
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,750
And I never thought I would get, I
was like, I'll never get this right.

1576
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:28,060
This will never work out with
this concept that I have.

1577
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:31,840
And I finally got it to work with
some great help from Julian Puffy,

1578
01:25:31,841 --> 01:25:35,560
who's my editor at random house. We
finally got it figured out, but it was,

1579
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,690
I was freaking miserable.
So I would like,

1580
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,900
eventually I want to get to the
gardener face. I just, wherever it goes,

1581
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:42,190
it doesn't matter.
Let's just have fun.

1582
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:45,910
Do you get mad when you read a book that's
kind of Piss poor from an author that

1583
01:25:45,911 --> 01:25:47,590
you really respect? Totally. Yeah.

1584
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:52,210
That's a foot like there's so many authors
in so many books right now. I am this.

1585
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:56,110
Why work so hard to make my stuff so
tight and so refined? It's very admirable.

1586
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,910
I like how you approach it.
Well it's,

1587
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,410
I look at it from the
customer's point of view.

1588
01:25:59,411 --> 01:26:02,170
If you drop 24 bucks on own book
and you can tell I phoned it in,

1589
01:26:02,171 --> 01:26:03,710
you're not coming back
cause I'm not coming back.

1590
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:06,020
If I read your book and I'm like,
this is the lace,

1591
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:09,410
yours being so lazy and you took my
money and you didn't work for it,

1592
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:13,370
I'll never read that author again.
Or you've, you've completed the work.

1593
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,230
It's not that anybody who's being lazy,

1594
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:18,410
but sometimes there's a puzzle that people
just don't have the effort to solve,

1595
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:20,720
but it's not that they're not
working hard, they just didn't,

1596
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,800
they didn't complete it or they're under
deadline and now I understand more.

1597
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:26,810
Like when I was younger I was much more
adamant like fuck you for taking my

1598
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:29,630
money. You Lazy Bastard. Now I
understand like, yeah, there's a,

1599
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,580
there's an ax at the
back of your neck saying,

1600
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:34,160
we've got to get this
book to press right now.

1601
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:38,270
If you want to get it out by December.
Yeah, for Christmas. You have to. Yeah.

1602
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:40,250
So that's what people go through a lot.
When you think,

1603
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,680
when you think you've read a shotty work,
a lot of times it's,

1604
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:44,810
they just ran out of time.
They didn't have time to do it.

1605
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,640
I think it's very cool though
that you think like that.

1606
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,920
I think it's very cool that
you think about the, uh,

1607
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:51,410
the audience and the people buying.
I think that's super important.

1608
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,580
It adds an element of a,
you have a connection with
them. You're not above them,

1609
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:58,640
you're not beyond them. You're
part of them. They need them.

1610
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:01,790
You appreciate them and then you
respect them as you're writing.

1611
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:04,160
You consider them.
I think that's big it in this,

1612
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:06,740
maybe this is from being a big
reader before the ebooks set,

1613
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:08,000
but it wasn't that long ago,
you know,

1614
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:13,001
to to buy the new Stephen King Book for
seven 95 and paperback seven 95 was a

1615
01:27:13,101 --> 01:27:14,630
chunk of money. You're like, okay,

1616
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,790
I want this and I'm buying
this and better be good.

1617
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,790
And then not Stephen King but somebody
else. You buy a book and you're like,

1618
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:22,130
I didn't get my money's worth
and I worked hard for that money.

1619
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,710
I've never forgot what that feels like.

1620
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,890
And even though I'd still
give all my stuff away,

1621
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,420
everything you can get on my website,

1622
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:34,421
it's [inaudible] dot com serialized
books for free or@patiobooks.com and

1623
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:38,180
everything I've published, we give away
for free as a serialized audio book.

1624
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:41,000
We run advertising against it and we
listen to the ad at the beginning of the

1625
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:43,700
show, just like your show. Then
you get 30 40 minutes an episode.

1626
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:46,250
You don't have to pay for anything and
let's do it all you want. It's brilliant.

1627
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:49,520
Lot of people, a lot of people can't
afford, they flat out can't afford books,

1628
01:27:49,521 --> 01:27:52,520
but they want their story. So that's
how they get it. So we do it that way.

1629
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:53,840
And then if you actually buy the book,

1630
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:56,420
my goal is always you would have paid
twice what you paid for it and you're

1631
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:59,510
still happy. That's beautiful, man.
That's a great way of looking at things.

1632
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:04,160
I love the fact that you give everything
away for free to put some ads on it.

1633
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:05,800
Who gives a shit, you know? As
long as it doesn't interrupt,

1634
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,620
interrupt the flow of the book. Right?
Was just like this, this podcast.

1635
01:28:09,621 --> 01:28:12,020
We never do an ad inside the podcast,

1636
01:28:12,021 --> 01:28:14,240
but don't want to interrupt
the flow of the conversation.

1637
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:19,241
But I think giving people something for
free is important because it's nice,

1638
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,530
it's nice to do.
It's a nice,

1639
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:24,410
it makes people feel good that they
can get your good stuff for free.

1640
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:28,070
They can go to Scott sigler.com they
could start downloading your audio books,

1641
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:32,090
get hooked, have many, many, many more
hours of entertainment for fucking free.

1642
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:35,430
And then we knew stuff comes out. They
want to support you. Yup, exactly.

1643
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:40,100
That's organic and a lot of, a lot
of times what happens is people have,

1644
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,980
a lot of people have money to spend
on entertainment and they don't mind

1645
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:44,960
spending that money on entertainment if
they know they're going to get something

1646
01:28:44,961 --> 01:28:45,560
good.

1647
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,370
What pisses people off is a spend their
money and then on something and then

1648
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:51,230
find out that they don't
actually like the product.

1649
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:54,170
So if I give these stories away,
you know,

1650
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:57,140
that's my competitive
advantage over Stephen King.

1651
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,240
If you go into a bookstore and
see Scott Sigler and Stephen King,

1652
01:28:59,241 --> 01:28:59,991
and you've never heard of me,

1653
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:02,010
you're gonna by Stephen
King because a proven brand,

1654
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,000
he's a proven storyteller.

1655
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:06,870
But if you go to the bookstore in Stephen
King's 24 95 and Scott's hagglers free,

1656
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,420
maybe I'll try this first,
then go get the Stephen King.

1657
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:11,940
Now I've got a chance for
people to try out my stuff,

1658
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:15,270
and if they listened to a couple of
books and they know what they're getting

1659
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:18,330
from then on, then they,
they buy everything that
comes out today. It comes up.

1660
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:22,440
Yeah. And you, you miss the viral aspect
when you charge people for things like,

1661
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:27,520
um, do you know, uh, the,
there's La has a radio team. Uh,

1662
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:31,110
it used to be frosty Heidi and frank,
and now it's just Heidi and frank.

1663
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:34,260
Really Nice folks. Very, very fun people.

1664
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,350
I've done their show a couple times and
they were on the radio and they went

1665
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:40,220
from the radio to doing a podcast,
but they,

1666
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,130
they were making their money
by charging for the podcast.

1667
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:45,720
And so they had a good piece of change.
It was coming in every month,

1668
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:46,740
but they couldn't grow.

1669
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,950
They couldn't grow because no one can
find out about them because it just

1670
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:53,580
doesn't, people don't, when you go,
hey, there's this team, you know,

1671
01:29:53,581 --> 01:29:57,420
Mike and fucking pissed face, and
they, uh, they have an awesome podcast,

1672
01:29:57,421 --> 01:30:01,320
but it costs two bucks. Trust
me. It's worth it. You're
like, how good could it be?

1673
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:04,200
I can go download Adam Carolla.
I'll go download Joey Diaz.

1674
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:07,350
Why would I bother spending two bucks
or something that I can get for free?

1675
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,560
That's where it gets weird when
there's just too much. The Internet,

1676
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:13,650
it's gotta be free. Everything's
gotta be free. If it's not free,

1677
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,710
it's not going to work.
It's just there's too much that it's free.

1678
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:19,860
That's too many options. Like you've got
to find another way to monetize things.

1679
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:24,060
He can't do it. The simple
like knucklehead way of
charging that really hasn't,

1680
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:27,720
I don't know anybody who's still doing
that or anybody who succeeded at charging

1681
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:31,920
for their podcasts. They do.
No, they do very well. Which
I do is, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1682
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,610
Dan Carlin makes a good
chunk of change out. He'll,

1683
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:39,480
he'll get angry with me and yeah.
Well I barely make his podcast should,

1684
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:42,900
his podcast is very different because uh,
like your audio books,

1685
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:44,730
it's more like audio books on history,

1686
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:49,731
but very dramatic and amazing flare to
me really gets you excited about learning

1687
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,910
about history.
But he charges for like the,

1688
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:56,580
he gives you the first 50
for free to get you hooked.

1689
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,130
And then if you want to get into the,
the databases,

1690
01:30:59,131 --> 01:31:02,640
once you really get addicted and you've
been nothing but Dan Carlin for two

1691
01:31:02,641 --> 01:31:05,490
months, you run out and then
you're like, what the fuck?

1692
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,180
And then he started paying money. Well
that, that's, that's perfectly good.

1693
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:13,070
You know? Yeah, I know what you're paying
for at that point. People like Ah, that's,

1694
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,990
that's totally worth a dollar an episode.
I know I'm gonna get my money's worth.

1695
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:16,890
And then they don't give a shit.

1696
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,660
That's the same thing that
happens with Nice staff.

1697
01:31:18,661 --> 01:31:20,190
Like once they know
what they're gonna get,

1698
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,540
they are perfectly fine paying
whatever comes out. Well you know what,

1699
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:24,374
it'll change it.

1700
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:29,280
If everything became like Amazon one click
where you just like your computer has

1701
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,770
all your credit card information
and then if you want something,

1702
01:31:31,771 --> 01:31:35,460
you just click on it and you go Amazon
one click because the Amazon one click

1703
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:40,110
would be only be slightly more
difficult than just clicking on it and

1704
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:42,990
downloading it slightly more difficult
cause you gotta pay a dollar.

1705
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:46,350
It's just where the dollar. Okay.
Let's see if it's worth a dollar click,

1706
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:50,250
it'd be pretty fucking easy to do.
But if you want to actually buy it,

1707
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:53,790
like you gotta go and entering
credit card information,

1708
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:55,670
get a pay pal account like this.

1709
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:58,050
A lot of fucking steps that
you're just not going to do.

1710
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:00,010
You're just going to change the tab

1711
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,810
and go to another website and you know,

1712
01:32:01,811 --> 01:32:05,050
go download the Nerdist or something
like that. Cause it's free. It's hard.

1713
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:06,940
It's hard to sell people
on buying something.

1714
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:11,290
But that just means that people are
like people looking at it from the wrong

1715
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:15,970
lens, you know there's a way to monetize
it and I think your way is the smartest.

1716
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:19,420
Give him as much free content
as possible. Then they go, wow,

1717
01:32:19,421 --> 01:32:22,620
this guy's fucking talented and
then they want to support you. Yeah.

1718
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,450
And there's a lot of, you know it's, I,

1719
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,090
it's putting there the
decision in their hands. You,

1720
01:32:28,091 --> 01:32:32,320
the customer know what you want to spend
your money on and we honestly don't

1721
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:35,320
give a shit if they just keep downloading
all of our books for free and never

1722
01:32:35,321 --> 01:32:36,940
pay for anything.
That's fine.

1723
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,640
Cause at the very least they're going to
go to work or they're going to talk to

1724
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:40,600
their friends, go, oh my God,

1725
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:43,390
he should this crazy growth story
heard called infected. It's nuts.

1726
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,910
This guy stabbing himself with a
fork for like five pages. It's nuts.

1727
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:49,270
And then eventually somebody they're
talking to is going to go check it out or

1728
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:53,350
just go by the book. So it's
not, you know, it's, it's one
we're, we're, we're, we're,

1729
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,230
our goal is we entertain people. That's
what we do. We take you out of your world,

1730
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:59,380
bring you into ours, take, get rid of
all your stress for a little while.

1731
01:32:59,381 --> 01:33:02,110
That's what we do for a living.
Some people want to do that for free.

1732
01:33:02,111 --> 01:33:04,750
Some people will pay for it.
And even the people get it for free.

1733
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,090
You're going to go out.
If we're good enough at our jobs,

1734
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,550
they're going to go out and talk to
their friends about it and we're going to

1735
01:33:09,551 --> 01:33:12,040
wind up getting that word of
mouth exposure. But we're big on,

1736
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:15,400
we've got a giant chip on our
shoulder. We're like, ah, that's,

1737
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:18,520
I work so hard to make my stuff so good
that I can give it to you for free.

1738
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,990
You're still going to
give me money for it.

1739
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,170
That's a great way of looking at it too.
You know what's cool about that?

1740
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:24,100
It's just,
it's,

1741
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:28,840
it's cool to think that you're also
getting by giving it away for free,

1742
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,120
you're getting that
word of mouth exposure,

1743
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:33,640
which he would be willing to pay
a lot of money for that. Yeah.

1744
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:36,010
I can't compete against the Stephen King.

1745
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:39,190
No one's put that kind of marketing money
behind me in it and we know that this

1746
01:33:39,191 --> 01:33:42,610
is a way for us to go out and get,
get new fans and get people to try us out.

1747
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:45,360
Yeah. He's like royalty at
this point. He's like, God,

1748
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:49,440
like it's aimed more at this point
and super fucking prolifically up.

1749
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:53,410
Jesus Christ makes you feel like such
a lazy fuck when you see that guy just

1750
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:56,620
churning bad ass book after Badass Book.
Yeah.

1751
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:00,820
It would be one thing if he was totally
phoning it in, but he's not like,

1752
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:04,720
people love these new books. Then the
new books that he's been coming out with,

1753
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,480
there's still bad. I just
read doctor sleep, you know,

1754
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:11,160
the SQL to the shining and uh, yeah,
Swahili. Yeah. Even heard of this.

1755
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:13,510
This is fucking excellent.
It's really good. Whoa.

1756
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,070
And then how long ago did you
put that in? Oh, it was only,

1757
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:18,680
I'm going to say it's hard, honestly,
it's hard to tell them he's,

1758
01:34:18,681 --> 01:34:21,520
he's already got to 800 page
novels coming down the pipe,

1759
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:23,740
but I'm going to guess it was
about three or four months ago.

1760
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,710
And it is the Danny Torrence,

1761
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:31,270
the little kid from the shining who's
now chronologically this is like the same

1762
01:34:31,271 --> 01:34:33,760
money or so now he's in his forties,
early forties I think.

1763
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:37,300
And then he gets into a whole
new perplexing situation,

1764
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:41,590
but book opens up with him,
him hitting rock bottom as an alcoholic.

1765
01:34:41,591 --> 01:34:45,950
Like it's rough. It's a rough read,
spoiler alert. Yeah, no, you go.

1766
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,950
But it goes to some pretty nutty areas,
so yeah.

1767
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:51,700
But he's prolific and he got what
he down does down to a science.

1768
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:55,090
Did you read it? Yeah. Did you enjoy
it as much as the original shining? No,

1769
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:58,310
I didn't. No, I didn't. And
that's partially because

1770
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:01,220
now that he's at such a royalty level,

1771
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:05,780
if he doesn't want to edit something, he
doesn't have to. And it's the same thing.

1772
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,720
It's the same place George Rr Martin is,
I'm not at that area.

1773
01:35:08,721 --> 01:35:12,020
I can go up my publisher and say, Yep,
800 page novel. They'll say, great,

1774
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:15,380
bring come back when it's 500 pages
and there's no way around it. You know,

1775
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:16,820
you've got to go through and refine that.

1776
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:20,060
And my editor is helping me make the
story better and better. Stephen King,

1777
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:22,890
why is he going to listen to
anybody? Honestly, at this point,

1778
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:26,470
and people come back and there's some,
you know, 25 year old interns like Nia.

1779
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,710
I know, I think this movement to knee
is too long and he's a shorten up.

1780
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:33,980
He's like, I'm Stephen King.
I think I know what I'm
doing. So the books now have,

1781
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:38,180
they don't move quite as fast as they
used to move. That's interesting. So yeah.

1782
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:41,200
So you credit the,
the editors with helping you

1783
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:45,840
with me. Absolutely. I'm a long winded,
I'm a long winded motherfucker. Right.

1784
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:49,060
If you gave me my druthers,
every book would be 1500 pages.

1785
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:52,360
You would need a wheelbarrow to carry
that thing around if it wasn't for the

1786
01:35:52,361 --> 01:35:55,470
editors. And you know, the, the people
I work with, like my business partner,

1787
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,520
but the books would be
just astronomically long.

1788
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,230
So what kind of relationship is that?

1789
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:04,270
That's an interesting relationship
with them. I hate them.

1790
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:08,080
Uh, I'm bitching about one of the other
and the other to the other all the time.

1791
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:13,240
You need them both. Yeah. Yeah. Well
I stomp around the office a lot. Uh,

1792
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,990
you know, I've got some kettle bells in
the office like God damn, sons of bitches,

1793
01:36:16,991 --> 01:36:20,530
you know, and just and get
mad and uh, uh, but it's,

1794
01:36:20,531 --> 01:36:24,430
it's worked in a good relationship
and um, I hate to admit it, but I,

1795
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:28,120
I bitch a lot during this process because
I get so frustrated because I want it

1796
01:36:28,121 --> 01:36:28,600
to be good.

1797
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:32,770
I so badly want it to be perfect and I
want people to read it and walk away.

1798
01:36:32,771 --> 01:36:34,750
Like, holy crap, that's
the best book I ever read.

1799
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:38,050
That's what I'm after every time. So
when the editors coming back going, yeah,

1800
01:36:38,051 --> 01:36:39,040
this isn't working.
And I'm like,

1801
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:42,310
I've put eight months of work into that
thing that you just want to get rid of,

1802
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:45,010
he's won. Beat the shit out of him.
Right. I just want to beat the shit out.

1803
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:48,280
But they're right. They, the
ultimately they wind up being right.

1804
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:52,750
Well when you stop listening, you know,
your fiction becomes something else.

1805
01:36:52,751 --> 01:36:56,200
Like [inaudible] you know,
the process where he was.

1806
01:36:56,201 --> 01:36:59,110
Everything he puts out makes 250 million
at some point he stops listening to the

1807
01:36:59,111 --> 01:37:01,990
people around them. Like, yeah, I
don't think the village is working out.

1808
01:37:01,991 --> 01:37:04,430
Maybe we should tweak this. And he's
like, it's tying that back channel. Yeah.

1809
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:08,740
They don't ever see planes he doesn't have
to listen to anymore. Exactly. Exactly.

1810
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,510
Yeah. So, so I still,

1811
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:14,440
I still listen and it's not easy cause
they got a bit of an ego with the fiction,

1812
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:17,850
but eventually these people break
me down and uh, and we make,

1813
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:19,480
we make a more refined,
better story.

1814
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:22,460
That's very honest of you. It's a
very honest in that, in that approach.

1815
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:25,430
And I think that's one of the reasons why
you're so prolific and successful with

1816
01:37:25,431 --> 01:37:28,820
your writing is that you have that
ability to look at yourself and the entire

1817
01:37:28,821 --> 01:37:32,350
situation objectively. It's very difficult
to do for a creative person. Yeah.

1818
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:35,420
A lot of creative people are
really bad at taking criticism.

1819
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,890
I'm not good at it, but uh, the, the two,

1820
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,800
the three primary people involved
in the process, my business partner,

1821
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:45,570
my agent and my editor, it's um,
you know, I, I trust these people.

1822
01:37:45,571 --> 01:37:47,130
They're successful at what they do.

1823
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:50,730
And at some point when they're telling
you something that is directly opposite

1824
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:52,950
of what you think, you still
have to sit down and go. Like,

1825
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:55,860
I'm going to evaluate what
you're saying on own merits.

1826
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:59,670
And it's not like every time I change it,
I are there. Their stuff, I'll be like,

1827
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:01,830
I'm fine. Don't fuckin publish the book
if you don't want that in there. Right.

1828
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:04,320
I don't give a shit. Yeah. Like
if that doesn't go in the book,

1829
01:38:04,321 --> 01:38:06,870
you don't get the book. So
there's, there's debate.

1830
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:10,380
It's not as simple as you just bring it
to them and then they say this is too

1831
01:38:10,381 --> 01:38:13,600
long and you shorten it up. You
sometimes go, no, it's not. So,

1832
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:15,360
so you stand your ground occasionally.
Yep.

1833
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,030
How do you know when to stand your ground?
There's just,

1834
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,930
there's certain things where,
um,

1835
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:25,020
as a storyteller you might not be able
to put into words the impact this moment

1836
01:38:25,021 --> 01:38:28,650
we'll have, but you know, in
your subconscious kind of,

1837
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:31,620
you know that structurally it's going
to impact this point, this point,

1838
01:38:31,621 --> 01:38:33,510
this point and then the ending.

1839
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:37,290
And then if you don't have this moment
that the editor doesn't really, he's like,

1840
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:40,980
why, who cares what he had for breakfast
for example? It doesn't matter. Like, yes,

1841
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:41,930
but that when,

1842
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:45,540
when they get to the end and see that
breakfast food again at the end of the

1843
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,170
book,

1844
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:49,680
it's going to tie everything together
and it's going to give the reader this

1845
01:38:49,681 --> 01:38:52,570
sense of completeness in his, her whole
soul and like there'll be satisfied,

1846
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:53,730
more satisfied with a book.

1847
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,740
So there are things that I can't really
explain or I'll try to explain and

1848
01:38:57,741 --> 01:38:59,430
they're not listening.
But eventually I'm just like,

1849
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,640
I know this works and that's got to go
in there and that's just the end of the

1850
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:07,420
story. But then a part of the give
and take is, you know, it's it,

1851
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:10,980
there's some quid pro quo and, and
I've had mad at her come back. Okay,

1852
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,890
you can keep that, but if you keep
that, you got to give up this. Wow.

1853
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:19,020
And he'll set it up in that like, and then
I'll, and then I'll just, I get furious.

1854
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:21,810
This shit. Do you think you'll
ever get rid of him? Uh,

1855
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:25,540
well then do you think you'll ever
be like, look, let's say rich,

1856
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:28,290
I got this with the technology of ebooks.

1857
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:29,790
Couldn't you just take like those chunks?

1858
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:32,490
Like it's this huge chunks that they tell
you to take out and make it like kind

1859
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:35,730
of like a director's cut. Like, Hey, you
buy an ebook and I'm also giving you this,

1860
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:36,421
like the whole thing.

1861
01:39:36,421 --> 01:39:39,780
I worked on this storyline that they told
me to cut out what we did that with my

1862
01:39:39,781 --> 01:39:44,580
book ancestor, we had the final book
from Crown, which is random house.

1863
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:47,640
And then there was like 50 pages
they cut out at the beginning,

1864
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:48,690
like you don't need all that.

1865
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:52,560
The story starts here in the general
thumb is you want to start as far into the

1866
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:53,850
story as you possibly can.

1867
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,310
But then I took those 50 pages and record
them as a podcast and give them their

1868
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,700
radio. So it's kind of kind of the same
thing. But this is the last pandemics,

1869
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:04,860
the last book I'm doing with Random
House and my agents taking new book out

1870
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:08,520
called Flyer as of like today,
literally today, starting to,

1871
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,070
to pitch it so we wind up
with random house again,

1872
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,560
I may have the same guy or it
may wind up with somebody else.

1873
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:18,590
I've been super lucky and that I've had
the same hardworking editor for all five

1874
01:40:18,901 --> 01:40:23,320
bucks, which from what I've told is
almost never happens to anybody. Seven,

1875
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:24,001
the same guy.

1876
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:27,570
So now he knows what I'm going for and
he knows my style and he knows how to

1877
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:31,400
manage me to some regard and he knows
when to ignore me when I'm calling him

1878
01:40:31,401 --> 01:40:35,220
names and stuff like that. So it's been
an awesome, awesome experience with him.

1879
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:38,400
So you have an editor, you have an
agent that also reads it as well.

1880
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:41,010
How many different people read it
before you had basically three?

1881
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:45,370
Basically three. Uh, my business partner
tends to read everything first, um,

1882
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:50,430
and uh, and, and take her feedback.
She has less feedback than the editor,

1883
01:40:50,431 --> 01:40:53,470
but the feedback she brings
back is more significant. Uh,

1884
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:55,120
so I'll pay attention to that.

1885
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:59,410
And then the agent usually only manages
the first 80 pages. Got Crazy add.

1886
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,020
And I'm like,
do you have to read the whole book?

1887
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:04,000
If you want to be part of the process,
you've got to read the whole book.

1888
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:05,290
I promise I'm going to
read the whole book.

1889
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:07,750
Then like the last five
drafts is that first 80 pages.

1890
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:08,584
That's all he gets through.

1891
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:11,030
If you want to be one of those
wheeler dealer type agents,

1892
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:12,680
you've got to have that sort of mentality.

1893
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,730
He's very, very, he's
very good at what he does.

1894
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:21,040
But we'll all, he cares about us. He knows
if I get this much of the book set up,

1895
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:24,700
he knows the sales process. Right.
If you buy in the first 50 pages,

1896
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:26,890
he can sell the book,
then your editors can fix the rest of it.

1897
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:28,930
So he's not that invested in
the full length of the book.

1898
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:32,890
And then the real work is done with a,
with Julie and the guy over at,

1899
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:36,760
at Crown Random House who reads, not
only is he read it all the way through,

1900
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:40,390
he's reading it all the way through five
times and having to pay close attention

1901
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,390
like we're talking like 500 page books.
Wow.

1902
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:46,780
He needs to pay super close attention
every time and I could not do his job at

1903
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:47,460
all.

1904
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:48,900
Now when you structure your stories,

1905
01:41:48,901 --> 01:41:53,700
do you use a software program to use
index cards on a, a bulletin board?

1906
01:41:53,701 --> 01:41:58,320
Like how do you set up where you're moving
all your pieces in your tetris game?

1907
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:01,420
I used to things we do use,
I got a uh,

1908
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:06,220
magnetic whiteboard in the office and
write on the index cards and put them all

1909
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:08,710
up with that. And sometimes, you
know, strings between the cards,

1910
01:42:08,711 --> 01:42:12,580
that kind of thing. That's the
general getting it all down the flow.

1911
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:17,020
And then I use a program called scrivener,
which people can use for Mac or PC.

1912
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,030
And it's basically the same thing.

1913
01:42:19,031 --> 01:42:22,270
It's little index cards in the
computer and there's an index card that

1914
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:26,470
represents a document. Each document
is a chapter, but it's great.

1915
01:42:26,471 --> 01:42:31,060
It's better than Microsoft
word because Microsoft word,

1916
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,890
once you get past a hundred pages,
200 pages,

1917
01:42:32,891 --> 01:42:36,070
you're copying big chunks and moving
around and it becomes a nightmare cause

1918
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:38,830
you're gonna screw something up.
But Scribner,

1919
01:42:38,831 --> 01:42:42,250
he just grabbed this icon
and drag it before this icon.
It rearranges everything.

1920
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,860
So I've gotten pretty adept at
using that a highly recommend it.

1921
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:47,470
It's great for scatterbrain
to keep everything flowing.

1922
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:49,630
And then a lot of times it'll just be,
you know,

1923
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,870
I get overwhelmed with the screen and
everything going on and I'll just pull out

1924
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:55,780
the three by five index cards and
start writing everything down again,

1925
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,140
bullet points and those put them up on
the board and go through it that way.

1926
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:03,120
So you like to do it digitally,
like to do it manually.

1927
01:43:03,121 --> 01:43:07,110
You like to just mix it up and constantly
keep doing it in a different way that

1928
01:43:07,111 --> 01:43:08,400
keeps your brain moving?

1929
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,010
Yeah, it, what I find is
when you get stuck there,

1930
01:43:11,011 --> 01:43:12,420
there's a couple of different things.
Number one,

1931
01:43:12,421 --> 01:43:14,070
if you're just staring at
that screen and you're stuck,

1932
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:16,770
just getting your hands involved
in a pen. And I, you know,

1933
01:43:16,771 --> 01:43:20,460
like just an ink pen and paper is a
tactile experience is different experience

1934
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:23,700
at activates different parts of your
brain sometimes can like, oh now I get it,

1935
01:43:23,701 --> 01:43:26,190
now I see what I was stuck on.
So that's part of it.

1936
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:30,030
And other parts of it is either,
there's only so much screen real estate,

1937
01:43:30,031 --> 01:43:33,150
so you can only see so many things
at one time. If you really stuck,

1938
01:43:33,151 --> 01:43:35,770
you pull back, right? All these index
cards, you put it up in this, you know,

1939
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:40,110
four foot by five foot whiteboard and
you kind of look at everything that can

1940
01:43:40,111 --> 01:43:44,810
spring your brain free at times too. So
it's largely, it's grabbing whatever's,

1941
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:49,240
if I get stuck in one area,
I'll start going to other areas and um,

1942
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:52,040
when I get really
overwhelmed, frustrated, I am

1943
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,880
more comfortable slipping back into, you
know, the eight year old version of me,

1944
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:59,870
which is a little piece of paper and some
notes or an index card and go back and

1945
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:02,030
just ride it out till it all
kind of flows onto the page.

1946
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:05,800
So as long as the process
is just continuing over and
over and over again. Yeah,

1947
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:09,460
that's a scrivener. Yup. Yeah,
I use that for jokes I use.

1948
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:14,170
Yeah I use it. I use a couple
of different things. One,

1949
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:16,940
I use a real chalkboard or
real a corkboard rather.

1950
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:20,570
And I have index cards and I put
them up with pins and I have bits.

1951
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,960
I have a one star,
two star and three star.

1952
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:27,590
One star is a completely new bit, two
stars a bit. That's still improving.

1953
01:44:27,591 --> 01:44:30,440
Three stars is a bit,
that's pretty close to being done.

1954
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,720
They always grow and change and get weird.

1955
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:36,320
And there's always like new directions
they take on certain shows and cause I

1956
01:44:36,321 --> 01:44:37,121
mixed them up to,

1957
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:41,960
I'll mix up the order of like the
different pieces inside the bit to try to

1958
01:44:41,961 --> 01:44:43,400
figure out which way works.

1959
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,730
And I like scrivener because I could take
those cards and just move them around.

1960
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:50,480
And sometimes when I'm just studying,
just thinking about my act,

1961
01:44:50,481 --> 01:44:52,340
maybe I'll listen to recordings.

1962
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,400
It's one of the most
uncomfortable parts of standup.

1963
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:59,180
But I think one of the most important, you
got to listen to pen, see yourself, um,

1964
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:02,120
and, and listen to like, Ooh, I don't like
how I did that. Like there's too much,

1965
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:05,960
too much bullshit and that joke and
that this joke is Kinda clunky and the

1966
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:10,220
wording's not good or the inflection
is too fake or what have you.

1967
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:14,480
You know? So, uh, that
process is a aided by that.

1968
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,850
And one of the things that I really
love was going to ask you about is right

1969
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:20,180
room ever use right room. I've used
it just to look on the phone now.

1970
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:22,510
Right room is the one that
takes your entire screen.

1971
01:45:22,511 --> 01:45:25,190
It makes it black and gives you that
green screen. We'll do that to you.

1972
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:25,541
Oh it does.

1973
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:29,450
It really Scribner's got a white out or
a blackout feature and I can get sort of

1974
01:45:29,451 --> 01:45:32,000
everything on the screen except what
you're reading. So kind of the same thing.

1975
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:36,080
Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah. Well that's right.
Room doesn't give you access to anything.

1976
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:39,140
You can't go to the toolbar. You can't
say what time it is. You don't get shit.

1977
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,470
Yeah, that's right. Room. That's what
it looks like. I really, really like it.

1978
01:45:42,471 --> 01:45:44,110
It's my favorite.
I,

1979
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:46,970
it's something I probably need to start
using more and Scribner cause I get

1980
01:45:46,971 --> 01:45:49,880
distracted trying to stay in touch
with social media and everything else.

1981
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:52,130
And if you're on the computer and
a fan is asking you a question,

1982
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:55,840
the natural impulses to go answer
that question. So, you know,

1983
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,430
getting to a point where I can
just ignore all that. But, um,

1984
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:03,550
I was just in Vegas for the new media
expo and when I really get into it and I

1985
01:46:03,801 --> 01:46:07,940
was under deadline, so I started writing
at noon. We were staying at the Rio,

1986
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:11,390
don't have the seafood buffet at the rail.
I will tell you that I, how dare you.

1987
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:14,660
Oh my God. Oh my God.
I've said that the top,

1988
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:16,940
the best vomit of my whole life
and has been a lot of vomiting,

1989
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:21,290
clams and a musket. Oh, I don't even
know. I don't know what it was but it was,

1990
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:24,140
it was Linda Blair shit.
It was crazy. But I'm,

1991
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:27,920
I'm writing and it's like noon out and
like there's the window and the window is

1992
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:31,730
open and by the time I got finished it
looked out and it was pitch black outside.

1993
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:36,080
So sometimes I can't imagine it's the
same thing when you're writing more of the

1994
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:38,000
short form jokes and moving
around from the jokes.

1995
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:40,370
But for this long form
things like 50 page story,

1996
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:43,760
I had my own screen came up and I,
that's all I was working on.

1997
01:46:43,761 --> 01:46:46,130
I didn't look at anything else. Just
wrote the whole thing through. Yeah.

1998
01:46:46,131 --> 01:46:50,070
You can get in those zones. Uh, I
don't write jokes like joke jokes.

1999
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,820
What I do is I write about subjects and
I find the jokes in what I write about

2000
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:57,480
it when he went. What I find is
that when I'm writing about things,

2001
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:01,890
it takes longer for me to write the word
history then for me to think of it or

2002
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:05,250
know it exists. If I'm thinking
about history, I can think about it.

2003
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,450
But I have to say his tier.

2004
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:12,410
I mean I have to actually individually
type all the letters and in that you,

2005
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,770
you have much more consideration to
every sentence that you write every,

2006
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:20,520
every chapter,
every concept because you're,

2007
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:25,290
you're thinking a lot quicker than your
writing. So as you're writing it down,

2008
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:27,560
you're considering deeply each,

2009
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:32,670
it's like its forces you to pause
and consider each individual word,

2010
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,350
consider the, the, the,

2011
01:47:34,351 --> 01:47:37,980
the concept you're actually talking about
far more than if you were just having

2012
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:41,070
a conversation. You're having a
conversation. It takes more, it takes,

2013
01:47:41,071 --> 01:47:45,780
it's much quicker to get the words out.
Right. I think in that slowing you down,

2014
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:49,470
it makes you consider things more and
then sometimes you'll just miss like

2015
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:52,980
really obvious shit that you would
have missed it if you were talking,

2016
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,800
but when you're riding like,
oh, and what about this?

2017
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:58,170
And then you'll go off
in some other directions.

2018
01:47:58,171 --> 01:48:01,500
Like you give your brain like a
different rhythm. The rhythm of writing.

2019
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:06,150
No talking, no, no, no distractions, no
fucking music. Stop all the nonsense.

2020
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:10,500
Lock the door, hit the right room
and just go. Yeah. Do you find,

2021
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:13,590
do you find you have to go for a certain
amount of time before all of a sudden

2022
01:48:13,591 --> 01:48:16,860
shit starts to take off? I'm useless
for the first half hour. Yeah. Yeah.

2023
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,180
Sometimes I,

2024
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,780
I don't even take credit for the things
I write because it's not me writing them.

2025
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:29,640
You know? It's your inner,
your inner muse. We'd wrote
it. We wrote that one. No,

2026
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:31,580
I don't know how that one in me,
I,

2027
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,350
I'm like the first 30 minutes
are usually just trash,

2028
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:37,500
absolute trash work and then at some
point something just takes over and you're

2029
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,600
making really good stuff.
It's interesting, isn't it?

2030
01:48:39,601 --> 01:48:43,980
That that weird switch that goes off
where you find yourself really zen in what

2031
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:47,250
you're doing? For me it is
probably around the same time,

2032
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:51,210
about 30 minutes in 2030 minutes. The
first 20 minutes, I don't even think,

2033
01:48:51,211 --> 01:48:56,211
I'm just trying to smash keys and
write things down and just thinking,

2034
01:48:56,461 --> 01:48:58,400
but just kind of getting
into it and trying to,

2035
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:02,130
and then somewhere along the line
you catch traction. My add is so bad.

2036
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:06,360
Now I've got a technique like I'll just
set the alarm on the phone instead of 30

2037
01:49:06,361 --> 01:49:09,420
minutes and then I'm like, okay, I'm
just not going to look at anything else.

2038
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:13,190
I can do this for 30 minutes. It's just
starting that that bad. That's bad.

2039
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,940
Force yourself to write for 30 minutes,

2040
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:18,750
doesn't matter what you write and then
almost invariably by the time the buzzer

2041
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:20,940
goes off, you're just like turn it off
and you're just like, cause you're,

2042
01:49:20,941 --> 01:49:23,160
you're rolling at that point,
but you have to force yourself to be like,

2043
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:24,750
I have to get into that groove.

2044
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,840
My groove is usually also
to move around the house.

2045
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:33,030
I like to pick up my laptop and go sit
somewhere else, go sit in my uh, you know,

2046
01:49:33,031 --> 01:49:36,570
sit in my living room, go sit
upstairs, go sit in front of the TV.

2047
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:39,900
You don't even watch TV. Just sit on the
couch. And I think that when I do that,

2048
01:49:39,901 --> 01:49:42,510
instead of just being in my office and
stare at the screen sometimes just being

2049
01:49:42,511 --> 01:49:46,260
in a different space, sitting
in a different place, just
go, oh, we're here now.

2050
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:50,590
And that just that
changing of your routine,

2051
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:55,180
just a little variation on it sometimes
can spark the mind an interesting new

2052
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:55,660
direction.

2053
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:56,470
Yeah.
You get,

2054
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:59,770
you get down these wormholes and just
getting any other kind of sensory input,

2055
01:49:59,771 --> 01:50:02,120
which goes back to now I'm going to write
things down instead of type them out

2056
01:50:02,121 --> 01:50:04,780
or anything like that can
cause it's all in there.

2057
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:07,150
All that stuff you want to come up
with is in there. It's not like you're,

2058
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:10,120
you know, it's not like you have a factory
where you have to make all this crap.

2059
01:50:10,121 --> 01:50:12,250
It's all already in there.
You just kind of getting,

2060
01:50:12,251 --> 01:50:15,310
figuring out how to mine it out of your
own brain and put it onto the page,

2061
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:20,050
you know? And I also find super
beneficial. A Walk, a walk. Yeah. Walk,

2062
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:23,680
you know, and uh, used to
bring a recorder, but now
with these new cell phones,

2063
01:50:23,681 --> 01:50:27,610
you don't have to know your phone can
record amazing notes and I just go for a

2064
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:29,950
walk, walk my dogs or something
like that, go down the street.

2065
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:34,180
And just when I'm thinking about something
and I've got something in my head and

2066
01:50:34,181 --> 01:50:37,360
I'm done writing and then I'm reviewing
the things that I wrote and like,

2067
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:41,140
how would I, how would I view this
if I was a person who was reading it?

2068
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:43,330
Like how would I, how would
I take this? Like I'll,

2069
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:46,750
I'll take it into consideration as I'm
walking. It's like the fat, you know,

2070
01:50:46,751 --> 01:50:51,190
there's something about forcing yourself
to do a mundane, very obvious task.

2071
01:50:51,191 --> 01:50:52,900
Left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot,

2072
01:50:52,901 --> 01:50:55,990
and then you can get into that groove
of introspective thought. Yeah.

2073
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,140
Yeah. And it does. Some of
that to me is like I've,

2074
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,450
I've got this little tiny office,
but there's like a loop.

2075
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:04,560
There's like four rooms and you actually
go from kitchen to this room to the

2076
01:51:04,561 --> 01:51:07,470
entryway to the writing room.
And I just don't do labs,

2077
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:10,650
so I just started doing laps and it
usually doesn't take very long because

2078
01:51:10,651 --> 01:51:13,560
you're turning right all the
time, every two steps. And it's,

2079
01:51:13,561 --> 01:51:16,710
there's something about your brain has
to put some level of attention on and not

2080
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:21,030
walking into things. And that usually
comes from the part that's blocking you.

2081
01:51:21,031 --> 01:51:23,250
The part that stopped me,
like you're convincing yourself,

2082
01:51:23,251 --> 01:51:25,740
you can't get this shit out
and now, okay. Oh, all right.

2083
01:51:25,741 --> 01:51:27,930
Boom that run back to the desk
and start writing things down

2084
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:31,820
really quick. Have you ever tried using
speech recognition software for writing?

2085
01:51:31,821 --> 01:51:32,020
Right.

2086
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:36,870
Wouldn't work for me only because I'm,
by the time I block a sentence down,

2087
01:51:36,871 --> 01:51:39,900
it's probably already be written, been
rewritten three times. Start the sentence,

2088
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:43,620
go back, start sentence, go back. And
unfortunately a pretty fast typer.

2089
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:48,060
I learned that a long time ago. It
was, I knew I wanted to write and yeah,

2090
01:51:48,061 --> 01:51:50,520
I just changed things.
Sell fast like it's all muscle memory now.

2091
01:51:50,521 --> 01:51:52,700
It's like copy this, paste
this, move this around. I,

2092
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:55,350
I cannot imagine speech
recognition would ever work for me.

2093
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:00,440
The um, uh, Mavis beacon teaches
typing. That's the one I owe, I owe.

2094
01:52:00,441 --> 01:52:03,310
That made us bake and she goes,
yeah,

2095
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:06,920
that was a for me meant
I was the poker guy. Yep.

2096
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,150
Looking right at them. It took a
long time. Genius product. Like no,

2097
01:52:11,151 --> 01:52:13,220
just play video games pitch.
He goes and like what?

2098
01:52:13,221 --> 01:52:15,910
I'm just playing video games and all
of a sudden I can type, it was amazing.

2099
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,780
Amazing.
And it's their fun games.

2100
01:52:17,781 --> 01:52:20,420
Like you're racing and share that you're
doing all kinds of different stuff and

2101
01:52:20,690 --> 01:52:24,290
figuring out where the little keys
are. That's, that's so important, man.

2102
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,940
I used to have one of those
goofy keyboards. It was
like separated split ones.

2103
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:32,770
Yeah. And your hands rest on it and ship
those died off. What happened there?

2104
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,310
Economic.

2105
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:35,740
I just want to be working on my end.
I don't think they worked for crap.

2106
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:36,760
They're supposed to be good for you.

2107
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:39,470
I had the one that actually was like
a transformer. It actually had a hand.

2108
01:52:39,471 --> 01:52:43,090
You went out to the sides. That thing
was bad ass. Did you ever get it? Get

2109
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:46,490
the one where you sink in,
you sink your fingers in.

2110
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:48,050
There was a weird one like this.

2111
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:50,010
Fingers like sitting in a cradle.

2112
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:53,040
I still have to look like every now and
then I'm still glancing down to get some

2113
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:56,010
kind of tracking going on,
which I don't need to do any more,

2114
01:52:56,011 --> 01:52:59,940
but it can't break myself of the
habit like I can, I can I do this.

2115
01:52:59,941 --> 01:53:02,160
Sometimes when I'm all
overwhelmed with an idea,

2116
01:53:02,161 --> 01:53:05,590
I'll just close my eyes and just start
typing so I don't need to do it anymore,

2117
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:08,400
but I'm still, I can't break that
habit of looking down at the screen.

2118
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,200
That's ancient. That's the
thing. Look at that. Yeah.
Yeah. I had one of those. Yeah,

2119
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,230
there was those and then there was the
Microsoft ones are a little bit more

2120
01:53:16,231 --> 01:53:19,800
curly and they had like a us an actual
space in between. Didn't separate.

2121
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:21,510
They're just,
it's more like lumpy.

2122
01:53:21,511 --> 01:53:25,740
They called them ergonomic keyboard makes
those things anymore. I don't think,

2123
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:27,810
I don't know.
You know what the problem is,

2124
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:31,680
you get used to those and then you go to
a laptop and it's feels weird. You know,

2125
01:53:31,681 --> 01:53:34,590
a lot of people are typing
their stuff on laptops now.

2126
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:39,360
So like the way you learn how to type on
a laptop is you want your fingers to be

2127
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:42,810
right in that position of j and
f the fingers across the board.

2128
01:53:42,811 --> 01:53:43,800
And then from there you go.

2129
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:47,250
If you go back and forth from
laptop to keyboard delight,

2130
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:50,910
this is like a thinking part.
We have to like a quarterback changing.

2131
01:53:50,911 --> 01:53:54,490
You're throwing lotions to
change everything around.
Yeah. It fucks with you. Yeah.

2132
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:58,530
But the speech recognition software is
fascinating to me because I wonder if

2133
01:53:58,531 --> 01:54:01,420
that I'll ever be something that
I'm interested in because, uh,

2134
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:05,770
for the walks, I have to imagine,
you know. Right. You're walking,

2135
01:54:05,771 --> 01:54:07,180
you're still speak everything down.

2136
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,710
No, I just record it. Right.
And Go back and listen to, yeah.

2137
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:10,790
I go back and listen to it.

2138
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:14,430
I really find that there's a
completely different state of mind. Uh,

2139
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,010
the actual writing state of mind,

2140
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:21,011
and I find that I'm way more creative
when I could just sit in total silence,

2141
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,170
not hear my voice or anybody's
voice and the right, I'll,

2142
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:27,650
I'll allow my brain to go in all sorts
of weird directions when they're not,

2143
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,500
it's not attached to flowing,
moving language.

2144
01:54:30,501 --> 01:54:35,120
Ideas can serve emerge instantaneously
and I just try to follow them and capture

2145
01:54:35,121 --> 01:54:38,870
them in writing. I think a, I limit
myself when I'm actually talking.

2146
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:44,100
Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Know it comes to
writing things. Yeah. It, it's for me,

2147
01:54:44,101 --> 01:54:47,400
but at this point it's just down to,
it's a process.

2148
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:49,920
Now I've got the process going and
getting more and more comfort with the

2149
01:54:49,921 --> 01:54:52,590
process. So hopefully I'm
growing towards that. You know,

2150
01:54:52,591 --> 01:54:57,420
Stephen King's process is just so fast
that your process is also very creative.

2151
01:54:57,421 --> 01:54:59,950
I mean, you have to have this
idea. You have to have the story,

2152
01:54:59,951 --> 01:55:03,780
you have to create this story.
That part's never people.

2153
01:55:03,781 --> 01:55:05,970
Some people talking about writer's block,
I've never had that.

2154
01:55:05,971 --> 01:55:10,380
I've had the opposite,
which is just this on slot of cool ideas.

2155
01:55:10,381 --> 01:55:11,191
Like this would be a good book.

2156
01:55:11,191 --> 01:55:14,680
And this be a good book and trying to
try and keep track of everything. So the,

2157
01:55:14,681 --> 01:55:16,140
the creative part,
um,

2158
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:19,920
being a scatter little kid fortunately
just has never been an issue for me.

2159
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,521
It's all it with me.

2160
01:55:20,521 --> 01:55:24,930
It's always been the discipline of being
able to write it down and trying to

2161
01:55:24,931 --> 01:55:26,760
fight the add and you know,

2162
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:31,410
and like I have to keep working on
this to make it the best it can be.

2163
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:34,350
When after the first draft, I'm kind
of already done with it. I'm like, oh,

2164
01:55:34,351 --> 01:55:35,940
I want to, I want to go do
something else, but you can't.

2165
01:55:35,941 --> 01:55:37,760
You got to go back and keep
hammering on that sword,

2166
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:40,230
making it make it a good
weapon. Yeah, that's,

2167
01:55:40,231 --> 01:55:44,130
that's really interesting that it's the,
the different of

2168
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,130
creative processes that all
try to achieve the same thing.

2169
01:55:47,131 --> 01:55:50,190
Whether it's a song or a
movie or a book or, or a joke.

2170
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:52,170
It's this completely fascinating to me,

2171
01:55:52,171 --> 01:55:54,280
the different ways that people
approach it in different,

2172
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:57,810
the different mindsets they
have in approaching it too.

2173
01:55:58,370 --> 01:56:02,150
You know this, that there's,
there's no one pattern,

2174
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:04,670
which is what's fascinating about
the human brain and everybody's got a

2175
01:56:04,671 --> 01:56:08,390
different way of doing it and just keep
working at it till you get to that end

2176
01:56:08,391 --> 01:56:11,900
product and where you can hopefully
look at what you finished with.

2177
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,390
And I think all creative people
kind of have the same thing.

2178
01:56:14,391 --> 01:56:16,670
You probably have it too,
like that's a pretty good joke.

2179
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:19,490
That's not the best it could possibly be,
but I think that's pretty good.

2180
01:56:19,491 --> 01:56:22,400
That's going to go in the arsenal
for the next stand up. And with me,

2181
01:56:22,401 --> 01:56:24,170
it's like that book is pretty good.

2182
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:26,030
I would work on that book
for the next 10 years,

2183
01:56:26,031 --> 01:56:29,960
every day to try and make
everything perfect. But you
know, at least for me there,

2184
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:32,780
there is no perfection. Like,
and here's some others go.

2185
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:34,730
I keep working on until
I've absolutely the perfect,

2186
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:37,070
the perfect phrase and the perfect
sentence in a perfect paragraph and the

2187
01:56:37,071 --> 01:56:39,290
perfect page, that's great. But you know,

2188
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:43,010
we got to put a book out and sell some
books so I can't work on a book for 10

2189
01:56:43,011 --> 01:56:45,790
years. Yeah, it's never perfect
either because your perception,

2190
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,740
sins of it change radically from d.

2191
01:56:47,741 --> 01:56:51,730
I mean like there's stuff that I enjoyed
that I did just a couple of years ago

2192
01:56:51,731 --> 01:56:54,520
that if I have to watch now, I don't, I
don't know. Yeah, anything to do with it.

2193
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:55,920
I don't want to watch it.
I want to listen to it.

2194
01:56:57,490 --> 01:57:01,410
Ron, I mean just to 24 months ago
I'm like, I don't want to hear it.

2195
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:04,220
I've gotten to the point now
where unless it's for research,

2196
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:05,990
I don't go back and reread the old books.

2197
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:09,140
And I heard an interview with
Bryan Cranston on Nerdist
that really helped a ton

2198
01:57:09,141 --> 01:57:09,501
with that,

2199
01:57:09,501 --> 01:57:12,380
which you know when he's just kicking
everybody's ass at breaking bad and he's

2200
01:57:12,381 --> 01:57:15,650
like the baddest actor ever at this
moment. He was really focused on,

2201
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:20,890
he puts everything he has
into that performance and
then the second he walks off

2202
01:57:20,961 --> 01:57:23,840
the set he's done. He's like, I'm
not paying attention to that anymore.

2203
01:57:23,841 --> 01:57:26,990
I'm moving on to the next thing I
did as best I can. So with my books,

2204
01:57:26,991 --> 01:57:30,560
cause I get worked every time I reread a
book and find a mistake or some kind of

2205
01:57:30,561 --> 01:57:32,930
goof up or something,
the character motivation isn't right.

2206
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:36,950
I get super angry and super worked up.
So now I just don't read that stuff.

2207
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:38,370
Like it's got to go.
Well I think

2208
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,800
that you sort of, when, when
you're done with a project,

2209
01:57:41,801 --> 01:57:45,310
you've internalized everything that you're
gonna learn from that everything that

2210
01:57:45,311 --> 01:57:49,270
you've, you know, I, I feel like
as an artist, as a crafts person,

2211
01:57:49,271 --> 01:57:51,580
whether it's a writer or
anything or a musician,

2212
01:57:51,850 --> 01:57:54,670
I think you're getting better all the
time or you're not getting better.

2213
01:57:54,850 --> 01:57:55,571
It's one of the two.

2214
01:57:55,571 --> 01:57:57,580
Either you're getting better all the
time and you're constantly working on

2215
01:57:57,581 --> 01:58:00,050
improving things or you're not.
And um,

2216
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:04,270
there's only a certain amount of time
that you should consider the past certain

2217
01:58:04,271 --> 01:58:07,600
amount of time he consider past work.
And cause if you consider it,

2218
01:58:07,601 --> 01:58:09,820
you're really robbing yourself,
present work,

2219
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:13,420
you're really robbing yourself of the
focus that you could be using on working

2220
01:58:13,421 --> 01:58:17,740
on the shit that you thinking about
right now. So in that mindset,

2221
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:20,740
I just start getting repulsed,
repulsed by my old stuff.

2222
01:58:20,741 --> 01:58:21,760
Like I don't want to talk.
How's

2223
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:25,950
it [inaudible] if I find myself on TV,
I go flip the channel.

2224
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:29,570
The other day I was in my car two times
in a row and raw dog was playing my

2225
01:58:29,571 --> 01:58:33,620
comedy. I'm like, shut up. I want to
fucking hear me. I don't want to hear me.

2226
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:38,280
I don't want to even think that I was
a different person 10 years ago and I'm

2227
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:42,010
concentrating on right now. I had
experience recently stand up. Uh,

2228
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,510
not,
I'm not doing standup listening.

2229
01:58:43,511 --> 01:58:48,460
Stand up that show me how
much I have changed as a
person and I'm on Pandora all.

2230
01:58:48,461 --> 01:58:52,210
I listened to his, uh, comedy on Pandora.
That's like when I'm not writing. Okay,

2231
01:58:52,211 --> 01:58:53,650
I got to pick up the opposite.
Got to clean up.

2232
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,560
Let's put out some comedy on Pandora
and just let that cycle through and hear

2233
01:58:56,561 --> 01:59:01,260
new stuff. And I started a new channel
for the Andrew dice clay channel and I go,

2234
01:59:01,261 --> 01:59:04,690
now, I was in college, we were all crazy
for dice. Like there was like we get,

2235
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:07,780
we gathered in the room and
watch VHS, it'd be like eight
guys. Why? Just like, ah,

2236
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:11,380
you're the best. And then I'm listening
to it now and I'm remembering these,

2237
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:14,470
hearing him do all these old bits
and I'm like, Oh, I love this bit.

2238
01:59:14,471 --> 01:59:16,180
And then I'm listening
to it. I'm like, yeah,

2239
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:17,860
this isn't really all
that funny to me anymore.

2240
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:22,960
This is so racist and so massage
and this and that. Like, you know,

2241
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,100
like somebody who's really good at racist
team right now as is Daniel tosh like

2242
01:59:27,101 --> 01:59:30,010
can do it in a way that
doesn't make you uncomfortable.

2243
01:59:30,011 --> 01:59:33,820
Like I don't know how he does it, but
listen to Andrew dice. Clay was like this,

2244
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:38,620
I don't, this isn't for me.
And more aggressive. Yeah,
well it's in the bowl bitch.

2245
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:43,210
Oh. And I realized like I was, what
we were all laughing at was that,

2246
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:46,360
that amazing the delivery is
delivering is timing were great,

2247
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:48,010
but the actual subject matter was,
and I'm like,

2248
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:52,150
I cannot believe how much I have changed
that I don't find this funny anymore.

2249
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:55,700
See I've gotten more immature and
I find it funnier. Is that right?

2250
01:59:55,701 --> 02:00:00,460
Because what I know he's doing is he's
doing an act. Yeah. Doing a character,

2251
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,151
you know,

2252
02:00:01,151 --> 02:00:06,151
he makes things up like his characters
is preposterously ridiculously oversexed

2253
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:09,820
asshole, you know, and
you know what to expect.

2254
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:14,821
So I enjoy it from this completely non
politically correct approach that he's

2255
02:00:15,971 --> 02:00:20,110
doing. Like as a, you know, that's his
act. That's what he's chosen to do. Right.

2256
02:00:20,111 --> 02:00:23,380
I mean he could easily start doing
clean jokes and concentrate on that. No,

2257
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:27,490
he's gotten dirty or he wears
weightlifting. Gloves is good.

2258
02:00:27,491 --> 02:00:28,660
His hair slicked back.

2259
02:00:28,661 --> 02:00:33,100
He's wearing a fanny pack and
he's talking about sucking Dick.

2260
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:37,930
Oh, it's fun. Big Glasses.
It's, he's got giant old lady,

2261
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:42,910
old Jewish lady I seen as new
step in awhile. He's Larry.

2262
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:44,770
We saw him in Vegas.
It was me,

2263
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:49,390
Brian Anthony from opie and Anthony
and Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly.

2264
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:54,340
A bunch of comedians. And we fucking
cried laughing. Yeah, it was so,

2265
02:00:54,341 --> 02:00:58,600
cause it was for us. First of all, we
know it's an act. We know it's comedy.

2266
02:00:58,601 --> 02:01:01,030
We know. I mean we,
we've been aware of it.

2267
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:06,160
I was a huge fan before ever got into
comedy, so to be there like in Vegas,

2268
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:10,060
having a couple of cocktails and be
able to watch, just sit there and watch.

2269
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:14,260
It was fucking hell. I bet. I bet. Live.
It's still pretty impressive. Ridiculous.

2270
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:19,230
He's talking about how to catch fag, how
you catch, how you make it a gay kid.

2271
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:24,130
It was so ridiculous. It was so
ridiculous. Like talking about how

2272
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:27,470
so you get fig like he,

2273
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:31,360
he's trying to get more and
more preposterous. There's,
there's all right. All of

2274
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:35,260
us, there's all of us. After the
show is, it was really fucking funny.

2275
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:38,920
I mean me and Jimmy Norton and
Brian and we were crying, laughing.

2276
02:01:38,921 --> 02:01:41,270
It was really funny.
But it's ridiculous.

2277
02:01:41,271 --> 02:01:45,060
There's an art form in sang ridiculous
shit. You don't really mean. Right,

2278
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,720
and that's what I think dice
does. Right? But if you, yeah,

2279
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:49,250
if you were alone in your car,

2280
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:53,160
if you're in your home and
you're completely sober and
you're listening to some

2281
02:01:53,161 --> 02:01:56,370
of the horrible things, he
said like, what the fuck, man,

2282
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:59,790
I'm uncomfortable laughing at this now.
I don't know what that says about me.

2283
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:03,240
It's fiction. It's, you know,

2284
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:08,200
if from the characters tractive I catch
a ton of shit for my books. Do you? Yeah.

2285
02:02:08,201 --> 02:02:13,200
I get people, like, people are so caught
up in their own, this is who I am.

2286
02:02:13,590 --> 02:02:15,750
You can make fun of everybody
else outside of this area.

2287
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,020
But the second you touch on my area,
you're a dick.

2288
02:02:19,050 --> 02:02:23,280
So I get it in black,
like me talking about dice clay right now,

2289
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:26,610
I get people like, I can't believe
your, that massage Mike. No,

2290
02:02:26,611 --> 02:02:29,940
that's this asshole character.
That's not me. That's the character.

2291
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:32,970
And people can't,
some people can't differentiate that,

2292
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:36,990
but nobody has a problem with it until
it's their particular area. Yes. Yeah.

2293
02:02:36,991 --> 02:02:41,290
If you're picking on vegans or
transsexuals, are Republicans, right?

2294
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:45,240
Getty you that Natasha Leggiero a
thing that happened over the weekend?

2295
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:48,220
No. Yeah, she, she made a
joke. Uh, she was doing,

2296
02:02:48,221 --> 02:02:53,110
Carson Daly had a new year's show in
Times Square and she made a joke about a

2297
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,420
old folks and,
um,

2298
02:02:55,690 --> 02:03:00,690
World War Two and Pearl Harbor
and she got more fucking hate,

2299
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:04,300
like unbelievable amounts
of people were angry at her.

2300
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:09,130
So she made a non-apology put it on
our website and she's like, fuck,

2301
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,670
it's beautiful, you know,
to, to do that in the fake,

2302
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:17,620
her apology was brilliantly written to
which she said is she was called a cunt

2303
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:21,300
so many times. She thought she was in a
British pub rooting for the wrong thing.

2304
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:24,780
Soccer team,
her originally

2305
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:27,720
joke wasn't even a Pearl Harbor joke.

2306
02:03:27,721 --> 02:03:30,720
It was just a denture joke about old
people eating spaghettio's because

2307
02:03:30,721 --> 02:03:35,160
spaghetti has got so much shit for having
that image of a spaghetti holding an

2308
02:03:35,161 --> 02:03:39,480
American flag that they put up on Pearl
Harbor Day just to kind of show respect

2309
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:42,630
now, you know? And then they were like,
what? How dare you, you know what?

2310
02:03:42,631 --> 02:03:46,280
It was the actual joke. Do you have a,
yeah, I'll pull it up. But it was a,

2311
02:03:47,130 --> 02:03:49,430
uh, hold on. Yeah.

2312
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:53,330
There's a lot of people out there that
fucking love to be offended. Oh yeah.

2313
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,940
I live in San Francisco
for crying out loud.

2314
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:56,601
Well yes,

2315
02:03:56,601 --> 02:04:00,020
there's a lot in there and they love to
talk about being offended and they love

2316
02:04:00,021 --> 02:04:02,330
to get angry at you
because they're offended.

2317
02:04:02,650 --> 02:04:06,590
Well you, uh, you are big on the Internet.
I'm sure you deal with that daily basis.

2318
02:04:06,591 --> 02:04:08,960
Look at that. And then Tagetik
live. Hold on, scroll up. Scroll up.

2319
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:14,690
Popular comedian living
today. She's cool. I love her.

2320
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,910
Pandora just introduced me to her like
a couple of weeks ago. She's great.

2321
02:04:18,410 --> 02:04:19,880
She's very nice too. She's a nice, nice

2322
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:22,440
person. Stated two of my friends too. Hmm.

2323
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:26,180
Now three cause I like
Moshe to uh, yeah, she,

2324
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:31,190
but she wrote on her thing. She's not
apologizing for shit. I love it. Cool.

2325
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,030
Yeah.

2326
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:35,000
Cause there's always people out there
that are going to want you to apologize

2327
02:04:35,001 --> 02:04:37,070
for something that's fucking
ridiculous to apologize.

2328
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,610
They're always going to exist.

2329
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:39,381
I got the,

2330
02:04:39,381 --> 02:04:42,830
the most recent one that came up and
you don't think it's bad until somebody

2331
02:04:42,831 --> 02:04:46,040
actually kind of calls you
on it in the book. Nocturnal.

2332
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:51,340
There's a character who has
Tourette's syndrome and also has a,

2333
02:04:51,641 --> 02:04:55,430
a voicebox has lost his voice,
a voice box due to throat cancer.

2334
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:59,750
So it's kind of preposterous. And then
he's always talking to the main character,

2335
02:04:59,751 --> 02:05:03,020
trying to make main character like fuck
are Brecker sacred dick or soccer and

2336
02:05:03,021 --> 02:05:05,300
like it's this crazy
combination of things,

2337
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:09,590
which is actually a true story that a
friend of mine who got arrested was in the

2338
02:05:09,591 --> 02:05:12,380
drunk tank and there was a, there
was a guy with the, you know,

2339
02:05:12,381 --> 02:05:15,450
the voice box and he had Tourette's.
And he's telling me the story of bar.

2340
02:05:15,451 --> 02:05:18,230
I'm like, that's so going in a book. Are
you kidding me? That's fucking awesome.

2341
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,180
And then one of my longtime fans finally
listens to this book and we do the

2342
02:05:23,181 --> 02:05:25,880
audio books and it's really over the
top when we do it in the audio books,

2343
02:05:25,881 --> 02:05:29,300
it sounds like the guy from south
park basically. And uh, she's like,

2344
02:05:29,301 --> 02:05:33,170
that's not funny. I have treads.
And I'm like, you're like, okay.

2345
02:05:33,171 --> 02:05:36,560
So now you have to write because
it's directly impacts are,

2346
02:05:36,561 --> 02:05:39,560
and it looks like we're mocking her, but
you have to write an apology. We're like,

2347
02:05:39,561 --> 02:05:42,530
yeah, I'm not gonna apologize for
the story because it's a character.

2348
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:47,240
But you know, it's unfortunate that that
hit you in your, your personal soft spot,

2349
02:05:47,241 --> 02:05:51,020
so to speak. And I didn't
mean to marginalize you, but
I'm not changing the story.

2350
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:51,530
It's great

2351
02:05:51,530 --> 02:05:52,960
funny though that it,

2352
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:57,650
if it's like someone can say that's not
funny and then you're not allowed to

2353
02:05:57,651 --> 02:06:00,110
talk about it.
But if it wasn't funny at all,

2354
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:03,890
if it was like a tragic situation where
a person had Tourette's and it was out

2355
02:06:03,891 --> 02:06:05,060
of control and is in a story,

2356
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:08,270
then that would be different
because that's not mocking.

2357
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:11,690
That's not putting into a comedy.
You know, like you could depict it.

2358
02:06:11,930 --> 02:06:16,070
You can depict Tourette's and depict
Tourette's being an issue that maybe,

2359
02:06:16,071 --> 02:06:18,080
you know, the people that
actually have it can say, oh,

2360
02:06:18,081 --> 02:06:21,080
that's very similar to what I have to
deal with. And they would be fine with it.

2361
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:23,240
But it's making the laughs out of it.
Yeah.

2362
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,810
That and that's what ticked off this
fan and finding them. It's weird

2363
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:28,130
even being able to explain like,
well,

2364
02:06:28,131 --> 02:06:31,490
the point of the joke is that you never
know whether he has it or not or he's

2365
02:06:31,491 --> 02:06:35,870
just using it as an excuse to be an
asshole to everybody. Um, but you know,

2366
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,700
and that, that, that one person,

2367
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:41,210
that's what every character that I create
goes through something to that effect

2368
02:06:41,211 --> 02:06:43,400
where somebody calls out and
goes, yeah, that's not funny

2369
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:47,790
dude. Yeah, but they're fucking
assholes. They really are.

2370
02:06:47,791 --> 02:06:48,810
They're really assholes.

2371
02:06:48,811 --> 02:06:52,590
And there's self serving clients because
you really have to look at the big

2372
02:06:52,591 --> 02:06:55,320
picture. I mean, you, you're
telling, what are we saying?

2373
02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:57,450
Are we saying that
Tourette's doesn't exist?

2374
02:06:57,640 --> 02:07:00,990
We saying that people aren't crazy
and the dude's don't have voice boxes.

2375
02:07:00,991 --> 02:07:03,240
Like what combination of these
things is unrealistic. Yeah.

2376
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:06,480
And also it's also a story
about cannibalistic monsters
living under the streets

2377
02:07:06,481 --> 02:07:10,650
of San Francisco. Yeah. Fuck fictional
fun. Ya know, people are cons man.

2378
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:14,970
If you pick on lesbians, they will come
after you with fucking baiting here.

2379
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,110
They are very quick to raise their
defense. Vegetarians also furious.

2380
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:22,170
Vegans are me. Armenians go after
Armenians. Watch what happens.

2381
02:07:22,171 --> 02:07:24,240
They'll fucking kill you.
Yeah. Here's the no kill you,

2382
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:25,850
the beat you in the streets
if you want to look at it.

2383
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:27,660
It's pretty much just the Jay Leno joke

2384
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,650
here.
Harbor Day,

2385
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:33,780
they sent out a tweet featuring their
mascot holding an American flag,

2386
02:07:33,781 --> 02:07:34,740
asking people to quote,

2387
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:38,350
take a moment to remember Hashtag
[inaudible] Pearl Harbor with us.

2388
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:43,351
It offended a lot of people [inaudible]
sentimental American historic

2389
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:48,730
traditions, seemingly looking for
people in business and it wasn't good.

2390
02:07:48,731 --> 02:07:52,630
But you are offended for another reason.
They're referring to spaghetti. I says,

2391
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:01,940
that's it.

2392
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:06,160
That's actually a good joke. Yeah,
that's a good joke. Fuck, fuck over that.

2393
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:10,900
Wendy's is that. It's um, I forgot
that dude's name and Anthony. Yeah,

2394
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,970
Anthony Anderson. That didn't seem all
that bad to me. That wasn't bad at all.

2395
02:08:13,971 --> 02:08:17,300
Fuck everybody. But if I was
a survivor, real Pearl Harbor,

2396
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:18,670
that'd be a different ballgame.

2397
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:22,970
But her response was so perfect because
she was like one of the few people that

2398
02:08:22,971 --> 02:08:25,820
didn't like bow down and take
it and just say, I'm sorry.

2399
02:08:25,821 --> 02:08:26,780
Even though she didn't mean it.

2400
02:08:26,781 --> 02:08:29,240
And her response is so great
because she's a real comic.

2401
02:08:29,730 --> 02:08:31,820
Steve Martin is on a comic anymore.
Steve Martin,

2402
02:08:31,821 --> 02:08:34,100
apologize for like one
of the lamest jokes ever.

2403
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,610
Some silly tweet where
he's talking about Lasagna,

2404
02:08:37,611 --> 02:08:40,910
like spelling it differently if you
were African Americans like cause like

2405
02:08:40,911 --> 02:08:42,530
spelling it like the pronunciation.

2406
02:08:42,531 --> 02:08:45,320
Like they would say Lasagna or something
like that. I don't remember what it was.

2407
02:08:45,321 --> 02:08:45,491
It was,

2408
02:08:45,491 --> 02:08:49,640
it was just a joke and people would bid
his fucking head off and he pulled the

2409
02:08:49,641 --> 02:08:52,910
tweet and apologize.
Oh Steve,

2410
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:57,440
listen to who changed. Things have
changed for Steve. Silly Bitch. You're,

2411
02:08:57,590 --> 02:08:58,940
you're listening to dummies.

2412
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:01,040
Just cause they can talk to
you doesn't mean they're smart.

2413
02:09:01,670 --> 02:09:03,560
Just because they could reach
you doesn't mean they're smart.

2414
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:05,700
It's so hard to keep a
perspective sometimes too.

2415
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:08,200
You get two or three tweets and I,
I some,

2416
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:12,140
I've seen some of the tweet hazing
that you've got or the tweet conflicts,

2417
02:09:12,141 --> 02:09:14,900
whatever. And like all of a sudden
you have this large audience,

2418
02:09:14,901 --> 02:09:18,530
but these 50 people are focused on it
and like you got to pay attention to it.

2419
02:09:18,531 --> 02:09:20,990
Right. You at least have to have
some kind of response to it. But

2420
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:27,500
fuck 'em all Scott at that block. But
you don't want to like be on follow me.

2421
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:28,900
Oh,

2422
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:36,350
enjoy my block. Yeah. Um, no,

2423
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:40,010
I don't engage a man because you can
engage them when we can engage the people

2424
02:09:40,011 --> 02:09:42,890
that are being nice. Sometimes I'll
engage people in a mocking way if I,

2425
02:09:42,891 --> 02:09:44,300
if I'm giggling at them.

2426
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:49,260
But to get actually angry at
them for what? To actually say.

2427
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:53,740
There's one thing if you did something
wrong or if there's like some sort of a

2428
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:58,760
remorse that you have for your actions
and maybe someone's reacting to that.

2429
02:09:59,210 --> 02:10:02,390
Something Real, not like this
Natasha thing that was, you know,

2430
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:05,350
it's possible you could fuck up and say
something he didn't really mean or you

2431
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:07,070
said it too quickly,

2432
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:09,740
didn't realize how ridiculous it
wasn't till after he said it. Yeah.

2433
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:13,010
But if there's none of that
and then you're getting hate,

2434
02:10:13,011 --> 02:10:13,610
like what are you doing?

2435
02:10:13,610 --> 02:10:16,070
You're going to just pay attention to
people that just look to hate people for

2436
02:10:16,071 --> 02:10:19,040
no fucking reason.
Are they living in the past?

2437
02:10:19,070 --> 02:10:21,380
Is there can be times too where
somebody says something like, Geez,

2438
02:10:21,381 --> 02:10:23,360
I never thought about it from
that particular perspective.

2439
02:10:23,361 --> 02:10:27,200
And that's a logical perspective. So yeah,
I'll, I'll re rethink what I said there,

2440
02:10:27,201 --> 02:10:28,970
but that's pretty rare. Well, I, um,

2441
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:33,610
have one thing that I really
do enjoy and it's a, a

2442
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,540
lot of people were very uncomfortable
with when they get hyper criticized when

2443
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:42,950
someone like attacks them and tax them
in a way that actually makes sense.

2444
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:46,850
But I think those people that do that,
um,

2445
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:51,650
whether they like it or not, they're
helping you because even if they're wrong,

2446
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:55,190
they're forcing you to consider whether
or not there's any merit in what they're

2447
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:57,980
saying. And if you can't find any
merit and what they're saying,

2448
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:02,210
then you relieved of any future
attacks like that. Like it's like, oh,

2449
02:11:02,211 --> 02:11:03,210
you're another one.
No,

2450
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:07,190
you're another crazy person that
has a distorted view of reality.

2451
02:11:07,191 --> 02:11:10,490
And the reason why you have this distorted
view of reality can be many, many,

2452
02:11:10,491 --> 02:11:15,200
many, many different reasons. You could
be fucking jealous. You could be crazy,

2453
02:11:15,201 --> 02:11:18,380
you could be psychotic, you could just do
that. I've gotten to people's twitters,

2454
02:11:18,381 --> 02:11:19,190
like they'll,
they'll,

2455
02:11:19,190 --> 02:11:22,220
they'll say something hateful to you and
you think about responding and then you

2456
02:11:22,221 --> 02:11:26,090
go to their Twitter feed and it's
just them attacking everyone.

2457
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:30,320
Fucking Dimi more to Koby Bryant
to fucking anybody can find.

2458
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:33,010
That's what some people
do. They just, they,

2459
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:36,290
they throw out a bunch of different lures
and hope somebody bites and not even a

2460
02:11:36,291 --> 02:11:36,800
real person.

2461
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,410
I unfortunately,
I,

2462
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:42,350
I pretty much weaned myself from looking
at Amazon reviews anymore cause there's

2463
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:46,010
just some assholeishness that goes
on there like nobody's business.

2464
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:48,070
Youtube is the center of,
oh I can't,

2465
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:52,430
I don't even look at those
youtube comments on Amazon.

2466
02:11:52,431 --> 02:11:54,830
I'll go and once in a while I'll
see a one star review and you know,

2467
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:57,320
like I worked my ass off for two years.
You son of a bitch,

2468
02:11:57,321 --> 02:11:59,120
what do you got to say about it?
And once in a while they're like,

2469
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:01,580
they take the book apart and
like from your perspective,

2470
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:04,100
I can see that's a crappy book
the way you see it, no problem.

2471
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:06,890
But most of them are just,
they didn't actually read the book.

2472
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,540
Like you can tell from the review,

2473
02:12:08,541 --> 02:12:11,810
like they read 20 pages and stopped and
gave you a one star review and you get

2474
02:12:11,811 --> 02:12:15,230
all super pissed off and then you go
and you click on that and you'd read

2475
02:12:15,231 --> 02:12:17,900
through their other reviews and
it's just like endless stars.

2476
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:20,510
One star reviews and like five stars
or twilight and you're like, okay,

2477
02:12:20,511 --> 02:12:21,770
that's not really my audience.

2478
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:24,600
You know what I've found really
fascinating about people like that,

2479
02:12:24,601 --> 02:12:29,160
the people who are really harsh on like
writers or movies or what have you,

2480
02:12:29,161 --> 02:12:33,690
and you read their criticisms and
there's often a lot of work put into that

2481
02:12:33,691 --> 02:12:36,180
stuff.
A lot of work put into the criticisms.

2482
02:12:36,181 --> 02:12:37,590
Like I've gotten people's Yelp pages.

2483
02:12:37,591 --> 02:12:40,560
You'd read like a really evil
Yelp and you're like, okay,

2484
02:12:40,561 --> 02:12:42,960
let's go to this guy's Yelp
page and see what he, you know,

2485
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:44,430
he hates this restaurant so much.

2486
02:12:44,431 --> 02:12:47,330
Let's see what he says about everything
and everything is like really well

2487
02:12:47,331 --> 02:12:52,170
written destruction of of various
restaurants or various things and you go,

2488
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,840
oh, I see what that guy's doing. He's,

2489
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:56,000
he's distracting himself
from his own failures.

2490
02:12:56,850 --> 02:13:01,850
He's attacking everything
is being mediocre and not
even realizing how ironic it

2491
02:13:01,951 --> 02:13:05,460
is. He's put all of his
energy into criticizing other
people's work because he's

2492
02:13:05,461 --> 02:13:06,630
avoiding doing his own.

2493
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:11,220
That's a big thing with a lot of these
like bloggers and critics and people that

2494
02:13:11,221 --> 02:13:14,820
are right. What are they actually doing
here? You're writing a bunch of evil,

2495
02:13:14,821 --> 02:13:18,060
evil shit, but what are you actually
contributing other than your opinion?

2496
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:19,950
Dog Shit.
Yeah.

2497
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:22,660
What do you, what do you
make, what do you put up?

2498
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:25,720
What do you put out in the world? Like
the people whose whole world is nothing,

2499
02:13:25,721 --> 02:13:28,710
but I'm going to rip on Coby Brian,
I'm going to,

2500
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:32,310
I'm going to come out and rip on
Lebron James for under achieving

2501
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:34,680
and you're like,
what the fuck do you do?

2502
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:37,050
What do you want this guide
to do for Christ sakes,

2503
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:39,690
like that thing and then the Yelp and
people ripping on everything. You're like,

2504
02:13:39,691 --> 02:13:43,680
just if you don't like the way they do it,
go do it and something great yourself.

2505
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:45,930
I very rarely attack journalists,

2506
02:13:45,931 --> 02:13:50,931
but I have gone after a few
MMA journalists who have
written evil shit about

2507
02:13:51,271 --> 02:13:54,150
fighters. Just really nasty, stupid,

2508
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:57,990
fucking hurtful snarky shit. Right? And
the only reason why they're doing it,

2509
02:13:57,991 --> 02:14:01,350
it's just their comments, you know? And
you got to expose them for what they are.

2510
02:14:01,351 --> 02:14:01,690
I mean,

2511
02:14:01,690 --> 02:14:05,580
just because someone falls short is
because someone tries and gets beat up by

2512
02:14:05,581 --> 02:14:07,440
someone who's better than them,
you know,

2513
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:11,820
have some respect for that process
of development, of understanding,

2514
02:14:11,821 --> 02:14:16,370
of exploration, of adventure that these
fighters go on for your entertainment,

2515
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:18,950
the sacrifice they have to make
just to be able to get in that ring.

2516
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:20,850
And like if you show up in the UFC cage,
you've,

2517
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:24,660
you've already done an enormous amount
of shit. Stunning, stunning sacrifices.

2518
02:14:24,661 --> 02:14:28,620
Even when they make horrible
excuses for why things went wrong,

2519
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:33,480
in my opinion, that has to be treated
with an objective sense of respect.

2520
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:37,710
You have to understand that
psychologically they're
defeat is unbelievably

2521
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:40,590
brutal.
That a fighter going through a defeat,

2522
02:14:40,591 --> 02:14:44,130
like they're looking for some reason
to stay alive when they're telling you

2523
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:45,030
they're very raw.

2524
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:49,440
W I had staff and then I got the flu
and then maybe those things are true,

2525
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:52,620
but the reason why they have to tell you
about those things is they're fucking

2526
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:56,790
falling apart their life into their
calling and looking for something to gain

2527
02:14:56,791 --> 02:14:59,130
some sort of a victory.
Like he might've kicked my ass,

2528
02:14:59,131 --> 02:15:01,280
but I was in a car accident six weeks ago,
man,

2529
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:06,150
I had to deal with insurance and they
find some reason to give them some reason

2530
02:15:06,151 --> 02:15:07,680
that they're worth something.

2531
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:10,980
And you'd like those journalists once in
a while to say something to the effect

2532
02:15:10,981 --> 02:15:13,710
of yeah, that was bad. UFC fight,

2533
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:17,370
it's still better than any UFC fight I've
ever been in because I've never gotten

2534
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:19,740
in the ring in my frigging life.
I don't think they have to say that.

2535
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:22,920
I think they just have to treat the
situation with respect and they have to

2536
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:26,580
treat what a fighter is actually doing
and they have to treat it differently

2537
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:28,620
than playing basketball.
Cause it's not the fucking,

2538
02:15:28,621 --> 02:15:32,580
same thing when a basketball games lost,
if you go home crying and freaking out,

2539
02:15:32,581 --> 02:15:36,000
you probably a baby. Okay. But when
you get your ass kicked in there,

2540
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:39,420
that guy stole a little piece of your
life. He stole some happiness from you.

2541
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:43,140
And if you don't, if you don't
respect that, it's because
nobody ever beat you up.

2542
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:46,500
If somebody, if you ever
fought and someone kicked
your ass, you would realize,

2543
02:15:46,501 --> 02:15:50,310
you know, it's like this is not
a good feeling at all and we'll,

2544
02:15:50,311 --> 02:15:54,360
let's just analyze what happened
in the fight itself. You know,

2545
02:15:54,361 --> 02:15:56,810
if you want a psychologically breakdown,
what,

2546
02:15:56,850 --> 02:16:00,090
what's wrong with the guy and where
it goes wrong to do it with respect.

2547
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,590
It can be done with respect.

2548
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:06,450
But W we have as a bunch of really
shitty writers who only get attention by

2549
02:16:06,451 --> 02:16:08,760
being negative. That's, but
that's been the sports writing.

2550
02:16:08,761 --> 02:16:13,050
That's why I got on sports radio,
sports radio.

2551
02:16:13,051 --> 02:16:14,040
It's sports writing.

2552
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:18,150
And I've been like really disrespectful
to those guys because I don't think that

2553
02:16:18,151 --> 02:16:19,470
has any place in martial arts.

2554
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:21,960
I believe if you want to get
shitty about a football player,

2555
02:16:21,961 --> 02:16:23,640
if that's your tradition,
that's fine.

2556
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:27,300
But if you want to add that same sports
guy, bullshit, talk to martial arts,

2557
02:16:27,301 --> 02:16:30,160
I say fuck you. You don't know
what you're talking about, right?

2558
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:33,010
You don't know what
you're some fucking dummy.

2559
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:36,550
Some dumb dumb football guy does.

2560
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:39,820
Amateur football was talking about
Anderson Silva breaking his leg and he's

2561
02:16:39,821 --> 02:16:43,690
saying, this is why I would never cover
MMA and I don't watch it. Never will.

2562
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,100
You know,
and like dummy,

2563
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:49,390
you're a part of the number one
sport for traumatic brain injuries,

2564
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:52,390
the number one football,
and you're also amateur football,

2565
02:16:52,391 --> 02:16:55,530
which means he didn't even get paid.
So the university's pimp these kids out,

2566
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:59,710
they make fucking billions of
dollars on college football.

2567
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:01,180
That's what you cover.

2568
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:05,170
And you make your living off of it
while the players make none and they're

2569
02:17:05,171 --> 02:17:09,270
getting fucking brain damage left and
right. And you're complaining about MMA,

2570
02:17:09,850 --> 02:17:12,800
just fuck you dummy you sports dummy.
Yeah,

2571
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:17,970
a bunch of these sports dummies and being
a former small time sports writer and

2572
02:17:18,881 --> 02:17:20,860
a former like small time college athlete,

2573
02:17:20,890 --> 02:17:25,300
they being able to see both of those
sides of the coin and anybody competing at

2574
02:17:25,301 --> 02:17:26,050
that level.

2575
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:30,940
Just the amount of work and talent just
to get to be sucky at something because

2576
02:17:30,941 --> 02:17:33,460
astronomical and most of
these writers have never,

2577
02:17:33,630 --> 02:17:38,140
they've never done anything even close
to what they're talking about and their

2578
02:17:38,141 --> 02:17:40,540
whole career is based on
how much of a dick can I be.

2579
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:43,930
Much intention and that's how they
got attention for the longest time.

2580
02:17:43,931 --> 02:17:47,440
I don't think that that's going to last
anymore. I think that that sort of,

2581
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:52,720
that was fine when everything was
being distributed by media networks.

2582
02:17:52,721 --> 02:17:56,290
When everything that you,
you couldn't really comment on it.

2583
02:17:56,291 --> 02:18:01,240
If you were a fan of Jim Rome, the radio
show 10 years ago or so. I mean how,

2584
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:03,580
what kind of feedback could
you ever give him, you know,

2585
02:18:03,581 --> 02:18:06,700
get there was no fried back and
when he did something controversial,

2586
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:10,780
people listened and they watch. It was an
adequate way of gathering up attention.

2587
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:13,960
But I think that these want to be guys
and these guys that are coming along now

2588
02:18:13,961 --> 02:18:14,860
that are trying to do that,

2589
02:18:14,861 --> 02:18:18,820
they're really fucking themselves by
playing this act of being this, you know,

2590
02:18:18,821 --> 02:18:21,400
really Shitty, you know, sports guy talk.

2591
02:18:21,550 --> 02:18:25,750
Because I think ultimately that's
going to be exposed as being a really

2592
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:30,430
ineffective way of communicating negative
and not really fun to listen to either.

2593
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:32,710
The judgmental level,

2594
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:36,430
I don't know that that'll ever go away
because I think unfortunately a lot of

2595
02:18:36,431 --> 02:18:39,160
the people watching this stuff want
way to feel better about themselves and

2596
02:18:39,161 --> 02:18:42,340
bitching about players is still huge.
It has no place in martial arts.

2597
02:18:42,341 --> 02:18:44,550
It will never work in martial
arts. That's good. That's,

2598
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:48,670
it could be an oasis of logic then
in the world of assholery. Well,

2599
02:18:48,671 --> 02:18:52,840
the stakes are higher than any other
sport. The stakes are the emotional state.

2600
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:55,870
And so his break, that's pretty
tough. Well, that happens in football.

2601
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:59,200
That happens in basketball and I have
been catastrophic injuries and almost

2602
02:18:59,201 --> 02:19:03,190
every kind of really physical
explosive sport. It's unavoidable. And,

2603
02:19:03,191 --> 02:19:07,630
but what Anderson they break that he
had was very unusual. I've only been,

2604
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:10,840
I've only seen two of
those ever live in person,

2605
02:19:10,841 --> 02:19:13,250
and I've called well
over a thousand fights.

2606
02:19:13,251 --> 02:19:17,400
There's was probably close to 1500 fights
in my career doing commentary. Right.

2607
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:21,100
I've only seen it twice. So it's pretty
rare. So for someone to point that out,

2608
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:23,820
that's why I don't watch MMA
or never worked ridiculous.

2609
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:28,400
Every stupid cheerleading has
catastrophic and has paralysis, death,

2610
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:31,130
crazy high school.
Cheerleading is really fucking dangerous.

2611
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:32,310
They're flipping each other.

2612
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:36,290
Doing Pyramids just started that crap
and I'm very nervous about it is very

2613
02:19:36,291 --> 02:19:38,210
scary to let me ask a question.

2614
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:42,200
Can you guys play my pandemic trailer for
the book? Fuck you. Then I can hit the,

2615
02:19:42,370 --> 02:19:45,210
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Is that coffee? When and
how long have you, oh yeah,

2616
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:48,890
please. Two minutes were very rude and
asking people to sit here for three hours.

2617
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,250
I don't give a shit. This
is awesome. Any time,

2618
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:54,050
just feel free to go to youtube
and look for Scott Sigler pandemic.

2619
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,970
I'm just going to talk shit
about you as soon as I know.

2620
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:59,300
I know because you haven't,
you haven't accomplished anything.

2621
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:03,830
Josie got to drag me down. How
rude. Go drill down. Where is your,

2622
02:20:03,831 --> 02:20:06,330
um, where's your trailer at?
Deserves a second yet for it.

2623
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:10,000
Is there a specific websites? Foul mouth
though. It's got swearing in it. That's,

2624
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:10,810
we'd like that.
Yes.

2625
02:20:10,810 --> 02:20:14,240
Is there a way that folks at home
can go and they can see a URL?

2626
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:18,200
They can all find it at Scott's a
go.com/pandemic that's got the youtube

2627
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:21,320
embedded right there. Or
just go to youtube and search
for Scott Sigler pandemic.

2628
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:24,800
I liked that. A authors are doing this
now making youtube. Whoops. There we go.

2629
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,800
Holy Shit.

2630
02:20:40,810 --> 02:20:43,980
They come around me and they die.
It takes like a,

2631
02:20:43,981 --> 02:20:47,200
maybe like a full hours are sober.
They die

2632
02:20:57,130 --> 02:20:59,950
just like a fucked up.
Is this

2633
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:13,083
Chris?

2634
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:28,040
Ooh, hard. Stephen King Park. Chuck,

2635
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:29,270
try to pronounce that last name.

2636
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:33,500
Antibodies.
Palo of dead dead.

2637
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,560
They're all dead because of me.

2638
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:44,060
Get me.
Please come and get me.

2639
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:47,600
I make these assholes.

2640
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:02,750
Do you want to save the world
and they're fucking seat.

2641
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:09,993
Yeah.

2642
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,550
Dogs for excited.

2643
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:16,490
What is it like to see your words come
to life in a visual form like that?

2644
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:19,070
It's awesome. It's awesome
because you got, uh, you know,

2645
02:22:19,071 --> 02:22:22,040
you've got to give that over to somebody
who's creative in a different area than

2646
02:22:22,041 --> 02:22:26,040
you. And like I do, you know, we, we
picked out parts of the book, like an

2647
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,910
actual scene from the book.

2648
02:22:26,911 --> 02:22:29,430
We could turn it in that trailer
and then gave it over these guys,

2649
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:31,260
the company's name,
res Gregson there,

2650
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:36,290
here in a l a u r e s Grex I
think the gay guy who directed,

2651
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:38,370
it's name's Adrian Bacardi.

2652
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:41,970
And he already shot a couple a thing
earlier for ancestor, but said,

2653
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:45,420
do this and then have to watch
how he does the whole thing.

2654
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:49,440
And they shot that in the same
warehouse where they filmed a inception.

2655
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:52,260
And so that was pretty fucking sweet.
You know, you get to it and you're like,

2656
02:22:52,261 --> 02:22:54,990
Holy Shit, this is where they shot
that one movie. And it was pretty fun.

2657
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:56,041
But it's a,

2658
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:59,400
it's thrilling to watch what other people
do with your work because you know,

2659
02:22:59,401 --> 02:23:02,190
you, I don't do that. So I have
to see how they bring it to life.

2660
02:23:02,470 --> 02:23:05,300
It's gotta be weird. It's
totally weird. He made that.

2661
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:10,050
When they make a movie about your books,
man, is that going to trip you out?

2662
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:14,400
Completely going to trip me
out because you as the author,

2663
02:23:14,401 --> 02:23:17,430
you see everything in your head. You
know how it's exactly supposed to look.

2664
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:21,840
But when the director gets a hold of
it and the producer gets a hold of it,

2665
02:23:21,870 --> 02:23:25,680
they're seeing something else and they're
the ones who make the pictures move.

2666
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,630
So you got to kind of go
with what they go with.

2667
02:23:27,631 --> 02:23:31,200
I mean what we're trying to do as we
work toward getting infected to be a TV

2668
02:23:31,201 --> 02:23:35,550
series and nocturnal Libby TV series is
just trying to make myself indispensable

2669
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:37,260
to these guys.
Like I'm always here.

2670
02:23:37,261 --> 02:23:39,600
I'm always ready to answer questions and
ready to go to work for you anytime you

2671
02:23:39,601 --> 02:23:40,320
want.

2672
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,780
So that if it comes to one of those
points where like I think what you want to

2673
02:23:42,781 --> 02:23:45,870
show might not exactly be
what the fans want to see.

2674
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:47,100
Maybe you can influence that,

2675
02:23:47,101 --> 02:23:50,400
but that's all you can hope for is to
influence things a little bit because

2676
02:23:50,401 --> 02:23:52,980
that's not your job. Your,
their job is to make movie.

2677
02:23:53,130 --> 02:23:56,700
I remember when Steven King first
saw the shining, he was very upset.

2678
02:23:57,150 --> 02:24:00,780
He was very upset with even
Jack Nicholson's performance
cause Jack Nicholson

2679
02:24:00,781 --> 02:24:03,310
was crazy from the jump
and he didn't want that.

2680
02:24:03,311 --> 02:24:08,250
And he wanted there to be an arc where
you see this normal guy slowly start to

2681
02:24:08,251 --> 02:24:09,084
fall apart.

2682
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:13,440
Whereas he felt like Jack Nicholson was
like so borderline unhinged from the

2683
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:15,450
beginning of the,
of the movie.

2684
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,550
It was just a completely
different movie than the book.

2685
02:24:17,551 --> 02:24:20,820
And then they did that one with the
dude from wings. Yup. They did the uh,

2686
02:24:20,821 --> 02:24:24,180
the full version of it. Stephen King. But
it was like, it was too late. You know,

2687
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:26,820
it's really hard to do.
Well,

2688
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:30,610
they're competing against one of the
icons of American film. You know,

2689
02:24:30,830 --> 02:24:35,160
the shining film is, you know, like it
or hate it. That's, that's an every top,

2690
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:37,830
top 100 out there.
Cause he's just so dramatic.

2691
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:42,240
Kubrick is such a bad motherfucker.
I mean his movies were so incredible.

2692
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:44,130
He was so weird too.

2693
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:47,550
Like he did shit in that movie where
the guy was getting blown by the stuffed

2694
02:24:47,551 --> 02:24:51,840
animal. Like what the fuck for? He's
going to turn on that shit. What the fuck?

2695
02:24:52,110 --> 02:24:54,660
Like his movie was so weird,

2696
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:59,670
so strong and but the Stephen King
apparently just just hated the crap out of

2697
02:24:59,671 --> 02:25:01,860
that thing.
But you never really got,

2698
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:05,010
I've never really got the impression
just being a fan that he's all of that

2699
02:25:05,011 --> 02:25:08,970
interested in his movie adaptations. He
know he directs, he did maximum overdrive,

2700
02:25:08,971 --> 02:25:11,820
which he was very involved
in and a couple other things.

2701
02:25:11,821 --> 02:25:16,590
But for the most part he's largely not
part of what goes on in his films it

2702
02:25:16,591 --> 02:25:19,410
seems like. So he wonder if that
movie was like, all right, screw this.

2703
02:25:19,411 --> 02:25:21,870
I got to be more paid, more
attention to what's going on. Well,

2704
02:25:21,871 --> 02:25:23,830
I think he had some huge

2705
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:27,340
moot like carry the original Carrie,
which still to this day,

2706
02:25:27,341 --> 02:25:30,630
like they tried to do a new carry and it
just wasn't what every three years now

2707
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:34,030
they do a new carry every three
frigging ears. It just wasn't happening.

2708
02:25:34,330 --> 02:25:36,640
The new carry sheet, first
of all, she was too cute.

2709
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:40,600
The girl is the girl from kick
ass. She's adorable. She's cute.

2710
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:44,320
She doesn't really like an outsider.
Chloe Moretz after she moved into a town,

2711
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:48,270
what's that supposed to be
playing, looking, you know,
playing ridge, you know,

2712
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:50,170
and she's like this different.
Yeah,

2713
02:25:50,171 --> 02:25:53,050
the girls got old gotta be outside
or different that you know,

2714
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:57,340
which sissy spaces, what
killed it? Fucking per effect.

2715
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,420
You just believed her. I believed
her in every way, you know,

2716
02:26:01,421 --> 02:26:02,340
and the scene when they,

2717
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:05,950
the fucking pigs blood scene in that movie
where she realized that everybody was

2718
02:26:05,951 --> 02:26:10,390
fucking with her and she went
crazy. Woo. Watched that recently.

2719
02:26:10,391 --> 02:26:14,260
It's still holds downs up. Stands up real
well. That's what it. Who directed that?

2720
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:18,210
God. I don't know. Find that guy. I
don't know what that stands up and they,

2721
02:26:18,250 --> 02:26:22,040
I think they've, I think there have
been three carry remakes. Really? Yeah.

2722
02:26:22,430 --> 02:26:25,180
I just saw this one, this more
recent one. I didn't even see it.

2723
02:26:25,181 --> 02:26:28,340
I just saw of it and I'm like, get
the fuck Outta here. Yeah. But I'm,

2724
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:32,330
I'm pumped for the Godzilla one. Ah,
fuck yeah. Are you kidding? By the way,

2725
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:36,910
Brian Depalma did carry, yeah. Yeah.
The new Godzilla. I, I the last guy,

2726
02:26:36,911 --> 02:26:40,000
Dillon was such a frigging disappointment
to me. I was still upset with that one.

2727
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:42,160
The new one looks pretty
good so far on Matthew.

2728
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:46,910
Broderick was dreaming throughout
the rest of, it was a big fat mass.

2729
02:26:48,490 --> 02:26:51,720
Rem was way more of a Mesclun.
Godzilla has disappointed Pacific around.

2730
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:55,810
Oh so bad. Everybody was telling me it
was good too. That was really weird.

2731
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:59,260
Real great action man. You're really
gonna enjoy it. Like you can't vote,

2732
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:02,350
you can't vote anymore.
No specific remedy like that.

2733
02:27:02,351 --> 02:27:03,540
What's the worst smell voter?

2734
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:06,820
And then that one part where
like the alien was pregnant
at the end. It was like,

2735
02:27:06,821 --> 02:27:09,040
I didn't get that far where I got,

2736
02:27:09,041 --> 02:27:12,920
I got with the guy and his ex girlfriend
were arguing and I was like, cut this,

2737
02:27:12,921 --> 02:27:16,420
this, this, this is so bad. I feel
like I'm watching a soap opera.

2738
02:27:16,810 --> 02:27:19,390
So Barbara made on Mars when I
was bashing it on my Twitter.

2739
02:27:19,391 --> 02:27:21,100
There's so many people
got pissed off at me.

2740
02:27:21,101 --> 02:27:24,550
Like a lot of people that you'd have
to have good fucking movie, Bro. Well,

2741
02:27:24,551 --> 02:27:27,070
it's like we were talking about,
I don't know what other people see.

2742
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:29,620
I don't know what their
perception of reality is.

2743
02:27:29,621 --> 02:27:33,160
I have a feeling that there's a bunch
of different perceptions of reality.

2744
02:27:33,161 --> 02:27:38,161
It's just like people have different ears
sizes and different brain power and d

2745
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:39,730
people are born with different vision.

2746
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:44,050
I think some people's
perception of reality is
fucking weird and I think that's

2747
02:27:44,051 --> 02:27:47,080
why they like shitty music
and they were shitty movies.

2748
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:51,040
I think the full filter that they're
seeing the world through is very different

2749
02:27:51,041 --> 02:27:53,230
than the filter that you or I may be.

2750
02:27:53,231 --> 02:27:58,090
That filter is shaped by culture
or life experience or the lack of

2751
02:27:58,120 --> 02:28:01,920
neurochemicals that I'm enough,
shit and firing and there've been,

2752
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:04,270
they don't eat cholesterol.
Whenever they're missing,

2753
02:28:04,390 --> 02:28:07,600
they're missing something and they
see the world in a weird, shocking.

2754
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:09,520
That's always shocking when you
watch a movie and you're like,

2755
02:28:09,970 --> 02:28:12,340
I get this all the time. Watch
a movie. I'm like, oh my God,

2756
02:28:12,341 --> 02:28:15,490
that's the worst stinking pile
of crusty dog who I've ever seen.

2757
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:19,240
And then you'd go to rotten tomatoes.
It's like 89 90% from the critics.

2758
02:28:19,241 --> 02:28:22,580
You're like, why are you fucking people?
Yeah. What did you just fucking watch?

2759
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:25,220
Not that.
Not that I thought that it was that bad,

2760
02:28:25,221 --> 02:28:29,900
but with the Pacific criminal thing
that just drove me nuts was I paid good

2761
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:32,360
money to see a giant
monster in a giant robot.

2762
02:28:32,361 --> 02:28:33,830
Beat the living shit out of each other.

2763
02:28:33,831 --> 02:28:37,790
Can you turn off the frigging rainstorm
so I can see a little bit of detail on

2764
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:40,370
what's going on here? Everything
was all grayed out. I'm like,

2765
02:28:40,371 --> 02:28:43,560
that's not why I paid to see this. I
think that you'd wanted to do that though.

2766
02:28:43,561 --> 02:28:46,310
So they get hired. The CGI, I
don't think it was that bad though.

2767
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:50,300
I don't think CGI was that bad.
CGI has kept that weird quality to it.

2768
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:52,610
Like when the Hulk Smash,
that alien ship,

2769
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:56,000
you didn't really think the Hawk was
smashing that alien ship. And the vendors,

2770
02:28:56,001 --> 02:29:00,710
like you Kinda know at CGI doesn't seem
real right. But if you're watching, like,

2771
02:29:00,711 --> 02:29:05,711
did you see rush a race car moving
know when they get in a fucking crash,

2772
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:10,360
that's a fucking crash. You
know? I mean, it's the, the,

2773
02:29:10,361 --> 02:29:15,361
the race scenes are very realistic and
you feel like you're actually watching a

2774
02:29:15,381 --> 02:29:19,580
real crash. Whereas I feel like, you know,
there's some CGI that it's just like,

2775
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:24,200
I of, he looks great, don't get me
wrong. I saw the new Thor looks great,

2776
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:28,130
but I know that's not really happening.
Right. No, it's not happening. It looks,

2777
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:32,180
it's fake. It's, is it fake enough to
take you out of the story? Yes. Yes it is.

2778
02:29:32,181 --> 02:29:33,310
And it isn't. You know, it,

2779
02:29:33,311 --> 02:29:36,360
it never allows me to get really deep
into the story because I know it's horse

2780
02:29:36,361 --> 02:29:39,560
shit. Right. You know, the shit
that took me out of Thor was like,

2781
02:29:39,561 --> 02:29:43,250
knowing exactly what's going to happen,
exactly what's going to happen next,

2782
02:29:43,251 --> 02:29:44,084
kind of a thing. You know? Like,

2783
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:46,640
it's just hard to get into that
that particular movie. Well,

2784
02:29:46,670 --> 02:29:50,510
that's one of the things that I really
loved about the new hobbit movie is that

2785
02:29:50,511 --> 02:29:53,540
the special effects they did
were just enough. I mean,

2786
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:56,750
there was a bunch of craziness.
I don't give any spoiler alerts,

2787
02:29:56,900 --> 02:29:59,210
but up until the time they get to
the drag and there's, you know,

2788
02:29:59,211 --> 02:30:02,270
the few silly scenes and there was a
lot of fun involved and everything,

2789
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:07,160
but the Gr, the dragon itself was so
well done and the scenes are so well lit,

2790
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:11,180
the whole everything about it. So bad
ass that you go, okay, they did it right.

2791
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:14,150
They did this one right. They nailed
it. They really did nail it. Okay.

2792
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:18,620
But it's hard to do with
CGI was desolation if she
may have in the first one.

2793
02:30:18,830 --> 02:30:21,400
Yes, yes. It was definitely
better than the front can't,

2794
02:30:21,530 --> 02:30:23,090
it can't be the whole movie and they,

2795
02:30:23,091 --> 02:30:25,610
that's part of the problem with Pacific
Rim is, you know, you didn't really,

2796
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:28,550
I didn't really care about any of
those characters. I was just like,

2797
02:30:28,551 --> 02:30:31,280
let's get out there and see these giant
things. Beat the shit out of each other.

2798
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:33,260
Dude, that was rooting for the
dragon for the last half hour.

2799
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:38,270
Totally ruined for the Dragon. He's my
favorite person in the movie. He's clever.

2800
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:39,260
He's got a lot of goals.

2801
02:30:39,310 --> 02:30:42,850
And that's what pisses me off is that
rotten tomatoes with 72% of that maybe are

2802
02:30:42,851 --> 02:30:45,770
71 south Pacific rim.
And,

2803
02:30:45,771 --> 02:30:49,720
and I just thought I lost my
mind because acting was horrible.

2804
02:30:49,721 --> 02:30:51,880
The script was horrible.
The fact that like you said,

2805
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:55,600
like they didn't even use the sword
until like halfway through the movie and

2806
02:30:55,601 --> 02:30:58,310
that's like the best weapon
that robot hat or whatever.

2807
02:30:58,480 --> 02:31:01,340
Right. So you, I want to find out
rotten tomatoes for the hobbit.

2808
02:31:02,050 --> 02:31:04,430
It'll probably go through
the rough four stars.

2809
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:08,240
70 76% said the Pacific rim.
Well,

2810
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:10,940
it was way better to me at least,

2811
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:13,550
but that's my kind of movie
I saw on the Rogan board.

2812
02:31:13,551 --> 02:31:15,710
There's a lot of people on the
message board. The fucking hated it.

2813
02:31:15,711 --> 02:31:17,900
They said it was a piece of shit.
They walked out in the middle of it.

2814
02:31:18,470 --> 02:31:22,590
Angry little angry,
angry little concern,

2815
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:25,840
but they weren't high command to love it.

2816
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:29,640
I love the trailer trailer looks amazing.
There's two things.

2817
02:31:29,641 --> 02:31:30,870
It's not as good as the first one,

2818
02:31:30,871 --> 02:31:33,240
but the first one that's so much
headroom in it. You enjoy it anyways.

2819
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:37,110
And the second one, like, take the goddamn
camera. I'll Steve Carell. I'm like,

2820
02:31:37,111 --> 02:31:41,010
I'm not. I know this doesn't do anything
for the movie. He's good in little bits,

2821
02:31:41,011 --> 02:31:45,850
but he had like 15 minutes of Solo
screentime. Someone's a corral hater. No,

2822
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:49,140
no, no. Not a krill hitters. Just
that character was good. Good.

2823
02:31:49,141 --> 02:31:52,740
And he's a punchline. He's not the
whole, these, not the whole joke.

2824
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:57,150
Other than that, it's some funny
shit in that movie. Well, there I am.

2825
02:31:57,151 --> 02:31:59,520
A huge will Ferrell fan.
Yeah, he could do no wrong.

2826
02:31:59,740 --> 02:32:03,020
I love fucking the step brothers movie.
Yeah,

2827
02:32:03,021 --> 02:32:05,190
it was that moving stepbrothers
was called step rose.

2828
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:10,230
I'm a huge towel at Knight Fan.
Talladega nights is fucking hilarious.

2829
02:32:10,290 --> 02:32:14,340
God Damn, he's funny. He's just
so stupid and silly, you know,

2830
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:18,120
just really knows how to nail
that silly character. Yeah.

2831
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:20,160
I've not seen anything of his,
I don't like.

2832
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:24,720
Have you seen Casa de mi padre?
It's a serious one.

2833
02:32:24,721 --> 02:32:28,120
Is Mexican movie the whole thing?
He talks Spanish and it,

2834
02:32:28,130 --> 02:32:32,260
there's no English in the whole entire
movie and it's like an old Mexican movie.

2835
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:36,220
How old is it last
year? Yeah. Oh, no shit.

2836
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:40,000
So it's a new movie. Yeah. I haven't
heard a peep about this. This is a comedy.

2837
02:32:40,270 --> 02:32:44,830
Yeah, it's trying to be, it didn't
work, Huh? Well, I mean it's,

2838
02:32:44,831 --> 02:32:49,530
it's very low, lower budget because it's
actually, I mean, I only got 5.5 on imdbs,

2839
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:50,740
so it's not that good of a movie.

2840
02:32:50,741 --> 02:32:54,970
But it was just interesting to see him
actually play and not using any English

2841
02:32:54,971 --> 02:32:55,850
through the whole movie.
It was

2842
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:59,290
remade the three Amigos. That's what
he should've done. That'd be great.

2843
02:32:59,291 --> 02:33:03,790
To Talladega nights is one of my all
time favorite. It's just so stupid.

2844
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:07,930
It was so silly and stupid.
Those movies also are good.

2845
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:11,200
They seem to cross generational lines.
Like when I go see my brother,

2846
02:33:11,230 --> 02:33:13,300
they want to watch.
They want to watch step brothers.

2847
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:16,240
My nephews want to watch stepbrothers. I
think it's hysterical. I know. I'm like,

2848
02:33:16,241 --> 02:33:18,520
I know you're not getting all this humor,
but that's a funny movie.

2849
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:20,710
While you can use,
be surprised,

2850
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:25,830
I think any kid over 10 is probably good
to go with that movie today with the

2851
02:33:25,841 --> 02:33:28,210
Internet, they're probably
good to go. They got 10.

2852
02:33:28,211 --> 02:33:31,990
They're showing each other each other's
dicks and exchanging email at the same

2853
02:33:31,991 --> 02:33:35,920
time. You know, they can handle making
someone eat a pile of poop off the lawn.

2854
02:33:36,130 --> 02:33:39,610
It's just funny. No matter how old
you are, that's a good flick. Yeah,

2855
02:33:39,611 --> 02:33:41,440
that's good for three year olds.
That'll work.

2856
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:46,030
That'll work for everyone in the family.
Everyone. Except people were uptight.

2857
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:47,490
Joe Have you didn't notice like the,

2858
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:50,860
I'm sure you have noticed the last few
I've see jam man showed me this and now I

2859
02:33:50,861 --> 02:33:52,510
can't stop looking at it as,

2860
02:33:52,511 --> 02:33:56,400
how many people were headphones now all
around their necks after every fight or

2861
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:58,170
four fight or anything?

2862
02:33:58,520 --> 02:34:02,870
Well, no, there's a, the new beats ones
that are, uh, they're, they're wireless.

2863
02:34:02,871 --> 02:34:05,600
Have you seen those beats studio wireless.
But yeah,

2864
02:34:05,601 --> 02:34:08,120
a lot of people are wearing
like monster ones with no cords.

2865
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:10,340
It's just they're getting paid.
Yeah. That's interesting. Well,

2866
02:34:10,341 --> 02:34:12,740
you used to see him with those energy
drinks. You're holed up to energy drink.

2867
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:15,740
Well, you know, I felt the fly really
turned around for me in the second

2868
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:20,200
I actually looked. Uh,
I was watching that. Uh,

2869
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:22,630
you got to see what my wife and we
actually look looking at the headphones.

2870
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,120
You know, I looked like all the beats.
I'm like, I don't think those are beats.

2871
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:28,120
And then we actually looked up the logo
because it was a different logo for the

2872
02:34:28,121 --> 02:34:30,400
monster headphones and all
of a sudden I'm like, wow,

2873
02:34:30,401 --> 02:34:32,050
somebody else is getting
in on that action.

2874
02:34:32,260 --> 02:34:34,990
This is cause Aryana does not
want to listen to Brittany talk.

2875
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:38,650
That's what she's got these on. They
don't have any dinner, many cords in them.

2876
02:34:39,310 --> 02:34:42,550
Brittany's talking some shit and area.
I was like, bitch, I came in here.

2877
02:34:42,551 --> 02:34:47,260
You are so pretty. They're both so
pretty. Such a pretty pretty girls.

2878
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:51,430
Oh so pretty. But their monster
beats, they're even more pretty.

2879
02:34:51,431 --> 02:34:53,260
They like their tech now they're in the,

2880
02:34:53,261 --> 02:34:55,660
I make them make their little
heads look like animate Dallas.

2881
02:34:55,661 --> 02:34:57,790
This is a good commercial
for those monsters.

2882
02:34:58,010 --> 02:35:01,810
The wireless ones where there's
a dude who's on a team bus,

2883
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:06,640
he's apparently going
somewhere way against Kevin
girl exit the bus and then he

2884
02:35:06,641 --> 02:35:09,610
puts those on and the music plays and
they're all saying go home, go home.

2885
02:35:09,611 --> 02:35:12,640
And he's smiling just walking past
everybody's Kevin Garnett. Yeah.

2886
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:15,780
He's a basketball player who used to play.

2887
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:18,940
You just play for Boston Celtics and I
can't think who he was playing for now,

2888
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:21,940
but I believe the bus is going back
to Boston and people are booing him.

2889
02:35:21,941 --> 02:35:24,010
He puts those things out and he does it.
It's a great commercial.

2890
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:27,690
That's excellent. You, they should all
be mouthing nick? I don't think so.

2891
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:32,250
I don't think so. Austin, if you
really want to show what could happen,

2892
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:36,570
I don't really want to sell
some fucking soundproof.

2893
02:35:37,230 --> 02:35:40,320
He also brought them a chair.
He helped bring them a championship,

2894
02:35:40,321 --> 02:35:43,980
so I don't know. Yeah, but if they're
really angry, Boston people trust me.

2895
02:35:43,981 --> 02:35:45,990
They'll say,
I'm comfortable with this conversation.

2896
02:35:46,030 --> 02:35:49,890
Joel's extremely uncomfortable with all
of this. Now you're an author. Come on,

2897
02:35:49,891 --> 02:35:52,590
I'm making fiction.
Putting words into people's mouths.

2898
02:35:52,591 --> 02:35:55,830
I'm making characters the asshole
racist character from Boston. Yes,

2899
02:35:55,860 --> 02:35:59,850
and that could someday going to book and
that's the bad guy. Here's a question.

2900
02:35:59,851 --> 02:36:03,570
When you are confronted
with scenarios like that,

2901
02:36:03,571 --> 02:36:08,070
like say if you have a racist
character in your film or in your role,

2902
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:11,520
you're a book rather and
you're constructing him.

2903
02:36:11,550 --> 02:36:15,240
Do you hold back on certain things you
think other people would find offensive

2904
02:36:15,241 --> 02:36:18,630
or do you try to paint him
in as vile away as possible?

2905
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:22,460
Which would include someone yelling
out racists, things like that. It

2906
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:23,550
um, there's, there's,

2907
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:27,930
there's a self my own self checking on
that and a lot of times I kind of have to

2908
02:36:27,931 --> 02:36:30,420
get over myself like this is,

2909
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:34,710
this is language that I don't
like and can't stand and,

2910
02:36:34,711 --> 02:36:37,440
but this character is not me and have
to get to the point where the character

2911
02:36:37,441 --> 02:36:39,480
would actually use it.
Yeah. Because that's,

2912
02:36:39,510 --> 02:36:42,840
those people are out there and that's
largely what I have to explain with my

2913
02:36:42,841 --> 02:36:46,660
affection a ton. Like why would you put
that in your book? That's not funny,

2914
02:36:46,661 --> 02:36:49,950
or that's not cool. Like, yes, but
there are people out there who do that.

2915
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:53,970
This is reality. There's really people
like this. So to make the story feel real,

2916
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:57,300
we put these real assholes we have to
deal with every day, put them in the book,

2917
02:36:57,301 --> 02:36:58,134
so I'll use them.

2918
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:03,030
What's fascinating to me is the amount
of pushback I get from over on the

2919
02:37:03,031 --> 02:37:04,920
publisher side,
the publish side,

2920
02:37:04,921 --> 02:37:06,450
you come out with that
language of the character,

2921
02:37:06,451 --> 02:37:09,750
like we're going to have to dial that
down. I'm like, he's a Klan member. No,

2922
02:37:09,751 --> 02:37:12,660
we're not going to dial that down. He's
burning across, he's a Klan member.

2923
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:15,560
And they'll be like, no, we
can't have that. And like
those are one of the things,

2924
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,690
like I mentioned earlier, that's where
things are. I had to put my foot down.

2925
02:37:17,691 --> 02:37:20,570
I'm like, that's going in the
book because that's real life.

2926
02:37:20,571 --> 02:37:25,210
And people actually say that. And so
that, that can get tricky. But um,

2927
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:28,610
if you're doing horror right
or any kind of writing right,

2928
02:37:28,611 --> 02:37:32,750
I think there's a lot of stuff you crossed
that makes you feel super icky. Like,

2929
02:37:32,751 --> 02:37:33,590
I,
you know,

2930
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:37,790
am I influencing someone to perform
these kinds of acts by putting it in the

2931
02:37:37,791 --> 02:37:41,360
book and the most of the crazy violence
shit that's always in the back of your

2932
02:37:41,361 --> 02:37:44,480
head because my books are ridiculously
violent and always in the back of your

2933
02:37:44,481 --> 02:37:45,320
head like,
okay,

2934
02:37:45,321 --> 02:37:49,370
but what if some day some messed up kid
reads my book and then says I'm going to

2935
02:37:49,371 --> 02:37:52,760
go reenact this torture scene on
somebody and am I eventually going to be

2936
02:37:52,761 --> 02:37:53,720
responsible for that?

2937
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:56,720
So that's always a thought and
the racist stuff is a thought too,

2938
02:37:56,721 --> 02:37:59,210
but largely just you let it roll.

2939
02:37:59,240 --> 02:38:02,480
Like if you think that's
what a real person would do
and talk like and act like,

2940
02:38:02,481 --> 02:38:03,470
then that goes in the book.

2941
02:38:03,740 --> 02:38:07,010
That was the argument when
a American psycho came out.

2942
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:12,220
I read it in the 80s. Um, I, when it
first came out, Bret Easton Ellis,

2943
02:38:12,221 --> 02:38:14,870
his book,
it's just really fucking dark.

2944
02:38:14,871 --> 02:38:17,720
If you think the movie's
dark with Christian Bale,

2945
02:38:17,721 --> 02:38:22,640
it is literally nothing compared to
that book. That book is fucking dark.

2946
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,500
And I remember some people that I
knew that had read it who were really

2947
02:38:27,501 --> 02:38:31,940
offended, they were really angry and
offended and they were saying like,

2948
02:38:31,941 --> 02:38:33,140
this isn't good writing.

2949
02:38:33,141 --> 02:38:36,710
He just is describing really fucked
up things that make you uncomfortable.

2950
02:38:36,711 --> 02:38:39,680
And then he goes on to the next fucked
up thing and the guy just keeps getting

2951
02:38:39,681 --> 02:38:42,330
away with shit. I didn't
see that. Uh, what,

2952
02:38:42,331 --> 02:38:47,331
what I saw was this intense view
into a potentially real person.

2953
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:53,150
I mean, there are fucking
serial killers. They do exist.

2954
02:38:53,151 --> 02:38:57,590
They have murdered people and
tortured people in horrific ways,

2955
02:38:57,860 --> 02:38:59,570
very similar to this character.

2956
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:03,800
So what he's done is drag us into
this really stomach wrenching,

2957
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:07,320
uncomfortable world. This
one intense psycho, right?

2958
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:11,210
And it's fucking masterpiece, I
think. I think it's a masterpiece.

2959
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:13,740
Well going, you know that the, the,

2960
02:39:13,870 --> 02:39:17,660
the process of writing in any creative
realm where you're doing film or are you

2961
02:39:17,661 --> 02:39:21,710
doing comics are doing books and going
into the bad guy's head and making that

2962
02:39:21,711 --> 02:39:23,990
bad guy live and breathe
and feel like a real person.

2963
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:28,070
Part of that process is the bad guy.
Doesn't think he's a bad guy.

2964
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:31,360
The super villain doesn't think
she's a super villain. You know, you,

2965
02:39:31,430 --> 02:39:35,120
these people are always morally
justified in everything they do.

2966
02:39:35,330 --> 02:39:36,590
They don't go out and commit evil.

2967
02:39:36,650 --> 02:39:39,970
They're committing acts that are logical
to them and they're being just in there.

2968
02:39:40,290 --> 02:39:43,700
They're committed, you know,
getting revenge or getting
fair desserts on someone.

2969
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:46,880
So being able to write from the
perspective of someone who's doing awful,

2970
02:39:46,881 --> 02:39:49,550
horrible shit,
but they don't think it's horrible.

2971
02:39:49,730 --> 02:39:53,390
That's one of the tricks to doing it
and that's what he did in that book is,

2972
02:39:53,490 --> 02:39:57,200
you know, the, the main character doesn't,
you don't really catch them going,

2973
02:39:57,230 --> 02:39:58,670
I'm going to commit acts of evil.

2974
02:39:58,670 --> 02:40:02,850
He's just doing what he thinks is what
should be done and wants to do what he

2975
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:05,960
wants and what he needs to do or what he,
as we all do in human beings,

2976
02:40:05,961 --> 02:40:09,290
those things we need to do.
We find a way to morally justify them.

2977
02:40:09,291 --> 02:40:13,080
Whatever it is that you do that you may
know is a bit squishy in the eyes of

2978
02:40:13,081 --> 02:40:15,210
society. There's some,
another part of your head,

2979
02:40:15,211 --> 02:40:16,680
the checks and balances system that goes,

2980
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:20,490
it's okay if you do it and here's why
it's even a good thing that you do it and

2981
02:40:20,491 --> 02:40:23,550
here's why. And that's, you know, that's
what he did in that book and that's,

2982
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:26,830
that's part of the screwed up,
screwed up part of writing. I mean,

2983
02:40:26,831 --> 02:40:31,800
if you're just not writing superficial,
good guy, bad guy snoring Dudley do right,

2984
02:40:31,801 --> 02:40:32,401
saves a Dagon,

2985
02:40:32,401 --> 02:40:35,610
snidely whiplash and those stories are
perfectly fine and people love them.

2986
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:39,210
But if you're actually trying to get into
the point where you make that bad guy

2987
02:40:39,690 --> 02:40:42,930
where you feel for the bad guy
and empathize with the bad guy,

2988
02:40:42,990 --> 02:40:43,920
that's tricky stuff.

2989
02:40:43,950 --> 02:40:47,330
And my goal at the end of my books
is if there's a showdown between the,

2990
02:40:47,331 --> 02:40:49,110
the main,
the bad guy and the good,

2991
02:40:49,170 --> 02:40:53,580
the good guy and a bad guy is you're not
really sure who you're rooting for if

2992
02:40:53,581 --> 02:40:54,414
you've done it right.

2993
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:57,030
The reader's not really sure
who they want to win that fight,

2994
02:40:57,060 --> 02:41:00,030
even though one is morally reprehensible
and the other one is supposedly good.

2995
02:41:00,700 --> 02:41:00,881
Well,

2996
02:41:00,881 --> 02:41:05,881
you don't want to set up obvious paradigms
and obvious characters that seem to

2997
02:41:05,951 --> 02:41:08,890
have been repeated over and over again
throughout time and more complex and

2998
02:41:08,891 --> 02:41:12,440
weird and Tony Soprano, like
you can get the, I mean that,

2999
02:41:12,441 --> 02:41:15,310
that was like the Sopranos was
one of my favorite shows ever.

3000
02:41:15,311 --> 02:41:17,550
And one of the things I really
liked about it was a Tony Soprano.

3001
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:18,730
I was a fucking murderer.

3002
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,750
He was an evil scumbag murder that
you were rooting for. Yup. I mean,

3003
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:26,750
it was a very, very, very
fascinating way that they,

3004
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:31,630
they danced with that. And um, I
think what Bret Easton Ellis did in,

3005
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:34,480
in that book was completely unapologetic.

3006
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:39,130
And that's why I found it so fascinating
because the way he described their

3007
02:41:39,131 --> 02:41:44,110
horrific, sickening way he described
these crimes was, uh, you know, I mean,

3008
02:41:44,470 --> 02:41:49,030
it was so clinical that it almost is
like done in the mind of a psychopath.

3009
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:52,840
Like I didn't even necessarily even enjoy
it. I just think he was really good.

3010
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:54,400
There was parts of that book.

3011
02:41:54,401 --> 02:41:59,200
They're like the part where he shows
up to clean up some bodies that he left

3012
02:41:59,201 --> 02:42:03,910
behind and the entire apartment
had been cleaned. And uh, he,

3013
02:42:04,090 --> 02:42:07,930
he locks eyes with a real estate agent
and the real estate agent is this woman

3014
02:42:07,931 --> 02:42:10,600
who's like selling the place and
she's like, I know what you did.

3015
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:13,120
Get the fuck Outta here.
And they exchanged this look,

3016
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:16,690
it's a really fascinating scene of
two monsters running into each other.

3017
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:20,890
You know, one of them were murder or the
other one, a psychopath or sociopath.

3018
02:42:20,891 --> 02:42:23,080
And they, that's one of my
favorite parts of that book.

3019
02:42:23,410 --> 02:42:26,590
And both of them, I don't remember
that part, but you know, you know,

3020
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:28,390
both of them think that
they did the right thing.

3021
02:42:28,770 --> 02:42:29,603
Yeah.
Did the right thing.

3022
02:42:29,710 --> 02:42:32,100
It's going to sell that apartment for
fucking 5 million bucks or whatever the

3023
02:42:32,101 --> 02:42:33,090
hell it was.
And he's got a,

3024
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:36,450
he was going in there to clean up the
bodies that he left in the tub covered in

3025
02:42:36,451 --> 02:42:40,650
acid or whatever the fuck he did. I
forgot what it was. But, uh, yeah,

3026
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:45,330
those, those really evil characters
that you create, that's, uh,

3027
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:49,870
an interesting thing for me
because like, like, like this, uh,

3028
02:42:49,890 --> 02:42:52,920
description of the guy coming down
with those headphones on, you know,

3029
02:42:52,921 --> 02:42:55,230
the guy's walking down
and people yelling shit.

3030
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:58,800
They're obviously saying angry things.
Like what would they say?

3031
02:42:58,801 --> 02:43:02,640
Would they say fuck you? Is that okay?
If you see, would your mouth that right?

3032
02:43:02,670 --> 02:43:05,790
Would you mouth? You know, you're
going to die with it. Maybe.

3033
02:43:05,791 --> 02:43:07,680
Maybe we'll go with you. We're going
to kill you. You're going to die.

3034
02:43:07,681 --> 02:43:10,620
You're going to see him out that, but you
can't say nigger, right? Don't do that.

3035
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:12,130
Evil people.
You make an evil

3036
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:14,880
people. That's fascinating. We
can threaten your life. Right?

3037
02:43:14,881 --> 02:43:16,900
And we can get away with like,
we're going to kill you.

3038
02:43:16,901 --> 02:43:19,750
They can mouth that in a commercial.
And that's probably okay.

3039
02:43:19,751 --> 02:43:22,530
But the other side that's totally done.
No one's going to put that on too.

3040
02:43:22,531 --> 02:43:25,000
It's just this fascinating
thing about creating fiction.

3041
02:43:25,001 --> 02:43:27,370
The fascinating thing about fiction is,
you know,

3042
02:43:27,371 --> 02:43:28,900
when you're creating an evil person,

3043
02:43:28,901 --> 02:43:32,830
like what you're saying about will a
person duplicate your ax, will they,

3044
02:43:32,831 --> 02:43:34,990
you know, create copycat
crimes? Will they,

3045
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:39,040
will they start like looking into your
way of describing things and recreating

3046
02:43:39,041 --> 02:43:42,370
it in a horrific way, in a real world
that you'll feel responsible for?

3047
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:43,990
Whether it's a racist thing,

3048
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,380
whether it's a violent thing or
whether it's whatever it is. You know,

3049
02:43:47,410 --> 02:43:50,620
that's a fascinating thing to have to
think about when you're creating fiction

3050
02:43:50,621 --> 02:43:51,131
is that you,

3051
02:43:51,131 --> 02:43:56,131
you may be reinforcing or even perhaps
inspiring an idea that's ultimately very

3052
02:43:57,101 --> 02:44:01,630
evil. I think that in the instances
where art has influenced people to go do

3053
02:44:01,631 --> 02:44:03,220
something, uh, you know,

3054
02:44:03,790 --> 02:44:07,270
those people are looking for that moral
justification even though they don't

3055
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:10,960
know they're doing it. When the night
stalker killer was out, you know, if,

3056
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:13,450
if ACDC hadn't wrote
the song night stalker,

3057
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:15,340
that guy would have found something else.

3058
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:16,960
That guy would have found
something else to, to,

3059
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:21,580
to validate his need to go out and kill.
So that's easy for you to say.

3060
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:24,430
But if he did what you wrote
in your Boobie d yeah. That,

3061
02:44:24,431 --> 02:44:27,310
that would be super difficult
to deal with. But I'm, you know,

3062
02:44:27,311 --> 02:44:32,311
kind of thought this through several times
cause I write some fucked up shit is,

3063
02:44:32,490 --> 02:44:35,380
is, you know, if it happens, how
am I going to feel about that?

3064
02:44:35,381 --> 02:44:37,960
And I've already kind of, you know,
like I guess I'm not a bad guy either.

3065
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:39,910
I'm just like the people I'm
talking about. I think a bad guy,

3066
02:44:40,210 --> 02:44:44,470
I pre justified that with that guy or
that girl would have found something to

3067
02:44:44,471 --> 02:44:48,190
latch onto and would have gone
out and killed based on, you know,

3068
02:44:48,191 --> 02:44:50,560
an Anne Rice story instead
of my story. Yeah. I'm,

3069
02:44:50,561 --> 02:44:54,910
I'm very fascinated by the influence of,
of something creative like that.

3070
02:44:54,911 --> 02:44:59,110
Whether it's a film that inspires like
taxi driver, which inspired John Hinckley.

3071
02:44:59,350 --> 02:45:00,460
You know, there's, I'm,

3072
02:45:00,461 --> 02:45:05,290
I'm fascinated by that strange
link between a n a creation,

3073
02:45:05,291 --> 02:45:09,520
a creative creation that's turned into
a movie or a book and how it influences

3074
02:45:09,521 --> 02:45:10,750
people and how you know,

3075
02:45:10,751 --> 02:45:14,020
you can catch someone who's got the wrong
fucking chemicals floating around in

3076
02:45:14,021 --> 02:45:18,850
their brain and they read any one of
your books and decide to enact a scene.

3077
02:45:18,851 --> 02:45:22,480
And there was a guy who was arrested
and in Vancouver for enacting a Dexter

3078
02:45:22,481 --> 02:45:27,250
scene. Oh yeah, he was Uighur nerd
that yeah, he fucking killed somebody.

3079
02:45:27,290 --> 02:45:30,430
Dexter dumb because I was a huge extra
fan and he wound up killing somebody.

3080
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:35,110
I'm a huge Dexter fan.
I was a huge extra fan of season one.

3081
02:45:36,610 --> 02:45:39,960
You didn't like, they got one guy
the best season though. John Lithgow.

3082
02:45:40,810 --> 02:45:43,600
Did you not watch that season? I couldn't
watch the, a bad rear naked choke.

3083
02:45:43,670 --> 02:45:47,400
This terrible technique.
Listen,

3084
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:52,240
I'm a Jujitsu practitioner. I know what
it looks like when you choke somebody.

3085
02:45:52,241 --> 02:45:55,270
It doesn't look like that. That
was terrible. If I was on that set,

3086
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:57,640
if I was on that set, I'd be like,
come here bitch, let me choke you.

3087
02:45:58,150 --> 02:46:00,970
I'm going to show you what it feels like
to be choked. You can't act like that.

3088
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,180
You can't act like that
when you're choking or where
you're not even squeezing.

3089
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:05,770
Interesting. This is,
I'm sure this is old hat.

3090
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:09,950
You've been on dozens of TV sets that
we did. Our first TV set ever for the,

3091
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:11,680
for justified.
We got to go there.

3092
02:46:11,681 --> 02:46:14,750
They're shooting episode number seven
because the people making justified or

3093
02:46:14,751 --> 02:46:17,600
interested in making in fact a new series.
So we get to go watch,

3094
02:46:17,630 --> 02:46:22,130
you know Timothy Olyphant do his
thing. Uh, and ones that guy, he's the,

3095
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:25,850
he's the Marshall Ones. Wears the
hat. Okay. He testified and he was in,

3096
02:46:25,851 --> 02:46:27,660
what was he in before it was deadwood.

3097
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:30,470
He was another guy who
wore a hat and shot people.

3098
02:46:30,471 --> 02:46:31,940
And then there's the other
guy that's from the shield,

3099
02:46:31,941 --> 02:46:34,190
that really good actor from the shield.
It's in that as well.

3100
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:38,030
I don't know which guy who played
like the, he was one of the cops.

3101
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:41,810
One of the dirty cops. Oh yeah, no, no,
no. That's a Walter Goggins. He, yeah,

3102
02:46:41,811 --> 02:46:44,930
he plays a bad guy. Yeah,
he's the two of them.

3103
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:48,380
If you've never watched us by the two
of them together are lights out for the

3104
02:46:48,381 --> 02:46:51,770
best deal. The best acting duo
on TV in my opinion. Hands down.

3105
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:54,470
Is that a really good show? It's
amazing. So good. It's so good.

3106
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:58,790
I don't hear about it. I don't catch
in hype. It's, Oh, it's, it's catching.

3107
02:46:58,791 --> 02:47:00,500
It started to catch on.
It's head into season five,

3108
02:47:00,501 --> 02:47:03,840
which starts tonight actually sees a
five premieres on season five. So I can,

3109
02:47:03,890 --> 02:47:05,990
I can start now and I
can get four seasons.

3110
02:47:05,991 --> 02:47:10,100
You can get forces an advertisement
for justified and we snuck in an

3111
02:47:10,101 --> 02:47:14,810
advertisement. Let's go choking. So
here's, here's why you'd like it.

3112
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:15,673
Here's why you'd like it.

3113
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:20,680
It's basically the character a is a total
psychopath who's wearing a batch and

3114
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:24,020
functions perfectly normal in society.
But when it comes point to arrest the guy,

3115
02:47:24,350 --> 02:47:27,620
instead of just pulling the gun and
going, okay, put your hands up. I got Ya.

3116
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:30,410
He leaves the gun in the
holster and he's always like,

3117
02:47:30,950 --> 02:47:34,820
I can take in and you're going to serve
life in jail or you can draw that gun

3118
02:47:35,060 --> 02:47:37,220
and if you shoot me down,
you get to walk with him anymore.

3119
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:40,100
Don't tell him I don't want to know
this. That's how dare you. I'm sorry.

3120
02:47:40,101 --> 02:47:44,450
Spoiler Alert Guy, I'm sorry.
But a son of a B that we got,

3121
02:47:44,451 --> 02:47:48,260
we got to go on the set and the and
Timothy old fonts reading the script and

3122
02:47:48,261 --> 02:47:51,500
it's very fanboy a super cool. And
then he turns out, he talks to the Mar,

3123
02:47:51,530 --> 02:47:55,310
the real Marshall, who's been the
consultant on the show for all four years.

3124
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:58,100
And Timothy asked him a question like,
know I'm a little,

3125
02:47:58,101 --> 02:47:59,720
I don't want my guy do this.

3126
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:02,480
And you could see the Marshall
sweating it a little bit,

3127
02:48:02,481 --> 02:48:04,940
cause he knows what he's gonna say.
It's going to screw up a lot of work.

3128
02:48:05,210 --> 02:48:08,090
And basically he says, yeah, you
wouldn't go from point a, B, c,

3129
02:48:08,091 --> 02:48:09,680
D and e to f if you were me,

3130
02:48:09,681 --> 02:48:12,410
you would have just gone straight
to FMN done with it. And then they,

3131
02:48:12,411 --> 02:48:14,390
you can tell they're now going
to go back and do rewrites.

3132
02:48:14,391 --> 02:48:18,140
Much like the John Lithgow thing with
a bad rear naked choke. There's so,

3133
02:48:18,380 --> 02:48:20,720
you know, there's so hoping it's
going to be as realistic as possible.

3134
02:48:20,721 --> 02:48:22,520
They're going to have to go
change a bunch of crap. Yeah.

3135
02:48:22,521 --> 02:48:24,110
That when I saw the rear naked choke,

3136
02:48:24,111 --> 02:48:28,920
I thought I was watching like TV show
from the eighties I was watching be a

3137
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:30,320
Vulcan nerve pinch.
It was fucked.

3138
02:48:30,321 --> 02:48:34,550
It was volcan nerve pinches more
believable because Elise, she's an alien.

3139
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:35,770
You know John Lithgow cows,

3140
02:48:35,771 --> 02:48:39,850
an old man with Shitty biceps
killing some lady in a bath tub.

3141
02:48:39,851 --> 02:48:41,060
It's just not even fighting back.

3142
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:45,050
People fight like wild animals when you're
trying to kill them. Yeah, it's crazy.

3143
02:48:45,060 --> 02:48:49,760
The unrealistic portrayal of death
that took you out of the story.

3144
02:48:49,761 --> 02:48:52,130
That's a good season though. I
agree. That's a really good season.

3145
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:53,690
It starts terrible.

3146
02:48:54,690 --> 02:48:57,920
Starts with the worst rear naked
choke seen in the history of TV.

3147
02:48:59,060 --> 02:49:01,940
I'm a stickler for technique
when it comes to shows.

3148
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:05,330
Is that the girl he's choking out? Let me
tell you some. It ain't that easy, bitch.

3149
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:08,010
Her whole right side is open.
She can pay

3150
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:11,010
it over there. He doesn't
have Jack Shit. Curl it up.

3151
02:49:11,310 --> 02:49:15,120
No that she's not fighting hard enough
for faces and red like you got to.

3152
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:18,070
I would tell them this is a true,

3153
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:22,310
this is a rear naked choke though
for real cause they are in a bathtub.

3154
02:49:22,380 --> 02:49:23,220
There's no way,
by the way,

3155
02:49:23,221 --> 02:49:25,800
you get into that bathtub without
anybody getting totally wet.

3156
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:27,540
Everybody would be soaking wet.

3157
02:49:27,541 --> 02:49:29,360
She'd be fighting for our
life and flopping around.

3158
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:32,410
You wouldn't get behind her naked and
be able to do this. This is ridiculous.

3159
02:49:32,411 --> 02:49:37,320
So ridiculous position. It's
just terrible. Season sucks.
I changed my mind crew.

3160
02:49:37,350 --> 02:49:41,550
That show fucking bullshit.
I think that Dexter just went,

3161
02:49:41,610 --> 02:49:45,780
it started just getting weird started
getting weird and not believable after

3162
02:49:45,781 --> 02:49:49,950
like the first season. I feel look
from a, from a creative perspective,

3163
02:49:49,980 --> 02:49:54,060
once they got through season two and three
maybe season four it's really hard to

3164
02:49:54,061 --> 02:49:57,720
keep that shtick going. He's the serial
killer or killers, serial killers.

3165
02:49:57,721 --> 02:50:01,590
There's only so much. The challenges
to that writing team were significant.

3166
02:50:01,591 --> 02:50:04,410
How do we keep this going because we're
making money and make the best show we

3167
02:50:04,411 --> 02:50:05,790
can it man.
It had to be really hard.

3168
02:50:05,880 --> 02:50:08,850
Well the problem is also the
dude stopped looking scary.

3169
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:12,600
If you look at Dexter in season one,
he was yoked. Yeah, he was there.

3170
02:50:12,601 --> 02:50:15,690
There were talking about him being like
a martial arts expert and he had this

3171
02:50:15,691 --> 02:50:19,770
thick neck and traps and everything and
he looked creepy and scary. You know,

3172
02:50:19,771 --> 02:50:21,690
he looked like a guy who
could fuck somebody up,

3173
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:24,690
but you look at him after he
got sick unfortunately he got,

3174
02:50:24,780 --> 02:50:27,150
what do you have like leukemia
or something. Like he had cancer,

3175
02:50:27,450 --> 02:50:31,410
he had to go through chemo and he was
really fucking skinny for a long time and

3176
02:50:31,411 --> 02:50:31,681
then you're like,

3177
02:50:31,681 --> 02:50:35,850
well now not buying him rag dolling all
of these people before I bought him as

3178
02:50:35,851 --> 02:50:40,851
this really crazy super strong guy who
was also a serial killer and it was just

3179
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:44,680
using his sickness to get
rid of bad people. Just like,

3180
02:50:44,730 --> 02:50:48,390
this is a fascinating concept, but
after awhile I was like, bitch,

3181
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:51,990
that's got to say they're holding
back the cough. Yeah. Listen man,

3182
02:50:52,890 --> 02:50:55,290
congratulations on everything.
That is a huge,

3183
02:50:55,291 --> 02:50:58,490
huge news that you've got these two
things in the works and you know,

3184
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:00,870
wish you all the best
[inaudible] and let me know when,

3185

3186

podcast suite and we really appreciate it

3187
02:51:06,361 --> 02:51:07,380

I was really fun talking to you.

3188
02:51:07,381 --> 02:51:11,440
Really insightful too to I love digging
into someone's creative process. Yeah,

3189
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:13,050
it's fun.
Why is showing that gay guy again?

3190
02:51:15,990 --> 02:51:17,700
He's a gay guy,
but he's bad ass.

3191
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:22,130
