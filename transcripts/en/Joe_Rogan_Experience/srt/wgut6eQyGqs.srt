1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,590
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,070
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,070
I taught fourth grade and now those
kids are grown up and that's really cool

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,930
because some of them told me it
was the best year of their lives.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,580
They come to see me do stand up.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,331
Oh,

7
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:12,991
that's amazing.

8
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,411
Very cool.

9
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,730
Will you teach and what grade?

10
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:14,990
Great.

11
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,870
At everything,

12
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,300
but oh,

13
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,210
fourth grade is different than science.

14
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:18,900
Everything.

15
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,171
I mean,

16
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:19,381
yeah,

17
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,040
it's different than what you did because
you went to some people who had an

18
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,600
interest and a love for something and
wanted to explore it what you were doing.

19
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,530
But mine is different.

20
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,370
They had to be there.

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,890
So my thing was self doubt,

22
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:32,724
self esteem.

23
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,310
I figured I can't teach them.

24
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,120
These subjects are going to
come and go in their lives,

25
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,710
but teaching them self esteem and some
of the most rewarding things where like

26
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,350
uh,

27
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,610
had this one kid who was real shy,

28
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,483
so shy,

29
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,320
he was real tall and he was embarrassed
by it and he would stay in the,

30
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,040
in the cloak room,

31
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,460
they'd call it a,

32
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,831
you know,

33
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,360
we're all the coats and
you just stay in there.

34
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,811
It won't come out.

35
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,240
I go,

36
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,890
sky,

37
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,150
come,

38
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,860
Sky King because he was
a space cadet goes sky,

39
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:56,700
you got to come out,

40
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,600
they can't stay,

41
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,130
I can't let a kid just sit and,

42
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,880
you know,

43
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,880
and by the end of me just like
work in his self esteem and all,

44
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,690
he was in the middle of the class,

45
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,680
just what everybody else waving his hand
and his mother came up to me and she

46
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:14,580
was like really touched by it and
told me that I changed his life and,

47
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:14,920
and you know,

48
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,990
that kind of Shit's cool.

49
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,930
And now I got like a couple of the
girls come to see me and she goes,

50
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,033
one of the girls goes,

51
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,460
uh,

52
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,870
ms.dot,

53
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,020
dot,

54
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,200
dot,

55
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,640
or why did you let us do so much stuff?

56
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,851
You know,

57
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,870
like I said,

58
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,340
because you were smarter than me.

59
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,721
I said she'd go to me.

60
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,021
I said,

61
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,261
look,

62
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:28,480
you know,

63
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,370
I always had more knowledge
because I was an adult kids.

64
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,120
Lot of you have more brainpower to me.

65
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,380
I know I wasn't smart enough
to know that I wasn't.

66
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,910
That's why you ran the class,

67
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:39,901
you know what I mean?

68
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,190
So you were an easy teacher.

69
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:44,310
That's what I told them at
the beginning of the year.

70
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:44,581
I said,

71
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:44,820
look,

72
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,070
I want this to be the most
fun year of your life.

73
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,690
Only you can mess it up.

74
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,120
Fucking awesome opportunity.

75
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,721
That must have been.

76
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:52,141
And I said,

77
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,280
I want to go to the gym.

78
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,480
This is what I was playing basketball.

79
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:54,781
I said,

80
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,160
I want to go to the gym more than you do.

81
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,890
So we're going to have a party.

82
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,410
Every Friday afternoon we'd have.

83
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:05,040
We'd have kids that would do break
dancing and stuff and really?

84
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,720
Yeah.

85
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,570
That's awesome.

86
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:07,404
That was great.

87
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,740
Did you ever try to pitch
that as a sitcom a no,

88
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:14,400
but somebody else had an idea for a
couple of times would be hilarious.

89
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,791
Sitcom.

90
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,840
It seems like a natural.

91
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,470
Yeah.

92
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,370
You as a,

93
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,040
as a funny teacher
because you really did it.

94
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,800
It's legit and if you really
stop and think about it,

95
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,400
that would be like for a kid that's like
one of the greatest rolls of the dice

96
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,140
and kicked and get for
their fourth grade teacher.

97
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,450
I had a girl,

98
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,200
our era for your fourth grade teacher,

99
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,600
she still calls me Mr Herrera.

100
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,090
She was 26 years old or whatever.

101
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,970
He calls me Mr Herrera.

102
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,940
Right.

103
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,770
And I go,

104
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,290
Theresa,

105
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,681
first of all,

106
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,670
you're taller than me.

107
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,770
She's always hot blonde.

108
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,850
I go start with the Mr. you can call me
dumb because I just can't call you dumb

109
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,600
net.

110
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,190
Funny.

111
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,640
She's got.

112
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,250
He's got me down as Mr Herrera.

113
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,163
That's good.

114
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
That'll keep you from being a dirty bird.

115
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,010
Whoa,

116
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,400
Whoa,

117
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,160
whoa.

118
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,130
Stay away dog.

119
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,710
She's a little girl.

120
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,531
Let her talk call you.

121
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,150
Ms Dot Darwish.

122
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,360
Trying to establish boundaries.

123
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,961
Somebody said,

124
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,460
why do you feel young?

125
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,260
I go because I can come on.

126
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Do you think that becoming more
aware or reaching a higher state of

127
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,110
consciousness because of your experiences
will actually help you because it'll

128
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:19,990
abandoned a lot of the distractions
that you present yourself almost

129
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
unknowingly.

130
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,131
Yeah.

131
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,570
Well it helps me.

132
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:26,260
It helps me in training and particularly
when I'm running now because I used to

133
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:31,261
listen to like Pantera and
patient disorder when I was
running and I had worked

134
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,570
myself into like a rage so I
wouldn't run into exhaustion.

135
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,730
That was kind of how they're trained
and not trained all the way through my

136
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,720
career like that and the
last couple of fights,

137
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:39,311
so sweet stuff.

138
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,330
I listened to a lot more like,

139
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,050
like more like blind binaural beat type
of stuff when I'm running so I could get

140
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,360
into more like a meditative stage,

141
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,253
you know,

142
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,310
doing a lot of yoga as well and trying
to find the same thing where you just,

143
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:50,850
you,

144
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,150
you,

145
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,470
you,

146
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,770
you're within yourself and you're
not focusing on anything else.

147
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,810
So your body's almost like on autopilot.

148
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,581
Yeah.

149
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,581
That the music that you listened to when
you train can have a profound effect on

150
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,330
how you approach your training.

151
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,603
It ready can,

152
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,491
it's so important.

153
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,370
And that's why I've always been so
vocal about all this stuff I listen to.

154
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,090
Like I'd,

155
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,290
I'd like training camp playlist,

156
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,550
so I tweet everyday trump songs I was
listening to and that kind of thing is

157
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,120
important.

158
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,240
And,

159
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,430
and,

160
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,560
and the other thing as well,

161
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,610
like earlier on in my career,

162
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,590
I would use music to anchor feelings.

163
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,820
So like,

164
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,420
like uh,

165
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,970
when I fought Ludwig I used
the song called Ian by Woodkid,

166
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,450
which was the first time I'd switched
from Angola belongs to me for like,

167
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:28,920
you know,

168
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
a bunch of fives.

169
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,413
Um,

170
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,930
so like for the 12 weeks of that
fight I was training with Frank Mir,

171
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,830
we were going to read it.

172
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,090
It's up to Mount Charleston and now into
red rock and like doing hill running

173
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,551
and stuff.

174
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,230
And we had some real tough sessions.

175
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:41,590
I mean,

176
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,920
you know,

177
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,870
we're ready to put ourselves
through for that training camp.

178
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,850
And as soon as I got back in my truck,

179
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:46,481
after the session,

180
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,111
after the session,

181
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,440
if I felt like it was a good session
that was productive and I felt positive,

182
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,790
I would put that song on and say I would
constantly connect those feelings to

183
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,750
that song.

184
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,950
So then when,

185
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,570
when I'm walking out
and that song comes on,

186
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:02,320
immediately I get that feeling
again and it's just like,

187
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:02,561
you know,

188
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,710
just like when you listen to a sermon,

189
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,260
you think of a person like,

190
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,441
oh,

191
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,470
I heard that someone was with that
person and you made that connection

192
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,160
immediately,

193
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,870
but you can also train yourself to do it.

194
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,340
So that's why you like allison to Cypress
Hill now and it will take me back to

195
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,760
fighting in cage warriors
like back in 2006.

196
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,690
Wow.

197
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,510
And I have songs all the way through like
that now I don't listen to because it

198
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,090
was like my first two fights.

199
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,140
I came back to Pantera,

200
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,610
drag the waters.

201
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,850
By the time I got to the cage I was so
wound up and so angry that I was just run

202
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,020
out of gas immediately.

203
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,793
Know what I mean?

204
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,650
And now whenever I
listened to those songs,

205
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,300
I get that feeling of light exhaustion.

206
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,134
Like ugh.

207
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,190
And I look at what's out there.

208
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,480
Some answers make no sense to me and
they seem to lead down really unhealthy

209
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:47,840
path.

210
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,680
So thank you.

211
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,543
But no thanks.

212
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,390
Are there answers?

213
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,230
Make more sense,

214
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,450
or maybe they don't and
I come up with my own,

215
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,510
but is it really is boiled
down to the Bruce Lee,

216
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,020
you know,

217
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,610
research your own experience,

218
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,200
a reject what is useless,

219
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,530
absorb what is useful and
what specific or year on,

220
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:03,771
you know,

221
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,160
his methodology for how
to approach knowledge.

222
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,371
I mean,

223
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:11,780
he applied it to martial arts by
reading is a brilliant way of approach.

224
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,310
Just any kind of knowledge,

225
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,240
whether it is really.

226
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,073
It's about life.

227
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:16,591
Yeah.

228
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:17,820
It's hard for people to accept that.

229
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:18,160
Right?

230
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,710
So it's much easier to follow the
pattern that you families followed.

231
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,850
I'm a Lutheran because grandma's Lutheran,

232
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,120
right?

233
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,190
GRANDPA always said that no matter what,

234
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:27,240
we'll be Lutherans.

235
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,690
Yep.

236
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,370
I remember talking to this girl and uh,

237
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,060
she said that she was going to get
a tattoo of a cross and I said,

238
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:33,630
uh,

239
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,050
I said,

240
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,470
oh,

241
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:34,801
I go,

242
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:35,670
you really religious?

243
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,270
She goes,

244
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,481
well,

245
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:36,961
not really,

246
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:37,800
but you know what?

247
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,450
I was born Catholic and I figured,

248
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,913
no matter what,

249
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,960
that's the one thing that will
be for the rest of my life.

250
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,050
Fuck.

251
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,760
I mean,

252
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,140
and I remember saying and I'm like,

253
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,801
you know,

254
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:47,670
I didn't know her very well,

255
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:48,180
so I was like,

256
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,950
okay,

257
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,783
um,

258
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,520
how do you know,

259
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,701
like,

260
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,380
how do you know you won't
change your mind about that?

261
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:52,771
And she's like,

262
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:53,311
oh my God,

263
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,270
my family would kill me.

264
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,791
And I was like,

265
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,151
oh,

266
00:06:59,151 --> 00:06:59,391
okay.

267
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,500
Well good luck with that.

268
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,240
Good luck with that.

269
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,253
Wow.

270
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,150
Those are examples.

271
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,350
Is that he had at war,

272
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,550
war took on different.

273
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,780
There will be people today's like,

274
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:08,951
no,

275
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm not really nancy,

276
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,491
but you know,

277
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,580
if I don't put the swastika
on my grandma would,

278
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,230
her feelings will get really
hurt and so it's high.

279
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,370
Don't hate the Jews,

280
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,600
but grandma fucking hates Jews.

281
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,680
And I love grandma.

282
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,180
Yeah,

283
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,731
exactly.

284
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:19,941
You know,

285
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,420
it's like,

286
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,770
I don't want to make them sad.

287
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,040
What's hilarious is that she was going
to get a Catholic tattoo in the first

288
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,160
place because like in the Bible
it very specifically says,

289
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,410
so like getting a religious tattoos like,

290
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,060
well you not listening to me,

291
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:35,840
you know,

292
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,550
only I listened when it's convenient,

293
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,740
but across tattoo is so sexy.

294
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,890
It makes me look spiritual
and it thins out my back.

295
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,130
That's the fault of the people
get pissed when you are.

296
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,420
You could eat at all and he's like,

297
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,530
what do you mean create your own?

298
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:48,980
It's not.

299
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,680
There are some absolute
truths that fall from heaven.

300
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,030
They stop those people that are
making up their own sheet anyway.

301
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,481
I mean,

302
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,120
when people say a full
time thing is bullshit.

303
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,960
They are making up their
own thing because they.

304
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,110
We'll add some parts of
that they don't like.

305
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,590
They will focus on the parts daylight
and pretend that it's the one and only

306
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,520
interpretation and say if
you're going to do that,

307
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,340
might as well be honest and
just peek from any source.

308
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,630
If you're going to be continuous.
