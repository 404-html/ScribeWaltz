00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,820
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,480
I always think I'm almost through this,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,930
so imagine we're the only
civilization in the galaxy.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,480
What a tremendous
responsibility there is on us.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,950
Imagine what that knowledge should
do to our political processes,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,510
the way that we think about ourselves,

7
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:20,040
the way that we get on together.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,690
Imagine how ridiculous it is to divide
our little world up into countries and

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,790
another little war every now and again,

10
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,170
important nuclear missiles at each other,

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,890
if in fact there's nowhere else in the
Milky Way galaxy where anybody thinks

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,970
where anybody can look at the styles
and think about and have these

13
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:36,804
conversations,

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,850
what a ridiculous way to behave.

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,300
So.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,300
So I think the cosmology is gives a
perspective which not doesn't necessarily

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,160
need to be humbling.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,110
It is humbling and that's
perhaps a good thing,

19
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,071
but it doesn't need.

20
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,560
You don't need to be depressed about it.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,400
It could be quite elating.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,881
You say,

23
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,061
well,

24
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:58,610
with what we are according to the evidence
and the data at the moment is almost

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,940
indescribably special.

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,050
Our,

27
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,340
our tininess,

28
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,040
our potential uniqueness,

29
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:10,041
our insignificance in a
cosmic scale actually makes
us special because we're the

30
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,030
only place.

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,361
And so,

32
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,020
so these,

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,700
these ideas are worth pursuing,

34
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,070
I think because they,

35
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:16,220
they,

36
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,040
they make you think about these issues.

37
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,390
It doesn't.

38
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,070
It also point to our ego that we think
that our biological processes any more

39
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,600
important than the exploding sons that
are required to create carbon life in the

40
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:28,690
first place or,

41
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,110
or any of the processes of the universe.

42
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,120
The answer that I think
is that you're right,

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,530
that in,

44
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,363
in a,

45
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,250
in a,

46
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,100
in a completely logical sense,

47
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,250
we're no more important or less
important than the stars themselves.

48
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,821
You're right,

49
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,960
which is natural objects.

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,380
But I would counter by saying that
people look for meaning in the universe.

51
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,860
People like to look for meaning.

52
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,400
It's this one thing that we've done
since we began to look at the stars.

53
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,770
The universe means something to me.

54
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,131
It doesn't,

55
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:56,400
it,

56
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,791
it does.

57
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,580
Meaning exists because
it means something to us.

58
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,120
So we know that it would be ridiculous
to say the university is meaningless.

59
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:04,350
It means something in my relatives,

60
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,131
our families,

61
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:05,731
we have loved ones,

62
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:06,564
et cetera.

63
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,900
So the fact that that
meaning might be emergent,

64
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,880
it might appear from the laws of nature.

65
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,400
And it is almost certainly transient,

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,770
unless we build these
self replicating machines,

67
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:17,001
we will.

68
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:21,570
We're not going to last forever as a
civilization probably so that to me,

69
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,630
that doesn't in any way water
down the significance of it.

70
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:25,751
So I,

71
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,450
I think again,

72
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,650
cosmology can be,

73
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,980
can be a powerful aid to philosophical
thoughts in this sense because we have to

74
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,350
accept that there's meaning in the
universe because it means something to us.

75
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,030
I don't see why it has to be eternal.

76
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,690
I don't see why that meaning
doesn't imply purpose.

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,310
I don't think there's any
purpose to the universe,

78
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,230
brings any point to our existence,

79
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,130
but the fact that we exist
at all is worth celebrating.

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,720
You don't need to add anything else.

81
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,261
In fact,

82
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,150
you almost did it to me.

83
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,060
You devalue it.

84
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:54,894
So why would you?

85
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,220
This is remarkable.

86
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,060
We emerged a single celled organisms
before that will emerge in some chemical

87
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,290
reactions in,

88
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,610
in hydrothermal vents,

89
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,700
probably down in the deep
primordial oceans of ancient earth.

90
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,500
And over three point 8 billion years,

91
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,710
we've come to the point where we can
sit and think about the styles and have

92
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,790
conversations like this.

93
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,050
Is that not enough?

94
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,950
Can we just leave it there?

95
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,840
Why does it have to be a point?

96
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,010
There isn't a point.

97
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,480
I don't think it's appalling to that,

98
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,300
but it's worth celebrating
because you don't think about it.

99
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,651
It's out of sight,

100
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:27,191
out of mind.

101
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,180
You don't have to look at it.

102
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,230
It's when you look at it and you know,

103
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,680
kind of like if you had to take a shit,

104
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,071
you know,

105
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:33,970
that's one thing you're like,

106
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:34,211
oh,

107
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,230
I can't wait to take a shit.

108
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,020
And he'd get on that toilet comes up.

109
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:41,340
But if you had a stuff that shit
back in your asshole theater,

110
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,340
reach in there with rubber gloves
on and just pack your own ass,

111
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,570
repack it.

112
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
That might be one of the worst
things you could ever do.

113
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,220
Like taking a shit is amazing

114
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,270
when you hold it in for just a little bit,

115
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,200
not a long time.

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,410
He'll lecture extra 20 minutes and
then you'd get on that toilet just,

117
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,880
ah,

118
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,650
you feel those logs just fucking
barrel and down the river.

119
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:04,931
Boom,

120
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,350
boom,

121
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,730
boom,

122
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,500
boom.

123
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,281
I went to,

124
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,560
I had took a dump at
the mall the other day.

125
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,830
I've been trying to eat healthier,

126
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,270
eating more Greens and stuff,

127
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,250
so it came out like very earthy.

128
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,210
Right.

129
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,560
It wasn't anything horrible.

130
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:23,270
It just smelled and I flushed and then
the guy came in to clean the restroom and

131
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:28,271
started choking and I felt so good and
he just hear him like trying to clean up

132
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,340
and then he just go at the end.

133
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:32,030
He just goes,

134
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,140
he was in there about two minutes.

135
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,800
He goes,

136
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,390
it smells like fucking shit.

137
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,280
Like oh yeah.

138
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:40,810
Like I said,

139
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,200
it was like a highlight of my life.

140
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,431
Yeah.

141
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,450
Like you scored on him.

142
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,830
He scored on them fucking
shit in a bathroom.

143
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,540
That guy's got to go in
there right after you.

144
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,710
And I had flushed.

145
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,510
So it wasn't like it was still sitting
there stewing like it was post flush.

146
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,990
Well there's nothing worse than
when you have to shit really bad.

147
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,710
And the only option is a Porta potty
and you're at a concert and there's 20

148
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:09,230
people behind you and there's a long ass
line and you go in there and you plop

149
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:13,000
down and you're shitting on other people's
shit that is on top of other people's

150
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,600
Shit,

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,980
which is on other people's Shit,

152
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,560
which is all in smurf juice.

153
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,860
And you just drop dropping logs on top
of preexisting logs and just gagging.

154
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,940
Meanwhile the band's
playing your favorite song.

155
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,890
Freebird No.

156
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,823
Fuck

157
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,030
did you.

158
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,030
I saw this online.

159
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,520
They had a thing about the Porta potties,

160
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,710
like the whole point of him is you're
supposed to close the lid and then that

161
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,770
will take the scent out
up through this funnel,

162
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:45,170
like this tube and release sent up there.

163
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:48,590
But the reason Porta potty smells so bad
is because everyone just leaves the lit

164
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:48,770
up.

165
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,640
No one wants to touch it.

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,541
Oh God.

167
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,374
Yeah.

168
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,740
Dylan bullshit.

169
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,603
It stinks.

170
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,230
It's a fucking confined space.

171
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,370
You're shitting in a phone booth.

172
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:57,204
It's not going.

173
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,280
That's smells everywhere.

174
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,240
Think as a society.

175
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,080
We could try it.

176
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,930
If it's still going to snake,

177
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,040
we can at least give it a shot.

178
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,221
You know?

179
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,060
I wish they movies.

180
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,420
Movies are like kids.

181
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:06,621
You don't.

182
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:06,921
People say,

183
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,754
do you have a favorite?

184
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,690
Fuck yeah,

185
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,620
but I'm not going to tell you.

186
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,041
You know,

187
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,500
like that's,

188
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,670
it's the same thing with kids.

189
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,650
It's like every parent,

190
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,120
I don't give a shit what they say.

191
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,380
I love them all equally.

192
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,690
No you don't because some
kids are just assholes.

193
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,520
You can't possibly,

194
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,190
you know,

195
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,370
and,

196
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,700
and some of them are screw
ups in life life children.

197
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,011
No,

198
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:23,360
I don't.

199
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,930
Yeah,

200
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,590
you can kind of love them all equally
because I think when kids feel like

201
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,940
there's a part of it that's your fault,

202
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,980
that's the thing that people feel guilty.

203
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:37,580
You're saying guilt
compensates for the lighter,

204
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,650
raises the love because you feel that
they need more love because you screwed

205
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:41,961
them up.

206
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,760
You're responsible for there being a
dog that killed one of my other dogs.

207
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,860
I love the dog that she killed,

208
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,730
but I loved her just as
much and it was very sad.

209
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,210
I mean,

210
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,980
obviously I have loved the dog that got
killed more because she wasn't a cunt,

211
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,130
she wasn't an asshole that was
out there killing the other dogs,

212
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,870
but this dog was a sweetie and I picked
her up at the pound and she lived at

213
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:04,310
the,

214
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,700
she was in one of those no kill
shelters for like eight months.

215
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,230
And when I was young,

216
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:10,360
man I had a real problem in that.

217
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,330
It's hard to talk about I guess

218
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,230
where I felt like,

219
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:17,890
um,

220
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,570
I felt I had always had this,

221
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,080
uh,

222
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,080
this need to help strays and I think I
had this need to help strays because I

223
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,190
felt like a stray and when I would see a,

224
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,530
a dog in a pound or a click,

225
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,610
I bought a cat from a fucking pet
store because it hissed at me,

226
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,420
you know,

227
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,950
because I felt his poor fucking cat,

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,770
like scared of me.

229
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,840
I'm not scared of me.

230
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:38,674
I love you.

231
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,460
And I felt that way about this dog,

232
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,020
this poor dog.

233
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,690
I used to call her squeaky because when
I picked her up she couldn't even talk.

234
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:49,150
She couldn't bark because
she barked so much,

235
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,490
so often in this pound
that her voice was gone.

236
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,350
So when she was barking in the pound,

237
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:53,651
she'd be like,

238
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:54,484
yeah,

239
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,520
it was like this squeak.

240
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,921
And I was like,

241
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,180
what the fuck is wrong with her voice?

242
00:07:59,181 --> 00:07:59,660
And I realized,

243
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,141
Oh my God,

244
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:03,140
she's barking all day and she
doesn't have a voice anymore.

245
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,560
And then when I took her
home and took care of her,

246
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:09,230
she eventually got her voice back
and she barked like a normal dog.

247
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,930
But that dog fucking loved people.

248
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,070
She loved people.

249
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,680
She was so happy to be out of that shit,

250
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,300
but she didn't like other dogs
because the dogs came near her.

251
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:18,980
She felt like it was a
competition for love.

252
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,980
Like if you came near another dog,

253
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,780
that other dog was going to get that love.

254
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,410
So she would get upset at that dog for
stealing love from her and she would try

255
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,244
to attack it.

256
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,150
So I loved her too.

257
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,631
Equally,

258
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:30,710
even though she was an idiot,

259
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,790
you know,

260
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,040
she,

261
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,500
but it wasn't her fault
that she was an idiot.

262
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,260
You know,

263
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,760
I would,

264
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:34,990
I would,

265
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,450
uh,

266
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,420
I realized from then on I will
never get a dog that's not a puppy,

267
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,500
that you got to raise them from the time
they're puppies because then you don't

268
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:42,920
have any,

269
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,080
they don't have any phobias or weirdness.

270
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,600
You get a chance to,

271
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,380
to raise them around people and raise
them around other dogs and socialize them.

272
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:55,040
And it's an important aspect of humans
just like it's an important aspect.

273
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,820
Any other animal that's in our culture.

274
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,661
So,

275
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,494
um,

276
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,250
you know,

277
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,401
I,

278
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:03,410
you can love your fucking shitty kids
just as much as you love your good kids

279
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,250
because it's partly your
fault that they're shitty.
