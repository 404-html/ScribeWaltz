1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,701
an honor to be here.

3
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:04,290
A pleasure and honor to have you,

4
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:04,890
sir.

5
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,980
Brian is my longest running
friend in Hollywood.

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,551
I think so,

7
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:08,731
right?

8
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:08,851
Yeah,

9
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:09,171
for sure.

10
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:09,720
Any years?

11
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,901
Yeah.

12
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,310
We've been friends a long ass time.

13
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,173
Almost 20 years.

14
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,660
Yeah,

15
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,770
94 or something like that.

16
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,790
People still come up to me.

17
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:19,791
It was 90 1995 and people still come up
to me and ask me if we're half brothers.

18
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,610
You are the ones that who's
used to say it on Wikipedia.

19
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right.

20
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,440
I am DB one of those.

21
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:25,981
It's a rumor.

22
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:26,910
I like keeping a lot.

23
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,661
I keep it alive.

24
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:27,880
I don't,

25
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,550
I never refuted it either.

26
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,220
Do I now?

27
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,780
Now I think you were the one who
told me about Gracie Jujitsu.

28
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,501
Yeah,

29
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,334
I remember that.

30
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,060
I remember we connected immediately.

31
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,670
Yeah.

32
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,830
You show up in those guys are all just
low blood sugar and just a bunch of

33
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:41,160
actors.

34
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,150
All of a sudden this guy,

35
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:42,331
see,

36
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:42,601
I'm like,

37
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:42,931
wait a minute,

38
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:43,651
that guy looks like me,

39
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,420
but he's thicker and then he looks way
more extreme and you had a tank top on

40
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:48,791
and you were like,

41
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,570
can possibly muster.

42
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,801
I was like,

43
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,240
that guy looks like he
fights and you're like,

44
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:51,721
yeah,

45
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,560
if I like to fight,

46
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,191
I need to fight.

47
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,240
I didn't do I need to be in class,

48
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,470
otherwise I will end up in jail.

49
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,161
And I was like,

50
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:57,600
that guy's going to be my friend forever.

51
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,960
We connected so quick
right away with everything,

52
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,070
every retarded thing.

53
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,630
We'd love pit bulls and,

54
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,050
and,

55
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,801
and we're,

56
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,390
we both know it's retarded.

57
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,231
That's the difference.

58
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:10,530
Like all of my extreme macho psycho shit.

59
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,700
I know it's fucked up.

60
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,860
Like I know my tattoos are fucked up.

61
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,150
I know my neck is too big.

62
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:16,140
I don't give a fuck,

63
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:16,651
you know,

64
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:17,940
I know my car is too loud.

65
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,470
I don't care.

66
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,090
You won't like it.

67
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:21,980
You've always been my,

68
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
my canary in the coal mine.

69
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,331
You as well.

70
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:24,571
You know,

71
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,220
as long as I know you're
still out there alive,

72
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,500
someone's rocking it the right way.

73
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,170
No doubt.

74
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,260
You're crazy to think that you would ever
want to do anything different because

75
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,680
whatever you've done has made you,

76
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,360
you,

77
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,870
you know,

78
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,171
I,

79
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:34,650
you know,

80
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:34,941
I,

81
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:37,290
I'm sorry for anybody that
ever hurt their feelings,

82
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,190
but I'm so happy.

83
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,670
Everything turned out the
weird turning against you,

84
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:39,870
right?

85
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,051
Man,

86
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,780
I never thought of that.

87
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,480
I really liked that.

88
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,380
As I was thinking of as a,

89
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,051
as you were talking,

90
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,590
I went,

91
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,210
I spent a lot of time
wishing I was somebody else.

92
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,290
That's why I'm an accurate,

93
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,340
that's why I'm a comic.

94
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:47,941
And by the way,

95
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,870
that is who I am,

96
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:49,410
isn't it?

97
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,090
We don't want a guy who wishes he was,

98
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,770
who spends a lot of time
wishing he was somebody else.

99
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,790
That's my identity.

100
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,950
Every guy wants an undefeated record.

101
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,520
Okay,

102
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,151
but I'm telling you,

103
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,200
that shit ain't good for you.

104
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,570
You have to understand
what it's like to lose.

105
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,991
Of course,

106
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,280
you have to understand failure.

107
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,851
You have to,

108
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:06,090
you have to be able to look back in
your past at a moment where you fuck

109
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,840
something up and feel uncomfortable about
it and that should provide you with a

110
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,090
certain amount of humility and they're
just trying to understand that.

111
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,650
I think a man is,

112
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,680
is the product of what partially a large
but largely a product product of of how

113
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,480
of the actions he chose to
take as a response to failure.

114
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,733
You know?

115
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,340
Yeah,

116
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,731
for sure.

117
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,790
I don't know how you learn
anything other than the hard way.

118
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,630
I don't,

119
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,740
I mean you don't really,

120
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:35,730
you don't really look where
we're a strange animal
that's dealing with infinite

121
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,731
variables and the only way to truly find
a focused way through this path is to

122
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:47,121
have accumulated a massive
amount of experiences and
forged positive information

123
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:51,030
and game plans from these experiences
and be able to move forward.

124
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,300
You cannot know it all
right away from the get go.

125
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,940
That's all you can do is control how you,

126
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,860
how you respond to failure,

127
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,740
what you choose to do differently
or readjusting your approach.

128
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,330
And by the way though,

129
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:07,780
the one thing for me is
I've learned just to enjoy,

130
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,780
enjoy that and allow the frustration,

131
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,430
uh,

132
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,190
you be able to make fun
of yourself when you fuck.

133
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,370
You guys can do that.

134
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,270
So huge.

135
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,770
There was a guy that's some big,

136
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,360
so big and then you're great at it.

137
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
There was a guy recently,

138
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,361
I say recently,

139
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,800
it was in within the last couple of years.

140
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,120
It was back when,

141
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,360
uh,

142
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,490
legends was at the,

143
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:30,360
the old bomb squad on Santa Monica
Boulevard where the two Jimmys.

144
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah.

145
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,151
Anyway,

146
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,590
this guy picked up a hooker.

147
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,760
He came back from Iraq,

148
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,930
picked up a hooker,

149
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,590
turns out the hooker was a dude
the had sucked this deck for,

150
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,430
I don't think I was a guy,

151
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,160
shot him,

152
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,630
no.

153
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,310
Dumped the body in an
alleyway and an alley way,

154
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:44,110
like a movie.

155
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,660
So the cops apparently see
this guy dumped the body,

156
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,650
the high speed,

157
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,484
chase and sues.

158
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,230
They chased him all the
way up to the desert,

159
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,510
gets out of the car with
his gun suicide by cop.

160
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,700
They shoot him dish.

161
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,040
And all I'm thinking of
is this motherfucker,

162
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,730
if he could just make fun of himself,

163
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,580
would have the best story ever.

164
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:00,090
So true.

165
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,450
The idea of the stubble and this
guy did it really quiet suddenly.

166
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,963
You don't know that story?

167
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,643
No.

168
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,460
Interesting.

169
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,910
Well,

170
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,660
if I may,

171
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,680
if you'll please leave.

172
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,670
I've never told you this story.

173
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,010
I can't believe you haven't either.

174
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,853
And you might have.

175
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,250
I met,

176
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,870
I'm at Club USA.

177
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,030
Yay.

178
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,440
In,

179
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,810
uh,

180
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,643
New York City.

181
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,483
How many years ago?

182
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,001
Oh,

183
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:20,480
I dunno.

184
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,313
20.

185
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,203
I know.

186
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,780
I'm,

187
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,240
I'm,

188
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm 63 now.

189
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,620
I just had a lot of work done,

190
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,783
but um,

191
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,420
uh,

192
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,811
yeah,

193
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,141
I'm,

194
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:31,820
I'm a Ahmed USA.

195
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,900
I'm a young man and a,

196
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm dancing and,

197
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,571
uh,

198
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,880
with my buddy and I meet this,

199
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,530
I have a weakness for Latina girls,

200
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,010
right?

201
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,670
Little petite,

202
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,300
curvy.

203
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,480
I see this beautiful Latino girl.

204
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,490
She's got this black pony tail.

205
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,480
She's got,

206
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,490
she's got that caramel skin,

207
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,880
this cute little ass I know.

208
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,840
And this title,

209
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,501
stop touching.

210
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,334
She's dead.

211
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,840
She's dancing,

212
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:57,890
she's dancing.

213
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,570
She's,

214
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,403
I'll start,

215
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,561
he said,

216
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,394
stop.

217
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,600
Sorry.

218
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,600
She's dancing and she's dancing and she
locks eyes with me with the eyes of a

219
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,270
fighter.

220
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,900
I mean,

221
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,370
just looking at me and I'm like,

222
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:10,850
all right,

223
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,600
well there's,

224
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
that's my wife.

225
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,520
That's my wife right there.

226
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,440
I start dancing with her and we're aligned
and we're dancing and she smells like

227
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,880
fucking apricots.

228
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't remember what it smells like.

229
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:21,630
We're for the story.

230
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,600
She smells like fucking apricots.

231
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,440
And I'm just this,

232
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,080
we started making out and I mean Bob
slapping on the dance floor and you know,

233
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,250
sometimes when you're that attracted,

234
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,570
everything else melts away.

235
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,950
You just see that one person.

236
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,190
I'm a little drunk and I'm
kissing her and it's romantic.

237
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,150
I mean deep.

238
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,061
Oh God.

239
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:40,940
So there are these booths,

240
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,390
there were these peak booths at Club USA
where you could go in and there was a

241
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,650
glass thing where other
people can watch you.

242
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,080
So I take this girl into the Pete booths
and I didn't give a fuck [inaudible]

243
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,450
glass.

244
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,790
So other people can watch and
you want to come into the booth?

245
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,481
They can watch.

246
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,850
But no freaking,

247
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,830
I was 20 I was 23 I didn't give a fuck.

248
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:01,161
I was like,

249
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,581
I'll take my,

250
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,020
I'll fucking fucking right here.

251
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,490
I didn't condom shut off.

252
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,830
So I'm literally like,

253
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,030
I'm going to fuck this girl
right here in this club and say,

254
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,700
you cuff me.

255
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,451
Go Fuck Yourself.

256
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,141
I was just in love.

257
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,680
I'm going to get hurt.

258
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,311
This is my girlfriend.

259
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,450
This is about as my girlfriend forever,

260
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,790
so I'm kissing and I'm making
out and I'm feeling a body.

261
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,760
He's got his little dance.

262
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,001
I'm like,

263
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:20,620
these are small.

264
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,453
It doesn't matter.

265
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,710
Our waste so hard enough for
the ask was on another level.

266
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,580
Yeah.

267
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,580
She had a beautiful ass and
I reached down and I go for,

268
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,290
well I grab a grab a branch,

269
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,120
I grab a fucking branch that
had been talked under and she,

270
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:43,121
he goes up and pulls my hand away and
I immediately realize that was a cop.

271
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,320
I've been,

272
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,180
I've been deep kissing,

273
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,910
deep kissing for two hours,

274
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,680
so I'm definitely a little gay.

275
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,690
I mean deep kissing and
I just grabbed a cock.

276
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,040
You ever thought it did not
know about the cock and tight?

277
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,791
How did I not know,

278
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,624
dude?

279
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,550
Because she was,

280
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,350
she was taking hormones obviously.

281
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:06,921
Secondly,

282
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,810
she was already like had that skin,

283
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,700
Latino or Filipino,

284
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,990
whatever she was,

285
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,590
where she just didn't
have hair on her body.

286
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,450
She was petite.

287
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,020
He,

288
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,560
I keep saying she sees
such a girl and you know,

289
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,700
but here's this here at ready.

290
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,061
Here's the,

291
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,110
here's why I'm a good guy.

292
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,850
Here's what I have a
really fucking nice guy.

293
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,220
Nope.

294
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,500
I,

295
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,820
I looked in her eyes.

296
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,860
She was so hurt his eyes.

297
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,850
He was so like,

298
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:29,601
he was just like,

299
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:33,580
please let this big and
I'm such a fucking onstar.

300
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,570
I felt so bad that I go,

301
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,670
I go back in to kiss her.

302
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,260
I kiss her him for
another like two seconds,

303
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:41,661
three seconds.

304
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,530
When I go on the lips,

305
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,680
of course food.

306
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,160
You fuckers now listen.

307
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,880
Oh,

308
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,713
I'm not

309
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,110
go.

310
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,681
I go like this.

311
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:51,340
I go,

312
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,730
oh.

313
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,270
I go,

314
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,170
oh fuck.

315
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,730
I have an old sir.

316
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,510
I have an ulcer in.

317
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,530
My stomach is killing me.

318
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,190
And she goes,

319
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,551
you do?

320
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:58,030
I go,

321
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,291
yes.

322
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:58,511
She goes,

323
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,291
do you have to go to the bathroom?

324
00:07:59,291 --> 00:07:59,441
I go,

325
00:07:59,441 --> 00:07:59,501
no,

326
00:07:59,501 --> 00:07:59,571
no,

327
00:07:59,571 --> 00:07:59,740
no.

328
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,370
I just have to.

329
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,510
I have a very bad old sir.

330
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,740
Sometimes it just keeps,

331
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,450
so I want to protect her feelings.

332
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,411
I felt bad.

333
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:05,800
Him,

334
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,640
his shit,

335
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:07,550
his ass.

336
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,220
That's how I got out
and I left and I never,

337
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,760
I did not come back to that quote.

338
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,410
I can't believe you went
back in and you got to be,

339
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,520
I didn't want to be rude.

340
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,393
No.

341
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,471
Wait a minute.

342
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:19,771
Wait a minute.

343
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,150
We've been the person,

344
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:24,720
some person pretended to be a girl
and tricked you into kissing him.

345
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
Never even told you something.

346
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,180
That for a lot of guys
would make them violent.

347
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,230
I would a gay band for a lot of guys.

348
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,133
What'd you relive?

349
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,480
I would've been mad if that,

350
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,240
if this person [inaudible] guys,

351
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:37,074
it's an experience.

352
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,123
Well,

353
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,201
okay for you,

354
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,280
but for a lot of guys,

355
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:44,220
it's an experience that they don't want
to have and someone tricked them into

356
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:46,560
doing it and they could
get violent and I don't,

357
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,460
I don't justify it,

358
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,570
but I'm saying a lot of guys,

359
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,560
that would be the reaction.

360
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,180
The fact that you felt bad.

361
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:51,881
It's very strange.

362
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:52,940
And he went back and then,

363
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,731
and then what?

364
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:56,040
Or a poem did you have
a of ton after that?

365
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,641
Uh,

366
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,080
I don't believe a kissed with Tom,

367
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,100
but if I tell the story again,

368
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,090
I'll definitely use that.

369
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,310
Isn't it funny how Lego a
memory from that far back?

370
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,810
It's almost bullshit anyway,

371
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,600
cause it's so like fragmented and odd.

372
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:13,080
It's like I can recite the facts
of a lot of details of my life,

373
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,700
but do it truly recall them.

374
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,960
And if I didn't have a language,

375
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,700
they wouldn't even exist to my memory
banks to tell you another story.

376
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,730
Please do this.

377
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,540
Did I tell you that Jimmy Burke story?

378
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,220
Which one?

379
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,750
A midnight?

380
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,921
No,

381
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,000
a million Jimmy Burke stories.

382
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,650
The one where where we were both
together with two girls on a bed.

383
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,633
Yes.

384
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,923
Yes,

385
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,063
yes.

386
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,120
All right.

387
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,630
That's good.

388
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,290
Okay.

389
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,850
So I had my best friend's thumb in my ass.

390
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,270
All right.

391
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,103
Uh,

392
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,310
but that's a whole different story.

393
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,330
Joe.

394
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,920
What you put your thumb.

395
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,230
Oh,

396
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,921
what should I tell?

397
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,480
Did I tell him,

398
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,313
sign my thumb?

399
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,540
Let's be clear about because we refer
to each other as best friends and I tell

400
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,890
him my thumb was never anywhere
near the punchline away,

401
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:56,870
but there's a very,

402
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,050
very good excuse for it.

403
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,980
No wonder why it's not on the podcast.

404
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,621
Well,

405
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:02,700
should I tell him the podcast,

406
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,080
it's a little late because
you already gave away.

407
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,830
The punchline is if you can tell
the story somehow or another make it

408
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,440
entertaining even though
the punchline is already,

409
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,280
I used to have ice date,

410
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,540
I two girlfriends for a long time that
I had sex with 10 years after the fact.

411
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,680
They were just my two girls.

412
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,550
Loved them,

413
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,300
loved them.

414
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,770
I had touched with those girls.

415
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,210
I,

416
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,560
you know that we dated in
college and then I dated him.

417
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:26,670
We want to add right after college
and and for the next 10 years,

418
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,870
maybe longer.

419
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,000
They were always a booty
call and I was kind of,

420
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,290
relationships are so strange,

421
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,583
so weird.

422
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,910
Even through their boyfriends to
girlfriends and we would always get crazy.

423
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:36,420
Paul,

424
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,961
how many,

425
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:41,040
how many girls like that have a guy like
that somewhere in their life where they

426
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,370
just have some arrangements
and they can always up places.

427
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,863
Right.

428
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,621
I know.

429
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:47,454
Dirty.

430
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,920
How can you tell what,

431
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,180
what do you most of all?

432
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,510
And because they're there,

433
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:55,290
they talk about him a lot because he's
still in their life because he's still

434
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,720
really important to them
because they had a long time.

435
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,733
I can always tell him,

436
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,170
you're saying you could sniff
it if a girl's doing it to you,

437
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,383
you can tell.

438
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:02,661
I mean,

439
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:02,941
I know.

440
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,860
And it just gives you like
a nice green light though.

441
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,230
You're like,

442
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,641
okay,

443
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:06,930
yeah,

444
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,220
yeah,

445
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,440
yeah.

446
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,251
You should be friends.

447
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,230
You should be automatically goes,

448
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,410
can assume that she's
doing that just horr ramp.

449
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,823
I was that,

450
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,140
I was that with this one girl.

451
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,443
Right.

452
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,660
Sorry about the training,

453
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,960
but I was that with this one girl and she,

454
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,803
um,

455
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,051
hold on one second.

456
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:27,121
It's,

457
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:27,921
it's getting hot in here.

458
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm going to turn the AC on.

459
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,121
Continue the story.

460
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:30,954
I'm sorry for,

461
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,900
I'll go slower Joe.

462
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,863
So,

463
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,990
so,

464
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,040
so she um,

465
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,590
she basically was a,

466
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,380
uh,

467
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,850
she,

468
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,180
she,

469
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,013
she was the girl,

470
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,983
both of them were,

471
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,380
you know,

472
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,460
my girls for a long time.

473
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,840
They are down at a restaurant
in New York City called Il Buco,

474
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,760
which is a great restaurant by the way.

475
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,610
And I get a call from one of them,

476
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,080
which is essentially like,

477
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:52,831
Hey Brian,

478
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:53,200
it's,

479
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,920
it's such and such and such and such
and we're hanging out and we really wish

480
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,940
you were here.

481
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,820
And we were talking about
you and we were talking,

482
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,840
telling dirty stories,

483
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:02,674
whatever they were saying.

484
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,980
And I,

485
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,310
I couldn't call back fast and I was like,

486
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:07,001
where are you?

487
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,470
Like where ideal Buco I'm like,

488
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,340
I'll be there.

489
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll be there now.

490
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,390
I mean I was literally like 20 minutes
away and I got down there in five

491
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:13,601
minutes.

492
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:14,910
I would say I was at
his hand at the capitol.

493
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:17,800
I drive taught that I get there.

494
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,700
Long story short,

495
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,660
because I'm a team player,

496
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:21,070
I call my best friend Jimmy Burke.

497
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,601
That's it.

498
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:23,351
I called Jimmy Burke.

499
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:23,980
I say,

500
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,600
get down here.

501
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,890
That by the way is
always the code for fuck.

502
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,730
And there's something about to go
down and it always involves pussy.

503
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,830
Get down here he goes,

504
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,810
be right there guy.

505
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,350
He's there in two seconds,

506
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,940
we'll drink and wine.

507
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,490
I'm fucking getting them all
applied up talking about it.

508
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,050
I could see the two of them,

509
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,040
the two girls are,

510
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,520
are,

511
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,780
are all over each other.

512
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,980
And I'm like,

513
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,311
Oh,

514
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,940
you want to use me as a bridge to
have an experience with each other.

515
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,751
How interesting.

516
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,380
My two old girlfriends who subsequently
asked me to have children with them,

517
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,010
by the way,

518
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,120
just to use my sperm,

519
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:55,960
which was very flattering,

520
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:56,794
but I had to say no.

521
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,790
But anyway,

522
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,510
so,

523
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,021
okay,

524
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,940
so I'm like that Jimmy Burke goes,

525
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:01,690
hey guys,

526
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,351
let's go back to my,

527
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,220
I call him the maestro.

528
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,510
He,

529
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,091
he goes,

530
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,140
let's go back to my place.

531
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,100
Let's go back to my place.

532
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,060
I'll pull the fire,

533
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:07,894
got some weed,

534
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,550
I'll make some fucking
chocolate chip cookies.

535
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,330
How's that sound?

536
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,370
We'd fireplace chocolates or cookies.

537
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,600
They're like,

538
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,260
uh,

539
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,890
yeah.

540
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,371
Okay.

541
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:16,204
Sounds good.

542
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,170
We get to the place.

543
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:17,920
Uh,

544
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,750
he goes to the kitchen to get,

545
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,140
like,

546
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,180
to start whipping up
chocolate chip cookies.

547
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,620
He's bringing out some weed.

548
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,251
He goes to the kids,

549
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:24,651
we bring,

550
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:25,481
who brings out we'd,

551
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:26,250
it brings out a joint.

552
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,921
By that time,

553
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm already naked on the bed with the,

554
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,591
with the girls.

555
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,700
I'm already naked.

556
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,481
And he's like,

557
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,710
what the fuck is,

558
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,710
this is a locking block though.

559
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,623
He is.

560
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,490
And I'm like,

561
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,610
oh my God,

562
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,990
you no longer look at my boss.

563
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,650
I'm like,

564
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,280
oh my look at you.

565
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,971
I'm like looking at him.

566
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:43,270
I go,

567
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,920
I go to Jamaica.

568
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,790
I'd rather be nowhere else
in the world right now,

569
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,090
Bro.

570
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,220
This is the place to be.

571
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,120
This is the greatest
experience of my life.

572
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,670
Literally like I'm living a
porn right now and I love them.

573
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,720
They're both my girls.

574
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,240
So Jimmy's lived,

575
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,510
oh,

576
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,960
let me take my clothes off.

577
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,891
He takes it.

578
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:57,551
He looks like a red,

579
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,181
bumpy pickled,

580
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,014
by the way.

581
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,790
He's fucking hairless.

582
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,380
Got a piece on him and I'm like,

583
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,730
that's just not attractive to me.

584
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:04,564
But whatever.

585
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,120
So he's trying to get
this girl's pants down.

586
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,320
He's getting and he's trying to,

587
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,690
and he's got a tongue
literally that goes literally,

588
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,890
he could catch fucking flies.

589
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,720
He's like one of those frogs.

590
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,430
He's taken this girl's pants down.

591
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,680
He's trying to get his
taste frog tongue in there.

592
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,780
She's cheese trying to
go down the other girl.

593
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,760
So she's more than the other
girl as I'll make no young gun.

594
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,990
I'm like,

595
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,171
Oh,

596
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,130
is that my car glare?

597
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,860
As you know,

598
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,460
I'm just a fucking,

599
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,590
I'm sorry to be this graphic,

600
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,101
but the point is,

601
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,190
it was just a fucking fucking business.

602
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:29,810
So,

603
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,470
so he,

604
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,050
he's trying to get us
done and she stopped.

605
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:32,291
She goes,

606
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:32,710
wait,

607
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,543
hold on.

608
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,780
I don't like this.

609
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,890
You guys need to,

610
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,350
you guys need to get
do something together.

611
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,581
I,

612
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:39,191
I don't,

613
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,870
I don't like to say I
look at Jim and we'd go,

614
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,381
oh,

615
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,310
we don't do that.

616
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
I don't do that.

617
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,570
See,

618
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,540
I don't fuck around with guys
because it's not that I'm homophobic.

619
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm just not attracted to the guys.

620
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
And I definitely have a hard on right now.

621
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,430
And so it was my buddy
and there's no fucking,

622
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,281
it's best bad enough.

623
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,140
We're about two feet away from each other.

624
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm not doing anything with my buddy.

625
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,580
And this is the girl that
Jimmy was trying to eat out,

626
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:57,850
right?

627
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:57,961
Yeah,

628
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:58,400
of course.

629
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,830
Yeah.

630
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,663
Like in Jimmy,

631
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,893
right.

632
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,470
She was more into the girl she was into,

633
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:04,304
you know,

634
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,030
so,

635
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,570
so,

636
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,290
um,

637
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,730
so she says,

638
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,570
so she says to Jimmy and
Jimmy could give a fuck.

639
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:11,831
He,

640
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:12,320
he,

641
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,190
he doesn't give a shit.

642
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,120
He's down to go.

643
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,230
And if he has to fuck me
in the ass to get to this,

644
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,240
he's gonna,

645
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,170
he's like this.

646
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,030
I can see the look in his
eyes and he's fucking like,

647
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,870
let's go.

648
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,570
Let's go.

649
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,660
What the fuck do you need me to do?

650
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,850
I want you guys to make out
that we had done a play,

651
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,960
not a sketch where we,

652
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:27,800
where we make as a joke.

653
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,400
And I go,

654
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,591
no,

655
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:28,661
no,

656
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:28,790
no.

657
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,660
I don't make out with guys.

658
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,500
It's disgusting.

659
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,910
Can't do it.

660
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,700
I can't do it.

661
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,350
I had to do it.

662
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,350
I think there was a part,

663
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,070
there was a,

664
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,840
you said you wrote a plate
that you guys are good.

665
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,270
I wrote this play as we can make out.

666
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,140
I can't,

667
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,410
I can't make out what there is.

668
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:45,680
But I did write this play where I make
out with can every letter and it's

669
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,360
unfortunate that it had to be that way,

670
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,710
but I had to make out with a guy.

671
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,840
But that's what I wrote,

672
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,250
that it's what I wrote.

673
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,150
It's called kissing up boy.

674
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,450
But the point is this
is what my Dick Hard,

675
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:56,690
right?

676
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,523
Why am I crying?

677
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,393
Why?

678
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,263
Okay,

680
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,120

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,511

682
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:05,140

683
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,270
so before I can even do it,

684
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,701
Jimmy goes,

685
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,560

686
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,251
Get over here.

687
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:10,170
You fucking pussy.

688
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,780
He goes like,

689
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,910

690
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,450
She goes,

691
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,283
yeah,

692
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,701
it goes down.

693
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,241
And I'm like that.

694
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,980
So now I'm back to my girl,

695
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,610
I'm back to my girl and we're,

696
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:26,040
well we're locked in and we're making
out and all of a sudden I feel the other

697
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:26,730
girls,

698
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,400
I feel the other girl's ass hand
around my ass cause he felt good.

699
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:29,970
Brian.

700
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,803
I'm like,

701
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,863
it feels fucking good.

702
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,410
All of a sudden they feel like I'm not a,

703
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,030
I'm not an ass play guy
to be honest with you.

704
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:39,420
But I feel like finger going and my mom,

705
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,461

a mug wish and look at,

709
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,840

710
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:46,674
you know what I mean?

711
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,200
So I'm like,

712
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,010

713
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,371
okay.

714
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:50,560
That,

715
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,110
oh,

716
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,690

717
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,021
She goes,

718
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,501
I feel good.

719
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:52,740
I go,

720
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,130
oh,

721
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,870
I guess so you're a girl.

722
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,381
I wouldn't go,

723
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:55,591
well,

724
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:56,550
you know it went in Rome.

725
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:56,770
I'm like,

726
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,130
AH,

727
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,963
fuck off.

728
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,990
And I'm just sewing and this guy and then,

729
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,370
and then I,

730
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,000
then I feel what feels like
a greyhound bus in my ass.

731
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:10,290
You understand a greyhound
bus in my ass to which I go,

732
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,050
oh,

733
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,490
like that.

734
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,510
Exactly what I went,

735
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,680
oh like that.

736
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,840
And I turn around like this.

737
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:16,651
I'm stuck.

738
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:16,921
I all,

739
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:17,754
I can do it.

740
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,510
My back,

741
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:18,901
I turned,

742
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,230
I go,

743
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,531
oh,

744
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:20,160
I like that.

745
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
And my buddy's got his thumb and
my ass and he goes like this.

746
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:23,850
He goes,

747
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,920
you fucking pussy.

748
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,913
Oh,

749
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,250
now let me explain.

750
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,203
Let me explain.

751
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,110
Let me explain.

752
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,910
Let me explain why and
how she said to him,

753
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm not going to do any more.

754
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,460
I will fuck you,

755
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:40,510
but you have to stick
your finger in his ass.

756
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,510
Do you don't have the
balls and Jimmy goes,

757
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,470
what?

758
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,130
I don't have a fuck.

759
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,500
Fuck you shut the fuck.

760
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,000
Yay.

761
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,561
I like that.

762
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:48,850
Like she gives a shit,

763
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,400
right?

764
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,770
Like,

765
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,340
Hey guy,

766
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,420
I mean a little something here.

767
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,500
I understand wanting to get laid,

768
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,080
but the stick your
finger in my fucking ass.

769
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,680
I go,

770
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:55,981
I go,

771
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:56,850
here's the problem.

772
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,550
I've got to tell us otherwise we're gay.

773
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,360
I told everyone in the world,

774
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,110
he sold a half a million
people on the podcast.

775
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,351
Hey,

776
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:04,771
you know what?

777
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:05,370
There it is.

778
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,761
I told,

779
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,020
I told my friends in New York,

780
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,890
we told the story.

781
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,723
They went like this.

782
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,970
My buddy like Jared McFadden,

783
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,130
they,

784
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,281
they,

785
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:10,511
they,

786
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,030
they had their hands in their pocket.

787
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,480
They listen.

788
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,313
They just went,

789
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,280
fuck this,

790
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,320
turn around and walk the

791
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,773
talk to me,

792
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,090
shaking their head in a bad mood.

793
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,291
I was like,

794
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:22,920
Hey,

795
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,480
can I fly in Jimmy out here?

796
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,293
Yes.

797
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,350
The next time you do the podcast,

798
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,330
let's schedule it in like
three or four weeks from now,

799
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:31,700
somewhere before thanksgiving.

800
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:32,070
I love it.

801
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,420
You come out to do the podcast,

802
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,580
we'll fly Jimmy out from
New York if he can do it.

803
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,810
But by the way,

804
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,130
Jimmy and I had so much fun in New York.

805
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,710
I was just thinking about how we used
to pick up girls by posing as doctors.

806
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,573
Remember that?

807
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,353
Oh Dude.

808
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,360
Sitting there drinking all your lines.

809
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,110
I said,

810
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,251
oh,

811
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:48,710
so he lives,

812
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,320
he saved.

813
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,411
Oh,

814
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,400
so you do like I'm a doctor and yeah,

815
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
but we'd set up like this.

816
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,630
A lot of times we set out like this,

817
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:54,990
you,

818
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,420
me and my buddy and Jimmy be over there
drinking a beer at the end of the bar.

819
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,370
It's worked fucking every time.

820
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,000
Every time.

821
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,451
And you know,

822
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,540
we'd be in there like a couple of years.

823
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,490
We find really hot girls.

824
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,180
I come up and go,

825
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,780
excuse me,

826
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,441
sorry to bother you.

827
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,560
Girls were doctors and my buddy just said,

828
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,560
and he's a great surgeon,

829
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,330
but he just lost his first patient.

830
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,210
He's really bummed out if you guys went
over there and just talk to them and

831
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:13,710
make them see it and feel so much better.

832
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,550
And they'd be like,

833
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,510
he's a surgeon.

834
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,140
They're like,

835
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,381
yeah,

836
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:18,090
we're all surgeons and
if you talk to a girl,

837
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,170
and she was actually a doctor.

838
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,110
Well,

839
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,350
how about the girl was asking you
a medical advice and you felt bad.

840
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:23,184
You had to come clean.

841
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,070
I felt horrible.

842
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:26,280
Hey,

843
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,830
she's asking him and medical advice
and he starts giving her like general

844
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,664
advice,

845
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,870
not me,

846
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,151
man.

847
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,421
I mean,

848
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,100
I fucking stuck to the end and I was like,

849
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:35,851
I'm getting laid.

850
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:36,380
I don't give you shit.

851
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,020
Back to makeup.

852
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,060
Showed the line while
your plasma rich plates.

853
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:39,900
I just invent shit.

854
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,880
I was a fucking idiot.

855
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,340
You then 30 30 30 a grown man.

856
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:48,174
That's how old I was.

857
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,230
Then we pretend we'd,

858
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,720
then we'd recognize each
other like I come up and go.

859
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,411
I like,

860
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,730
we'd sit right next to the hottest
girls in the club or something.

861
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,260
I'd go,

862
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,590
Dude,

863
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,221
you've got to just tell you,

864
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,570
I saw your movie at Sundance.

865
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,760
You're in fucking [inaudible].

866
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:00,990
You are.

867
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,310
You're doing dineros in
your next little bit,

868
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:02,451
right?

869
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:02,820
Yeah.

870
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,800
Well actually he's directing it.

871
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,431
Oh fuck.

872
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:09,270
Congratulations on such an amazing actor.

873
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,463
Bryan County.

874
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,021
I had a film there too.

875
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:13,854
I don't know if you saw it,

876
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,993
Leland,

877
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,850
what's the name of the fucking thing?

878
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,720
Dude,

879
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,030
it worked every time because
they remodel actresses.

880
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:21,720
They're like,

881
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,260
hey,

882
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,850
you know I,

883
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,461
and I'd go like this.

884
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:23,790
I go,

885
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,630
I'm sorry these girls with you,

886
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:25,560
can I buy you guys a drink?

887
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:26,070
And they like,

888
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,340
actually I was brilliant.

889
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,363
That's so simple.

890
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,683
Right in,

891
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,893
we were talking,

892
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,830
it never fail.

893
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,520
When you a normal looking guy,

894
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:40,050
you got to fucking use your mind
and you've got to be a higher,

895
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,440
higher tending to be
famous and getting that,

896
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,400
oh this is an important use grace and
we out of fight suit glocal Jimmy Burke.

897
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,600
We have to do that anymore.

898
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,150
Chicks,

899
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,350
you just Google your name.

900
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,140
Did we up there fucking
giant android screen and go?

901
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:56,381
Yeah.

902
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,700
It doesn't say shit about you.

903
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,940
How about telling how bad of a
fucking movie at Sundance and liar.

904
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,741
It is weird singing.

905
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:03,010
You hang out with different people though.

906
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,170
Cause it seems like certain
people you act different,

907
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,470
you know,

908
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,390
like you're more silly.

909
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,280
Or when you're with the league,

910
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,440
I mean I'm a chameleon mean like
my sister who calls me a chameleon,

911
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,690
you know what my buddy happening,

912
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:14,710
Tampax has said about me.

913
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:15,130
He goes,

914
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,120
you know Brian Walks,

915
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,130
if Brian walks,

916
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,660
it takes a walk with
seven Cherokees when he,

917
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,260
well you know what comes back a Cherokees.

918
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,130
It's like ah fuck.

919
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,470
It's true that I had to be that way.

920
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,420
It's a kid I had to plan in when I moved.

921
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,730
Moved here is very unique.

922
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,750
I mean it's not like,

923
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,350
you know,

924
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,591
you're,

925
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,460
you're very unique.

926
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,810
Bullshit.

927
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,580
I try to be short bus unique
either your your unique dude.

928
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,593
But yeah,

929
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,750
you and I always wind up with caveman
conversations that I always go fucking

930
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,930
right to the bottom of a man's soul
to what we think about violence and

931
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,970
sexuality and you know,

932
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:56,230
all this fucking societies and illusion
and what happens when it crumbles down,

933
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,670
that fucking guy is going to fall apart.

934
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,480
But that's what I hear.

935
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,690
You and I have always had this
friendship where like where,

936
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:02,381
no matter what,

937
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:03,460
if we're lying to each other,

938
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,270
like if we're just,

939
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,770
we're like,

940
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,300
if we just don't want to deal
with the truth right now,

941
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,510
we'll just start saying something like,

942
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,380
and like I would be like,

943
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,131
I really love her.

944
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:09,964
And he'd be like,

945
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,780
Hey,

946
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,490
who are you fucking talking to now?

947
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:12,911
You're down.

948
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:13,181
I'm like,

949
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:13,990
but I live with her.

950
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah.

951
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,280
So what,

952
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,380
you don't love her break
up with her immediately.

953
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:17,680
You know,

954
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,470
I could never get away.

955
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,560
We can never really get away
with like lying to each other.

956
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,191
You know,

957
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:23,980
you were just too good of a friend to
have these crazy girls who were there.

958
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,960
And when I say crazy girls put folks,

959
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,250
I'm not an invasive sort of a a
friend when it comes to friends,

960
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:30,791
girlfriends,

961
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,460
like Brian can tell you I'm,

962
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,580
I'm usually a pretty supportive,

963
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,400
right when you say Brian Korea.

964
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,651
Yeah,

965
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,101
absolutely.

966
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:38,560
And I did it a lot of crazy girls
and he stayed a lot of crazy girls.

967
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,933
No Fun.

968
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,280
But my take on it was always
just be sweet to them,

969
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,210
be nice to him,

970
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,710
fuck the shit out of them.

971
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:45,401
And if they leave,

972
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:45,940
they leave.

973
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,081
Right.

974
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:46,914
You know that's how you go.

975
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,860
But with you,

976
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,160
you had a totally different kind of
crazy and developed an addiction.

977
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,090
You had a fascination with girls
who were gigantic problems.

978
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,300
Yeah.

979
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,010
Brian's girls are sweet girls.

980
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,000
They just,

981
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,140
what happens in life?

982
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,270
You'd take a left when he should,

983
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:01,090
should've taken a ride.

984
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,841
You get stuck.

985
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,651
You can't pay your rent.

986
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,660
There's a lot of shit that
happens to people in life.

987
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,830
So he's dealing with essentially
sweet girls that go down a bad track.

988
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,810
Your dealing with fucking crazy people
where you can lose your fucking house.

989
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,090
Oh,

990
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,030
not just lose your house,

991
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,371
your life,

992
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:16,204
your life.

993
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,020
You had,

994
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,040
he had a few of them,

995
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,311
man,

996
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,260
where he would bring over like it was,

997
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,610
it was like Joe Lewis,

998
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,660
his bum of the month club,

999
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,590
who's great,

1000
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,770
bring over all these new silly
bitches that he was dating.

1001
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,540
One of them I called bunch of naps.

1002
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,030
How she read it.

1003
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,960
She came over.

1004
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:33,390
I met her cookies.

1005
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,671
Yeah.

1006
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:34,740
She comes over and I go,

1007
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:35,370
they check neat.

1008
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,090
It looks like she needs a bunch of naps.

1009
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:37,691
Right.

1010
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:40,120
And then 10 minutes into
hanging out at my house,

1011
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,571
Oh my God,

1012
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:41,351
I'm so tired.

1013
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,350
She takes her shoes off
and curls up on the couch,

1014
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,460
was a fucking cash.

1015
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,911
I literally,

1016
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,241
she was like,

1017
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:50,390
having owning a high tech
patch was so string love.

1018
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:51,170
She's my pet.

1019
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,310
It was so strange.

1020
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:53,750
I have never met like,

1021
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,380
uh,

1022
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,360
more cat,

1023
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:56,690
like human rights.

1024
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,410
I've never met a person who just like
had no desire to have an intelligent

1025
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,101
conversation,

1026
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,060
just wanted to take naps.

1027
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,680
I talked to this guy and this,

1028
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:04,280
this fucking,

1029
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,020
I talked to this awesome dude who's a,

1030
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,460
who's a well known,

1031
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,010
um,

1032
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,840
like uh,

1033
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,673
uh,

1034
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,590
like a,

1035
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,170
a psychiatrist's his phd.

1036
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,891
He's really smart guy.

1037
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,530
And he said a lot of times
people in relationships,

1038
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,290
like he works with a lot of like
couples and stuff like that.

1039
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,460
And then addicts and stuff.

1040
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:19,920
He said,

1041
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,271
and he said,

1042
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:25,271
a lot of times what human beings do
is we apply a construct on someone.

1043
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,721
So they'll,

1044
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:30,170
you'll find somebody that looks the part
and then you just apply a construct.

1045
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:30,621
You just go,

1046
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:30,950
oh,

1047
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,820
that's who you are.

1048
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,683
You're this girl.

1049
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,890
You really like to work out.

1050
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,131
Yeah.

1051
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,340
You're the j crew girl on,

1052
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,600
on,

1053
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:35,901
on,

1054
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:36,591
on a fucking,

1055
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:37,550
on the front of a sail boat.

1056
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,670
That's what I want to date me.

1057
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,231
While the girl was like,

1058
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,430
I'm from fucking Michigan,

1059
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:43,310
I never been on a sample of my fucking
life and I like to do drugs every day.

1060
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,144
What are you talking about?

1061
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,450
No,

1062
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,283
you know,

1063
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,770
why were you trying to construct the,

1064
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:49,650
that's sort of a,

1065
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:52,520
a really non realistic
reality though all the time.

1066
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,060
I don't know,

1067
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,020
because it wasn't like,

1068
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,040
it was really strange.

1069
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,250
It's like that's the kind of behavior
that you get from people that have a hard

1070
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,210
time meeting girls.

1071
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,940
But you had no problem eating girls.

1072
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,751
It wasn't that at all.

1073
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,770
You were not shy.

1074
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,290
You're always charming
and you're always funny.

1075
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,131
So I mean,

1076
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,720
I can't remember a time where you're like,

1077
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,141
dude,

1078
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,670
I can't meet girls.

1079
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:12,230
And just tired of being alone.

1080
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,370
It was never that.

1081
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,910
It was,

1082
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,541
it was you,

1083
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,110
you know,

1084
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,810
for whatever reason would wind up getting,

1085
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,630
I can't crazy girl like this.

1086
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,630
There were so nuts,

1087
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:20,901
dude,

1088
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,700
that I was trying to figure out.

1089
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:27,701
I spent many an hour by myself thinking
about you after many of our crazy

1090
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:30,230
adventures,

1091
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,250
thinking about you going,

1092
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,170
how did this happen?

1093
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,130
How did this guy get to this state of
mind where he lets this person in his life

1094
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,510
and then he can't see that.

1095
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:39,440
I don't understand that.

1096
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,910
This is what I'm hanging out with you.

1097
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:41,390
I'm like,

1098
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,040
here's this insightful,

1099
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,821
intelligent,

1100
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:48,821
objective self deprecating guy who's
really well read and yet he's hanging

1101
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,930
around with legit methods.

1102
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,930
You were hanging around with like
scary people there were like,

1103
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:54,070
no,

1104
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,560
no,

1105
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,760
I really don't know what that was.

1106
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,230
I think part of it was just,

1107
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,740
um,

1108
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,330
I think what it was was I'd go,

1109
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,571
oh,

1110
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,940
that's a project and I
can save that person.

1111
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,310
Yeah.

1112
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,360
I think that was a lot of them.

1113
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:03,960
That was,

1114
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,050
I found that very
intriguing where I'd say,

1115
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,710
you know what?

1116
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,700
All you need is someone like me to change
your life and I know how to help you.

1117
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,210
And it took me a long time to realize
that that is the dumbest shit you can

1118
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:15,044
advocate for it.

1119
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Anybody dead fucking end or you never
want to do that shit like goodness.

1120
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:20,991
It is.

1121
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:23,930
You know you never want to
do that because you can't.

1122
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,321
You know,

1123
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:26,150
my father said something
interesting to me the other day.

1124
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:26,810
He said,

1125
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,200
look,

1126
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,580
you want to give advice to a kid?

1127
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,443
Very different.

1128
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,490
Don't ever get advice ever,

1129
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,870
ever to an adult,

1130
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,430
even if even if that can use it.

1131
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,403
I'm never doing it.

1132
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:35,901
I said,

1133
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:36,171
yeah,

1134
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:36,880
but I the guys,

1135
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,760
he's headed toward a wall.

1136
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:38,001
He goes,

1137
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:38,421
that's right.

1138
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:39,650
And they know their head into a wall.

1139
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,071
This is your dad.

1140
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:41,180
Yeah.

1141
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,600
And he said,

1142
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,890
you're your do a talk show.

1143
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,830
I got to get them on online.

1144
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,480
Yeah.

1145
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,161
You get him on the pot.

1146
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:46,350
Because one of my favorite
people in the world,

1147
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:46,980
this the greatest,

1148
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,730
does he live here?

1149
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,563
He's in a month.

1150
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,290
Why don't you get it?

1151
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,123
Can I say,

1152
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,390
can I go on with your dad?

1153
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,661
Oh,

1154
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:52,530
that'd be great.

1155
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,210
Leaves.

1156
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,371
Well,

1157
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:55,770
he's a great guy to
talk to about politics,

1158
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,360
about the state of the fucking world.

1159
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,450
I would love about everything because
he's living in a hundred countries.

1160
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,171
Oh Jesus.

1161
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:04,860
He's going to Italy right now just
to brush up on his Italian and my,

1162
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,400
why are you doing it?

1163
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,770
He goes,

1164
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,300
I dunno.

1165
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm going to Rome for three weeks.

1166
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,690
Wow.

1167
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:08,861
He,

1168
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:09,451
he was the greatest.

1169
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:10,840
He said a sock and he was like,

1170
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,240
uh.

1171
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,180
We were talking about like having a,

1172
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,860
you know when,

1173
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,330
when you're with a woman you want to be
able to talk to her and sometimes you

1174
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:15,431
can,

1175
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:16,264
he goes talk to her.

1176
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,371
What would you want to talk to her?

1177
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,720
I've been married to
your mother for 50 years.

1178
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,280
I want to talk to her and I'm not going.

1179
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,090
It's ridiculous.

1180
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:21,631
You've got to work.

1181
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,530
You've got to fucking work.

1182
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,933
My stupid,

1183
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,350
it was so great.

1184
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:26,370
He's such a bottom,

1185
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,840
bottom line guy and has read everything,

1186
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,640
but it's also just a real man,

1187
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,190
you know,

1188
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,541
a real,

1189
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:33,991
a real flood.

1190
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:35,170
Sounds like a fun guy to talk to him.

1191
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,540
He's more of those.

1192
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,900
I call them every day when I needed it.

1193
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,220
When I,

1194
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,320
when I want to talk about
something in the news or saw,

1195
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,630
talk about just crazy with them.

1196
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,040
How deep do you go in the rabbit hole?

1197
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,120
As deep as it gets.

1198
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,411
Really,

1199
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:48,090
you're that guy where you can go all
the way into the rabbit hole with him.

1200
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:49,680
Like personal secrets.

1201
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,880
Fuck yes.

1202
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:51,600
Anything.

1203
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,320
Fuck yes.

1204
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,210
And be careful by the way,

1205
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,140
cause he'll fucking,

1206
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:55,440
he'll,

1207
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,950
he'll,

1208
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,970
he'll smell you.

1209
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:57,751
He'll smell.

1210
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:58,260
You're like,

1211
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,340
oh my God.

1212
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,091
Smell.

1213
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:00,460
Yeah.

1214
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,230
How about this?

1215
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,741
How about this?

1216
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:02,910
I'll give you a great story.

1217
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:03,181
Ready?

1218
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,014
Watch this.

1219
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,400
My buddy comes in,

1220
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,391
I swear to God,

1221
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:07,021
I'm with my dad,

1222
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,160
we're in my office.

1223
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,360
My buddy comes in,

1224
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,150
he just happened to be
around cause he was gonna,

1225
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,371
you know,

1226
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:12,030
he just comes in and goes,

1227
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,391
Hey Brian,

1228
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,120
how are you doing?

1229
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,560
I go,

1230
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,980
Hey,

1231
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,460
you know,

1232
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,360
let's say his name is Jeff.

1233
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,871
Hey Jeff,

1234
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:16,470
what's up?

1235
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,870
And he goes,

1236
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,960
no,

1237
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,491
I'm gonna tell you doing.

1238
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:17,760
I go,

1239
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,390
I'm good.

1240
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:18,811
And he goes,

1241
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:19,350
all right man,

1242
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,330
I love this question because
there's a couple of words.

1243
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,811
And he goes,

1244
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,111
Hey,

1245
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:23,250
Ms. Guy doing nice to meet you.

1246
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:23,820
Yay.

1247
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,870
And he just leaves.

1248
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:25,581
And My,

1249
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,190
my father,

1250
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,023
my father goes,

1251
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,373
what's that guy do?

1252
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,370
And I go,

1253
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:29,491
oh,

1254
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:29,820
he's,

1255
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,653
he's a writer.

1256
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,380
My father said,

1257
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,213
oh,

1258
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,830
I suspect that's not
going to work out for him.

1259
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,380
And I go and I go,

1260
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,090
how did you know that?

1261
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,960
Then he goes,

1262
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,340
pattern recognition.

1263
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,660
I've been around,

1264
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm 71 years old.

1265
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,100
That's how pattern rather
than Russian mission.

1266
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,130
So he's like that guy from the Bill
Ben Stiller movie where he has like the

1267
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,410
human lie detector on it.

1268
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,520
That's what he can read
you in a heartbeat,

1269
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:53,761
dude.

1270
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:54,271
He can read,

1271
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,470
he can see you walk across the street.

1272
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,580
He knows your whole fucking life.

1273
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,420
Then again,

1274
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,400
how the fuck are you so bad at that?

1275
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,210
Well,

1276
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,290
I'm actually good at it.

1277
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,430
I choose to ignore it.

1278
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,120
Really?

1279
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,421
Yes,

1280
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:04,440
I did actually.

1281
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,880
I think I'm very good at it,

1282
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,580
but when I see a project I go,

1283
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,414
hey,

1284
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,590
I need to help you.

1285
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:12,060
So you almost,

1286
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,550
well,

1287
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,210
there was a self
destructive aspect to you.

1288
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:15,660
Uh,

1289
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:15,870
the,

1290
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,940
the always disturbed me being your friend.

1291
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,070
That's what would drive me nuts,

1292
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:20,730
you know?

1293
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,300
And it was a distraction and it drives me.

1294
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,340
It hurt my career by the way.

1295
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,290
Really?

1296
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:24,670
Yeah,

1297
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,050
yeah,

1298
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,321
yeah.

1299
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:29,130
It hurt my career and it
hurt my relationships with
people that were significant

1300
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:30,180
in my life and yeah.

1301
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,410
Um,

1302
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,660
and I think a lot of that self sabotage,

1303
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:35,040
we all go through that stuff.

1304
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,000
You go through it,

1305
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:36,271
man,

1306
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:37,710
you will weigh less than,

1307
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,370
than anybody.

1308
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,310
I knew actually you were always very
good at cutting out the fat and I kept it

1309
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,440
because I wanted an excuse maybe to,

1310
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:44,980
uh,

1311
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,341
you know,

1312
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,420
I mean it was like a parachute.

1313
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:47,254
You know what I mean?

1314
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,030
I think,

1315
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,863
um,

1316
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,040
there's very few reasons in life to give
yourself more problems and if you can

1317
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:58,390
find all your own problems and address
them and try to deal with all your own

1318
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:00,580
problems and be real honest about that,

1319
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:03,820
then it makes it really easy
to see other people's problems.

1320
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,470
But I've found that in my life when I
wasn't being honest with myself about my

1321
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:09,400
own problems,

1322
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,840
when I had issues,

1323
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,760
when I had unresolved things in my mind,

1324
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,091
just went,

1325
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,080
it was a real young man.

1326
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,840
I was still growing up and trying
to get over my fucked up childhood.

1327
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,030
I found it much more difficult for me to
see problems in other people because of

1328
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:22,231
the,

1329
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:25,060
the shield that I put on
recognizing my own issues.

1330
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,620
I wasn't as intuitive or insightful when
it came to recognizing other people.

1331
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,860
As I get older and I became as
honest as is humanly possible,

1332
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,240
which is how I am now,

1333
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:37,990
um,

1334
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,380
now,

1335
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,200
then it became where I
just see it everywhere.

1336
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,300
That became really obvious.

1337
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,200
That's what I have now become obsessed
with and that's why I don't suffer fools

1338
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:47,531
anymore.

1339
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:48,220
Like that's why,

1340
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,910
because what I'm,

1341
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,220
what I'm very interested
in is figuring out,

1342
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,940
I want to stay as undiluted as I can
and as authentic when I was watching

1343
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,500
Springsteen,

1344
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,020
but I,

1345
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,540
the word that kept popping into
my head was just authentic.

1346
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,950
He's never lying.

1347
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:00,910
It's everything about him,

1348
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,691
the way he dresses,

1349
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,480
the way everything about it
and nothing is in his way.

1350
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:08,140
There's no resistance is why you can do
a back bend and touch his head at 62.

1351
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,511
Why,

1352
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:08,711
why?

1353
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:09,970
He could literally back Ben,

1354
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,800
he went all the way back and hit his head.

1355
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,330
He can,

1356
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,163
he can run.

1357
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,110
He's 62.

1358
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,003
That's amazing.

1359
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,903
On stage,

1360
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,481
on stage,

1361
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,130
on lot back then at 62.

1362
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,570
And I went and I went,

1363
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,820
that guy is so out of his own way.

1364
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,361
You know,

1365
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,171
I've said this before,

1366
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:24,160
maybe on the podcast,

1367
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:27,470
but it's one of my favorite metaphors
that Michelangelo said when he was Clark.

1368
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,313
He says name.

1369
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,400
I mean when,

1370
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,131
when we got last week,

1371
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:30,641
I'm sorry guys,

1372
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,474
I speak Thai.

1373
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,070
Uh,

1374
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,311
sorry.

1375
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,000
There are no girls here.

1376
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,833
Okay,

1377
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:35,411
sorry.

1378
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:35,830
Sorry.

1379
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,663
When Michelangelo,

1380
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,360
uh,

1381
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,750
said,

1382
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,931
uh,

1383
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:42,760
when he carved the David The statue of
David and he had this piece of marble and

1384
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,271
he said,

1385
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:44,710
and this is a great metaphor for art,

1386
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,071
he said,

1387
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,360
it's already in there.

1388
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,490
I just had to get all
this shit out of the way.

1389
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,331
And he said,

1390
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,220
that's how you should look
at yourself as a human being.

1391
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,430
You're born and you acquire
a lot of shit as you're,

1392
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:55,600
as you're growing up,

1393
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:55,960
right?

1394
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,830
So as you grow up,

1395
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,120
a lot of Shit's put on you,

1396
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,200
uh,

1397
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,070
your family,

1398
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:00,550
uh,

1399
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,630
how they define you,

1400
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:02,051
what they,

1401
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:03,070
what they do to you.

1402
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,520
Uh,

1403
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,271
PA school,

1404
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:04,811
high school,

1405
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:05,890
the trauma of school,

1406
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,270
the grief you go through,

1407
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,511
you know,

1408
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,920
your body is and what you wanted to do,

1409
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,320
those losses and stuff and
you put on a lot of stuff,

1410
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:11,790
you,

1411
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,020
you,

1412
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,660
you come to the world when you're ready
to take it on at 30 with a whole lot of

1413
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:17,680
fucking baggage.

1414
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,360
And a lot of it's negative,

1415
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,320
you know,

1416
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,460
and the,

1417
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,670
the job then is to figure out a
way to get that stuff off you,

1418
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,280
to shed that stuff and get
back to who you really are,

1419
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,440
the authentic you.

1420
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,700
And that to me is at least as a comic
and as somebody who writes and stuff,

1421
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:37,030
that's,

1422
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,500
that's all I think about now.

1423
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,111
You know,

1424
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:39,891
what is,

1425
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,800
what is how honest can I
truly be with my expression,

1426
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,800
even if I'm being silly and like
talking about saving a whale,

1427
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,230
there's a lot of me in there that I'm,

1428
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm talking about,

1429
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,000
you know,

1430
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,220
and especially now the stuff
that I'm working on now,

1431
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:52,491
just,

1432
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,240
you know,

1433
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,140
being a father and things like that and
that responsibility and what that really

1434
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,980
means and,

1435
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:58,700
and,

1436
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,061
and,

1437
00:32:59,061 --> 00:32:59,270
uh,

1438
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,410
with my daughter and,

1439
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,870
and not being able to
show up her a part of me,

1440
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,501
uh,

1441
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:03,701
and,

1442
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:04,191
and who,

1443
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:04,821
who I want,

1444
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:05,720
she's gonna model the men.

1445
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,190
She dates after me,

1446
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,840
so I gotta be a fucking,

1447
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,560
I got to be the,

1448
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,670
I gotta be her hero.

1449
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,650
I got to be the guy that she actually,

1450
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:15,050
I don't want to Dayton
the guy I used to be,

1451
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,363
you know what I mean?

1452
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,060
So there's all those responsibilities
that you start taking on as you get older.

1453
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,800
But so much of that is,

1454
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,720
and so much of fucking thought,

1455
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,141
you know,

1456
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:24,870
but I've got to think,

1457
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,740
they act like it's an active process.

1458
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Thinking and being creative is actually
learning what not to think about because

1459
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:35,660
the rest of it comes to it.

1460
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:36,171
There's the dead.

1461
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:36,450
That's a,

1462
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,820
that's a real philosophy.

1463
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:42,821
If you can open yourself up and think of
thinking as being more of a channel for

1464
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:45,500
what's available to you,

1465
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,080
that that's a very important distinction.

1466
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,333
This notion that,

1467
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,660
that see a lot of people come and say,

1468
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:50,931
well,

1469
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,070
I'm missing something.

1470
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm missing something that
I have to add to my arsenal.

1471
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,723
No.

1472
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,211
In fact,

1473
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,440
what you're probably doing is there's,

1474
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,010
there's something you've got to let
go of and when you let go of that,

1475
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,130
you'll get what you're looking for
or you'll find that that that's a,

1476
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:06,540
that's a fundamental difference
in thinking about thing.

1477
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,910
And I think a lot of times we're taught,

1478
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,863
hey,

1479
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,291
you,

1480
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,340
you're missing something.

1481
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,900
You got to add to your year.

1482
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,760
You got to put another
Arrow in your quiver.

1483
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,871
In fact,

1484
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:15,690
you might have the,

1485
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:15,850
the,

1486
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,683
the uh,

1487
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,120
better,

1488
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,250
better advice may maybe to say,

1489
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,930
you got to let some stuff go,

1490
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:21,350
man.

1491
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,610
You're holding on to some stuff.

1492
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,750
You've got to let some stuff go.

1493
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,260
You're still defining yourself along
lines that are not helpful to you.

1494
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,250
You're still,

1495
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,830
you still have people in your
life that are not your friends,

1496
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:32,150
even though they seem like they are,

1497
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,420
you still have,

1498
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
you're still doing a job that you
hate because it's an excuse to not do,

1499
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,640
not go for what you really want.

1500
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,350
There are a lot of things
that you should be deleting.

1501
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,590
You should be taking out of your life and,

1502
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:44,921
and,

1503
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:48,920
and then there will be room for
something that's much better.

1504
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,560
That's a,

1505
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,331
that's a very,

1506
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:52,130
it's a scary way to think of it,

1507
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,740
but I don't think we
talk about that enough.

1508
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,560
Okay.
