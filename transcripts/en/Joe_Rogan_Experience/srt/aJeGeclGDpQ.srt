1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,270
Okay.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,103
Hey everybody,

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,093
what's up?

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,563
How are Ya?

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,480
I don't eat too many people to answer,

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,180
but,

7
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,570
uh,

8
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,650
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by Ting Ting

9
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:17,950
is a cell phone company that we've had
sponsor our podcasts for quite a while

10
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,790
and we've had nothing
but positive reviews.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,080
I think that's one of the most important
things about when you have a podcast.

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,531
I mean,

13
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:26,660
what,

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:26,951
what did,

15
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:27,731
what does a podcast,

16
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:29,980
just people talking and having a
conversation and talking about shit.

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,240
It's entertainment whenever it is.

18
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,070
If you have an add on it,

19
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:34,120
it gets really tricky.

20
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,560
Like you have to make sure
that whatever you're using,

21
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,300
whatever you're endorsing,

22
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,620
it's gotta be legit.

23
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,520
And,

24
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,701
uh,

25
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:46,570
one of the nicest things is when you have
a podcast sponsor and you get positive

26
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:47,051
feedback.

27
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:50,050
So I thank you for that
feedback and I don't,

28
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,640
I even the negative stuff,

29
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,210
I don't mind it.

30
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,930
It's important this having this open
loop like that with people is huge.

31
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,350
Everyone that I've turned on a Tang
has said that it saved the money.

32
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,980
So what Tim does is they
use this sprint backbone,

33
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,713
excuse me.

34
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,430
So they have a really good cell phone
network and then they do it their way.

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,410
They do it without contracts.

36
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,011
They deal,

37
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:13,600
you can cancel at anytime.

38
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,310
It's a mobile company that makes sense.

39
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:17,200
A No B s mobile company,

40
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,590
they don't have early termination fees.

41
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:22,030
They don't have bundling.

42
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:22,780
No bullshit.

43
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,010
Really simple.

44
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,750
You pay for what you use.

45
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,411
It's cheap.

46
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:30,520
98% of people would save
money if they use Tang.

47
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,390
That's legit.

48
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,170
Um,

49
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,951
Chris Ryan,

50
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:37,951
who's a good friend and I'm doing him
and Duncan Trussell are an eye or doing a

51
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,370
podcast tomorrow together.

52
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,590
Chris a switched over to
Tang and he fucking loves it.

53
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:41,981
He was like,

54
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,090
because it's so much cheaper.

55
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,170
Red Vans switched over and saved a
shitload of money when he was in Canada.

56
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,311
It's a sweet,

57
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:48,701
sweet,

58
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:53,701
sweet cell phone company and you could
save 25 bucks if you go to rogan.ting.com

59
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,480
save 25 bucks off.

60
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,950
They're super sweet android phones.

61
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,330
They use all the top of the line.

62
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,051
Android phones,

63
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,520
like the HTC one,

64
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,290
the Samsung Galaxy note.

65
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,970
The note three is,

66
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:04,360
what's the one?

67
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,830
The one that I have the uh,

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,040
s for all really sweet devices.

69
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,470
Uh,

70
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,450
you missed nothing.

71
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,770
rogan.ting.com we're also
brought to you by hover.

72
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,040
Hover is a domain name company.

73
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,430
It's actually the domain
name company that I use.

74
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,480
They have an awesome online interface.

75
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,770
It's super intuitive,

76
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,620
really easy to use and it's a,

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,070
it's owned by the same people that own
Tang and they have the same sort of

78
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:33,904
philosophy,

79
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,510
give people a good product
and don't rip them off.

80
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,540
It's possible like you can have a,

81
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,550
a frictionless relationship between the
people who have things like hover and

82
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,770
the people who need things like us.

83
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
And if you're looking for a domain name,

84
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,503
you look into register,

85
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,850
don't domain name you,

86
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,000
you cannot do better than hover.

87
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,510
They also have free who
is domain name privacy,

88
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,040
which it should be.

89
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,850
I mean that should be standard
but it was in the beginning.

90
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,751
However,

91
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,751
make sure it is awesome website and
again by the same people that run ting,

92
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,350
I have my stuff registered there and
if you need to register anything there,

93
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,190
they also can set it up for you.

94
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:19,750
We can move domain names if you have
it registered somewhere else and you're

95
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,030
like,

96
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,720
I don't like what these people do or
you got to put on some mailing lists or

97
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,760
some crazy shit thing happened.

98
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,840
Things happen folks.

99
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,540
But Hover always been there for me.

100
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,190
Uh,

101
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,411
I've,

102
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,060
I've enjoyed hover for a long time.

103
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,660
Um,

104
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,260
we have new promo codes for
Heather for hover for this episode.

105
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,780
So we're going to have different
ones for different episodes.

106
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,630
I guess the trying to figure out like
which episodes were more effective.

107
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,770
Target Marketing,

108
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,750
ladies and gentlemen for this episode,

109
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,950
it's the word powerful.

110
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,090
So go and use the word powerful
and save some money at hover.

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,481
Again,

112
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,081
I endorse him,

113
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:52,180
I use him and as I endorsed Tang,

114
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,200
same cell phone company or same company
that owns a cell phone company also owns

115
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:56,920
hover.

116
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,131
Uh,

117
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:01,150
you can try 30 days of Google apps
on your domain for free at hover.

118
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,080
And see if you like it.

119
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,910
There's a lot of really
cool things about hover.

120
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,200
Go check it out,

121
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,640
be one with it and use
the code word powerful who

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,983
do much coffee.

123
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,130
We're also brought to you by Onnit Dotcom.

124
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,003

Yeah,

00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,630
that's right on it.

127
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,860

We've got a lot of cool things.

129
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,750

Strength and conditioning equipment.

Essentially what ANA is,

135

human optimization website.

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,180
And uh,

169
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,140
when I first met you,

170
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,490
one of the first things I said was like,

171
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:36,990
this motherfucker needs his own
podcast because you can just talk,

172
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,360
nobody can spit out information.

173
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:39,991
Like I've never,

174
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:40,441
I've,

175
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,540
I've been alive for 46 years.

176
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,710
Never met a guy who can spit out as
much impressive information as you that

177
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:47,011
quickly,

178
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,420
when it comes to like the body,

179
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
it's my escape at home.

180
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:51,870
I have four women.

181
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,460
So who gets to talk at home,

182
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,300
right?

183
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,840
Not me.

184
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,201
Yeah.

185
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,580
It's so outside the world.

186
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,130
I get to share what I do

187
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,961
inside.

188
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:00,890
You get shutdown,

189
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,730
I get shut down.

190
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,360
Wow.

191
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,090
But you have a lot of information,

192
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:05,421
dude.

193
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,440
Every time I talked to you,

194
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:10,650
I wish I had like a notebook or what show
was recording it because I always try

195
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:12,110
to remember as much as possible.

196
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,910
And you've given me some great
advice as far as you know,

197
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,740
health and fitness and exercise and all
sorts of different things that you know

198
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:19,011
about.

199
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,230
But I always walk away
from every conversation,

200
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:21,381
you know,

201
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,640
I know I forgot something.

202
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,670
I know I didn't remember something
like the last time we were talking,

203
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,280
you were telling me about some shit that
helps your liver after you drank and

204
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,090
you take this,

205
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,923
what is this?

206
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,590
What is it?

207
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,281
Unbelievable.

208
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,590
Glutathione pulled that thing closer
to your face so people hear you better.

209
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,631
Glutathione,

210
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,040
glutathione and that,

211
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,510
that,

212
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,040
that helps your liver
when you drink alcohol.

213
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,030
Well it helps you with just about
anything that delivers responsible for,

214
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,113
um,

215
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,440
digesting or metabolizing as
you metabolize certain drugs,

216
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,580
chemicals and so forth.

217
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,070
The liver uses up its ability to,

218
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,640
um,

219
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,680
continue the process so it spills over
into the blood and that's how you get,

220
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,030
uh,

221
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,270
you know,

222
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,390
drunk because your liver can
only deal with a certain amount.

223
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:05,870
So if you replenish or replace
the glutathione in the liver,

224
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,610
you get an incredible benefits of it.

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Not only does it help with metabolism,

226
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,460
but it's an incredible antioxidant for
the brain and for the eyes and for the

227
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,294
heart.

228
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,230
What does it made out of?

229
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,480
It's three amino acids that are together.

230
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,380
It's in our body,

231
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:23,270
but we don't have enough of it to really
generate the metabolism that we need if

232
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:24,104
we're drinking.

233
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,220
And where do they get that?

234
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,180
Where did they get glued at time?

235
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,420
Cause I know Dave Asprey
really into that stuff too.

236
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,560
The version of it's manufactured,

237
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,521
but how do they make it,

238
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:31,910
what is it?

239
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,181
Oh,

240
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,460
it's three amino acids that
they've put together and um,

241
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,050
the products that we interact with our,

242
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,620
um,

243
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,090
it's a delivery technology.

244
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,750
We're you wrap the vitamins or your wrap,

245
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,730
the supplement in a what's
called the Lyposomal,

246
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,770
which is like a cell wall from lecithin
is from soy and it protects whatever it

247
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:56,690
is that you're ingesting because
a lot of the things that you take,

248
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:58,130
like I think I shared with you,

249
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,310
if you take a thousand
milligrams of vitamin C by mouth,

250
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,090
you only absorb 19% the rest of it is
destroyed by the acid that's in the

251
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:05,870
stomach.

252
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,690
But if you wrap it in this
protection called the light basalt,

253
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,110
you'll be able to absorb 93% so
taking something like glutathione,

254
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:17,480
which normally when you take
it in in its natural form,

255
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:18,360
it's destroyed.

256
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,890
Most of it is destroyed and then absorbed
and then re manufactured in the blood.

257
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,740
But if you wrap it in this
protective outer coating,

258
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,574
it Lyposomal,

259
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,270
you can absorb it more readily and
their effects are unbelievably positive.

260
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,290
For instance,

261
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,170
a gentleman who uh,

262
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,380
went out drinking three high balls
and five shots of Tequila went home in

263
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,880
subsequently was very dizzy,

264
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,714
nauseous.

265
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,990
He forgot that I gave them a sample of
this gludethyon in east used four puffs

266
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,170
under the tongue,

267
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,990
held it for 30 seconds
and then 30 minutes later,

268
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,830
clear as a bell.

269
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,700
Woke up the next day,

270
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,690
went out partying again.

271
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:51,470
Couldn't get drunk.

272
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,303
Wow.

273
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,980
That sounds like nonsense.

274
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,801
It isn't nine.

275
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,130
So wish

276
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,720
I was smart enough to
call you on your bullshit.

277
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,850
I talked to my office.

278
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,110
Erin will tell you everything.

279
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,611
That sounds crazy.

280
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:03,630
Maybe that guy was lying.

281
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,480
Maybe it wasn't that drunk drugs.

282
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,650
If I told you who it was,

283
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:08,041
you would know.

284
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,760
He's a hammer.

285
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,593
Hammer fist.

286
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,530
He knows how to throw him down.

287
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,730
He knows how to throw him down while
you're giving people some false hope,

288
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,051
man.

289
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:15,460
You tell him,

290
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,670
take glue to tie on and don't
worry about the drinking.

291
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,061
Well,

292
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,391
no,

293
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,470
everything in moderation.

294
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,640
But if you go across that line,

295
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,650
you need to have something
to fall back onto.

296
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,820
I need to try that now,

297
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:26,430
but I don't want to get drunk enough
to try it and I'm scared to get drunk

298
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,090
enough to try it.

299
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,830
But,

300
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,460
but it sounds like a strange thing to try.

301
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:29,851
You know,

302
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:30,684
for years,

303
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,100
you know,

304
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,280
I take the kids to Mexico every year and
I take a bottle of Scotch with me and I

305
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:38,310
sit and read a book and drink to Scotch
over a period of a couple hours and I

306
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,480
turn the bottles empty.

307
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,150
My kids go and get you some
mosquitoes and I continued drinking.

308
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,133
I don't get drunk.

309
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,920
It turned out that one of the products
that I was taking had a very high amount

310
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,210
of reduced glutathione in it.

311
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,690
So when I got exposed to
the glutathione world,

312
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,450
which was just last year with
a doctor Christopher shade,

313
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,100
who's one of the gurus in
the area of Glutathione,

314
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,950
a technology and absorption,

315
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,390
um,

316
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,950
he introduced it to me and it made
sense reading the literature on how it

317
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:05,910
functions in the liver.

318
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,510
That's pretty fascinating.

319
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,370
There's also the
dehydration that comes from,

320
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,110
from alcohol consumption.

321
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,640
What's the mechanism behind that?

322
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,260
Alcohol's a diuretic.

323
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,380
It causes you to go to the bathroom and
since you used all those colorful words

324
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:19,831
earlier,

325
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:20,521
I'll use the word,

326
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:21,354
it makes you pee,

327
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:21,901
right?

328
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,680
Of course.

329
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,640
You mean like bad words?

330
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,500
I use bad.

331
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,920
Come on.

332
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
I was going to interrupt you and say,

333
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,560
you can say those words on this,

334
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,350
just the Internet.

335
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,501
Well,

336
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:32,520
it shouldn't be that way.

337
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:32,670
I mean,

338
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,560
if you and I were sitting down
just having a conversation,

339
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,150
we would talk like to normal people.

340
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:36,930
It's not,

341
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,591
we're not vulgar,

342
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,550
awful people,

343
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,770
but occasionally the word
fuck is the right word.

344
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,401
Absolutely.

345
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,181
It's the right word.

346
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,160
In about every tense of
the English language.

347
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,810
We robbed of that freedom by television
because people were pretending by not

348
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:49,980
saying fuck on television,

349
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,360
that people don't say fucking real life.

350
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,760
So you're never going to really
believe what you see on television.

351
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,730
There's always going to be this bridge
that you're not willing to cross over

352
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:57,900
because these people never swear.

353
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,910
It's silly where the same people,

354
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:00,960
we're all the same people.

355
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,560
People that say fuck to people that
don't say you don't like to say it.

356
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,403
Don't say it,

357
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,580
but it's not a big deal.

358
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:05,971
Thank you,

359
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:06,804
George Carlin.

360
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,460
Jesus Christ.

361
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,380
It should have been figured
out a long time ago,

362
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:10,980
but it's not.

363
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,341
So yeah,

364
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:11,701
you could say,

365
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,630
find your retentive.

366
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,860
Well,

367
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,240
I use words like anal
retentive instead of assholes.

368
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,900
You know,

369
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,250
that's not a good word.

370
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,730
It isn't.

371
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,080
Okay,

372
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,913
fine.

373
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,090
We're dead to me is a
totally different thing.

374
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,450
Culberson and ass off.

375
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,560
They're just fucking like
to clean their hands anyway.

376
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,660
Alcohol has a couple
of things that it does.

377
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:28,830
Alcohol is a sugar.

378
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,120
So what happens is it causes your blood
sugar to go up and then drop because

379
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:37,530
insulin's turned on and you
become irritable because
you need sugar to run the

380
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,364
brain.

381
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:38,910
Uh,

382
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,260
and then dehydration,

383
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:41,310
you need hydration.

384
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,350
Is that why people get
hungry for pancakes?

385
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,563
Maple Syrup.

386
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,530
You want that syrup,

387
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,040
butter and Maple Syrup
and the Morgan carbs.

388
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,260
The better brain food.

389
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,160
Brain food.

390
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:54,760
Yeah.

391
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,890
The more carbs the better for
the brain after you drink.

392
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:57,130
Right?

393
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,090
It's a diuretic.

394
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:01,870
It's a dehydrator and it's a
hypoglycemic drops your blood sugar.

395
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,130
It's an Amino suppressant too,

396
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:03,460
right?

397
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,930
It is itch actually.

398
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,550
It shuts off growth hormone production.

399
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,181
Yeah.

400
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:07,841
It's not good,

401
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,501
but damn.

402
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,640
Why does it make things so fun?

403
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,500
I know.

404
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,710
It's what a crazy thing.

405
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,060
Something that makes us so happy for a
little while just to sell fucking and so

406
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:19,270
stupid and dangerous and
impossible to control.

407
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,370
Like that's the craziest
thing about the alcohol.

408
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,430
It's like it's impossible
to regulate how many people,

409
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:27,490
you just put it out in the market and
people drink whatever they want and if

410
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:27,750
they,

411
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,583
it's not a lot.

412
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,660
You drink a glass like this
whiskey and you're fucked.

413
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,480
What other thing do you have the,

414
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:38,260
you could just buy like that that like
literally will kill you if you drink too

415
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,360
much and you can get it everywhere.

416
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,790
It's pretty ridiculous.

417
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,480
Yeah,

418
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,470
it's unbelievable.

419
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:45,790
If you really stop and think about it,

420
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,050
I think what's even worse is the fact
that they've restricted marijuana use for

421
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:50,861
so many years.

422
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,190
When you look at the stats on
people who cause accidents,

423
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,640
I mean you're only saying this because
you didn't watch Nancy Gracie's piece

424
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,180
last night.

425
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,331
No,

426
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,790
I definitely saw Nancy
Grace's speech last night.

427
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,490
You would understand that Ma
out marijuana makes you lazy.

428
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,660
Oh you it makes you fat.

429
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,570
I've seen that and it makes you just
want to sit on the couch and eat chips.

430
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:08,470
That's what Nancy grace says.

431
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,860
One out of 300 so bad.

432
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,790
That poor sweetie.

433
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,200
She needs a pot cookie.

434
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,540
Just one of those pot
cookies and met you just go,

435
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,141
oh,

436
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,130
why was I fighting this while
some of them be like rubber feet.

437
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,630
If she could just sit back on a really
comfy couch after a pod cookie and some

438
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,650
dude was really good at it,

439
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:27,484
rubbed her feet,

440
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,211
she'd be like,

441
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,830
why was I saying that?

442
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,480
This is bad.

443
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm going to take my shoes off now.

444
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,963
Yeah,

445
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,900
Porn Nancy,

446
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,733
she needs a hug.

447
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,450
A lot of people are angry at her.

448
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,790
Not me did she needs some love.

449
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,630
She's crazy.

450
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,920
She's talking nonsense about wheat,

451
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,370
Europe,

452
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,450
big fat lady.

453
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,070
And you're talking
about people being lazy.

454
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,510
That doesn't make any sense at all.

455
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,070
And I know she's not lazy.

456
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,590
I mean,

457
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,120
she's a,

458
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,990
she was a judge.

459
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:50,590
She,

460
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:50,921
you know,

461
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:51,920
was running this TV,

462
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,260
this TV show forever.

463
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,520
Being on TV shows the hard work being
on a successful TV show for a long time.

464
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,750
That's hard fucking work,

465
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,921
but come on,

466
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,420
you're talking crazy about weed.

467
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:02,590
No one's listening to you.

468
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,580
That's nonsense.

469
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,520
You're the exact thing that
young kids want to avoid.

470
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,470
They want to avoid an angry,

471
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,650
Yeley preachy person on television who's
yelling at them and telling them some

472
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,250
shit that they know is not true.

473
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,690
It doesn't make you lazy.

474
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:17,471
If you're lazy,

475
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,850
you're already fucking lazy.

476
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,140
It has nothing to do with a weed,

477
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,790
but don't you think the kids nowadays,

478
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,240
they look,

479
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,200
they listened to that and
they say interesting and
they just do their own thing.

480
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,370
They know it's a bunch of shit.

481
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,780
I think she's just had a touch.

482
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,910
She's completely out
of touch and it's not,

483
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,911
not just that a touch foolishly ignorant
as to the consequences of what she's

484
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:36,821
saying,

485
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:37,511
because people were just going to,

486
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,980
if you really believe what you're saying,

487
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,800
you're doing it such a foolish way that
people are gonna immediately discredit

488
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,750
the message because it's coming from you.

489
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,150
The marrow ball numb makes you lazy.

490
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:48,760
Say No,

491
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,350
it doesn't stop it,

492
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,184
dummy.

493
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,880
That's a ridiculous statement.

494
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,240
Yeah.

495
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,190
And she's only saying
it because she's just,

496
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,001
she's just,

497
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:56,300
you know,

498
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,991
miss the boat.

499
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:57,710
She missed,

500
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,430
missed the Internet.

501
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,330
I think Colorado,

502
00:14:59,331 --> 00:14:59,931
Washington,

503
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:04,160
and eventually Arizona will be great
test areas to disprove all that bullshit

504
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,480
that's being said about marijuana.

505
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,350
Do you know what they're doing though?

506
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,580
It's really sneaky thing.

507
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,470
The Colorado dispensaries,

508
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,050
they have dispensary's that
they've had for a long time.

509
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,190
They had them back when I lived there,

510
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,800
but they have actual retail stores,

511
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,360
but they're not allowed
to have bank accounts.

512
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,670
So they have massive amounts of cash and
the government literally will not let

513
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,410
them put it in a federal bank.

514
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,000
They can't put it in a state bank.

515
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:26,511
They can't put it,

516
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,440
they can't put it in a bank.

517
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,690
They don't allow them
to put their business.

518
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,670
So they gotta they gotta have a safe
somewhere and put stacks of fucking paper

519
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:35,450
money.

520
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:35,890
Is this,

521
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,590
you gotta remember to count it or
like what are you talking about?

522
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,630
This is the stupidest idea ever.

523
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:41,870
You,

524
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,800
you can make money,

525
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,060
but you can't put it in a bank.

526
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,930
Here's even worse.

527
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,670
You probably heard about in
Denver where they have um,

528
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,230
uh,

529
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,180
outlets for picking up marijuana but you,

530
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,700
there's no place legally
designated to spoke it.

531
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,100
That's hilarious too.

532
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:55,761
Yeah.

533
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,470
They even have the sniff machines.

534
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,071
Have you ever seen him?

535
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:58,521
They put on,

536
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,880
they've developed these things to pick
out nanoparticles in the air and they put

537
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,541
it over their nose.

538
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,890
Like you're watching a fucking movie.

539
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,460
They're sniffing to smell.

540
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:08,150
If they could smell marijuana
from your home outside your home,

541
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,320
and if they can,

542
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,540
they will give you a ticket.

543
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,510
It's a new way to make
money with a giant electric.

544
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,410
It looks like a cartoon knows this
guy's got like a space knows on.

545
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,220
Have you seen it?

546
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,371
No,

547
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,204
I haven't seen it.

548
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,450
Well,

549
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,530
Jamie pope pull a picture.

550
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:22,040
That shit up.

551
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,700
It's hilarious.

552
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,533
Called the sniffer.

553
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,120
I don't know what the fucking
technical name for it is,

554
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,330
but they're literally standing outside
of people's houses trying to smell weed.

555
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,540
You made we legal coordinates in there.

556
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,790
We can't have a backyard party.

557
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,900
You can't pass around a joint,

558
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:38,000
the backyard or you go
have to get a ticket.

559
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,571
Come on.

560
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:39,404
Assholes.

561
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,490
That's ridiculous.

562
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,690
What's the big deal?

563
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:42,524
It smells good.

564
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,660
It's awesome.

565
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,570
Smells good.

566
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,930
It just does like there's some things
that don't smell good when they're burning

567
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,831
like cigarettes,

568
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:49,600
smell like shit.

569
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,930
You have hemp oil was legal.

570
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,970
I'd be using it on what?

571
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,103
On my body?

572
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,471
Well,

573
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:54,991
it is legal.

574
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:55,850
You can get hemp oil.

575
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:57,690
What do you mean you get detoxified him,

576
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:58,160
boy.

577
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,731
No,

578
00:16:58,731 --> 00:16:59,720
because hemp,

579
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,730
hemp oil doesn't
necessarily have THC in it.

580
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,130
It's not necessarily psychoactive.

581
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,040
It depends on whether it comes from the
hemp plant or whether it comes from the

582
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,540
female though the marijuana,

583
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,540
the marijuana is not even a real word.

584
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,690
Marijuana is the slang for
a Mexican wild tobacco.

585
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,610
That's where that word came from.

586
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,440
When the a whole Henry,

587
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,570
Harry Anslinger and
William Randolph Hearst,

588
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,220
when they were trying to
make marijuana illegal,

589
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,780
that's what they started calling it.

590
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,820
They couldn't call it cannabis.

591
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,511
There's the,

592
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,344
uh,

593
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,210
there's a thing and when
they made it illegal,

594
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:32,420
half the people in Congress didn't even
realize that they had made marijuana

595
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:32,781
illegal.

596
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:33,171
Look at that.

597
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:34,580
Notice the electronic nose.

598
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,150
It's got a compass on the end of it
and shit to tell you where the smoke is

599
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:38,661
coming from.

600
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,860
This is so stupid.

601
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,971
Look at that.

602
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:42,500
That's a giant electric piggy.

603
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,930
It's a pig with the electric piggy.

604
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,303
That's what that is.

605
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,911
And by the way,

606
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,380
you're a pig if that's what you do.

607
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,080
If you stand in front of people's houses
with a fucking electronic sniffer,

608
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,230
not even your own nose,

609
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,243
you're a pig.

610
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,940
You're trying to arrest them because
they're smoking something that's now legal

611
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,721
inside their house,

612
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:58,890
but they left a window open.

613
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,843
You're a pig.

614
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,773
That's a pig.

615
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,713
So disgusting.

616
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,500
I love techno.

617
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,181
Electronic.

618
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,150
Fucking fake knows

619
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,370
the guy who made that must have
been laughing like a mother fucker.

620
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,260
He was probably so high when he,

621
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:14,340
when he's so into that pat and he
didn't even realize he fucked us.

622
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:19,341
Me and he's one of us and he fucked us
with his stupid electric robot knows,

623
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,510
but he made lots of money
so he can go to Colorado,

624
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,220
have his own condo and smoke all day.

625
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,450
The irony and manage if he'd just started
his own pot selling business after he

626
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:28,201
sold those things.

627
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:30,330
Imagine if he was like the bank's
betting against themselves.

628
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,381
Hey,

629
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,460
we all need a cash cow.

630
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,180
That's the move.

631
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,751
That's what you do.

632
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:34,041
You,

633
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:34,874
you develop,

634
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,530
you develop shit to help the cops while,

635
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,960
while profiting off weed
and it all eats itself.

636
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,310
Yeah.

637
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,000
It is legal to smoke marijuana on your
front porch and voted for last month.

638
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:45,211
10.

639
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,044
Okay,

640
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,883
good.

641
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,431
Yeah.

642
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:48,750
You could smoke on your front porch now.

643
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,550
Powerful Denver.

644
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,480
Wow.

645
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,100
Fuck yeah.

646
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,980
Denver Denver's Straw.

647
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:55,740
But there's gonna be a lot of
blow back from all of this.

648
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,100
And the first blow back that we're
seeing is the blow back and his era has

649
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,700
housing are doing it.

650
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,533
Hey Mike.

651
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,521
The A,

652
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:03,060
the first blow back is the bank thing.

653
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,500
They're not allowed to
put their money in banks.

654
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,490
So what they supposed to do,

655
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,120
they have to fucking stash money places.

656
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:09,930
Man.

657
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,010
It's really crazy.

658
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,210
He's going to have to buy cash houses
and shit and cash boats and maybe that's

659
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:15,900
the point.

660
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,141
Yeah,

661
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:17,760
they're trying to get it
so they can't get rich,

662
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,871
which I'm all for it,

663
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:19,290
man.

664
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,501
You know,

665
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,610
I think that if people,

666
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,220
if people want marijuana,

667
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,680
they should be able to grow
it and it's not hard to grow,

668
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,190
you know?

669
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,370
And I think that one of the reasons why
it's so expensive and been so expensive

670
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,840
for so long is because it's illegal.

671
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,550
Once it becomes legal,

672
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,151
you know,

673
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,520
it,

674
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,610
it should like all balance out.

675
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,080
It should,

676
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,940
it should be really easy to
get super easy to access,

677
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,810
easy to grow.

678
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,160
You don't really need to pay for it.

679
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,143
It's just the,

680
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,510
this,

681
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,860
the fear of having,

682
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,671
you know,

683
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:45,330
uh,

684
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,410
somebody come and find your
little collective that you
and your buddies have set

685
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:50,880
up on some little piece
of property somewhere.

686
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,520
Oh,

687
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,830
they'd been doing that up north.

688
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,723
Yeah.

689
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,590
They've been busting houses,

690
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,440
million dollar houses
with the entire basement.

691
00:19:58,441 --> 00:19:59,041
First floor,

692
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,400
second floor with all the hydroponics.

693
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,243
Yeah.

694
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,930
They go by your house with a special
machine now and it checks like the amount

695
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:07,890
of electrical,

696
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,420
whatever the fuck is
going on in your house.

697
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,920
So if you have like a lot of lights on,

698
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,260
they might just storm your house.

699
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,230
There was a,

700
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,190
an old couple that were,

701
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,890
I believe there is a
former FBI or former CIA,

702
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,780
and they got arrested.

703
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,681
The fucking,

704
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,730
the DEA arrested them came into their
house because they thought they had to

705
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:28,800
grow up when they were
just growing vegetables.

706
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,821
So they broke,

707
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,380
I mean,

708
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,520
they literally went,

709
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,410
if I forget whether it
was a former FBI or CIA,

710
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,250
I forget who it was,

711
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,750
but the DEA literally went into their
fucking house because they thought they

712
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:40,920
were growing marijuana.

713
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,880
And you know,

714
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,870
like Jesus Christ,

715
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:43,530
guys like,

716
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,630
do you not check who the
fuck these people are?

717
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,590
No.

718
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:46,930
No.

719
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,763
Okay.

720
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,240
Can I go in there and get those plants?

721
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
But I wish I remember the,

722
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,380
the exact specifics of the story.

723
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:54,370
But it was hilarious.

724
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,003
Denver though,

725
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,000
they don't give a fuck.

726
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,541
They said,

727
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,374
come get us.

728
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,040
It's right.

729
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,940
We're cowboys.

730
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,920
We've got fucking ranches up here.

731
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,701
We've got wells,

732
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,660
we got water wells.

733
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,590
I think we're good.

734
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,950
I think we're gonna keep our weed now
and it's all this fucking crazy blowback.

735
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,320
Crazy blowback.

736
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,820
Well,

737
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm expecting to Chinese to come here.

738
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:18,250
They just dropped four point $7 billion
into the American economy buying

739
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,060
businesses.

740
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,580
Let's see if they go to Colorado
and buy some weed farms,

741
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,473
they're going to do it.

742
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,341
Chinese,

743
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,001
they're going to go off.

744
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:24,834
You'll right couch.

745
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,501
Yeah.

746
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:29,280
Can you imagine how much the world would
change if Chinese people came over here

747
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:30,160
and started growing weed?

748
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,110
They're very ambitious folks.

749
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,490
It would be over real quick.

750
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,190
We've got a lot of money
these days too much.

751
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,300
It's a fascinating thing,

752
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:39,620
isn't it?

753
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,440
How um,

754
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,870
these nations look at
each other over time.

755
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,490
You know,

756
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:43,930
the,

757
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,140
the,

758
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,881
the sort of,

759
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:48,000
the character of the nation sort of
shifts back and forth and now China,

760
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,870
the character is become instead of
one of just total communism of this,

761
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:52,290
you know,

762
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,730
rampant capitalism and this,

763
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:53,971
this,

764
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:56,280
this new feeling of China being like,

765
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:56,851
you know,

766
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:59,650
producing literally
every fucking cell phone.

767
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,080
No one demand except for the Samsung ones,

768
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:06,810
which are pretty in Korea and he all the
top cell phones and laptops and shit.

769
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,850
China is just make it so much shit.

770
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,230
Yeah.

771
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,230
Lenovo bought IBM thinkpad and it's now
the number one business computer in the

772
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,490
world under the name of the Nova.

773
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,710
Wow.

774
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:17,990
Yeah.

775
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,100
I work in China.

776
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
I have a contract and trying to,

777
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:24,590
with the second wealthiest guy in China
for wellness centers and I'm watching

778
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:25,640
what he's buying up.

779
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,231
Unbelievable.

780
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:29,000
The amount of money that the dumping here,

781
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,330
I bought a thinkpad just
because I'm dumb and I figured

782
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,190
that will be the way to really
inspire me to be less dumb.

783
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,710
Every time I do some
writing on my think pad,

784
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,580
you know he can't write total
nonsense when you have a think pad,

785
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,210
you know it's too pretentious,

786
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,950
but I liked that little nipple man.

787
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,390
Nobody ever stuck with that nipple.

788
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,650
The nipple for the mouse?

789
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,161
Yeah.

790
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,110
The nipple for the mouse
is pretty sweet man.

791
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,850
I don't know why it never caught on they,

792
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,410
they nailed that shit with IBM.

793
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,140
A couple of other like PC
laptops had that little nipple.

794
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,471
Yeah,

795
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,304
that's my baby.

796
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,660
I had one of those.

797
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,360
I think it was the shit I
was riding on Saint Pat's on.

798
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,710
I'm obviously thinking

799
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,370
you were just playing
with that little redness.

800
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,890
Well,

801
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,820
I wasn't playing with it.

802
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:07,654
I was working.

803
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,650
That's what I was going to work.

804
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,910
There's no playing involved.

805
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't play dude.

806
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:11,710
I don't play games.

807
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,180
Yeah.

808
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,571
So,

809
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:13,811
uh,

810
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:14,890
that's all made in China,

811
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:15,101
right?

812
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:15,970
The Foxconn of course.

813
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:18,010
It makes all of the apple iPhone.

814
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,640
Yeah.

815
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,940
I wonder who makes the nets
outside of Foxconn measures.

816
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,020
They were American nets.

817
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,250
That'd be really ironic.

818
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,120
We send American nets over the Chinese
factory to catch the workers as they

819
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:28,954
jumped from the building.

820
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,633
Imagine that.

821
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,010
No,

822
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,850
it's weird man.

823
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,630
It's weird when you find out how much
shit China makes when they duplicate

824
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,130
cities and stuff like that.

825
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:42,940
Like they duplicate Paris and
all these other European cities.

826
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,200
Yeah.

827
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,160
One of the funniest,

828
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,320
funniest,

829
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,890
one of the most necessary towns that
they just got finished doing was a

830
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:53,090
geriatric old age town for
200,000 elderly Chinese.

831
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:53,781
Well,

832
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:58,370
you think 200,000 elderly when
there's 1.3 plus billion people there.

833
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,020
So the town has everything.

834
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,411
It's got,

835
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,010
you know,

836
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,491
stores.

837
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:02,750
We can buy diapers,

838
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:03,291
you can buy,

839
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:03,740
you know,

840
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,251
liquid,

841
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:04,850
uh,

842
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,340
drinks and protein hospitals,

843
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,690
their own er,

844
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,720
everything just for I think at 60 years
of age and older and they're building

845
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,220
town after town just to
take care of the elderly.

846
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,130
They have a really weird thing
going on with their children too.

847
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:21,140
Obviously the one child now,

848
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,090
it's now unlimited or it's too,

849
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,200
it's no longer one,

850
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,960
not they.

851
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,080
It's actually just a slight variation.

852
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,310
The slight variation is if you came
from a single parent household,

853
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,600
if you an only child,

854
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,110
rather,

855
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,400
if you were an only child,

856
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,531
one of your,

857
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:36,110
uh,

858
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,150
either the male or the
female was an only child,

859
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:39,440
you were allowed to
have more than one kid,

860
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,274
then you can have too.

861
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,170
Let's not much of a change.

862
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,550
It's not like unlimited,

863
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,830
that's still like they're
really trying to restrict,

864
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:46,730
but they have too many people.

865
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,561
I mean they,

866
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:48,261
they know it.

867
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,540
Everybody knows it and it's craziness.

868
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,670
And so their solution
was to only have men,

869
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,620
which is a crazy fucking solution.

870
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,280
I mean,

871
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,280
then you have like this crazy set up where
70 plus percent of the people are men

872
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,140
and the men are lonely and sad and
they can't find a woman and they,

873
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,980
they have this real despair because they
might not ever be able to find a woman.

874
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,450
It's real possibility.

875
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,680
There's just not that many.

876
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,340
That's right.

877
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,320
And the chicks must just be on.

878
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,100
That shit was so powerful there in China.

879
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,210
They must be so powerful,

880
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,620
so hard to get one,

881
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,750
but it's their culture has an
OLED allowed them to be that way.

882
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,773
Keeping Dally,

883
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,590
that's easy for you to say white man.

884
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,601
You gotta keep him.

885
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:29,600
Got to keep them in their place.

886
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:30,434
There's only,

887
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:30,820
you know,

888
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
it was only 30 of them.

889
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,560
You can't let them know
how the valuable they are

890
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,961
to many people,

891
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:36,794
man,

892
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,060
whether it's China or India,

893
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:39,290
what you get to a billion.

894
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,320
I wonder how long it's going to
take for us to get to a billion

895
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,680
with the immigration
that's happening fast.

896
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,400
You think so?

897
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,090
I think so.

898
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,811
All through Mexico?

899
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:49,410
Is that what you're saying?

900
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:49,830
Nope,

901
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,663
there's

902
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,700
most senior I heard most newer.

903
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:55,860
Oh,

904
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,850
there's a what,

905
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,950
21 million coming from China.

906
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,170
21 million hundred 1 million a year.

907
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,500
21 million that between now and 2020
there'll be 21 million people and they

908
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:10,260
predict there'll be someplace between
six to 10 million coming just to

909
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:11,094
California

910
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,791
if you will.

911
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:12,481
They all get in.

912
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:13,020
Don't do it.

913
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,290
Is there like a number
that the United States,

914
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,020
if they won't come anymore,

915
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,590
if they bring a company here,

916
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,070
they can get a green
with say 2,105 years ago.

917
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,341
Oh,

918
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:28,341
expert u s population to hit 1
billion by 2100 fucking crazy man.

919
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,670
Not too far off.

920
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,720
That's not too far off.

921
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,060
That means that conceivably Jamie
could still be alive to see this.

922
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,450
You and I will be gone unless
some new shit comes along.

923
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,270
But Jamie and I see this coming on.

924
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:41,821
Yeah,

925
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:43,200
there is always new shit coming along,

926
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,010
right?

927
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,843
Yeah.

928
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:46,721
Yeah.

929
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:47,520
That's crazy.

930
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,340
Jeez.

931
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,910
Yeah.

932
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,050
That's a billion is a scary number
because it represents chaos,

933
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,431
not just chaos,

934
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:55,390
but also represents,

935
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:56,140
there's,

936
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,950
there seems to be like a lack of
appreciation for life when it gets to that

937
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,281
level.

938
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:03,700
And that's when you find like these
crazy rapes in India and this horrible

939
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,760
stories of people doing terrible things.

940
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,451
China,

941
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,850
people selling their kids like people.

942
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,980
Not to say that people don't
do terrible things over here.

943
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:12,850
They definitely do.

944
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,740
People do terrible things everywhere,

945
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,330
but it seems like life is not as
valuable when there's too much of it

946
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,843
true

947
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,043
there.

948
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,491
You know,

949
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:25,941
the,

950
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:26,420
uh,

951
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,370
China and the black market for organs,

952
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,010
Middle East for Oregon's and children.

953
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,690
I mean,

954
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,880
these aren't my favorite
topics to go through.

955
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:39,470
I read about it because I am across
an international marketplace and it's

956
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,850
extremely scary,

957
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:41,091
you know,

958
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:45,020
with three daughters and having to
look at that one can be pulled off the

959
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:45,854
street,

960
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,281
you know,

961
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,130
and sold as and is,

962
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,973
um,

963
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,180
uh,

964
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,940
in slavery,

965
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,691
which is very,

966
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:51,231
very common.

967
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:55,230
You see all the cases that have been
coming up with Middle East and with China.

968
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:56,630
And how about with Ohio?

969
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,230
No,

970
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,160
it wasn't that fucking guy.

971
00:27:58,161 --> 00:27:58,701
What did he live in?

972
00:27:58,701 --> 00:27:59,534
Ohio.

973
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,471
Cleveland.

974
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:00,741
Yeah.

975
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:01,371
The Cleveland Guy.

976
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:03,560
When they found he had a bunch
of women living in his basement.

977
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:06,380
He had kidnapped him and
locked him up in his basement.

978
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,341
There's a,

979
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:10,070
this is where there's been a few
of those over the past few years.

980
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,290
So it's not just there,

981
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,610
you know,

982
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,470
it's not just China.

983
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,420
A woman has to be worried
about that here too.

984
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,283
All over the world.

985
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:15,840
Yeah.

986
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,441
It's all over.

987
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,760
I am just talking about,

988
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,030
you know,

989
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,710
the venues that I traveling
and hear the stuff going on.

990
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,050
That thing that happened in India.

991
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,681
Fuck,

992
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,514
you know?

993
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:23,921
Yeah.

994
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:26,800
There's so much rape and sane Pakistan,

995
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,630
these stories.

996
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,350
And the other thing is also
the perspective because
I mean without a doubt,

997
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,170
any of those stories
about gang rape in India,

998
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,360
they're horrible and
disgusting and terrifying.

999
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,920
I think the reason why we're hearing
about so many crimes from there though is

1000
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:45,790
that we can't even realize what
it's like to have an extra,

1001
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,960
like what we have now,

1002
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:50,590
plus an extra 700 million,

1003
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,500
like that's out of control.

1004
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,110
And you know that that might
be the problem in itself.

1005
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:01,660
This insane psycho behavior might be
that there's so many people that when it

1006
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:02,500
gets to that level,

1007
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,880
that life just gets devalued.

1008
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,080
Well,

1009
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,930
fortunately in China they have
lots of places to spread out to,

1010
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,221
so,

1011
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,420
but they're all concentrated,

1012
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:10,631
you know,

1013
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:14,680
in areas like Beijing and Shanghai and
Guang Chao and Kenton and so forth.

1014
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,181
What?

1015
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:17,680
It's it's wall to wall.

1016
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,761
That's insane.

1017
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:19,594
Like Japan.

1018
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,853
Yeah.

1019
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,930
Sardines in a can in the trains.

1020
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,093
Yeah.

1021
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,311
Yeah.

1022
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,910
They push people in there.

1023
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,090
That really puts you in.

1024
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,250
That's so fucking crazy.

1025
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,830
When we look at California
with the expansive horizons
that we have in Texas and

1026
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,723
Alaska,

1027
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,181
I mean,

1028
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:39,790
we're very blessed to have
these beautiful places that,

1029
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,481
you know,

1030
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:45,481
my fear that we have so many people
coming in that it starts crowding us in.

1031
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,650
The cities were already
having the crowding,

1032
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,401
Chicago,

1033
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:49,001
New York,

1034
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,601
Los Angeles,

1035
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:50,261
San Francisco,

1036
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:51,094
San Diego,

1037
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,370
so you have to look for Bumfuck,

1038
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,280
Iowa or core de Lane.

1039
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,530
Beautiful places.

1040
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,011
Yeah.

1041
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,900
They might be the last bastions of hope,

1042
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,760
you know it.

1043
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,760
It really seems like if people keep
expanding the population at this rate,

1044
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:08,590
it's almost inevitable that the whole
country gets dragged into the same

1045
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,790
situation that we've seen and
these other countries just,

1046
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,430
it's almost inevitable numbers wise,

1047
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,120
right?

1048
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,010
You're just going to run
into an uncontrollable
unmanageable size of humans,

1049
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,010
whether it's 500 million or a
billion or whatever the number is.

1050
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,271
Yeah.

1051
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:21,960
And he says,

1052
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,290
just really ACL,

1053
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,400
Lou will get in there and say,

1054
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,420
what are you trying to restrict to one
child per family than I ever do that?

1055
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,021
Yeah.

1056
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:29,171
Well,

1057
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:30,004
I hope so,

1058
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,843
but still,

1059
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,580
somebody's got to do something.

1060
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,200
It's just the question of,

1061
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,980
you know,

1062
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,370
you don't want to really let nature take
its course because what nature we'll

1063
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:39,851
deal say,

1064
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:40,001
oh,

1065
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:40,511
there's too many.

1066
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:41,081
You fuckers,

1067
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,270
let's just give you a horrible disease.

1068
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:43,841
You know,

1069
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,051
what's,

1070
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:49,051
just give you some ruthless shit that
you'll never recover from and killed 99%

1071
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:49,870
of you.

1072
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,920
And that's what nature would do.

1073
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,840
Nature would just figure
out a way to fuck you.

1074
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,570
So if we don't,

1075
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,520
if we don't fix it ourselves,

1076
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,413
nature fixes it.

1077
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,240
You hope.

1078
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,870
Yeah.

1079
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,291
You hope.

1080
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,010
And you hope we don't accelerate it
with all our genetic engineering.

1081
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,110
Are you worried about that?

1082
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,730
I'm extremely worried about it.

1083
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,540
Um,

1084
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,470
since uh,

1085
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:10,800
you know,

1086
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,120
GMO has been around,

1087
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,460
we've been seeing an
increase in CELIAC's disease.

1088
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:18,150
We'd been seeing autoimmune
diseases like Lupus or articles.

1089
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:23,040
Now starting to confirm what we thought
that there is an association with gluten

1090
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,520
from breads from grains and a lupus and
rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's,

1091
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:34,131
which are all names for diseases that
create inflammation and start destroying

1092
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:35,221
our own selves,

1093
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:35,971
our own tissue,

1094
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:36,571
our bones,

1095
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:37,620
rheumatoid arthritis.

1096
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,970
And there are articles now coming out
showing that there's this relationship to

1097
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:42,540
it.

1098
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,990
And then you look back of when GMO started
with Monsanto and some of the other

1099
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:48,120
companies and you start seeing the trend,

1100
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:49,470
the increase in these diseases.

1101
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:52,980
Why didn't we have these
diseases in the past like autism?

1102
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:55,580
Why is autism at such an incredible level?

1103
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,011
What is it,

1104
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,930
one to 21 to 50,

1105
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:02,931
when it used to be one to
400 is it relative to the
immunizations we went from,

1106
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,870
you know,

1107
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,280
a small amount of immunizations now giving
but 30 in a year to the kids between,

1108
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:08,490
you know,

1109
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,301
up to five years.

1110
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:10,770
I don't remember really
what the numbers are.

1111
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:12,300
I stopped pediatrics years ago.

1112
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,280
But when you inject all
these inflammatory chemicals,

1113
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,830
I mean that's what happens when
you and do an immunization.

1114
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:20,910
It creates inflammation.

1115
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,330
This is a hot topic and it's,

1116
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:24,200
it's a very,

1117
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:25,940
like when you start talking about it,

1118
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,190
like there's people that are
immediately going to dismiss you.

1119
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,470
Yep.

1120
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,210
So you started talking about it always
one of those anti immunization guys.

1121
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,270
But if you realize the statistics,

1122
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,580
if you start looking at
the statistics for the,

1123
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:37,880
uh,

1124
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,110
the vaccine,

1125
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,300
would vaccine court decide the payout?

1126
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:41,780
They've,

1127
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,613
they've had a payout,

1128
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,840
numerous large settlements with people,

1129
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,830
millions and millions and millions
of dollars because they connected the

1130
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:51,170
immunization shots to
their kids getting autism.

1131
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,590
Correct.

1132
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,341
That's a weird thing.

1133
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:54,140
People don't want to hear that fact.

1134
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:54,530
No,

1135
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,191
I mean they could say,

1136
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:55,341
well,

1137
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,040
they just lost in court because
it was a misinformed judge or,

1138
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,690
I mean there can be some variables,

1139
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:03,980
but the reality of the situation is
you're not supposed to give a baby peanut

1140
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,814
butter.

1141
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,690
Okay.

1142
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,270
A fucking little tiny baby shouldn't
even get peanut butter because it could

1143
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:08,910
kill him.

1144
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,970
If that kid is allergic to peanuts,

1145
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,560
if she's got that allergy,

1146
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,750
you could literally kill
a baby with peanut butter,

1147
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,040
but why is it okay to just shoot chemicals
in and assume that everyone's going

1148
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,200
to have a uniform reaction
to these chemicals?

1149
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,580
Are Most people going to be okay?

1150
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,180
Yes.

1151
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,630
Is it good that we have vaccinations
because they print it prevents from

1152
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,810
diseases abso-fucking-lutely I've had
a bunch of vaccinations in my life.

1153
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,190
I think they're very important.

1154
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,630
Should you give them the babies?

1155
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,460
I don't fucking know about that.

1156
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,870
I don't know about that.

1157
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,183
I don't know.

1158
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,010
Maybe we should look at that
real quick because what?

1159
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,240
What are you shooting in that?

1160
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:41,791
It's,

1161
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:41,961
it's,

1162
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:42,171
you know,

1163
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:43,004
it's a baby.

1164
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,420
It's a day old.

1165
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,190
You're going to shoot chemicals that
maybe let it sit around for a while and

1166
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,080
grow and get stronger maybe.

1167
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,850
And that's what a lot of doctors think.

1168
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,290
They think that this should be a protocol.

1169
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,540
We don't give them any shots
until they get to be about two.

1170
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,900
And then you slowly start
introducing him to the essentials.

1171
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,250
You avoid.

1172
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,270
Like when they're babies,

1173
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:04,480
you don't give him things to prevent VD,

1174
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,943
you know?

1175
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,700
But people want to do that kind of shit.

1176
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,780
Like there's a lot of money and met
fucking vaccines and as soon as a

1177
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:14,300
corporation gets behind the bottom line,

1178
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,680
they're just trying to sell more.

1179
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,200
They'll try to figure out
a way to make it so like,

1180
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:18,411
look,

1181
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:19,550
the fucking kid can take it.

1182
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:20,780
These kids are strong these days.

1183
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,310
They're eating our GMO corn.

1184
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,780
You can give him a hard vaccine,

1185
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:24,981
man.

1186
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,030
We'd be making a lot of money.

1187
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:26,864
Tommy,

1188
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,290
come on.

1189
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,251
Well,

1190
00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:34,251
one of the recent ones for adult females
or adolescent females is a product for

1191
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,361
HPV,

1192
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:37,390
human papillomavirus,

1193
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,870
which can cause cervical cancer protocol,

1194
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,713
Garnett cell.

1195
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,330
And there are reported cases of healthy
women who get the garden of cell and end

1196
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:47,040
up with problems with their brain.

1197
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,180
Oh.

1198
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,200
And the issue is,

1199
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:49,381
you know,

1200
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:54,120
from the young and also for any age really
is the protection that our body has.

1201
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:54,301
This,

1202
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:54,991
this wall,

1203
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:59,100
this barrier called the blood brain
barrier that stops things that are caustic

1204
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:00,840
and harmful to our brain from getting in.

1205
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,310
It doesn't fully develop to maybe five
years of age in the average child.

1206
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,600
So when you're giving an overwhelming
amount of inflammatory injections,

1207
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:12,360
it creates an immune response
and it goes into the brain.

1208
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:12,601
Well,

1209
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,710
it passes that him,

1210
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,100
that inflammatory process into
the brain and that's probably,

1211
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,300
and they'll deny it.

1212
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:18,930
You know,

1213
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,880
the part of the reason why it happens,

1214
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,080
they were talking about,

1215
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,530
uh,

1216
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:22,921
Theo,

1217
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:27,570
which is mercury that used to be in or
is still in some of the immunizations.

1218
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:29,310
They thought it was mercury toxicity.

1219
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,780
And you know,

1220
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,950
my partner in,

1221
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:32,620
um,

1222
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,190
in

1223
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,620
this is all scientific facts.

1224
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,454
It's all scientific.

1225
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,710
Yes.

1226
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,011
And that,

1227
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:38,690
that alone,

1228
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,790
there's the people that are
automatically dismissing you right now.

1229
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,840
And I'm sure there were a bunch.

1230
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:43,501
And me as well,

1231
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,230
and they should dismiss me because I'm a
fucking idiot and I don't know what I'm

1232
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:46,920
talking about.

1233
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,110
I'm just repeating a bunch of
words that I've read online.

1234
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,520
Dismiss me away please.

1235
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,480
But,

1236
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,330
but recognize that this is not
as cut and dry as you think.

1237
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,220
And it's not that immunizations are bad.

1238
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:56,701
It's not.

1239
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,361
Everybody wants to say,

1240
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:57,481
oh,

1241
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:59,130
he's anti someone's anti-vaccine.

1242
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,871
Oh she's,

1243
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:03,900
she's causing the deaths of thousands
because she doesn't endorse giving babies

1244
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:04,734
vaccines.

1245
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,520
No,

1246
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,720
that's not the case.

1247
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,560
But what the case is is you got to
realize it's a fucking chemical.

1248
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,650
And the idea that just shooting a foreign
chemical into a baby is totally safe.

1249
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,170
Like you sure are.

1250
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,290
You fucking sure how her,

1251
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,290
the little baby body is going to react
to a needle being shoved into it and you

1252
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:29,730
inject some manmade chemicals that
just might have mercury in them.

1253
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,290
Everybody's going to be okay.

1254
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:32,460
Well,

1255
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,100
I agree with you that we
all need immunizations.

1256
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,040
I think it's the timing
that we need to reassess.

1257
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,660
I think if you're overwhelmed,

1258
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,543
nothing,

1259
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,111
you're correct,

1260
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:42,944
sir.

1261
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,123
I've done the story correct.

1262
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,180
You've done your reading.

1263
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,451
Well,

1264
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:49,230
I've done a lot of reading
about the people much smarter
than me figuring things

1265
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:49,530
out.

1266
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,620
And one of the things they figured
out is a babies are fucking genuinely

1267
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,190
sensitive.

1268
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,550
Correct.

1269
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,830
They're really small and they,

1270
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:56,730
this is the not really developed yet.

1271
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,430
It doesn't mean that
like vaccines are bad.

1272
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:01,200
Vaccines are awesome vaccines.

1273
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,300
And the reason why we
don't have polio vaccines,

1274
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:07,050
the reason why there's a
million things like mumps,

1275
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:10,230
which is actually starting
to make a comeback because
people are not vaccinating

1276
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,390
their kids from mumps and measles,

1277
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:13,140
you know?

1278
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,230
So it's not entirely good
to not vaccinate either.

1279
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:16,831
It's,

1280
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:17,161
it's,

1281
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,994
it's good.

1282
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,511
It's just,

1283
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,490
it needs to be done at
the right time probably.

1284
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,310
And we need to figure out
why there's so many of them.

1285
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:23,791
I mean,

1286
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,170
are they all necessary?

1287
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,790
Are we sure that that's a good idea?

1288
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,990
And I don't think there's any way to
do it until they clone fake people,

1289
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,100
headless people,

1290
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,480
and they use it or using it as prisoners.

1291
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,583
Prisoners,

1292
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,513
that's what they should do.

1293
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,830
Give them vaccines.

1294
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,860
You can't do that because you've got to
test them on babies and you need to make

1295
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:41,521
fake babies.

1296
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:42,390
That's the only way to do it.

1297
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,990
You don't have to make it.

1298
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,651
But then there'll be,

1299
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:44,850
you know,

1300
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,150
a lot of people that are
convinced that they're,

1301
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,490
they've made a real baby.

1302
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,300
Cause it'd be,

1303
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,760
you'd have to be so perfect in
order for my experiments to work,

1304
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,030
write it up as a thesis.

1305
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,080
It's a good TV show.

1306
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,540
It's like a one of those a CSI shows,

1307
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,830
but it's all about fake babies.

1308
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,671
Yeah,

1309
00:37:59,671 --> 00:37:59,941
man.

1310
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:00,460
Um,

1311
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,720
I think that a lot of people
want an either or in that case,

1312
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:05,340
and I'm glad that you have the courage to,

1313
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:05,610
uh,

1314
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,080
to talk about that because you know,

1315
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:10,350
as well as I know that it's such a hot
topic that immediately even discussing

1316
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:14,640
the possibility that occasionally there
could be problems when you inject kids,

1317
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,960
people,

1318
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,210
people assume you're like a nine,

1319
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:19,410
11 truther,

1320
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:19,981
you know,

1321
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:23,320
you believe the towers were
broken down by thermite.

1322
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:26,160
Like they put you in that
nutter category right away.

1323
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,110
You're a chem trail believer.

1324
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:30,060
You're a fucking UFO fanatic.

1325
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,290
You know where big foot lives,

1326
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,130
boom,

1327
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,970
I've got his address.

1328
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,430
You know what I'm saying?

1329
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,580
Yeah,

1330
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,413
absolutely.

1331
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,273
You know,

1332
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,103
they think that,

1333
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,580
I mean you made a comment about it.

1334
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,720
We're all the same,

1335
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:48,721
we're not all the same and you give the
same products to 90 different people and

1336
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,350
you get 90 different reactions.

1337
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,930
You hope you get a couple of
them that have no reaction.

1338
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,640
But they think that it's,

1339
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,520
we live in a perfect world
and that's the problem.

1340
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,580
They don't take into consideration that
the genetic uniqueness of each person

1341
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,830
unquestionable genetic uniqueness.

1342
00:39:04,831 --> 00:39:07,410
But that's not convenient if
you just try to turn a profit.

1343
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,273
Correct.

1344
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,010
And that's why it's weird that
we just allow that to happen.

1345
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,680
I mean it's not anti-science,

1346
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,690
it's not anti-medicine it's common sense.

1347
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,490
It's very simple.

1348
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:18,660
A Co who's waiting,

1349
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,200
hold on.

1350
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,820
Is it profit going on here?

1351
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,530
Well you guys are
providing how much money?

1352
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,420
Holy Shit.

1353
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,930
You find out how much money
is in vaccinations that much.

1354
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:28,951
First of all,

1355
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,210
why is it costs that much?

1356
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,530
Why are you making that much money?

1357
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,580
And second of all is that have anything
to do with why they give so many

1358
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,301
vaccinations?

1359
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:37,320
Is that possible?

1360
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,880
And if you think it could be,

1361
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:42,060
if you think that people are sneaky and
slimy enough that there that could be,

1362
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,970
it has to be something that we
all take into consideration.

1363
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,650
It doesn't mean that you're a nutter.

1364
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,880
It means like that's like that seems like
a writing on the wall kind of a thing.

1365
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,250
It's all about profit.

1366
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,620
I'll give you an example that you might've
heard less weak company came out with

1367
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:59,960
a new drug for hepatitis C.

1368
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,980
Hepatitis C is a chronic process.

1369
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,000
That viral infection,

1370
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:03,920
we don't really have very
good treatment for it.

1371
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:05,810
They use Gamma Alpha Interferon.

1372
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:06,890
It doesn't work that well.

1373
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,570
They came out with a drug,

1374
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,840
one capsule a day for 84 days.

1375
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,110
It's cost $1,000 a tablet.

1376
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,490
It costs them $2 billion to get
it to where it is right now.

1377
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
There are 4.1 million people in
the United States with hepatitis C.

1378
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,130
It'll only take 250,000
to pay off everything.

1379
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,600
And they've got 4.1 million
people with Hepatitis C.

1380
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,560
So the argument is why doesn't
the company lower the cost for it?

1381
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:42,100
So it would make it more available
to more people discussed.

1382
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,531
They have,

1383
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:42,771
you know,

1384
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:47,771
a program for hardship cases and the
CEO was on this radio program that I was

1385
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:49,610
listening to and he says,

1386
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:51,620
it's not our model to lower the price.

1387
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,113
Whoa,

1388
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,160
it's not our model.

1389
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,480
It's their model.

1390
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:57,830
We want $1,000 a pill,

1391
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,210
dollars a pill.

1392
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,510
Is it because the research and
development costs were so high?

1393
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:01,721
Well,

1394
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:05,660
they're saying it was very high and
they bought the technology from another

1395
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:06,494
company,

1396
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,610
but it's a,

1397
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:07,971
you know,

1398
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:12,971
you do 250,000 times 84,000 and that's
the amount of money that it costs them to

1399
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:15,740
do everything that they've done.

1400
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,000
It just seems like if you give people
the opportunity to make more or less

1401
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:20,450
money,

1402
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,283
it's up to them.

1403
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,000
Well this is what it is.

1404
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,640
Some people that go fucking
crazy and it's like gasoline.

1405
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:28,250
Why is gasoline 47 cents in Abu Dhabi?

1406
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,150
Right.

1407
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,810
But you know,

1408
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,700
but you can't like limited either.

1409
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:33,860
That's what's weird about being a person.

1410
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:34,130
Me,

1411
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,470
he can't tell people
what to do either way.

1412
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,131
You know,

1413
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:37,521
he can't.

1414
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:37,681
It's,

1415
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,200
it's hard to tell them what to do.

1416
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:39,741
I mean,

1417
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:40,910
it's hard to say what year?

1418
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,331
Well,

1419
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,530
how can I say that?

1420
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,921
You know,

1421
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,530
you are your shit cost too much.

1422
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,000
Your pills cost too much.

1423
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:47,301
When,

1424
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:47,540
uh,

1425
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,490
maybe I'm not willing
to work for less either.

1426
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:50,001
And everybody goes,

1427
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:50,271
ah,

1428
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:51,170
we'll just leave it alone.

1429
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,161
Well,

1430
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:57,110
the economy of scale is if you're making
$7 and 50 cents an hour working 40

1431
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:57,771
hours a week,

1432
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,110
how can you afford to pay $1,000 a pill?

1433
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,640
It's craziness.

1434
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,750
It's so much money.

1435
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,280
It's an insane amount of money.

1436
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,590
But if it has research and
development funded when they,

1437
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:10,640
when they do something like that,

1438
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,140
how long does stuff like that tank?

1439
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:13,910
Like if they're going to develop
some sort of a crazy pill,

1440
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,250
what's like a high end figure?

1441
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,700
High end could be,

1442
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,030
you know,

1443
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,301
10,

1444
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,590
15 years on the short,

1445
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:20,540
which is a fast track that
they have with the FDA.

1446
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,374
It's three years.

1447
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,790
And the only problem with that,

1448
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,170
if you look the past five,

1449
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:24,831
10 years,

1450
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,440
the drugs that went
through the fast track,

1451
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,490
there were a number of them that were
taken off the market because of the side

1452
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:33,320
effects that they didn't see
in the first three years.

1453
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:33,800
Well,

1454
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,633
they were there.

1455
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,500
There was one drug that was for a form
of leukemia that was just taken off the

1456
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:44,330
market where it caused your blood
vessels in your limbs to shut down.

1457
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:48,700
So your leg would lose ischemias
the term lose bloods hallway.

1458
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,580
So it would go dead and they'd
have to amputate your live a fuck.

1459
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,050
And this is what was going on.

1460
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,320
There was another drug that
was for ovarian cancer,

1461
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,480
which is a very drastic thing.

1462
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,363
Um,

1463
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,061
Jean Wilde's,

1464
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:01,870
a wife,

1465
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,450
uh,

1466
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,290
from laughing,

1467
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:03,830
uh,

1468
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,990
died of ovarian cancer anyway.

1469
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,800
Um,

1470
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,690
and they had it out for a year.

1471
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:09,530
At the end of the year,

1472
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:14,150
the FDA took it off the market because
they found that it had no status to

1473
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,860
statistical benefit.

1474
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:16,820
Nope.

1475
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,750
People think that better.

1476
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,913
Wow.

1477
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,130
So how was it that they were
allowed to have this drug marketed?

1478
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:24,800
I don't know how many thousand
dollars it was per treatment,

1479
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,810
but it was just phenomenal.

1480
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,030
And the drug for Hipaa,

1481
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,500
for a diabetes,

1482
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:30,951
which,

1483
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:31,784
um,

1484
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,150
was taken off the market after
a year because of liver failure.

1485
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:35,984
Then the,

1486
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,620
you know,

1487
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,011
the,

1488
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:37,844
um,

1489
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,470
uh,

1490
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,070
anti inflammatory medication,

1491
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:42,200
Vioxx with a cardiac problem.

1492
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,490
I was just going to bring that up.

1493
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,830
I know a dude who had a
stroke because of that stuff.

1494
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,910
He had a,

1495
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,680
he guy Metzger is his name.

1496
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,510
He's a former UFC fighter,

1497
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:55,511
like a really elite fighter and one of
the pioneers of MMA and a handsome guy to

1498
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,260
fucking beautiful head of hair.

1499
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:57,590
He's a,

1500
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:02,590
he does a commentary now and he was
apparently taking it because he had

1501
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:04,190
arthritis in his knees.

1502
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:04,941
He has it real bad.

1503
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:05,960
Inflammation is knees.

1504
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,400
And then his,

1505
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:07,880
uh,

1506
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,720
his family,

1507
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,950
people around them start saying like,

1508
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:10,491
what's going on man?

1509
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:11,630
You're like slurring your words,

1510
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:12,261
like what's happening?

1511
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:12,650
Stroke.

1512
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,010
He realized he had had a stroke and
then it turns out that a bunch of people

1513
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:17,330
that took this stuff and had strokes,

1514
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,530
he's made a full recovery.

1515
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,461
But you know,

1516
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:20,241
it's because he's a young,

1517
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:20,811
healthy guy.

1518
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,460
But that's fucking scary shit.

1519
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,420
Yeah.

1520
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,840
So basically not everybody has
a side effect of medications.

1521
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:28,820
Medications generally are very good.

1522
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,130
You just have to be cautious
when you start into those little

1523
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,530
five pound six pound critters.

1524
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:35,970
We called kids babies.

1525
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,541
Well,

1526
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:36,871
yeah,

1527
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:37,171
I mean,

1528
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:39,300
and even fucking MMA fighters,

1529
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,270
205 pound Guy Metzger's I mean,

1530
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:44,970
it's pretty much everybody's
gotta be careful.

1531
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:45,480
It's a,

1532
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:45,811
it's a,

1533
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:46,644
it's not,

1534
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,330
it's not totally figured out yet.

1535
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,231
You know,

1536
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,880
not with every single human being.

1537
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,020
There's a lot of variables that people
have to work with when they make drugs or

1538
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,040
solutions.

1539
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,420
You just,

1540
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:57,501
the,

1541
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:02,370
the variables or the different amount
of places where people came from.

1542
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:05,790
Of course there's different things that
they were exposed to in their ancestors.

1543
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:06,624
Jeans,

1544
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,913
you know?

1545
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,130
Yeah.

1546
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,500
If you ever had genetic testing,

1547
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,460
no,

1548
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,200
no.

1549
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,033
I'm a chimp.

1550
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,450
I don't think I qualified
for being a person.

1551
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,150
It definitely would have about three
and a half of neanderthal might be a

1552
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:18,984
missing link.

1553
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,060
They know they'll find neanderthal.

1554
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,540
Yeah.

1555
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,141
I know.

1556
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:23,850
Someone in my family fucked a monkey.

1557
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,140
Someone down the line,

1558
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,990
someone down the line
totally fucked a monkey.

1559
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,290
I don't want to find out that I'm more
neanderthal than a regular person.

1560
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,900
But then they say the Niana
tiles looking up lately,

1561
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,291
by the way,

1562
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,070
I've been reading.

1563
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:35,903
Yeah,

1564
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,900
no,

1565
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:36,961
no,

1566
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:37,201
no.

1567
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,720
They started to think that may have been
a little smarter than when people are

1568
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:40,990
giving him credit for it.

1569
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,510
Might even be able to talk,

1570
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,790
might've been able to,

1571
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:44,940
uh,

1572
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,810
they use tools.

1573
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:46,644
They know that,

1574
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,480
uh,

1575
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:47,700
they,

1576
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,090
they,

1577
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,360
they think that neanderthals were
very similar to human beings,

1578
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,471
but just,

1579
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:52,860
uh,

1580
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,600
not quite,

1581
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,070
you know,

1582
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,880
I took the alien genetics
to bring him up to homo hug.

1583
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,900
I don't know.

1584
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,030
At kiss and Homosapien and homo erectus.

1585
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,190
That's what I was just going to tell you

1586
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,380
it for me.

1587
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,020
You've got the process.

1588
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,213
Yeah.

1589
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:08,520
No,

1590
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,500
they still haven't figured out how
neanderthal jumped all the way up to homo

1591
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,040
erectus.

1592
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,400
Homo bilocation homosapien and the
diff distinction was the front,

1593
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,010
the cortex or the NEOCORTEX,

1594
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,180
the new brain part,

1595
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:25,200
which is how we get our language skills
when we get our thought processes and

1596
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,470
integration of our emotion and you know,

1597
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,753
and uh,

1598
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:33,770
control frontal lobes with a command
and executive functions and uh,

1599
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:34,500
you know,

1600
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,180
they still looking for that missing link.

1601
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:37,500
Yeah.

1602
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,100
It's um,

1603
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,360
it's a fascinating thing,

1604
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:44,361
the whole process of trying to figure
out our past with fossils because fossils

1605
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,080
are really difficult to create.

1606
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,240
You,

1607
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,551
you know,

1608
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:50,250
you have to get caught in some sort of
a natural disaster or a mudslide or you

1609
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:50,610
know,

1610
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,620
something's going to happen
to preserve the body.

1611
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,380
Cause normally buys will
get eaten by scavengers.

1612
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:55,591
I mean,

1613
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:57,000
that's what scavengers are there for.

1614
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:58,710
And especially in those days,

1615
00:46:58,711 --> 00:46:59,250
man,

1616
00:46:59,250 --> 00:46:59,551
you know,

1617
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,020
I'm sure there was a lot of death.

1618
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,010
Things were just dying.

1619
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,420
People weren't living as long.

1620
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,580
So the idea that,

1621
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:06,780
you know,

1622
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,260
we can,

1623
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,410
we can figure out our entire fossil
record just by finding bones,

1624
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:10,861
but boy,

1625
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,870
that's a fucking shitty
record we're dealing with.

1626
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,281
They just found,

1627
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:15,870
I think a partial skull,

1628
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,220
which is the oldest,

1629
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:19,920
a hundred thousand years old
or a hundred million years old.

1630
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:20,940
I don't remember what the,

1631
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,260
how many Zeros are after it,

1632
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,251
but,

1633
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,084
uh,

1634
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:24,690
you know,

1635
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,460
there was finding a new ancestor.

1636
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,330
Yes.

1637
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:27,661
Yes.

1638
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:28,580
Do you see that article?

1639
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,860
I've seen several of them.

1640
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:30,130
There's

1641
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,460
been,

1642
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,770
there's been a lot of new
discoveries over the past,

1643
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,580
like about,

1644
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,640
say 10 or so years ago whenever it
was that they discovered that Hobbit,

1645
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:37,750
man Flores,

1646
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,310
do you know about that?

1647
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:39,700
No.

1648
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,420
Homo Floresiensis I believe is
the term that the hobbit people,

1649
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:44,680
they were three foot tall,

1650
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,790
little like chimp,

1651
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,730
like people buy pedal little elves.

1652
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:49,541
I mean,

1653
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:53,020
they lived on a fucking island and they
think that they might've even prayed on

1654
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:53,980
human children.

1655
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,720
They think that they might've been,

1656
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,790
that,

1657
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,090
that,

1658
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,660
that could be total horse shit.

1659
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:00,040
I don't know why that was even theorize,

1660
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,790
but they thought that maybe that might
have been one of the reasons why they

1661
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,010
killed them off that the human beings,

1662
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:06,941
yeah.

1663
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:09,400
That there was some preparation
between the two species.

1664
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,141
That's it.

1665
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:10,990
Just a theory.

1666
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,800
Um,

1667
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,910
and it's not mine by the way,

1668
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:14,750
but they think that that,

1669
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:19,600
that has occurred in some places were
chimps have got in and stolen babies and

1670
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:20,470
they eat the babies.

1671
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,450
But that's just,

1672
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,820
yeah,

1673
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,870
but in your little people.

1674
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,171
Yeah.

1675
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:25,270
But what they're saying is that primates,

1676
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:25,800
yes.

1677
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,460
We'll sort of people like,

1678
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:28,181
I mean they were very,

1679
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:28,451
very,

1680
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:29,141
very primitive,

1681
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,140
but they lived as recently as 10,000,

1682
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:33,310
15,000 years ago.

1683
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,600
So if 10,000,

1684
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:35,440
50,000 years ago,

1685
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:37,300
humans weren't in this exact form.

1686
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,030
And we were dealing with these
weird little chimp people like this,

1687
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:40,864
look at these things.

1688
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,980
Like they have the,

1689
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:42,091
uh,

1690
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:42,220
the,

1691
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,600
the various forms of humans,

1692
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,440
that little tiny thing.

1693
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,130
That's it.

1694
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,790
That's the homofloresiensis Jamie,

1695
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,160
see if you could pull up
a better picture of it.

1696
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,140
Cause there's some interesting
drawings that they did,

1697
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:50,980
like individual ones,

1698
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:52,000
like one of the ones you showed earlier.

1699
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:52,530
Well,

1700
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:57,530
there's homo erectus look like to do with
a big Dick or wrecked homo erectus at

1701
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,370
two and he's gay.

1702
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,530
Bad.

1703
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:05,930
Yeah.

1704
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:06,763
It's terrible joke.

1705
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,021
This,

1706
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:08,320
um,

1707
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,640
but this hobbit person thing,

1708
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,240
right?

1709
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,240
I mean this absolutely without
doubt walked alongside with people.

1710
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,520
So if you see that person there and PR,

1711
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,820
well that guy's yoked.

1712
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,743
Who is that guy?

1713
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,080
The cokes like Gleason t
bow looking at he's stacked,

1714
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,820
but that's a rare person.

1715
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,840
Don't compare that size.

1716
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:26,860
But the um,

1717
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,990
the little hobbit guy right next to him,

1718
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,300
it's really fascinating stuff man.

1719
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,380
Does that means that all those stories
that the Indonesian people would tell,

1720
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,251
uh,

1721
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,090
and there's a,

1722
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,600
there's a,

1723
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,350
a like a la,

1724
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,600
the Orang Pendek that um,

1725
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,660
there's a jungle people
say is still alive.

1726
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:45,820
They still think there's a small
population of these things.

1727
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:49,120
It's still exist and they
call it the Orang Pendek.

1728
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,280
So little a chimp,

1729
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:54,550
like a tiny person that
lives in the forest.

1730
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,930
Fucking crazy man.

1731
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,590
If those,

1732
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,400
if there is a small amount of those people
that are still actually actually left

1733
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,760
living in some crazy rain forest
somewhere that's not outside the realm of

1734
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:04,594
possibility,

1735
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,500
much more likely than bigfoot,

1736
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,700
that there's this little hobbit,

1737
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:12,100
man that's still alive because
that was always the legend.

1738
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,170
And when they found this
in the island of Flores,

1739
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:14,411
they're like,

1740
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,191
Holy Shit.

1741
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:16,750
Like three Flores.

1742
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,220
Um,

1743
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,170
that's a good question.

1744
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,003
It's near Florida.

1745
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:21,490
No,

1746
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,323
it's near Flores.

1747
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:22,930
Uh,

1748
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:23,231
yeah.

1749
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:23,860
I don't know.

1750
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,730
I don't know where it is.

1751
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,440
I think it's like Sumatra
or something like that.

1752
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:27,274
Maybe I just made that up.

1753
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,670
Isn't that like a,

1754
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,930
what part of the world is it?

1755
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,010
Probably all vitamin D deficient.

1756
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,230
All those people to be so short.

1757
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,093
Okay.

1758
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,230
In Indonesia,

1759
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,440
Indonesia,

1760
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:39,711
well,

1761
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:41,660
there's a term called um,

1762
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,081
uh,

1763
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,950
island dwarfism and it
applies to primates.

1764
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,300
Sometimes it plays to elephants.

1765
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:51,170
You get like these tiny pygmy
elephants and that are on islands,

1766
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:52,580
but not to lizards.

1767
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,020
Lizards get bigger.

1768
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:55,790
If you leave lizards on an island,

1769
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:56,630
they actually grow.

1770
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,220
That's why you have like the Komodo
dragons and like big fucking crazy lizards

1771
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:02,300
like crocodiles and shit.

1772
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,070
They actually grow when
they're on islands.

1773
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,990
Yeah.

1774
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,650
The reason,

1775
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,210
because they have
everything can't get away,

1776
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,450
so they just eat everything.

1777
00:51:09,451 --> 00:51:10,730
He's his gang up on bitches.

1778
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,743
Just take them out.

1779
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,471
You know,

1780
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:14,900
if you're on an island with
a family of Komodo dragons,

1781
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,100
good luck.

1782
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,170
One day they're going to
find out they can eat you.

1783
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:21,200
You know they're going to sneak up on
you and find out that they can eat you.

1784
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,150
And if you can't go anywhere
because you're on an island,

1785
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,590
the lizards are always going to win.

1786
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,993
Strange and that,

1787
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,003
yeah.

1788
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,013
Would you looking at,

1789
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:31,751
Oh,

1790
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:32,680
the Komodo Dragon.

1791
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:33,611
Oh,

1792
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:34,444
what about it?

1793
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,610
I was expecting a picture up there.

1794
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,780
He's looking for,

1795
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,790
you never see the commercial.

1796
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,430
It was on a double o seven
had one where you really,

1797
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:43,240
do you have a pet?

1798
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,660
Yeah.

1799
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,530
So it was in the movie,

1800
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:45,850
which is the last one.

1801
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:47,470
The last one where the radio is.

1802
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,130
What is his name?

1803
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:48,431
Daniel.

1804
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:48,820
Craig.

1805
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,420
Daniel Craig.

1806
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:49,571
Yeah.

1807
00:51:49,571 --> 00:51:50,021
Where would they,

1808
00:51:50,021 --> 00:51:53,050
they were in Hong Kong or a at a casino?

1809
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,430
Yeah.

1810
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,850
They accident evil.

1811
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,810
Fucking lizard.

1812
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:59,410
So could you imagine you hear
that walking outside of your tent,

1813
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,210
your wash up on the beach,

1814
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:01,691
like don't worry,

1815
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:01,931
honey.

1816
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:02,764
We have a tent.

1817
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,530
Look at that fucking creepy thing.

1818
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,850
Probably hasn't changed in forever.

1819
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:12,740
Neat.

1820
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,180
Remorseless Monster.

1821
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,180
It's fascinating to think that
that was the entire earth,

1822
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:17,610
isn't it?

1823
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,443
Yeah.

1824
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,080
I mean that's essentially a dinosaur,

1825
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:21,470
right?

1826
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:21,980
Right.

1827
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,240
It's about as close to the dinosaurs.

1828
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:24,740
You can get them in crocodiles.

1829
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,470
How much different is there
from a crocodile to a dinosaur?

1830
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:28,304
It seems pretty,

1831
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,203
pretty similar.

1832
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,063
I want one of those.

1833
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,240
You want to crocodile?

1834
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,380
Not when a Komodo Dragon,

1835
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,423
what would you do with it?

1836
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,230
Would you stand up there and
your underwear and take pictures?

1837
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,880
What'd you do?

1838
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,030
Oh,

1839
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:38,990
I'm afraid to get bitten.

1840
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:40,880
No,

1841
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,080
what a great watchdog.

1842
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,130
Not really.

1843
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:43,701
It's going to eat.

1844
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,830
You watch good watchdogs like their owner.

1845
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,600
That thing doesn't give a shit about you.

1846
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,840
You want a good watch dog?

1847
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,330
I'll give it away to someone I don't like.

1848
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:50,721
Yeah,

1849
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:51,020
get,

1850
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,670
get out.

1851
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,100
You know,

1852
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,933
get a bird.

1853
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,770
Get something that squawks
when people are outside,

1854
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,270
get a flamingo or something.

1855
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,860
I've got two cats and two dogs.

1856
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:58,310
That's enough.

1857
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,170
He cocks I guess make noises.

1858
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,600
Hunter s Thompson used to have
him in his place and Woody Creek.

1859
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,560
When people come near the peacocks to go,

1860
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,630
let me crazy noises and I'll let
you know that people are coming.

1861
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,450
The good guards or at least alert.

1862
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:12,290
It's got alarms.

1863
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,730
Military Macola too.

1864
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:14,743
Yeah.

1865
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,321
So,

1866
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:16,154
um,

1867
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,230
so what,

1868
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,380
what other stuff do you think besides
this glue to on what other stuff do you

1869
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:24,230
think that people should be taken
on a regular basis that they're not?

1870
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,500
That's an incredible question.

1871
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:33,830
There are a lot of things that we're
losing in our water for say for instance,

1872
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:34,500
uh,

1873
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,580
we get bottled water.

1874
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,503
What's in it?

1875
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,460
Nothing filtered water,

1876
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:39,211
filtered water,

1877
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:40,650
no minerals were the minerals,

1878
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,031
the minerals.

1879
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:46,650
We're probably all to some degree mineral
deficient in one of the ones that the

1880
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:50,010
federal government talked about
back in the late nineties,

1881
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,000
uh,

1882
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,240
was c Everett Koop talked about
it in fact was a chromium.

1883
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:59,040
Chromium is an anti
diabetic because it helps,

1884
00:53:59,130 --> 00:53:59,380
uh,

1885
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,810
insulin work better in your body.

1886
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,390
It's called the glucose tolerance factor.

1887
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,470
Chromium.

1888
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,400
And we found that,

1889
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,640
uh,

1890
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,960
because of our farming technology
that we haven't been burning the,

1891
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,860
the leftover crop to get the
ash potash back into the soil,

1892
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:15,420
that we're losing a lot of the minerals.

1893
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,240
Uh,

1894
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,620
we,

1895
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,270
everything we get is filtered.

1896
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,880
So we lose all the trace magnesium,

1897
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:21,714
molybdenum,

1898
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,740
all the trace elements that we need for
very important chemical pathways in our

1899
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:26,574
body.

1900
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,970
So we're running around with
a deficiency of function.

1901
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,960
And the only way to improve upon that
function is to replenish minerals.

1902
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,460
And you can get trace minerals.

1903
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:35,761
I mean,

1904
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:39,210
it doesn't really matter where you
get as long as it's a high quality

1905
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:41,220
bioavailable kind of product.

1906
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:44,870
There are a lot of vitamins that are
a lot of minerals that you can absorb

1907
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:45,900
because they're cheap.

1908
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,370
Sulfated ones.

1909
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,170
Getting the citrate is a lot better.

1910
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:53,160
The glucarate and the fumarate or much
better forms of whether or not it's a

1911
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:55,710
zinc or magnesium or so forth.

1912
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,900
Do you think people should
take them in a colloidal farm?

1913
00:54:57,901 --> 00:54:59,610
Like how has that Hook colloidal minerals?

1914
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,390
Neurosis is a suspended one,

1915
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:02,580
so it gets absorbed a lot better.

1916
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:04,440
Instead of taking it in
a compressed tablets,

1917
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,330
I don't use anything that's compressed.

1918
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,140
I use only a powdered encapsuled powder,

1919
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,910
uh,

1920
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,740
with a vegetable out of code on it.

1921
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,400
When that,

1922
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,030
um,

1923
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,800
so like when you,

1924
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,510
when you take colloidal minerals,

1925
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,800
they collect them from some mineral rich
streams or something like that or the

1926
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:23,400
ad.

1927
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,810
How do they,

1928
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:24,220
if they're,

1929
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,470
if they're artificial,

1930
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:25,801
you know,

1931
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:26,800
they're making it too.

1932
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:30,480
They're suspending it so
that it's easy absorbed.

1933
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,310
There is a cistern in,

1934
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,030
um,

1935
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,980
New Zealand where,

1936
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,850
um,

1937
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:40,710
it's about a 50 million year old sister
and which has a blend from erosion from

1938
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:42,450
the walls of the sister and uh,

1939
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,470
with natural water,

1940
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:44,550
clean,

1941
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,890
fresh water and it has a balance in it,

1942
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:49,560
which gives you a water a Ph of eight.

1943
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,240
And uh,

1944
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:51,451
you know,

1945
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:54,690
I don't want to really get into the
thing about acid based kind of chemistry.

1946
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,770
What does that mean by a Ph?

1947
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,240
A Ph eight is,

1948
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,630
uh,

1949
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,710
more Aukland,

1950
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,360
which is called Aukland warrant.

1951
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,590
And the benefits of alkaline
water versus acidic water acidic.

1952
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,340
Um,

1953
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:05,581
you know,

1954
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:09,060
we have ionizers that take a regular
tap water and make it into smaller

1955
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:09,894
molecules.

1956
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,490
What is an interesting molecule?

1957
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:13,670
Because it doesn't stay singular.

1958
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:14,880
It's just not one h,

1959
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:16,020
two o water molecule.

1960
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:20,100
It clumps together in a lot of water
molecules stick together because of the

1961
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:21,450
electrical attraction of it,

1962
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,530
of the Ma,

1963
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,860
each molecule to the next

1964
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,440
it would ionize water is no ionize water,

1965
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:28,150
puts a charge in it to separated.

1966
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,500
So it's more absorbable.

1967
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:29,920
I mean,

1968
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,350
I've had patients come into the officer's,

1969
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:31,781
Hey doc,

1970
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:32,610
I'm drinking,

1971
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:32,801
you know,

1972
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:36,700
my eight ounces every two
hours and I'm still thirsty.

1973
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,400
And it's because they're
drinking acidic water,

1974
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:43,060
which clumps together and doesn't
allow for bio available water.

1975
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,920
And you'll start seeing
some stuff that says,

1976
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:45,071
you know,

1977
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,860
bio available water and you know,

1978
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:52,861
it's going gonna take some time for our
brain to accept it are our position,

1979
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:53,650
uh,

1980
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:57,580
to accept these new trends
because they say it's,

1981
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:57,731
you know,

1982
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:58,564
it's bullshit.

1983
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,650
You don't need Aukland.

1984
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:01,530
And yet there's no
thing with acid outcome.

1985
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,440
There are articles that,

1986
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:02,801
you know,

1987
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,120
refute the benefits of it,

1988
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,810
but I see it in clinical application
with patients who have failed certain

1989
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:12,790
medication and they go onto an
alkalizing protocol and they get better.

1990
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,250
And I documented they shouldn't be better,

1991
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:16,030
but they're better.

1992
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:19,120
They're symptomatic complaints of
pain and swelling and all that's gone.

1993
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,103
Why do you say shouldn't?

1994
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,820
Why it shouldn't be costs?

1995
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,220
In my medical training,

1996
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,301
I don't see,

1997
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:25,660
you know,

1998
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,291
in my training,

1999
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:31,291
I've been in practice 32 years and had
13 and a half years of a training with a

2000
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,960
year and a half of research
and it shouldn't happen,

2001
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:35,920
but it is happening.

2002
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,760
So when you go back and you
look at the fringe science,

2003
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,050
you start realizing that on the fringe
it hasn't come full cycle into the core

2004
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:44,460
of,

2005
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,440
of our belief system that uh,

2006
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,880
the products have,

2007
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,720
um,

2008
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,811
uh,

2009
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:54,811
means what Aukland water has a means by
which it changes the acid base of our

2010
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:58,780
body and our body does much
better in Aukland situations.

2011
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,070
Inflammation.

2012
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,870
If your body is acidic,

2013
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,030
more inflammatory diseases occur,

2014
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:05,530
but you can't prove it.

2015
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,210
It's supposition.

2016
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,571
It's,

2017
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,404
you know,

2018
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,400
speculation.

2019
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,410
We don't have enough hard documentation
to prove it and there's a lot of

2020
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:19,411
resistance to develop that hard scientific
information right near right now.

2021
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,580
And with everything that's on the fringe,

2022
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,000
everything that's new that comes into
medicine does a lot of resistance are

2023
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,290
cycled in medicine is about
30 years because you've got
30 years doctors who are

2024
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:31,510
in practice for 30 years
who control everything.

2025
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:36,511
And that's old school stuff that I used
to work on was 20 years old doctors

2026
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:37,811
nowadays.

2027
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:42,811
I mean I interact with training doctors
and the information that they're running

2028
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:45,250
their practices on so antiquated,

2029
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,080
you know,

2030
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,080
it's like doctor still think that
testosterone causes prostate cancer and

2031
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:55,870
there's not a single shred
of evidence that proves it.

2032
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,390
One of our docs from Harvard,

2033
00:58:58,391 --> 00:59:01,660
doctor Abraham Morgan Fellow wrote the
book to start from for life where he

2034
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:02,590
spends his,

2035
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,401
you know,

2036
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:04,151
academic,

2037
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:04,630
uh,

2038
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:09,630
life at Harvard and in Boston proving
that there's nothing to substantiate that

2039
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:12,130
testosterone causes cancer.

2040
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:14,740
What does cause test testicular cancer?

2041
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:16,450
Cause that's a really common one with men,

2042
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,170
uh,

2043
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,780
to stickler as seminomas
to stick your cancer.

2044
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,003
Um,

2045
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,321
you know,

2046
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:22,130
there's

2047
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,820
genetic predisposition for it and
there's also thermal temperature.

2048
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,990
There's an increased occurrence
in men who have had what they call

2049
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:34,910
cryptorchidism crypto is hidden testicle
where they haven't had descended

2050
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:35,930
testicles.

2051
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,320
So if their pediatrician was on
time and gave them a shot of Hcg,

2052
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,340
which causes the testicle to drop,

2053
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,650
then it drops out of the
98 degree temperature that
the testicle isn't made to

2054
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,484
function it.

2055
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,440
That's why it hangs out in artistic,

2056
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:52,461
in our sick,

2057
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:53,870
in our ball sack.

2058
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:54,420
Okay.

2059
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,550
Stupid design.

2060
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,030
Well,

2061
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,050
but there's a reason for it.

2062
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,460
They want it to be degrees,

2063
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:59,001
uh,

2064
00:59:59,001 --> 00:59:59,601
less so.

2065
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,790
It doesn't induce cancer.

2066
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,360
Our sperm are germ cells and germ cells
have a chemical germ cells like cancer

2067
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,760
and germ cells have a
high reproductive rate.

2068
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,010
What happens when you get fixed?

2069
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,270
When a dude gets fixed?

2070
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:14,391
Oh,

2071
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,530
you mean for this cord?

2072
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:16,551
Oh,

2073
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:17,384
when it cuts cords.

2074
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,260
Yeah.

2075
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,093
What is it called?

2076
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,510
What's it called?

2077
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,230
Vasectomy.

2078
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:21,840
Vasectomy.

2079
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,430
Yeah.

2080
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:22,840
Yeah.

2081
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,631
I'm an east coast.

2082
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:25,400
You're familiar to say by vasectomy.

2083
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,330
Oh,

2084
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,163
I thought it was,

2085
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:28,640
it's a v the snip,

2086
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,271
snip,

2087
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:30,050
snip.

2088
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:30,860
Come up with a word.

2089
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,131
Right.

2090
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:31,964
For the sector.

2091
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,260
Is there any half sick to me?

2092
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,400
Is that bad for people?

2093
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,333
Um,

2094
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:35,900
no,

2095
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,830
it's not bad.

2096
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:37,101
It's,

2097
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:37,341
you know,

2098
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:39,420
stops having kids that you
shouldn't have for subs,

2099
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:41,810
having kids that you would like
to have that you can't afford.

2100
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,141
Right.

2101
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:42,974
But is there any,

2102
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:43,850
absolutely.

2103
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,350
But is there any medical,

2104
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,780
no concerns that someone would have?

2105
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,260
No.

2106
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,093
Um,

2107
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:49,880
the,

2108
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,170
the uncomfortable nature of the procedures
psychologically I think is worse than

2109
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:55,580
the physical aspect to it.

2110
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,050
So do you think dudes lose,

2111
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,220
like when,

2112
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,054
when they,

2113
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,960
they're shooting blanks,

2114
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:03,230
they lose like the psychological
feeling of actually being potent,

2115
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,040
um,

2116
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,570
because they have just dead calm.

2117
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:12,320
There's calpers pellets and they have
the prostate which generate fluids.

2118
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,400
It's not just the,

2119
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,420
the swimmers,

2120
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,280
you know,

2121
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,150
there's definitely something
missing to the batch though.

2122
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,820
There's a volume is decreased,

2123
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,290
but there were ways of increasing volume.

2124
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:25,610
There's volume that's decreased
and you don't have as intense of a,

2125
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,473
um,

2126
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,570
orgasms,

2127
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,120
orgasms or ropes.

2128
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,590
So they're not as good.

2129
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:31,760
Orgasms are not as good.

2130
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:34,280
And in the majority of people,

2131
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:35,420
there's no effect on it.

2132
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,900
The majority of people know what if
you're one of those people and you already

2133
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,520
got snipped and it's
right and you're like,

2134
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,001
oh,

2135
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:41,834
fuck me.

2136
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,000
What if coming goes from
the greatest thing ever?

2137
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:44,450
Tell him,

2138
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,283
all right,

2139
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,133
whatever.

2140
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,170
Then you have to sit on the
couch and talk about it.

2141
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,360
Then he got to reattach this,

2142
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:54,140
the plumbing,

2143
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:54,741
I can do that,

2144
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:55,041
right?

2145
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,620
They go in there and micro
surgically reattach your,

2146
01:01:57,621 --> 01:01:57,890
uh,

2147
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,730
correct packer pump.

2148
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,760
They could do that or us that go
in and they just suck out the,

2149
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:02,450
uh,

2150
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,750
the sperm from your testicle,

2151
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:04,603
the needle.

2152
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,350
Oh,

2153
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,670
hey,

2154
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,090
that's,

2155
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:10,610
that doesn't seem like anybody
should have to do that option.

2156
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,780
So that's the option.

2157
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,340
They do it every now and again.

2158
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,613
Oh Man.

2159
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,460
How long would they have to do that for?

2160
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,010
Like,

2161
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:18,960
that's a male,

2162
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,310
like a mail shot.

2163
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,090
If,

2164
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:21,510
no,

2165
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,740
if a male has a low sperm count and
he wants to get his wife knocked up,

2166
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,150
uh,

2167
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,890
they'll try with growth hormone,

2168
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:29,611
testosterone,

2169
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:30,061
zinc,

2170
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:33,270
and other ways of trying to stimulate
increase in the sperm count.

2171
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,220
But if they're not producing sperm,

2172
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:35,760
uh,

2173
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,660
for whatever reason,

2174
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,531
they can take a needle,

2175
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:40,800
put it in and aspirate to suck outs.

2176
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,000
That's sounds crazy.

2177
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,440
Aspirate is a better word.

2178
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,090
It means suck out.

2179
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:45,421
Yeah.

2180
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:46,530
I would have asked you what to ask,

2181
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:47,383
right?

2182
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,640
So yes.

2183
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,480
Aspiration.

2184
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:51,820
This,

2185
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:52,750
the idea of it,

2186
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,760
like if you said the ETA
stick a needle in my Gsi,

2187
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:56,521
I'd be like,

2188
01:02:56,521 --> 01:02:57,030
all right.

2189
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,490
You know the deal and
my shoulder over there.

2190
01:02:58,491 --> 01:02:59,160
All right,

2191
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,290
but you're talking about pulling
something out of my penis.

2192
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,610
I'm really not comfortable with that.

2193
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,690
But out of your testicle.

2194
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:04,850
Yeah,

2195
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:05,350
man.

2196
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,020
It doesn't seem like a good idea.

2197
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,090
That seems like it's got
to be a way around that,

2198
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,060
but that's how we fix him.

2199
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:11,790
Fertility when it's not the woman's fault.

2200
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,580
Jesus though a fucking needle
and your Dick Together.

2201
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,673
It happens.

2202
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:17,820
Yeah.

2203
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,631
The adult industry,

2204
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:19,910
they use Caverject.

2205
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,050
They inject in the bass.

2206
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:23,520
I love how you say the adult
industry or what should I say?

2207
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:24,280
Porn.

2208
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,113
That's what it is.

2209
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,640
The industry.

2210
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:27,900
What about the child industry?

2211
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:28,734
Is it different?

2212
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,060
You have a different industry.

2213
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,300
You can't use the term adult if you
can't use the term child in the same

2214
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:34,050
business.

2215
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:34,320
Okay.

2216
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,580
Now like what is the industry
that these is that all adults are,

2217
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,510
they just want to fuck.

2218
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,650
Like that's the adult.

2219
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,750
The real adult is just
like living your life.

2220
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:43,561
It's a bunch of bullshit,

2221
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:44,760
but this is what you really want to do.

2222
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,050
You really just want to fuck.

2223
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,730
So that's why we call
it the adult industry.

2224
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,810
That's a terrible message for the children
that your life is based in Thailand,

2225
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:54,330
sexually sexual pressure as you get older.

2226
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,610
What do you come to the two
most important things in life?

2227
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,630
Um,

2228
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,620
food and sleep.

2229
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:59,490
Okay.

2230
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,690
Sexual pleasure.

2231
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:01,350
Of course.

2232
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,183
I'm just joking.

2233
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:03,660
Just joking.

2234
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,210
I know you're,

2235
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,240
but it's just funny
that you used that word.

2236
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:06,740
Adults,

2237
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,970
adult people use that.

2238
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,510
It's like urban for black people,

2239
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,501
you know,

2240
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:11,730
it's like they don't
want to say black people,

2241
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:14,970
but they can say urban and it means
exact same thing and somehow or another

2242
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:16,020
people just let it slide.

2243
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,230
So what should I use instead
of the adult industry?

2244
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:19,650
Uh,

2245
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,390
the porn porn or far,

2246
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,310
it's nothing wrong with porn industry.

2247
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:25,020
They use a chemical,

2248
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,120
which in fact comes from a,

2249
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:27,830
a woman,

2250
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,260
uh,

2251
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:28,980
PGE,

2252
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,400
which Prostoglandin e and they inject
it in the base of the penis and it makes

2253
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,830
them have a erection that lasts
for like two to four hours,

2254
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:35,730
like a baseball bat.

2255
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,900
That's such a strange thing.

2256
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,250
They take something out of the woman,

2257
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,410
they inject into the man
and the man gets rock hard.

2258
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,750
Do you think that that is like they're
in a woman to make a man or wrecked like

2259
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:50,751
she has the ability to do that chemical
in the man in his sperm when he had

2260
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:52,500
Jackie plates in a woman who is pregnant,

2261
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:53,610
it can cause her to deliver.

2262
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,971
Maybe,

2263
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:55,130
you know,

2264
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:56,920
I'm okay.

2265
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,753
I fuck.

2266
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,780
So what is this stuff that a woman
has that they take out with a needle?

2267
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,100
You don't take it out for,

2268
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:05,730
but it's a,

2269
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,050
it's a chemical in her.

2270
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:07,501
Well,

2271
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:08,334
how did she have it?

2272
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,050
Where's it in her body?

2273
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:10,900
It's her body.

2274
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,750
She had to come out in a
sweat or anything like that.

2275
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:12,961
Oh,

2276
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:14,100
you'd like pheromones?

2277
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:14,880
Yes.

2278
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,690
Um,

2279
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,040
I'm not sure to be perfectly must

2280
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,300
come out of her vagina for sure.

2281
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:19,841
Absolutely.

2282
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:20,510
Out of the bag.

2283
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:21,910
That's why we're all attracted to him.

2284
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:22,450
Yeah.

2285
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,220
It comes out of China,

2286
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:23,850
not the one.

2287
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:24,340
Right.

2288
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,750
Well that's not true.

2289
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,690
You can be attracted to both Mr. Gordon.

2290
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,913
How dare you.

2291
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,813
ABS.

2292
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,270
It's not an either or situation
services free for all.

2293
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,060
Here it is a damn Claypool.

2294
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:36,611
Yeah,

2295
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:36,921
but mean.

2296
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:37,810
That only makes sense.

2297
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,290
Why a eating pussy gives guys hard on,

2298
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,721
sorry,

2299
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:41,500
I had to say it that way.

2300
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:41,910
Right?

2301
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,280
Look,

2302
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,001
it's the pheromone.

2303
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:43,720
Get upset at me,

2304
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,351
ladies and gentlemen.

2305
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:45,730
What I'm going to say fellatio and you go,

2306
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:46,564
who are you?

2307
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:47,853
I know her.

2308
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,000
Fellatio Felice.

2309
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,063
Yeah,

2310
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,393
so

2311
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:53,783
absolutely.

2312
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,693
What can I do?

2313
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,260
You're a bad influence.

2314
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,831
No,

2315
01:05:56,831 --> 01:05:57,011
no,

2316
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:57,610
no.

2317
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,360
You're a great guy.

2318
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,370
Semi Professional.

2319
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,253
This,

2320
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,580
it makes sense that a woman would have
something in her body with the smell of

2321
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:06,580
it actually gives the guy erection
because that absolutely works.

2322
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:07,000
Look,

2323
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
look at the animals.

2324
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,180
The guy gets horny during the estrous,

2325
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:14,100
which is the female cycle of an animal
and she's throwing out pheromones.

2326
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,840
So obviously gals were throwing up
pheromones and when you meet it,

2327
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:17,320
you know,

2328
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,200
you stand in front of,

2329
01:06:18,201 --> 01:06:20,080
I'll tell you the man side of it later,

2330
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,790
when you stand in front
of a group of women,

2331
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:24,430
there are certain of the women that
you're more attracted to than others.

2332
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,120
There was a study done at Ucla where
they were looking at this issue of

2333
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,440
pheromones and I apologize,

2334
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:32,380
I forget the female doctor's name who
did all this research and developed a

2335
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:33,940
product which guys can buy.

2336
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,140
Of course there was a check.

2337
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,460
It was a chick making money on that smell.

2338
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:38,343
Absolutely.

2339
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,000
What she found was that,

2340
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:40,863
um,

2341
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,400
she took women and she introduced
them to guys that were fat,

2342
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:46,420
that we're lazy,

2343
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:46,811
you know,

2344
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:47,770
from smoking marijuana,

2345
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:47,950
right?

2346
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:48,101
Yeah.

2347
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:49,480
Those legacy guys,

2348
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,680
lazy potheads.

2349
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,820
They didn't see him,

2350
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,860
but they had the shirts from these guys,

2351
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:57,010
so they smelled the shirt to smell
the perspiration that was on it.

2352
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:01,480
And what happened almost a hundred
percent of the time was they were able to

2353
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,610
pick the guy that was healthy,

2354
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,920
that was a physically active,

2355
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:09,610
that produced this pure
pussy perspiration.

2356
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:13,360
And they found that it was guys that
were healthy that didn't have any medical

2357
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:13,901
conditions,

2358
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:15,990
so women can sense through the pheromones.

2359
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:20,530
So the pheromones transmit understanding
about the condition of the person.

2360
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,491
They picked,

2361
01:07:21,491 --> 01:07:22,480
the guys that were fat,

2362
01:07:22,481 --> 01:07:23,830
they picked the guys that were healthy,

2363
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:28,120
so she took the chemicals
or the synthesize this
stuff that they found in the

2364
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:28,954
healthy guys.

2365
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,010
And that's her Fairmont.

2366
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:31,430
That's fascinating.

2367
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,460
And injured 50 bucks I think
for a little bottle of perfume.

2368
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:36,400
And I think that totally makes sense.

2369
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:36,611
I mean,

2370
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:39,790
if we know that pheromones exist and
you know that when you were like really

2371
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,150
attracted to someone to the,

2372
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:42,040
the intensity,

2373
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,830
like when you're touching
them and just being near them,

2374
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,640
they like it,

2375
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,640
like take turns on something.

2376
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:52,870
And it absolutely could be for
emotional as well as physical,

2377
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:57,040
as well as pleasure based in sensitivity
than it'd be some pheromone exchanges

2378
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:57,400
too.

2379
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:57,611
Right.

2380
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:00,520
But I think that the pheromones
really set you up for everything.

2381
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:01,331
Look yet,

2382
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:01,631
you know,

2383
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:02,020
in,

2384
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:02,411
in,

2385
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,160
um,

2386
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,300
it's neuroendocrinology,

2387
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:06,490
which is the way hormones
work in the brain,

2388
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,260
which is what I spend
most of my time doing.

2389
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,100
Um,

2390
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,450
pheromones trigger,

2391
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,200
um,

2392
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,460
pleasurable centers,

2393
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,660
centers in the brain.

2394
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:14,320
You know,

2395
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,130
we have centers in a low libido area,

2396
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,320
which is another way saying
the sex area of the brain.

2397
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:19,910
We have an area that stimulated by,

2398
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:24,710
not just to stastrom but estradal in
a recent article that came out of Jama

2399
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:25,281
three,

2400
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,114
four months ago,

2401
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:30,440
and in Dr Abraham Morgan Fallon was on
the news talking about it on good morning

2402
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:31,340
America or something.

2403
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:36,790
And men need estrogen dial in order to
have a fully functioning sexual mindset

2404
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,750
and women need to stop stroke.

2405
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,010
I have a question for you.

2406
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,960
Has there ever been
anyone so fucking dumb?

2407
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:45,650
They named their kid
libido has to be right.

2408
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:46,730
There has to be a guy.

2409
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,480
It's like I'm telling you this kid always
going to want to do is fuck it when

2410
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:51,314
Jamie has a chance.

2411
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,593
There must be,

2412
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,760
there's a libido out there somewhere,

2413
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:56,810
somewhere along the line.

2414
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:57,703
It's gotta be,

2415
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,420
you're looking at the
names that are out there.

2416
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,931
Shane.

2417
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:00,764
Shame,

2418
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,060
Star light star.

2419
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:04,490
Bright Jesus fucking Christ.

2420
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,190
What a what a mad mad world.

2421
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,600
Yeah.

2422
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,433
Love movie.

2423
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,190
Yeah.

2424
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:10,381
The,

2425
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:13,670
so when we were talking about,

2426
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,210
um,

2427
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:16,040
different things that you do,

2428
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:18,040
one of the things that I
didn't mention is that you're,

2429
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,193
you're uh,

2430
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:19,910
one of the,

2431
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,230
I don't want to say a pioneer,

2432
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:25,490
but one of the more prominent guys when
it comes to understanding the effects of

2433
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:30,470
traumatic brain injuries and working
with guys are working with boxers and

2434
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:31,161
working with,

2435
01:09:31,161 --> 01:09:31,550
uh,

2436
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,000
you know,

2437
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,770
various athletes that have suffered.

2438
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,990
I know you've worked a
lot of people that I know.

2439
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:36,873
Right.

2440
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:37,280
Uh,

2441
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,330
did you get involved in all of this?

2442
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,680
Great question.

2443
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:40,743
Um,

2444
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,541
you know,

2445
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:46,541
I've been practicing a hormonal modulation
therapy since about 1995 and I myself

2446
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:48,291
was,

2447
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:52,460
I'm not feeling so great
between the age of 3,446.

2448
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:52,851
And in fact,

2449
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:57,650
I was on antidepressant and a obese
losing my hair and just not a very happy

2450
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,603
camper.

2451
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:03,590
So I went to a company in Las Vegas and
paid them a lot of money in 97 and was

2452
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:05,870
diagnosed with having
three hormone deficiencies,

2453
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:10,490
growth home to stoss thrown in thyroid
and just thinking it was genetic,

2454
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,850
ended up going on to a
replenishment treatment.

2455
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,750
And in my practice I had started shifting
over to hormone modulation that they

2456
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:20,870
used to call it what they
call anti aging medicine.

2457
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:24,680
I turned to coin called Interventional
endocrinology because I don't think the

2458
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:28,880
term anti aging in medicine is a
proper term for the general masses.

2459
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:33,590
It's a great buzzword to
get an understanding of what
you know we do in the area

2460
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:34,910
of interventional endocrinology.

2461
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,930
So treating a lot of people
with a hormone deficiency.

2462
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:43,931
In 2004 I'm reading an article out of
Turkey about pugilists boxers where they

2463
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:49,100
had this uncanny high occurrence of growth
hormone deficiency and that I call my

2464
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:49,940
epiphany article.

2465
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,790
I read that it all made sense.

2466
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,590
Head trauma creates a situation
that leads to hormonal deficiency.

2467
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:02,620
So I went back to my population from 1995
to 2004 and started interviewing them

2468
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:08,801
again to see who had had accidents and
almost every single person had a very

2469
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,170
clear cut motor vehicle accident.

2470
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:13,440
In the first book that I wrote,

2471
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:14,610
interventional endocrinology,

2472
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:19,611
chapter five talks about a 17 year
old kid who came to me at 21 with um,

2473
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,360
significant mood changes,

2474
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,101
depression,

2475
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:23,934
anxiety,

2476
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:24,900
isolation.

2477
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,130
He couldn't gain weight.

2478
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:31,330
It turned out he was hormone deficient
and when he was 21 years of age,

2479
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:35,880
I go back to him and find out
that he had a motorcycle accident.

2480
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:37,210
Was in a coma for three days.

2481
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:37,411
No.

2482
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,040
Wow.

2483
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:43,040
So I've got kids right now that
have had motor vehicle accidents,

2484
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,220
slip and falls,

2485
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,380
blunt head trauma,

2486
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:50,390
assaults that have had a develop hormonal
deficiency and you can develop the

2487
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:56,841
hormone deficiency because the head trauma
can interrupt areas of the brain that

2488
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:01,620
regulate hormone production by the
pituitary called the master gland in the

2489
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:02,454
brain.

2490
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:07,490
There's a regulatory sensor that test
the blood every microsecond to see if

2491
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:08,970
there's a balance of girl tone,

2492
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:09,550
testosterone,

2493
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,250
estrogen and all the hormones in our body.

2494
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,590
And if there's a deficiency of it,

2495
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:16,290
it sends a signal to the master gland,

2496
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:20,430
the pituitary to tell it to increase
the production of whatever hormone it

2497
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:22,770
perceives as being deficient or low.

2498
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:23,881
On the other hand,

2499
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:24,900
if it's too high,

2500
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,420
the same area of the brain called the
hypothalamus tells the pituitary to shut

2501
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:31,410
down or decrease the
production of hormones.

2502
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,240
So if you're making not enough growth
hormone or not enough IGF one which is the

2503
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:37,200
market for growth hormone,

2504
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,510
it'll tell the brain to
produce more growth hormone.

2505
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,210
And the same thing with testosterone.

2506
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:48,050
So I started looking at this area
since 2004 and the literature was just

2507
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:53,070
starting to burgeon with a lot of
documentation research that have been done

2508
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,320
showing that people who have head
trauma have testosterone deficiency.

2509
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,153
Number one,

2510
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,420
growth hormone deficiency.

2511
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:01,140
Number two,

2512
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,771
thyroid.

2513
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:02,610
Number three,

2514
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,241
cortisol,

2515
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:05,340
which is the adaptive kind of hormone,

2516
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,630
the stress hormone.

2517
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,831
And I had one,

2518
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:11,580
two and three I had growth from deficiency
to stocks from deficiency in thyroid

2519
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:12,414
deficiency.

2520
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:17,820
And in 2007 I had been seeing
a lot of people retired,

2521
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:22,821
NFL football and rugby and a lot
of sports players and boxers.

2522
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:23,670
Like,

2523
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:24,870
I can say James,

2524
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,500
Tony,

2525
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,160
um,

2526
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:26,700
and,

2527
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:26,851
uh,

2528
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:31,380
they were documented as having hormone
deficiency and we went on to ESPN outside

2529
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:35,820
the line in 2007 and showed their lab
results and they talked about how much

2530
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:40,260
better they felt when they had their
hormones returned to normal levels,

2531
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,720
replaced a physiological levels,

2532
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:44,100
not bodybuilder levels,

2533
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:45,570
but physiological levels,

2534
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:51,110
which is like 60 milligrams a week
versus something like I hear up to 400

2535
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:52,254
milligrams a week.

2536
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:52,440
Yeah.

2537
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,040
That's something that
people really need to,

2538
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:54,560
um,

2539
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,280
it's,

2540
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,110
it's,

2541
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:56,770
it's,

2542
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,740
it's something that people need
to understand that if you look at,

2543
01:13:59,741 --> 01:14:01,000
look what a bodybuilder is,

2544
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:04,630
that's impossible without ridiculous,

2545
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:09,100
insane numbers of chemicals that you
shoot into your body literally is

2546
01:14:09,101 --> 01:14:09,934
impossible.

2547
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,830
And I think people have bad taste

2548
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,640
in their mouth or a bad idea about the
idea of testosterone because they think,

2549
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:15,791
well,

2550
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:16,750
if you take testosterone,

2551
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,510
you're taking a steroid and you're
going to become a big giant monster

2552
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:20,190
direction.

2553
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:23,980
Like you can't become a big giant monster
person unless you're fucking dedicated

2554
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,330
to crushing your body.

2555
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,193
Correct.

2556
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,320
When I started doing hormone
replacement using testosterone,

2557
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,810
a lot of patients that
that's a antibiotic,

2558
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,673
that's a steroid,

2559
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,011
don't,

2560
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:33,191
don't,

2561
01:14:33,191 --> 01:14:34,930
don't they picked you,

2562
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:37,930
you like Dorian Yates to stand
out there and your front porch.

2563
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:42,190
And my response to them was steroids.

2564
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:43,900
What you're buying the corner from Bubba.

2565
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:46,630
What I'm giving you as a
medication called testosterone.

2566
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:47,500
Why is it always Bobo?

2567
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,880
I don't know if it gets a bad rep,

2568
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,570
but he fucks guys in prison but was
one of the first guy to fucking prison.

2569
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:53,471
Well,

2570
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:55,360
I've got a limited vocabulary for,

2571
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:55,601
you know,

2572
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:56,980
the guy selling stuff that corners,

2573
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,450
let's call him Lou Lou Crazy Lu,

2574
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,420
who's got the good shit look at you.

2575
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:06,420
Swoll so in the beginning it was the
hormone deficiency and not feeling as I'm

2576
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,450
able psychologically,

2577
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:12,130
physiologically and physical,

2578
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,300
um,

2579
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,710
diabetes increased and we're now seeing
out of literature starting in 2000 that

2580
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:22,150
if you're low and free testosterone and
50 year old male and above and now 50

2581
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:23,140
year old female and above,

2582
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,240
you have a higher occurrence of diabetes.

2583
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,460
So to start thrown serves a,

2584
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,690
an incredible function.

2585
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,650
Also pain.

2586
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,160
We found that testosterone
also stops inflammation.

2587
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,960
So people have joint aches and pains.

2588
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:38,140
They go away when they replace
your testosterone level,

2589
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,090
growth hormone and cognitive function.

2590
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:45,570
The real bottom line is we know that
head trauma causes hormonal deficiency.

2591
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:50,230
We know that hormone deficiency
is associated with depression,

2592
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:50,741
anxiety,

2593
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:53,260
and all those suicides that
we're seeing in the NFL.

2594
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:55,630
And in the military in 2012,

2595
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,130
there were more,

2596
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:57,860
uh,

2597
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:01,540
there were 364 homeless one a day,

2598
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:02,703
64,

2599
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,370
uh,

2600
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,250
people in the military,

2601
01:16:04,251 --> 01:16:05,260
you committed suicide.

2602
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,420
They all had pst,

2603
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,840
you know,

2604
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,020
post traumatic stress syndrome,

2605
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,330
which is just another form of a Tbi,

2606
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:11,320
traumatic brain injury.

2607
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:12,221
Yeah,

2608
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:13,960
I believe at the very least,

2609
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:15,410
it mirrors the amount that,

2610
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,570
that are killed in action.

2611
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:17,621
It's scary.

2612
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:17,921
I mean,

2613
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:18,370
that's,

2614
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,121
that's a scary,

2615
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:19,930
scary thing.

2616
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:20,141
Well,

2617
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:20,921
in 2012,

2618
01:16:20,921 --> 01:16:23,410
there were more people committed
suicide than were killed in action.

2619
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,020
It was more documented by the dod,

2620
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:27,491
but you know,

2621
01:16:27,491 --> 01:16:27,871
so the,

2622
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:32,871
the issue is that we do
great at diagnosing traumatic
brain injury or cts or pet

2623
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:34,541
scans,

2624
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,800
all these high tech things.

2625
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:37,720
But we fail at treatment.

2626
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,050
And the reason why we've tr fail it
treatment is because we haven't put a good

2627
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:45,790
composite together of laboratory
testing for traumatic brain injury.

2628
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:51,150
So what we've developed over the past
10 years is this testing to allow for

2629
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:53,830
someone to have their hormones checked,

2630
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:58,720
to determine if there's a brain source
for the deficiency or if the gland,

2631
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,650
like you know,

2632
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:01,060
the testicles are gone.

2633
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,800
Of course you're not
going make testosterone.

2634
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,960
But if you have healthy young testicles,

2635
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,780
you should have a chemical in the
brain that's directing them to produce

2636
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,500
testosterone called leuteinizing hormone.

2637
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,070
Well here

2638
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,180
comes the big question.

2639
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,680
If this is all the case,

2640
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:16,850
if a traumatic brain injuries and
concussions and whatnot are causing this

2641
01:17:16,851 --> 01:17:19,490
decline in the function and the,

2642
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:19,671
the,

2643
01:17:19,671 --> 01:17:20,030
the,

2644
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,490
the operation of glands in the
body that produce hormones,

2645
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:27,470
should the people who take that stuff
be allowed to continue whatever they've

2646
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:30,680
done that's made them deficient
of all these hormones.

2647
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:32,270
So the argument is like,

2648
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,820
there's a big issue of sh
I'm sure you know about it,

2649
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:35,840
and mixed martial arts.

2650
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:41,170
And the big issue in mixed martial arts
is testosterone replacement therapy that

2651
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,300
a lot of these guys are
legitimately showing up where they,

2652
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:44,660
they,

2653
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,620
they test low enough.

2654
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:47,300
We're doctors prescribing testosterone.

2655
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,330
So the question is they're there,

2656
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,790
they need this when they're
young for one of two reasons,

2657
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:53,060
right?

2658
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,650
Either there's a medical issue,

2659
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,980
like they could have taken steroids
and the steroids could have shut their,

2660
01:17:57,981 --> 01:17:59,030
their balls down.

2661
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,920
Or if it's not that,

2662
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:01,900
it's,

2663
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:02,181
you know,

2664
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:04,970
they could have a disease that lowers
a test or if it's not that its head

2665
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:05,360
trauma.

2666
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,520
If it is head trauma and
their businesses head trauma,

2667
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,220
should they still be
engaging in head trauma?

2668
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,510
Great question.

2669
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,450
The answer is obviously no.

2670
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,220
So

2671
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,180
if you were like,

2672
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:21,640
say if they had you running the
Nevada state athletic commission,

2673
01:18:21,641 --> 01:18:25,480
if you were the guy that had to oversee
boxers and mixed martial arts fighters,

2674
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:28,120
if they came to you lower testosterone,

2675
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:28,810
you would say,

2676
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,680
well we're going to get
you some testosterone by,

2677
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,270
well,

2678
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:32,930
no more fighting.

2679
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:36,290
Well you have to go and do some
assessment to see what the damage is.

2680
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:36,621
You know,

2681
01:18:36,621 --> 01:18:39,290
we have some technology
that is phenomenal.

2682
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,150
I mean if you look up on the Internet,

2683
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:41,360
uh,

2684
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,250
Dti Mri where you can actually see the
interruptions of nerve conduction in the

2685
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,950
brain of the nerve fibers.

2686
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:50,780
You can see the interruption of
the axons is what it's called.

2687
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,340
You can also see scarring.

2688
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:54,350
I had a DTI Mri done.

2689
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:55,131
Uh,

2690
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,530
it's called track two gram
or diffusion attention.

2691
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,190
That's it.

2692
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,090
All my God,

2693
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:00,410
that's unbelievable technology.

2694
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:01,160
I had this done.

2695
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:01,701
My God,

2696
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:02,570
that's real.

2697
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,433
That's real.

2698
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:04,850
Holy Shit.

2699
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,990
That image looks like a
crazy flower from avatar.

2700
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,833
Yeah.

2701
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:09,590
Yes.

2702
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,850
So what is this called again?

2703
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:15,851
What is the technology d t Mri with DTI
diffusion tensor imaging and it follows

2704
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:21,641
the flow of water through
the neurons new desktop.

2705
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,640
Okay.

2706
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,420
That's my new desk.

2707
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,430
Send you something that is incredible.

2708
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:26,900
That image is fantastic.

2709
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:29,210
I don't even want to see what my
stupid fucking brand looks like.

2710
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:29,601
So anyway,

2711
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:34,601
you have a DTI done and you can actually
see calcifications are scars based upon

2712
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:37,040
the amount of damage to the brain.

2713
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:40,490
You make a decision whether or not the
person is at great risk for continuing.

2714
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:41,324
And what he's doing.

2715
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:42,740
Wow.

2716
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,750
There was a university of Saint Louis,

2717
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:48,320
I think just got another
$8 million grant to do DTI,

2718
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,400
Fmri and one of the study of the brain,

2719
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:56,990
which are very definitive for showing
a deficiency of blood flow from head

2720
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:57,261
trauma.

2721
01:19:57,261 --> 01:19:59,990
You can have areas of the
brain lose their blood supply.

2722
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,090
You can have nerve damage.

2723
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:06,350
I've got some great pictures I'll send
you where you can actually see the

2724
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:09,930
severing of the nerves that
connect the front to the,

2725
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:10,141
you know,

2726
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:12,210
the frontal lobe to the cortex.

2727
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,130
So you lose,

2728
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,083
uh,

2729
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:16,650
decision making.

2730
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:17,850
The ability to,

2731
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:18,750
uh,

2732
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,400
do more than one thing at once.

2733
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,320
I don't multi taxing dies,

2734
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,030
want to look.

2735
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:23,520
Yeah.

2736
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,353
I don't even want to look.

2737
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,040
My brain is like a messianic,

2738
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,060
I don't even want to go in there.

2739
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:28,020
It smells like a body.

2740
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:32,700
But there are things you can do to bypass
the areas of damage to fix everything.

2741
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:33,330
What can I do?

2742
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,260
There are things you can do.

2743
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:34,760
What can I do it?

2744
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,610
Cause sometimes we damage,

2745
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,890
we have a new product
that the more you talk,

2746
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:38,700
the more I'm thinking,

2747
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,240
yeah,

2748
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,073
I got a problem.

2749
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,640
We have evoked potential,

2750
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:44,400
which is like an EEG of the
brain where it follows a,

2751
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:46,440
you're sitting in front
of a computer reading,

2752
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:47,820
you're looking at flashing lights,

2753
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:51,060
you're looking at things and it causes
electrical patterns in the brain.

2754
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,400
And there are quote normal
electrical patterns.

2755
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,630
And then there's abnormal.

2756
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,720
The abnormals correlate with different
areas of the brain because you've got

2757
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,850
this net over your head
and it's sensing it.

2758
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,490
It's being used in the
military right now by a doctor.

2759
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:02,640
Uh,

2760
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,473
David,

2761
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:04,260
uh,

2762
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,420
hauger crazy Dave,

2763
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:06,750
right,

2764
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,410
Dave.

2765
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:07,741
But,

2766
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:08,430
uh,

2767
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,960
they're going to be sending
me one of the units,

2768
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:13,340
so I'll have it in the office so we
can see how wonderful your brains from,

2769
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:14,070
I'm scared.

2770
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,000
I don't want to look in there.

2771
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:15,180
Maybe,

2772
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,530
but there are things we can do to,

2773
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:17,523
to try and help it.

2774
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,830
It's done brain transplant.

2775
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,300
It's crazy.

2776
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:21,980
Yeah.

2777
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,251
I would,

2778
01:21:22,251 --> 01:21:24,840
I would like to see what my brain looks
like after three shots of Tequila.

2779
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,210
You know,

2780
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,850
that's the probably turns
to like the Batman logo.

2781
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,061
Well yeah.

2782
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:36,480
Would you like to see what your brain
looks like when it's completely fucked up?

2783
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,500
Like if you could just,

2784
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,950
it is right now around it and vodka
and just take a good look at it.

2785
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,420
Absolutely.

2786
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:43,760
Fmr.

2787
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,930
I look different and be able to
tell if someone's intoxicated.

2788
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,530
Well,

2789
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:46,921
let's see.

2790
01:21:46,921 --> 01:21:49,310
The one that does the blood flow is the,

2791
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,700
it follows the uh,

2792
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,860
the red blood cells is the FM Ri.

2793
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,580
Uh,

2794
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,850
the electrical patterns would be
interesting to see because alcohol's an

2795
01:21:56,851 --> 01:21:57,600
anesthetic.

2796
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,580
So you'll see drop off
in the electrical charge.

2797
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,240
Is this,

2798
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,630
is it possible that this technology will
evolve to the point where cops could

2799
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:05,640
use it to tell if people are
fucked up when they're driving?

2800
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,241
They just,

2801
01:22:06,241 --> 01:22:08,400
they don't even have to like
check your breath or any of that.

2802
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:11,910
They just scan you with this little thing
real quick and they look at your brain

2803
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:13,980
in 2,100 possibly.

2804
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:14,851
Probably.

2805
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:15,101
Right?

2806
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:15,210
Yeah.

2807
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,890
Right now it's a huge piece of equipment,

2808
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,720
but so was the cell phone right?

2809
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,040
Used to be a big suitcase.

2810
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:21,090
You carry in your car,

2811
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:21,870
you remember those tastes.

2812
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:22,830
This is huge too.

2813
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,320
But he got HTC.

2814
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,831
Yeah.

2815
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:27,030
See good smart man.

2816
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:27,780
Go android.

2817
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,870
That would put you,

2818
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,000
keep your money on the winners.

2819
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,890
Apple done fucked up.

2820
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,660
Fucked up the cell phone game.

2821
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:34,561
I Love Apple.

2822
01:22:34,561 --> 01:22:37,290
Don't get me wrong because apple people
go crazy when he started talking shit

2823
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,880
about apple stock was up today.

2824
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:39,811
It's great.

2825
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:40,770
It's great company there.

2826
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:42,720
They make awesome operating
systems and computers,

2827
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,040
however their phones can suck it.

2828
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,953
How about that?

2829
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:49,650
I was with them for a long time and
people are tired of me talking about this.

2830
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:52,840
I'm sorry you getting
that anger off your chest.

2831
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:53,850
You need some couch time.

2832
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:54,750
It's not off.

2833
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:55,583
It's still there.

2834
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,130
Okay.

2835
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:57,660
Apple made me go android.

2836
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,360
He made me leave with
a little skinny screen.

2837
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,100
How sounds your bitches,

2838
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:02,953
it's the uh,

2839
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,833
DNA.

2840
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,081
Yeah,

2841
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:04,900
those are sweet phones.

2842
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,410
Yeah.

2843
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,100
There's so many cool

2844
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,440
phones.

2845
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:06,771
Just get,

2846
01:23:06,771 --> 01:23:08,650
I mean obviously the apple phones,

2847
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:09,510
I'm just bullshitting around.

2848
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,250
There's still great to
iPhones have the best camera.

2849
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:14,170
I think if it never seen
a camera that's like,

2850
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,160
it's easy to use.

2851
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:17,680
And when you get like mega pixels,

2852
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,041
you know,

2853
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:18,791
some people say,

2854
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,420
you know,

2855
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,760
this has more of that
and a certain amount,

2856
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:22,150
you just,

2857
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,380
you just want it to look good,

2858
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:23,890
right?

2859
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:24,370
I mean,

2860
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,990
when you get into like eight megapixels,

2861
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,430
how big do you want that picture?

2862
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:27,761
Like,

2863
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:28,720
what are you doing with that thing?

2864
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:29,800
If you want to make a poster,

2865
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:30,401
yeah,

2866
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:31,270
you're going to put a billboard,

2867
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,110
a billboard,

2868
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,610
and you need like a high megapixel,

2869
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,421
but for the most part,

2870
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:35,310
a little cell phone camera,

2871
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:39,520
I'll do it for your kid to mix you.

2872
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:40,354
Um,

2873
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,231
you guys,

2874
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:41,910
uh,

2875
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:42,210
in,

2876
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:44,950
in studying all this stuff exposed,

2877
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:45,221
uh,

2878
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:48,850
have really sort of a
dirty secret in the NFL,

2879
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:49,960
in the world of boxing.

2880
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,460
But for a long time people were able
to look at damage that was caused by,

2881
01:23:54,461 --> 01:23:55,140
uh,

2882
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:55,390
you know,

2883
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:55,871
athletes,

2884
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:57,580
whether it's a box of being punched drunk,

2885
01:23:57,581 --> 01:23:59,620
and they looked at it sort
of almost with a willful,

2886
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:00,730
willful ignorance.

2887
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,330
They're like,

2888
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:01,601
ah,

2889
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:02,081
you know,

2890
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:03,430
I guess he stayed around too long.

2891
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:03,791
You know,

2892
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,320
it's not like no one,

2893
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:06,190
no one touches it.

2894
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:06,990
No one described.

2895
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:10,660
It becomes pugilistic
dementia and then you know,

2896
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:11,081
that's it.

2897
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:12,820
And the guy just fades away.

2898
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:17,110
When you start talking about this
as a very real cause and effect,

2899
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:17,980
um,

2900
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,480
how much blow back is there from that?

2901
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:19,961
Do you,

2902
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:21,580
do people get upset at you for that?

2903
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,530
They don't get upset at me.

2904
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,880
They just don't talk to me.

2905
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:26,110
Is that what happens?

2906
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:28,030
Like when it comes to
like certain businesses,

2907
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:28,221
like,

2908
01:24:28,221 --> 01:24:31,420
like football players or football
teams or hockey teams or something?

2909
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,100
Something where people
take a lot of impact,

2910
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,630
they get upset about these findings.

2911
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,140
Uh,

2912
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:37,830
of course they do because
the American pastime is what?

2913
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,503
Flip sports?

2914
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:40,020
Sports,

2915
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:40,380
Football,

2916
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:40,831
sports,

2917
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:41,664
baseball.

2918
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,573
So baseball,

2919
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:45,900
they're afraid of changing
the way the game is played.

2920
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,330
So look at you can't do,

2921
01:24:48,331 --> 01:24:53,331
what is that a rule 49 where
you can't do any side impact?

2922
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,010
No side impact anymore.

2923
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:57,240
There was a rule that came out through 49,

2924
01:24:57,241 --> 01:24:58,074
I don't remember.

2925
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,000
Fucked up the youtube clips.

2926
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:00,410
Yeah.

2927
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:04,290
Cause those youtube clips where dudes
get hit from the side flying through the

2928
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:04,890
air.

2929
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:05,041
Oh,

2930
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:07,890
that's such a brutal thing when you
get hit from the side by a giant man.

2931
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:08,070
Yeah.

2932
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:11,160
They're afraid that it's going to change
the way the game's played and it won't

2933
01:25:11,161 --> 01:25:13,050
be as exciting anymore.

2934
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,190
It most certainly will.

2935
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:14,431
You know,

2936
01:25:14,431 --> 01:25:15,150
it's like a glad,

2937
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:17,220
I think we have a gladiator mentality.

2938
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,140
We love seeing people getting hurt.

2939
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,490
We love seeing,

2940
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:20,761
you know,

2941
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:21,810
the sports that are rough.

2942
01:25:21,811 --> 01:25:25,650
I mean I took my daughter when
she was 11 to a hockey game.

2943
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:26,881
It was the,

2944
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:27,120
uh,

2945
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:27,691
New York.

2946
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:28,524
Um,

2947
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:28,861
uh,

2948
01:25:28,861 --> 01:25:29,221
what is it?

2949
01:25:29,221 --> 01:25:29,640
The Raider?

2950
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,180
No,

2951
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,013
the uh,

2952
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,520
[inaudible] and uh,

2953
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,153
islanders.

2954
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:36,420
Jersey devils?

2955
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:36,691
No,

2956
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:36,810
no,

2957
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:36,961
no.

2958
01:25:36,961 --> 01:25:38,460
The ones from New York,

2959
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,110
but hockey team.

2960
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:40,800
Anyway,

2961
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,740
so she was cheering at 11 when they
were checking against the devil,

2962
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,680
the Devil Jersey.

2963
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:49,770
But there's a New York one
cause the islanders rangers,

2964
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:50,550
it was the rangers.

2965
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:51,990
It was a range of great game.

2966
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,190
Absolutely great game.

2967
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:55,980
And she was cheering when any,

2968
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:57,780
someone was hit against the,

2969
01:25:57,781 --> 01:25:59,850
checked against the wall.

2970
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:00,540
Right.

2971
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:01,261
Unbelievable.

2972
01:26:01,261 --> 01:26:02,071
And that's what they do.

2973
01:26:02,071 --> 01:26:02,910
And then in the middle of the,

2974
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,070
they pull off the

2975
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,380
gloves and they gotten into the shoot.

2976
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:09,080
Fuck out was unbelievable was
my first time at the rink.

2977
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:09,291
Well,

2978
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,950
the weirdest thing about hockey
fights is that it's really a salt.

2979
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,900
Like you're allowed to assault each other.

2980
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:15,231
Correct.

2981
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:15,990
Cause you're not,

2982
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,690
you're not wearing boxing gloves,

2983
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,220
you're not wearing MMA gloves.

2984
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:20,530
You're beating the shit out of each other.

2985
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,141
Bare knuckle.

2986
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:22,580
Like why is that legal?

2987
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:22,971
I mean,

2988
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:23,810
all they do is like,

2989
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,160
they penalize you a little bit,

2990
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,540
but you know what's going on.

2991
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:27,770
Everybody knows it's happening.

2992
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,080
The guy's not going to play
after he get fights anyway,

2993
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:32,780
so he has to sit in a box for
a little while and cool off.

2994
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,381
Whoa.

2995
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:35,270
You really showed him
and he didn't show up.

2996
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:36,530
Didn't show him shit,

2997
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:37,070
man.

2998
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:37,881
He just got in a fight.

2999
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:39,230
He wants to take a break right now.

3000
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,600
You guys just probably
broke his fucking hand.

3001
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,480
People jump up and they're
cheering when the fights occur.

3002
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:45,350
There's so crazy.

3003
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:46,760
It's 48.

3004
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:48,351
Yeah,

3005
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:49,070
it's uh,

3006
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:52,970
we like to watch people try
to win guilty of assault,

3007
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,470
drinking a game.

3008
01:26:54,471 --> 01:26:55,221
A couple of years ago.

3009
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:55,760
This guy,

3010
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,180
he was known as a bad ass but got
charged and suspended for a long time.

3011
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,470
Marty McSorley is his name.

3012
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:01,770
Oh yeah,

3013
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:02,863
sure.

3014
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:03,890
Wow.

3015
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:04,611
Holy Shit.

3016
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:05,030
What's needed?

3017
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:07,580
I think that guy was going to
do MMA at one point in time.

3018
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,590
It sounds like a crazy man.

3019
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:10,880
Yeah,

3020
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,330
man.

3021
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,640
It's just a very weird
how that's sort of like,

3022
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:13,851
I mean,

3023
01:27:13,851 --> 01:27:14,000
if,

3024
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,590
if baseball players go at it,

3025
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,440
it's not,

3026
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:16,770
you know,

3027
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:18,350
that this becomes a big deal.

3028
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:18,951
You know,

3029
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:20,120
bench clean brawl.

3030
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:21,350
That becomes a really big deal.

3031
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:22,820
Baseball paid his fight on TV,

3032
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,740
but hockey players are expected to,

3033
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,420
it's par for the course.

3034
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:27,590
It's just the game.

3035
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:28,570
Yeah,

3036
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,900
so it's fucking man's game.

3037
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:30,901
That's it.

3038
01:27:30,901 --> 01:27:32,360
It's why Canadians are so powerful,

3039
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,003
you know?

3040
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,701
That's why I also,

3041
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:36,320
they're so polite and their sport,

3042
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:36,951
they could fucking,

3043
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:40,220
just a fight to break out
the drop of a hat so loud.

3044
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:41,750
You can't talk shit.

3045
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:42,321
You know,

3046
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:44,510
if you're on a basketball court
and you start talking shit,

3047
01:27:44,511 --> 01:27:46,760
you're most likely not going
to get punched in the face.

3048
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,500
But if you're in a hockey rink,

3049
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:50,390
it's most likely that you're
going to get punched in the face.

3050
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:51,950
Say,

3051
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:52,400
who was it?

3052
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:52,731
Kelly,

3053
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:55,340
Rudy and the fiber.

3054
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:59,000
One winter they came left Canada
and came down to play here.

3055
01:27:59,140 --> 01:27:59,973
Five oh one winter.

3056
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,280
Uh,

3057
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,611
Kelly.

3058
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:01,911
Rudy,

3059
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:02,990
you ask him football questions.

3060
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,251
I don't know.

3061
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:04,084
It was hockey.

3062
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:04,370
Oh,

3063
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:04,611
I don't know.

3064
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:05,444
Hockey,

3065
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,070
basketball and football.

3066
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,720
But a lot of Canadians we
thought you telling me,

3067
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:09,940
I would think the Canadians,

3068
01:28:09,941 --> 01:28:10,370
uh,

3069
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:12,680
absolutely would come down to the
states where there's a little bit more

3070
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:13,760
civilized in the,

3071
01:28:13,761 --> 01:28:14,150
uh,

3072
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:14,983
in the brawling.

3073
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:15,291
Yeah.

3074
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,910
But not as nice and the populace.

3075
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:17,450
Huh?

3076
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:17,960
You know,

3077
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,521
you,

3078
01:28:18,521 --> 01:28:20,750
you have a brawling populous there.

3079
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:22,040
That's a polite populace.

3080
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,330
And which do we have?

3081
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,160
Well,

3082
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:24,993
we're not really broad.

3083
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,730
We're talking shit.

3084
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:26,000
Oh,

3085
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,811
talk a lot of shit.

3086
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:27,130
And then,

3087
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:28,730
and in Canada and then we get separated.

3088
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,220
Well,

3089
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,053
let me go

3090
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,210
and you know,

3091
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:33,411
I mean,

3092
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:36,410
this is very rarely a bench
clearing brawl in our sport.

3093
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:37,400
Our sport is baseball,

3094
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:37,631
right?

3095
01:28:37,631 --> 01:28:38,510
Or national sport.

3096
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,070
Allegedly it's baseball,

3097
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:40,993
even football.

3098
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:43,250
I mean they hate each other
full clip while they're running,

3099
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,170
but they rarely kick each other's asses.

3100
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,230
It seems like you should totally be
allowed to kick each other's asses and

3101
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:48,800
football,

3102
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,580
but they don't allow it because it would
be too brutal because you look at the

3103
01:28:52,581 --> 01:28:53,530
size of some of these guys,

3104
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:56,750
they took their helmets off and beat the
fuck out of each other in the middle of

3105
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:58,740
the field and 80,000 people go,

3106
01:28:58,830 --> 01:28:59,663
ah,

3107
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,250
it's too gangster.

3108
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,550
Even for America.

3109
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:05,160
So football players are
not allowed to fight.

3110
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,730
That's a pretty interesting thing if you
really stop and think about like it's

3111
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:11,730
just something we culturally
accept as being a rule,

3112
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:14,940
but it makes no sense that hockey
players are allowed to fight.

3113
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:15,980
But football players aren't.

3114
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,160
That's so stupid.

3115
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,800
That's a really dumb rule.

3116
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,003
If,

3117
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,810
if they're both playing
in the same country,

3118
01:29:21,811 --> 01:29:22,591
this is retarded.

3119
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:23,730
It doesn't make any sense at all.

3120
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:24,840
It's in the rules.

3121
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,980
That's what football is going to do.

3122
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,360
They're going to take out all these
crazy like side hits and put in brawls.

3123
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:30,710
That was 48 it was uh,

3124
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:31,890
cited side tackle.

3125
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,980
Take that shit out and take the
helmet off and start throwing down.

3126
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:35,910
If they added to that,

3127
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:36,530
I'll put bode,

3128
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,830
go through the fucking roof.

3129
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:40,680
What happened in the beginning
with the use the leather,

3130
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,580
what do they call it?

3131
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,413
Little helmets.

3132
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,050
Helmets.

3133
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,420
Well those are good too because
you can't hit each other as hard.

3134
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,920
It's really fucking dangerous.

3135
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:49,740
It's hard to do and you realize you can't
run into each other full clip and use

3136
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:52,690
your head like a battering
ram pads to patty.

3137
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,420
There's actually less instances of
brain damage in rugby then there is an

3138
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,390
American football.

3139
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:58,710
Get that shit they used to wear.

3140
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:00,330
That's hilarious.

3141
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,220
It was a little funny,

3142
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:03,120
silly pads,

3143
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:05,130
but it'd be better if
people played like that.

3144
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,720
They would get more hurt for sure.

3145
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:10,380
But honestly it'd be better because they
would realize they can't play the game

3146
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:10,861
that way.

3147
01:30:10,861 --> 01:30:12,390
The way they play it is completely unreal.

3148
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:13,243
You had the girl,

3149
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,900
how dare you?

3150
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:16,780
Um,

3151
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,010
they,

3152
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:19,290
they would realize that you
can't just run into each other.

3153
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:19,750
Like that's,

3154
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:23,910
that's so preposterous that you think
you could just crash into each other and

3155
01:30:23,911 --> 01:30:24,840
everybody's going to be fun.

3156
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:25,441
Like,

3157
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:26,274
that's,

3158
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,780
that's a recipe for danger.

3159
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:30,750
That's a recipe for disaster just
running at each other full clip.

3160
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:34,830
But if you force people in a
situation where they were bear head,

3161
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:35,930
their head to head,

3162
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:39,750
the idea of colliding with other
person's head does not seem that cool.

3163
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,713
I'm just doing them.

3164
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,890
They think they have some veneer of
protection by wearing the helmet.

3165
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:47,190
But do you have less protection actually
when you're wearing a helmet because

3166
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:49,890
your brain gets rattled around
more often cause you can take it.

3167
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,820
That's the point.

3168
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:51,420
Yeah.

3169
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:51,930
You've got,

3170
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:52,763
you know,

3171
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:54,120
had a patient to,

3172
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:54,954
uh,

3173
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:59,070
who was driving a motorcycle up to four
or five at 70 miles an hour and he's

3174
01:30:59,071 --> 01:30:59,851
clipped by a car.

3175
01:30:59,851 --> 01:31:00,541
He goes up,

3176
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:04,080
catapulted ends in the
ends up stopping his body,

3177
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:06,240
ends up stopping in the fast lane.

3178
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,223
Oh my God.

3179
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:08,940
So I'm sitting there and
talking to the guy and I said,

3180
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:10,410
so what happened next?

3181
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:11,273
He says,

3182
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,450
I woke up in the hospital.

3183
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:13,230
I said,

3184
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,220
so you had head trauma?

3185
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:14,581
He said,

3186
01:31:14,581 --> 01:31:14,940
no.

3187
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:15,301
I said,

3188
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:16,830
why would you tell me you
didn't have head trauma?

3189
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:19,980
He says his helmet wasn't broken.

3190
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,091
Oh,

3191
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:21,924
hilarious.

3192
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:23,371
His helmet.

3193
01:31:23,371 --> 01:31:24,660
But he was in a coma for,

3194
01:31:24,661 --> 01:31:25,494
you know,

3195
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,700
12 hours or whatever.

3196
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:28,200
Woke up his legs up here.

3197
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:29,100
He's got a broken leg,

3198
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:30,120
six broken ribs,

3199
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:30,781
uh,

3200
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:31,441
harm,

3201
01:31:31,441 --> 01:31:32,490
clavicle broken.

3202
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,720
And he ended up developing this incredible
anger and depression in the word is,

3203
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:40,230
and hedonism,

3204
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:41,550
which means no six,

3205
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,340
he just didn't desire.

3206
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:46,860
And a n and hedonism and Hayden SC and h,

3207
01:31:46,861 --> 01:31:47,011
e,

3208
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:47,570
d I,

3209
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:49,350
n I'm gonna use that from now on.

3210
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,230
And he and hedonism.

3211
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:55,660
So he developed this need
for sex and his testosterone,

3212
01:31:55,661 --> 01:31:56,461
when we tested him,

3213
01:31:56,461 --> 01:31:57,720
his testosterone was zero.

3214
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:58,590
Whoa.

3215
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,710
He was just shut down.

3216
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,010
So

3217
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,330
he's ready to die probably.

3218
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:01,930
Well,

3219
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,720
there's a lot of problems with not
having enough to stastrom depression,

3220
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:05,261
kill yourself,

3221
01:32:05,261 --> 01:32:05,861
suicide,

3222
01:32:05,861 --> 01:32:06,341
suicide,

3223
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:06,850
and suicide.

3224
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:07,601
We say zero,

3225
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:08,800
but what was his actual level?

3226
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:13,330
Probably 130 something
really in the literature,

3227
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:17,590
they look at anything less
than 320 400 by some others.

3228
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,600
Now when you see,

3229
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:20,230
um,

3230
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:20,561
the,

3231
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:20,781
the,

3232
01:32:20,781 --> 01:32:22,480
the science that goes behind,

3233
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:23,140
um,

3234
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:23,621
the,

3235
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,070
uh,

3236
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:28,840
the athletic commissions where they have
to do certain tests for drugs and do

3237
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:32,200
certain tests for various
performance enhancing substances,

3238
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,440
do you think that they should be
testing people's free testosterone?

3239
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:38,290
They should be making sure that
people are healthy enough to compete

3240
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:44,380
in 2006 I was on ESPN
to answer that question,

3241
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:50,080
it's very difficult to give someone an
elixir of youth and say don't use it.

3242
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:55,250
So if you give someone the
opportunity to use to stash on,

3243
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,570
they're going to tend to abuse it,

3244
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:57,740
right?

3245
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,770
So it means monitoring them
before they play the game.

3246
01:33:00,771 --> 01:33:01,850
But look at football.

3247
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,040
How old do you when you
start playing pop Warner?

3248
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,470
I never played football
too smart for that shit.

3249
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,110
So the bottom line is you start,

3250
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:13,040
at what point do you start testing to
make sure the hormones are in a normal

3251
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:13,640
balance?

3252
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:17,930
When do you know as soon as you
possibly can to test them and then you,

3253
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,630
every year you check them
to see if they're dropping.

3254
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,111
Also,

3255
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:21,411
you know,

3256
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:22,370
because they've had,

3257
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,313
um,

3258
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:28,450
documented head to head injury or
they've been dinged and they've got,

3259
01:33:29,001 --> 01:33:29,181
you know,

3260
01:33:29,181 --> 01:33:30,050
their bell rung.

3261
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,393
Um,

3262
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,331
it's really,

3263
01:33:32,331 --> 01:33:33,440
that's the difficulty.

3264
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,300
The commission's won't allow it,

3265
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:35,960
you know,

3266
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,660
look what happened to Lance Armstrong
goes aside from everything else.

3267
01:33:38,661 --> 01:33:42,980
He had a seminoma cancer of his testicle
and he was put on replacement levels of

3268
01:33:42,981 --> 01:33:44,990
testosterone and he was allowed to,

3269
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:49,730
but then he got greedy and started
on a lot of other things started in

3270
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,080
embellishing his levels.

3271
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:52,011
Oh really?

3272
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:52,610
Yeah,

3273
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:53,780
that's what they say.

3274
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,033
And you know,

3275
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,840
a lot of the French Open people have,

3276
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:57,140
uh,

3277
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,990
some of them have been nailed
because they had tested a look.

3278
01:33:59,991 --> 01:34:03,240
What happened to James
Toney after fighting,

3279
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:03,520
uh,

3280
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,353
Jose,

3281
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,360
um,

3282
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,550
in Madison Square Garden,

3283
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,220
they tested him and they found that his,

3284
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:12,980
they said Deca and Angela
and Tacony date was,

3285
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:18,040
which is a form of testosterone
was a 13 in the cutoff was nine.

3286
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,780
But the testing that they do,

3287
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,270
it doesn't detect the drug directly.

3288
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:24,104
It's indirect.

3289
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:26,750
So our testing technology is really bad.

3290
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:27,763
It's still bad.

3291
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,791
It's still bad,

3292
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,680
but Olympic level testing is really good.

3293
01:34:30,681 --> 01:34:31,070
Right.

3294
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:33,380
The Athletic Commission testing
is not quite at that level.

3295
01:34:33,381 --> 01:34:33,980
Is that what it is?

3296
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:37,250
It's the difference between
urine testing and blood testing.

3297
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,360
So it should be blood.

3298
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:39,290
It should be blood.

3299
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,040
I don't care.

3300
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:40,610
You know,

3301
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:41,420
the uh,

3302
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:41,841
what is it?

3303
01:34:41,841 --> 01:34:42,280
The uh,

3304
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,130
the leagues,

3305
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,053
um,

3306
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,253
uh,

3307
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:46,791
the group,

3308
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:47,890
the leagues,

3309
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:48,773
uh,

3310
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,820
Veda you talking about like it's the
ones that protect me and that's not the

3311
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:53,390
anti-doping.

3312
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,620
It's the leagues.

3313
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:57,420
The ones who protect the
players from you invasion.

3314
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:57,621
It's,

3315
01:34:57,621 --> 01:34:58,454
is that what it is?

3316
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,420
The union players union?

3317
01:34:59,421 --> 01:35:01,370
Is it a player's union
told called players,

3318
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:02,643
players union,

3319
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:03,080
you know,

3320
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,250
they protect the uh,

3321
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:07,970
the player from invasion of privacy by
having it urine as opposed to blood.

3322
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:09,140
The blood is more accurate.

3323
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:11,060
Well that's one of the things
I was going to ask you.

3324
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:11,331
I mean,

3325
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:11,700
how,

3326
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:16,460
how much of sports today really isn't
possible without some sort of performance

3327
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:17,294
enhancing trucks.

3328
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:21,230
I think every sport is possible without
any enhancement possible in the level

3329
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:22,190
that you see it today.

3330
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,433
Um,

3331
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,333
yes.

3332
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:27,320
I mean eating right.

3333
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:29,390
I mean if you really want to get critical,

3334
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,670
if you're eating really well,

3335
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:34,730
that should be illegal
because it's enhancing,

3336
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,360
right?

3337
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,160
If you're taking vitamin supplements,

3338
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,030
that's illegal because it's
enhanced protein powders.

3339
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:42,430
Taking creatine,

3340
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,600
you taking a,

3341
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,551
you know,

3342
01:35:44,551 --> 01:35:45,360
a ride,

3343
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,400
you're taking magnesium,

3344
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:47,061
taking calcium,

3345
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:48,350
all these things that have benefits.

3346
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,640
You're taking resveratrol.

3347
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:50,330
Well,

3348
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,050
Arginine,

3349
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:52,370
it all helps in the body,

3350
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:55,010
so these things should be illegal.

3351
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:56,480
If you follow that trend of thought,

3352
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,800
you should not be doing that.

3353
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,640
Anything that puts your capabilities
above what the normal level is,

3354
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,670
but when you see something like
the Tour de France specifically,

3355
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,940
I've heard that the numbers that they
achieve in the Tour de France are

3356
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:10,280
literally impossible
unless you're taking drugs.

3357
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:14,870
Blood doping is very common where they
take their butt out and put it back in.

3358
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:17,630
A referral poet in used
to be very heavily used,

3359
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:20,300
which stimulates your body to
produce more red blood cells.

3360
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,530
Growth Hormone was great.

3361
01:36:21,531 --> 01:36:22,640
Provigil was great.

3362
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:23,300
I mean,

3363
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,900
I know because in reading some of the
documents that come to me to evaluate

3364
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:27,734
cases,

3365
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:28,670
you know,

3366
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,010
a lot of things were being used to,

3367
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,850
to enhance their capabilities.

3368
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:33,160
Things like Dha,

3369
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:33,860
Mark Maguire,

3370
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,230
you know,

3371
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:36,070
I only used interesting dial,

3372
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,373
you know,

3373
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:38,450
thou IOC,

3374
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:42,080
the International Olympic Committee
doesn't allow for us to use or for the

3375
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,670
client patients to use,

3376
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,580
um,

3377
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:45,130
DGA,

3378
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:47,150
which comes from Mexican wild yams,

3379
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:48,260
natural source,

3380
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,190
vital hormones.

3381
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,930
Don't let them use pregnenolone.

3382
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:52,400
Don't let them use interesting Diane,

3383
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:53,600
which is now off the market.

3384
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:57,620
You can't have Anderson Dionn because
it only takes one chemical reaction to

3385
01:36:57,621 --> 01:36:58,910
make it into testosterone.

3386
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,320
Uh,

3387
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,720
terrorists tribulus
which is a plant based,

3388
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:03,350
uh,

3389
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,660
testosterone natural that's banned.

3390
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:07,040
Tribulus has banned.

3391
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:10,280
Tribulus has been such
tribulus was extremely mild.

3392
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:14,950
It's still has the ability to
become testosterone terrorist.

3393
01:37:14,951 --> 01:37:16,280
Tribulus wow.

3394
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:19,450
But isn't it like really bioavailability?

3395
01:37:19,451 --> 01:37:20,570
It's like very small,

3396
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:20,790
isn't,

3397
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:20,960
it?

3398
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,700
Doesn't matter.

3399
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:21,891
It does.

3400
01:37:21,891 --> 01:37:22,820
It gets on their list.

3401
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:23,650
You look at their labs,

3402
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:24,440
they've got,

3403
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,273
um,

3404
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:26,571
that's so crazy.

3405
01:37:26,571 --> 01:37:28,730
They've got a decongestants,

3406
01:37:28,731 --> 01:37:30,290
they have asthma medication.

3407
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:31,340
You have to get a,

3408
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:31,640
you know,

3409
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:36,020
three cardinals and the pope to sign
off on you for asthma to use some of the

3410
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:39,350
rescue inhalers because they can
give you a great energy surge.

3411
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:39,501
Well,

3412
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:40,460
I know some guys,

3413
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:41,210
uh,

3414
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,550
who are on Adderall,

3415
01:37:42,551 --> 01:37:43,760
they are prescribed Adderall.

3416
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:46,000
They were told they have to
get off it to compete in a,

3417
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:46,834
in an a.

3418
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:50,480
So they have add and believe it or not,

3419
01:37:50,481 --> 01:37:55,481
there were articles that talk about
testosterone deficiency and add also women

3420
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,850
with Anorexia Nervosa

3421
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:59,460
who have failed a antidepressant therapy,

3422
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,680
checking for thyroid
testosterone deficiency.

3423
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,030
It's such a good point you were making
about that vitamins should be illegal,

3424
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:07,500
that food should be illegal.

3425
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:11,430
Healthy nutritional supplements should
be illegal because they all make you

3426
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:12,090
perform better.

3427
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:12,600
Correct.

3428
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,600
So at what point in time are we going to
have something like what we're dealing

3429
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:21,780
with now is like they're injecting
steroids and they're doing hormones,

3430
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:25,050
but when they start getting into
genetic engineering of human beings,

3431
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,010
like at what point in time our athletics
going to be even valid anymore.

3432
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:33,510
If you're engineering super people as
they're going to come a point in time,

3433
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:33,990
do you think,

3434
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:34,710
I mean you're,

3435
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:35,550
you're a scientist,

3436
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:36,384
you're a doctor,

3437
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:40,080
you're a smart dude when you're looking
at the future of human enhancement and

3438
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:43,170
not just on a chemical
level or hormonal level,

3439
01:38:43,171 --> 01:38:43,411
like,

3440
01:38:43,411 --> 01:38:43,591
you know,

3441
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:44,580
you're educated then,

3442
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:45,510
but in,

3443
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,141
you know,

3444
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:46,440
when you,

3445
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,480
when you look at it in
a technological level,

3446
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,170
yeah.

3447
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:52,800
I think these genetic
enhancements are for specific use.

3448
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:53,993
Like military,

3449
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,770
like if you want to be the hulk,

3450
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,000
if you want to be the whole core,

3451
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:58,380
you want to be captain America.

3452
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:00,300
Could you imagine if
they decide to do that?

3453
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:05,430
We develop different colors and entire
army of like hulk dudes that literally

3454
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:06,510
are built like the hawk.

3455
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,380
They're bulletproof.

3456
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:12,410
They have fucking spider skin that's
mixed with a or the the spider silk.

3457
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,400
They already developing that Spiderman.

3458
01:39:14,401 --> 01:39:14,700
Yeah.

3459
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:15,960
Well they developing a,

3460
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:16,470
um,

3461
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:17,190
there's a,

3462
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:17,470
uh,

3463
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:17,730
uh,

3464
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:21,330
artificial skin that they're trying to
create that's mixed with spider silk.

3465
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,010
So it becomes literally bulletproof.

3466
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,420
He'd have bulletproof skin.

3467
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:25,230
Wow.

3468
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:25,801
Giant,

3469
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:27,030
huge hulk dudes.

3470
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,960
You tell me some guys in Nebraska sitting
on a farm thinking about going over to

3471
01:39:30,961 --> 01:39:33,030
Iraq and kicking some ass and they go,

3472
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:33,631
listen band.

3473
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:35,430
I'm thinking about doing the hulk program,

3474
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:36,350
man.

3475
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:37,350
You know that Shit's permanent.

3476
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:37,650
Yeah.

3477
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,311
Hey man,

3478
01:39:38,311 --> 01:39:38,551
that's all.

3479
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:39,510
I'm a hawk forever.

3480
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:40,051
Whatever.

3481
01:39:40,051 --> 01:39:41,040
I'll be bulletproof.

3482
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:41,940
Fuck it.

3483
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,410
If they offered that to soldiers,

3484
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,660
we're going to have a
real problem on our hands.

3485
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:47,670
We're going to have an army of hawks

3486
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,760
better do away with war.

3487
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,043
Yes.

3488
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,100
Do you think that would work?

3489
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,350
That army of hawks would
everybody backing off?

3490
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,130
It's like,

3491
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:56,300
boy,

3492
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:58,410
you haven't had a nuclear war since 1947.

3493
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,880
Who hasn't?

3494
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:00,580
We haven't.

3495
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:01,413
We haven't ignored.

3496
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:01,820
Yeah,

3497
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:05,400
it wasn't it when it dropped the
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

3498
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,330
Was that 47?

3499
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:06,630
No,

3500
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,291
45.

3501
01:40:07,291 --> 01:40:07,760
45.

3502
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:07,870
Yeah,

3503
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:08,590
45.

3504
01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:08,970
Uh,

3505
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,803
the Enola Gay.

3506
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,033
The um,

3507
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,100
if you stop wishing that
terrible thing to say,

3508
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,960
he should have just kept it to yourself.

3509
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,250
You're that guy.

3510
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:17,570
Hey,

3511
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:18,403
I have,

3512
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,280
this is free for all.

3513
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:23,490
It is certainly that I want
a straw with some paper wads.

3514
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:24,391
I mean,

3515
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:27,150
it's literally been the last
time anybody uses a nuclear bomb.

3516
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,033
So,

3517
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:30,870
and we all have them.

3518
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:31,980
It's kind of,

3519
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,810
maybe that's what's going on
with the genetic engineering.

3520
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:34,501
We all become the hall.

3521
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:35,490
Can everybody just stops.

3522
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,860
That makes sense to fuck,

3523
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:39,780
if that makes sense.

3524
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:40,950
Do you,

3525
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:42,480
do you worry though that you know,

3526
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:45,180
there is going to come a point in time
where there's not going to be natural

3527
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:46,590
humans or do you think it's exciting?

3528
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:47,130
Do you,

3529
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:50,670
do you think that it could be in some
way dangerous that we genetically

3530
01:40:50,671 --> 01:40:52,020
engineered human beings to live,

3531
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:55,060
to be a thousand years old and
be able to jump over buildings?

3532
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:56,163
Or do you think,

3533
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:56,771
I mean,

3534
01:40:56,771 --> 01:40:56,950
what,

3535
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:57,711
how do you feel about it?

3536
01:40:57,711 --> 01:40:58,240
Right.

3537
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,140
I think that we've,

3538
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,480
we've been modified already.

3539
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,810
We've been modified and with what we eat,

3540
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:05,860
we modify ourselves,

3541
01:41:05,861 --> 01:41:07,330
what we'd been injected with,

3542
01:41:07,331 --> 01:41:08,650
we've modified ourselves.

3543
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:09,941
And I think that,

3544
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:10,480
um,

3545
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,290
there are,

3546
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,010
let's see,

3547
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,711
there's a,

3548
01:41:12,711 --> 01:41:17,290
a senator that's using stem cells
to generate new heart valves.

3549
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,580
So we're going to have artificial,

3550
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:19,361
natural,

3551
01:41:19,361 --> 01:41:20,230
artificial,

3552
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:20,680
uh,

3553
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:21,670
replacement organs.

3554
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,630
So He'd go to the,

3555
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:22,931
you know,

3556
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:26,250
to the bank and you press a
new heart or your press a,

3557
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:26,481
you know,

3558
01:41:26,481 --> 01:41:29,650
a longer schlong or whatever situation is,

3559
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:30,461
uh,

3560
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:32,950
we'll have medications to
make our heart work better.

3561
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,770
Our lungs breathe better
to bring in more oxygen.

3562
01:41:35,771 --> 01:41:38,500
If we have any oxygen
left in our atmosphere,

3563
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:44,060
it's dropped from 21% to I think or
22% down to 19% are oxygen level in our

3564
01:41:44,951 --> 01:41:46,060
atmosphere has dropped,

3565
01:41:46,061 --> 01:41:46,571
has dropped.

3566
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:47,404
This is when,

3567
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,693
um,

3568
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:51,550
millions years it's dropped.

3569
01:41:51,551 --> 01:41:52,384
They were found,

3570
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:57,480
they found oxygen trapped in ice that's
dated back millions of years and they

3571
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:01,030
measured the amount of oxygen in it.

3572
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:06,540
Wasn't that a part of the theory why
dinosaurs were so large and higher oxygen

3573
01:42:06,641 --> 01:42:07,150
concentration?

3574
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:10,870
There's a higher oxygen concentration
and that they were able to move through

3575
01:42:10,871 --> 01:42:13,570
the atmosphere more easily because uh,

3576
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:13,940
because their,

3577
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,190
their considerable bulk,

3578
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,220
it would have been not so much of
an impediment to movement with it.

3579
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:19,600
I haven't read the atmosphere.

3580
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:20,320
Yeah.

3581
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:20,741
Again,

3582
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:25,420
a theory that I fucking glanced over
then I'm spouting out as if I wrote the,

3583
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,860
the paperwork myself.

3584
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:27,911
So,

3585
01:42:27,911 --> 01:42:28,660
um,

3586
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,910
that over the millions of years,

3587
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:32,730
the oxygen level has been dropping.

3588
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:33,521
And also,

3589
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:34,000
you know,

3590
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,240
we're killing down the
regenerating sources in the Amazon,

3591
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:37,930
right,

3592
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:38,320
right.

3593
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,200
We're killing all the,

3594
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:39,700
you know,

3595
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,650
the trees and everything to build houses.

3596
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,361
The Amazon thing,

3597
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:44,260
it's really depressing.

3598
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:44,590
Yeah.

3599
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:49,180
I was listening to something on the way
over here where it was a discussion of

3600
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:54,010
the Peruvian rain forest and their
collection of rubber in the early 19

3601
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:54,844
hundreds,

3602
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:59,940
and how this population of indigenous
people went from 45,000 down to 3,500 and

3603
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:03,940
little or little over,

3604
01:43:03,941 --> 01:43:04,210
you know,

3605
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:04,481
five,

3606
01:43:04,481 --> 01:43:05,314
six years.

3607
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:09,790
They made these people go out and collect
rubber for them and they gave them a

3608
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:13,930
quota that they had to reach in every
ounce that they were under that quota they

3609
01:43:13,931 --> 01:43:15,580
would take out in human flesh.

3610
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,070
So they would chop peoples'
arms off or you know,

3611
01:43:18,071 --> 01:43:19,390
a pal put them on a scale,

3612
01:43:19,391 --> 01:43:22,170
like they slaughtered these people
and scared the fuck out of him.

3613
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:25,360
But at the same sort of
techniques that Cortez used,

3614
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:26,261
uh,

3615
01:43:26,261 --> 01:43:26,861
on the,

3616
01:43:26,861 --> 01:43:27,161
uh,

3617
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:28,420
on the Aztecs way,

3618
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:29,440
way back in the day.

3619
01:43:29,441 --> 01:43:32,290
So it's like literally
the same sort of practice,

3620
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,440
but it happened in the early 19 hundreds
terrifying shed to the amount of like

3621
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,820
evil shit that goes on in the rain forest.

3622
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,830
They just shop it down,

3623
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:43,030
make a profit,

3624
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,080
chop it dies.

3625
01:43:44,081 --> 01:43:46,360
Plenty of it keep going until one day.

3626
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:50,320
They're going to get to a point in time
when they realized they just hack down a

3627
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,250
hundred million thousand year old trees
and it's going to take a thousand years

3628
01:43:52,251 --> 01:43:54,530
from the grow back and now we're fucked.

3629
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:54,800
Yeah.

3630
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,730
Fortunately people like Bono and share
had been buying up large blocks of a

3631
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:01,370
territory in the Amazon to
preserve what you imagine.

3632
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:05,360
If the earth has to be
saved by Bano together,

3633
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:06,500
they save the earth.

3634
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,780
Who will with Google?

3635
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:11,300
They get together with Google
and they saved the earth.

3636
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:12,660
They've been buying up the rain forest.

3637
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:15,710
How cheap is the rain forest that
they could just buy it up like that?

3638
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:18,950
Who's selling it to them?

3639
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,270
Who owns that shit?

3640
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,581
The government did.

3641
01:44:21,581 --> 01:44:22,730
They really all that shit.

3642
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:24,290
It's all earth Earth's place.

3643
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,850
You get the idea that people are just
going to keep doing that until they run

3644
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:32,840
out of forest is absolutely terrifying
because it could happen and all the

3645
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:36,890
medicinal things that we're losing because
they say there were species of plants

3646
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,753
and animals,

3647
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:40,520
insects and bugs and so forth
that had been decimated,

3648
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:42,020
removed off the planet.

3649
01:44:42,021 --> 01:44:42,854
Extinct.

3650
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:43,521
Yeah.

3651
01:44:43,521 --> 01:44:44,540
It's terrifying stuff.

3652
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:45,350
Um,

3653
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:48,620
you know about the Brazilian wandering
spider that they've discovered in the

3654
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:49,454
Amazon?

3655
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:50,320
No,

3656
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,750
they're using wandering there,

3657
01:44:51,751 --> 01:44:52,010
uh,

3658
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:53,720
doing research on which try to convert.

3659
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:58,940
They're doing research on them to
try to convert it into a Viagra type

3660
01:44:58,941 --> 01:45:02,000
medication because the sting of the,

3661
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:04,940
a wandering spider in Jack's,

3662
01:45:04,941 --> 01:45:09,941
that type of venom that causes you
to have an insanely painful erection.

3663
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:11,240
And if you survive,

3664
01:45:11,241 --> 01:45:12,021
which a lot of people don't,

3665
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:13,310
it's a very toxic spider.

3666
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,690
But if you do survive,

3667
01:45:14,691 --> 01:45:16,370
your penis will be broken forever.

3668
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,360
It'll never work again,

3669
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:22,220
that it's somehow or another interacts
with your body's production of nitric

3670
01:45:22,221 --> 01:45:26,990
oxide and it just over floods your system
with it and your whole body goes into

3671
01:45:26,991 --> 01:45:29,150
this incredibly painful,

3672
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:32,000
shocking state of muscle contraction,

3673
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:35,200
including your CAC ruined.

3674
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,980
Then it breaks like a fucking,

3675
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,570
like a ballpark frank,

3676
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:39,111
you know,

3677
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:40,130
they plump when you cook them.

3678
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:40,581
That's it.

3679
01:45:40,581 --> 01:45:41,414
That's going to happen.

3680
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,930
Pop boom by just an evil spider.

3681
01:45:44,931 --> 01:45:48,380
So they're trying to convert this thing
into some sort of a truck viagara thing.

3682
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:50,870
He just used to a sudafed.

3683
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:53,270
Sudafed works to counter it.

3684
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:54,463
Oh,

3685
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:55,850
are you joking?

3686
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:56,420
Nope.

3687
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:59,990
What do you mean sudafed will counter
the effect of the Brazilian wandering at

3688
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:03,460
spider of like Viagara if you're
telling me it's why I think is fiber,

3689
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:03,840
the beaches,

3690
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,370
Silas,

3691
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:05,450
I don't think it works the same.

3692
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,280
I mean obviously it's way more potent.

3693
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:07,880
Yeah,

3694
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,230
I'm still blocks the same thing.

3695
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:09,501
Oh,

3696
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:09,891
okay.

3697
01:46:09,891 --> 01:46:10,161
So,

3698
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:11,360
and if you do that,

3699
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:14,480
what do you take and how
much you take the Sudafed,

3700
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:19,250
but what is the 30 milligrams
per tablet and it's two tablets,

3701
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:20,330
but what is sudafed?

3702
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:21,940
It's a decongestant.

3703
01:46:21,941 --> 01:46:23,090
It so reverses.

3704
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:23,661
No,

3705
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:23,781
no,

3706
01:46:23,781 --> 01:46:23,900
no.

3707
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:26,060
I mean like is there a
chemical name for Sudafed?

3708
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,130
F Adrin pseudo ephedra.

3709
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:29,023
Ephedra

3710
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:30,980
yeah.

3711
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:32,240
So sudafed is like a speed,

3712
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:34,940
so it causes the blood vessels to do this.

3713
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:36,380
Fabric causes it to do this.

3714
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:37,214
This causes of the,

3715
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:37,971
wow.

3716
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:42,530
So if you take that sort of speed
stuff after you take Viagra,

3717
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,350
you're unbelievably painful reaction,

3718
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:44,900
we'll go down.

3719
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:45,733
Correct.

3720
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,060
Yeah.

3721
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:47,240
And it's called priapism.

3722
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,290
Those poor bastards.

3723
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:48,500
Yeah.

3724
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,070
Sometimes they have to
get their penis is drained

3725
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:51,720
out.

3726
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,151
She why?

3727
01:46:52,151 --> 01:46:52,650
Why?

3728
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,431
Cause they got crazy,

3729
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:53,820
right?

3730
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,410
They went to nine much too much.

3731
01:46:55,411 --> 01:46:56,244
You've got too crazy.

3732
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,980
You got that 10 hour bone or something.

3733
01:46:59,490 --> 01:46:59,830
Nine.

3734
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,800
So happy people are so stupid though.

3735
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:02,730
Like if you give them the,

3736
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:03,510
they get orders,

3737
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:07,530
many cheeseburgers they want
and we'll fucking cheeseburgers.

3738
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:11,610
If you just give him a bottle of this
crazy Brazilian wandering spider dick pill

3739
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,630
and they think that shit home,

3740
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:14,130
they're just going to suck
down the whole bottle.

3741
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,630
People in nutty.

3742
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:16,171
What'd you read that?

3743
01:47:16,171 --> 01:47:17,040
Scientific American.

3744
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:22,070
I know it because it's in my art because
I'm very intuitive and I'm a healer and

3745
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,190
I'm out there holding hands
with people and healing them.

3746
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,301
I met a dude once,

3747
01:47:27,301 --> 01:47:28,170
told me he was a healer.

3748
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:29,843
I walked away.

3749
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,261
I was like,

3750
01:47:31,261 --> 01:47:32,094
we're not talking anymore,

3751
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:32,580
dude.

3752
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,570
You're not a fucking healer.

3753
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,093
I'm a healer.

3754
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:35,700
Basically.

3755
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:36,533
Healer.

3756
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:38,460
Have you ever had anybody try to heal you?

3757
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:39,443
Mark Gordon,

3758
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,560
no chick stories not settled down.

3759
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,150
It's not that kind of show.

3760
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,530
No,

3761
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:49,080
it never had anyone tried
to heal me other than an MD.

3762
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:49,890
Ah,

3763
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:50,940
well then you're a smart man.

3764
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:54,060
Trust and the bottle of Scotch.

3765
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:58,420
Scotch doesn't work as long as you have
that glue to file on nearby to snap on

3766
01:47:58,830 --> 01:47:59,521
replenishment,

3767
01:47:59,521 --> 01:48:00,390
keeping my hormones,

3768
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:01,051
I lost.

3769
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:05,310
I was at the beginning of this whole
soldier and that I went on from being

3770
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:06,660
diagnosed with a hormone deficiency.

3771
01:48:06,661 --> 01:48:08,340
I weighed 178 pounds,

3772
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,960
21% body fat.

3773
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:14,490
18 months later I was 214
pounds at nine to 10 pounds.

3774
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,230
Nine to 10% body fat.

3775
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:17,130
Wow.

3776
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:17,963
Yeah,

3777
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,320
because the thyroid deficiency was
helping me to gain all this weight and low

3778
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:23,580
testosterone.

3779
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:26,880
Do you think that the social stigma
that's attached to people cheating and

3780
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:28,890
sports and steroids,

3781
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,250
uh,

3782
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:32,760
that keeps people from exploring
the idea of hormonal replacement,

3783
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:35,040
but it seems to be a stigma behind it.

3784
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,790
Like the idea of taking testosterone
or whatever the fuck you're taking.

3785
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:39,680
Growth Hormone.

3786
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:43,250
I think it's a medical issue where the,

3787
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:49,190
the medical community as a whole has
taken this position of demonizing

3788
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:55,290
testosterone and growth hormone and
all the hormone is also saying that,

3789
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,011
you know,

3790
01:48:56,011 --> 01:48:57,810
they don't really need to be replaced,

3791
01:48:58,170 --> 01:48:59,900
but I've got what,

3792
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:03,900
7,000 articles in my library on this
new book that I'm working on for head

3793
01:49:03,901 --> 01:49:04,734
trauma.

3794
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,210
We're almost,

3795
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:10,920
every single one has a positive statement
to make about how it improves mental

3796
01:49:10,921 --> 01:49:11,551
functioning,

3797
01:49:11,551 --> 01:49:12,480
how it improves,

3798
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:13,380
uh,

3799
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:13,981
depression,

3800
01:49:13,981 --> 01:49:16,320
anxiety and how it improves,

3801
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,400
um,

3802
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:18,660
personal interactions,

3803
01:49:18,661 --> 01:49:19,381
sexual drive,

3804
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:21,180
physical stamina and so forth and so on.

3805
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:26,100
And you get a number of articles that
come out to refute it because it just

3806
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:31,101
doesn't fit in the social cultural
design that is being made for us.

3807
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:34,290
And the articles that
come out to refute it.

3808
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:35,520
You're talking about scientific art,

3809
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:36,390
scientific articles.

3810
01:49:36,391 --> 01:49:38,520
What's the basis of their
argument against that?

3811
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:39,383
Well,

3812
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:42,870
if you really read close
their scientific study,

3813
01:49:42,871 --> 01:49:44,490
like the one that came out recently,

3814
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:48,910
you probably saw it was in I think New
England Journal and medicine or the Jama

3815
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:54,040
where it said that people who take
testosterone after they've had a

3816
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:55,330
cardiovascular event,

3817
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,710
heart attack or something,

3818
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:59,470
or had a stint put in or
had open heart surgery,

3819
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:04,810
that they die at a couple of percents
greater than the people who don't use it.

3820
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:06,970
But if you looked at the study,

3821
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:11,380
it was flawed study who's a
floss studied and it was um,

3822
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:12,100
you know,

3823
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:16,750
it was spun so that it would put more
fear into people about testosterone.

3824
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:18,980
Do you think that that's done on purpose?

3825
01:50:18,981 --> 01:50:20,660
Do you think that this is
something like they say,

3826
01:50:20,661 --> 01:50:20,871
okay,

3827
01:50:20,871 --> 01:50:24,980
what is the angle where we can attack
testosterone while you have this angle?

3828
01:50:24,981 --> 01:50:25,814
You could say,

3829
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:29,630
we have this one task and it could
be interpreted erroneously this way,

3830
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,880
so let's do that and pretend
it's under good faith.

3831
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:32,743
Correct.

3832
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:33,340
Uh,

3833
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:38,250
so they're academicians is one that I
interacted with at Ucla who were reviewed

3834
01:50:38,251 --> 01:50:39,450
and wrote a little article,

3835
01:50:39,451 --> 01:50:44,451
a little statement on how flawed
the study was and you know,

3836
01:50:44,521 --> 01:50:48,510
there are people coming up that people
can become famous for either developing

3837
01:50:48,511 --> 01:50:50,970
something or refuting
something that was developed.

3838
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:51,930
You know,

3839
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:52,763
just amount,

3840
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:57,270
equal amount of people want to hear
that what you've developed is bullshit.

3841
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,340
Just as mad as people.

3842
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:02,700
There's an equal amount of people want
to hear that what you developed is

3843
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:03,500
beneficial.

3844
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,080
We don't want to hear that when
it comes to science and medicine.

3845
01:51:06,081 --> 01:51:07,970
We don't ever want to
believe there's ego involved.

3846
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,020
We just don't.

3847
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:09,441
We just,

3848
01:51:09,441 --> 01:51:10,320
we don't want to hear it.

3849
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:10,550
Yeah,

3850
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,940
right.

3851
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,560
People,

3852
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:14,030
he will fight that like they
fight the daddies and asshole.

3853
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:16,280
If you found out the daddy
really was an asshole,

3854
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:16,821
you know,

3855
01:51:16,821 --> 01:51:17,061
you're like,

3856
01:51:17,061 --> 01:51:17,894
God dammit.

3857
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:20,300
I was holding out hope that
daddy wasn't an asshole.

3858
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:21,373
Why is that?

3859
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:22,843
Human Nature?

3860
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,350
It's just human nature.

3861
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:28,510
I think that companies would compete
knowing that the result would be that you,

3862
01:51:28,511 --> 01:51:31,400
you might take something effective out
of the market just because you're trying

3863
01:51:31,401 --> 01:51:31,911
to profit,

3864
01:51:31,911 --> 01:51:33,140
but people could benefit from it.

3865
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,033
Yeah.

3866
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:39,100
I know that there are congressional
laws behind growth hormone that makes it

3867
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:43,450
illegal for any doctor to dispense
it for quote unquote anti aging.

3868
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:45,581
We'll see.

3869
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,150
You know,

3870
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:49,420
why does it make it illegal for anyone
to dispense it for any reasons if it's

3871
01:51:49,421 --> 01:51:50,980
effective in enhancing health?

3872
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:51,843
Correct.

3873
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:57,180
But a colleague of mine who sees a
lot of people from the government in

3874
01:51:57,491 --> 01:51:58,324
Washington,

3875
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,500
a lot of them are on growth hormone.

3876
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,900
Of course they are the old
fucking creepy bastards.

3877
01:52:01,901 --> 01:52:02,090
Yeah.

3878
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:04,270
It's like trying to live forever
and that shut everybody else down.

3879
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:04,850
It's right.

3880
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:06,320
It's like the con,

3881
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:06,740
I mean,

3882
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:09,170
the constitution states at
whatever congress passes,

3883
01:52:09,171 --> 01:52:10,190
they have to use two,

3884
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:12,470
but they've exempted themselves from the,

3885
01:52:12,710 --> 01:52:13,280
uh,

3886
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,380
the new health care laws.

3887
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:14,591
Well,

3888
01:52:14,591 --> 01:52:16,360
there's just a lot of really weird rules.

3889
01:52:16,361 --> 01:52:19,870
Like there has to be something grossly
wrong with you for you to be prescribed

3890
01:52:19,871 --> 01:52:21,790
something that could be beneficial.

3891
01:52:21,791 --> 01:52:26,050
Like you know the story behind
provigil provigil first came along,

3892
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:27,510
they were trying to make a,

3893
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,930
a drug that enhances cognitive
function and the government was like,

3894
01:52:31,931 --> 01:52:33,040
no,

3895
01:52:33,041 --> 01:52:34,840
it's got to cure a disease.

3896
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:35,501
And they went,

3897
01:52:35,501 --> 01:52:36,520
okay,

3898
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:37,383
narcolepsy.

3899
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,580
So the use of fucking narcolepsy,

3900
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:43,270
but really what it is is a performance
enhancing drug for mental acuity,

3901
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,570
but they keep it.

3902
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:45,440
How crazy is that?

3903
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,070
You can't say

3904
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,550
that.

3905
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:47,361
You can't say,

3906
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:47,541
well,

3907
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:49,010
we've got something that
makes you think better.

3908
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:53,180
Are you stopping the
disease if you're not,

3909
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,420
stop roid now will you have as legal?

3910
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:57,351
Well,

3911
01:52:57,351 --> 01:53:02,351
they found a use for a
provigil and Nuvigil that's
outside of narcolepsy in it's

3912
01:53:02,781 --> 01:53:07,781
called work place fatigue and they gave
it what's called an ICD nine which is

3913
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:11,780
the international classification
of disease coding.

3914
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,680
Did I got a disease?

3915
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:13,220
Yeah,

3916
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:13,700
you've got,

3917
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:14,330
you know,

3918
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:15,860
because she worked so late.

3919
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:16,620
Yes,

3920
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:20,390
I have a disease the morning you
wake up and you're Fatina pro vigil.

3921
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:21,320
How many scripts do you want?

3922
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:21,560
A bit.

3923
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,600
They'll say probably not
good to eat every day though,

3924
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:24,434
right?

3925
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:26,210
Tim?

3926
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:28,730
Tim Ferriss was on the podcast
talking about that in fact.

3927
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:29,211
And he said,

3928
01:53:29,211 --> 01:53:29,361
uh,

3929
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:32,450
there's no biological
free lunch and correct.

3930
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:36,370
That one seems you always have to
pay a little too wild to be safe.

3931
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:40,130
Well new vigil cheaper and also smoother.

3932
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:42,260
Really well a new vigils.

3933
01:53:42,261 --> 01:53:43,430
Actually the only shit that I've tried,

3934
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,480
but uh,

3935
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,640
it's a pretty shocking
how well that stuff works.

3936
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,620
You almost are reluctant to talk about it.

3937
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:49,760
How much is each pill?

3938
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:50,863
I don't know.

3939
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:51,330
Bob.

3940
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:52,163
One,

3941
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:53,090
one 50 milligrams.

3942
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:53,410
All right.

3943
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:54,243
How many,

3944
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,100
I don't know.

3945
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:56,900
It's like 20 to $25 a pill.

3946
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:01,610
How much is [inaudible] I used to buy it,

3947
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:02,030
you know,

3948
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:04,790
cause we have a pharmacist at seven bucks.

3949
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:05,570
One of the hard tech.

3950
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:06,260
That's why he bought it.

3951
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:06,630
Goddamn.

3952
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:07,490
Absolutely.

3953
01:54:07,491 --> 01:54:08,960
Cause you had a pharmacist's license.

3954
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:10,633
Why didn't,

3955
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,270
why didn't you buy like birth
control pills while you're out it,

3956
01:54:14,271 --> 01:54:15,110
you didn't need those.

3957
01:54:15,111 --> 01:54:15,381
All right,

3958
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:16,214
fellow,

3959
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,710
I personally don't take
birth control pills.

3960
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:18,951
Yeah,

3961
01:54:18,951 --> 01:54:19,641
I wouldn't either.

3962
01:54:19,641 --> 01:54:20,750
I think it's a bad idea.

3963
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:22,520
Just let nature run its course.

3964
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:22,971
Absolutely.

3965
01:54:22,971 --> 01:54:24,320
Get pregnant if you get pregnant.

3966
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:24,861
Be the first.

3967
01:54:24,861 --> 01:54:25,694
Absolutely.

3968
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:26,600
Um,

3969
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,261
there's a,

3970
01:54:27,261 --> 01:54:30,830
there's a lot of a reluctance to
talk about the provigil and Nuvigil.

3971
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:31,191
In fact,

3972
01:54:31,191 --> 01:54:32,230
I had a guy that's a,

3973
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,260
from maps,

3974
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:36,950
the multidisciplinary
psychedelic studies group didn't,

3975
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:37,550
was,

3976
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:39,260
it wasn't going to tell the,

3977
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:41,890
like the audience that he was on
provigil while the show was on,

3978
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:42,201
I was like,

3979
01:54:42,201 --> 01:54:43,040
why would you hide that?

3980
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:43,281
It's like,

3981
01:54:43,281 --> 01:54:43,521
wow,

3982
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:44,870
it just seems like he goes,

3983
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:45,531
I flew here,

3984
01:54:45,531 --> 01:54:46,251
I was very tired.

3985
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:46,460
I go,

3986
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,710
it's a totally legitimate
reason to take it.

3987
01:54:48,711 --> 01:54:49,130
Like,

3988
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:50,510
and it's not a bad thing.

3989
01:54:50,511 --> 01:54:51,470
You're obviously not,

3990
01:54:51,471 --> 01:54:52,610
it's not like you're drunk.

3991
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,990
It's not like you're out of control.

3992
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:55,490
You're functioning totally normally.

3993
01:54:55,491 --> 01:54:58,070
Like why be ashamed a
wasn't really ashamed,

3994
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:00,080
but he was a bit concerned about the,

3995
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:00,670
like,

3996
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,420
like people would not take him seriously.

3997
01:55:02,421 --> 01:55:02,511
Oh,

3998
01:55:02,511 --> 01:55:04,280
the guy wasn't even sober
when he was on the show,

3999
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:04,670
you know?

4000
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:05,210
Oh,

4001
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:05,841
that's what it is.

4002
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:06,141
It's not,

4003
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:07,250
you're doing scientific studies.

4004
01:55:07,251 --> 01:55:09,470
You're not just using it
as an excuse or a crutch.

4005
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:11,270
So he was a little bit reluctant,

4006
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:12,440
which I thought was really fascinating.

4007
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,790
But it's not speed.

4008
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:14,180
No,

4009
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:14,361
no,

4010
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:15,120
it's not at all.

4011
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:15,651
It doesn't,

4012
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:16,150
uh,

4013
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:16,460
you know,

4014
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,110
Warp your cognition,

4015
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:18,651
your brain,

4016
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:23,180
and you're not talking rapidly and
smoking cigarettes and tremors.

4017
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:23,871
Yeah.

4018
01:55:23,871 --> 01:55:25,430
That can be a real issue with people.

4019
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:26,264
Huh?

4020
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:27,710
There's a lot of people that can do it.

4021
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:31,100
I've seen people that have
had real problems with that
Adderall stuff where they

4022
01:55:31,101 --> 01:55:33,300
just get whacked out and
they know when it stopped.

4023
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,840
What meth amphetamine,

4024
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:36,651
Adderall is.

4025
01:55:36,651 --> 01:55:37,484
Methamphetamine.

4026
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:38,720
Meth as,

4027
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:39,860
and I hate to interrupt here,

4028
01:55:39,861 --> 01:55:40,760
but I have to pee.

4029
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:41,640
I've,

4030
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,920
but I want to keep the show going,

4031
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:43,501
but I have to pee.

4032
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:43,951
So Jamie,

4033
01:55:43,951 --> 01:55:44,190
please

4034
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,030
talk to him about math.

4035
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:45,983
Okay.

4036
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:47,310
I'll take an Adderall.

4037
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:52,311
Before I took it once and I wanted to
do some art projects and I'd never taken

4038
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:52,710
it.

4039
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:53,610
Friend gave it to me,

4040
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:55,470
so I took a time release capsule,

4041
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:56,320
hope.

4042
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,800
I'm hoping that it would
just give me a little,

4043
01:55:59,220 --> 01:55:59,850
a little ding,

4044
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:01,650
but it kept me up for two days.

4045
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:03,630
It felt like I was poopy all day.

4046
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:05,443
You know,

4047
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:08,670
I restricted my own license,

4048
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:10,290
my own prescribing license.

4049
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:11,670
So I only do class three.

4050
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:11,851
You know,

4051
01:56:11,851 --> 01:56:14,370
they have a class two class one,

4052
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:15,623
you know,

4053
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:20,660
heroin and quaaludes and
whatever else and two is um,

4054
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:22,680
Adderall and I restricted my license.

4055
01:56:22,681 --> 01:56:27,000
I had so many people coming in thinking
that they can just get Adderall because

4056
01:56:27,001 --> 01:56:27,790
they're asking for it.

4057
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:28,441
And I'm very,

4058
01:56:28,441 --> 01:56:30,000
very strict on how I dispense stuff.

4059
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:34,620
I try not to dispense any medications
that I don't absolutely have to.

4060
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:38,400
And I find that a lot of times that
when you correct the underlying hormone

4061
01:56:38,401 --> 01:56:39,181
deficiencies,

4062
01:56:39,181 --> 01:56:40,800
that the person gets better,

4063
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:41,640
their cognition,

4064
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:43,530
their energy level improves.

4065
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:43,951
In fact,

4066
01:56:43,951 --> 01:56:45,510
in traumatic brain injury,

4067
01:56:45,511 --> 01:56:49,530
the number one symptom across
all the studies is fatigue.

4068
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,600
And the minute you correct their hormones,

4069
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:52,500
the fatigue is gone.

4070
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:53,160
Wow.

4071
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:53,461
I had,

4072
01:56:53,461 --> 01:56:53,760
uh,

4073
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:54,061
you know,

4074
01:56:54,061 --> 01:56:56,040
initially a lot of people
coming in from the military,

4075
01:56:56,041 --> 01:57:01,041
the military likes using things like
Adderall and provigil in new vigil Nuvigil

4076
01:57:02,671 --> 01:57:04,050
vigilant pro vigil are,

4077
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:07,020
they worked very well without
causing a lot of side effects.

4078
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:08,100
But methamphetamine,

4079
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:11,550
silliest thing that I have is
patients who come in on a multitude of

4080
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:14,190
antipsychotic drugs I can't
do to presidents and so forth.

4081
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:18,750
And because they're on so much to
control how bad they feel they have,

4082
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,340
they're fatigued.

4083
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:24,840
And so the doctors counters
it with Adderall and then
adds another drug because

4084
01:57:24,841 --> 01:57:27,600
they can't sleep at night called
Tressa don so they can sleep.

4085
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:28,370
Here's the

4086
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:28,851
question though,

4087
01:57:28,851 --> 01:57:31,670
is there ever going to come a point in
time where they can engineer the perfect

4088
01:57:31,671 --> 01:57:35,060
blend and you take something and
everything just works perfect?

4089
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:35,790
I mean,

4090
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:40,040
if we're enhancing our bodies in any
way with new chemicals and new medical

4091
01:57:40,041 --> 01:57:40,874
innovation,

4092
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,990
do you think there's going to be,

4093
01:57:41,991 --> 01:57:42,380
I mean,

4094
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:43,201
maybe this is just,

4095
01:57:43,201 --> 01:57:44,330
they're just not that good at it yet,

4096
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:47,450
but one day then I have this one
pill and you take it and boom.

4097
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:47,980
Yeah.

4098
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:49,660
I don't think there'll be just one pill.

4099
01:57:49,661 --> 01:57:53,820
I think there'll be one pill for people
like you and one pill for people like me

4100
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:58,240
because we're so genetically diverse and
biochemically diverse that it would be

4101
01:57:58,241 --> 01:58:00,460
nice to have one pill fits all,

4102
01:58:00,461 --> 01:58:01,294
but that's,

4103
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:02,590
it's impossible.

4104
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:03,310
It's impossible.

4105
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:03,850
Right.

4106
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:04,683
But do you feel

4107
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:08,650
there'll be some sort of conditions like
that in the very near and foreseeable

4108
01:58:08,651 --> 01:58:09,100
future?

4109
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:09,470
Yeah.

4110
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:10,160
Um,

4111
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:10,461
you know,

4112
01:58:10,461 --> 01:58:11,330
they're working on a,

4113
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:12,351
I don't know if you remember,

4114
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:15,410
I think it was star trek number two with
bones is walking through the hospital

4115
01:58:15,411 --> 01:58:19,960
in San Francisco and he hands a pill to
a woman who's getting ready to have or

4116
01:58:19,961 --> 01:58:23,990
renal kidney transplant and she takes
it and her kidneys start functioning

4117
01:58:23,991 --> 01:58:24,560
again.

4118
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,730
We're going to be finding,

4119
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:29,390
we're going to be finding medications
that turn the genetic code on for

4120
01:58:29,391 --> 01:58:30,230
different areas.

4121
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:31,370
And that's why I was asking you about,

4122
01:58:31,570 --> 01:58:31,820
you know,

4123
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:33,260
your genetics being tested.

4124
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:34,250
Um,

4125
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:39,250
we have products that are being studied
to turn on the genetic matrix and we

4126
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,430
have others that stimulate

4127
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:44,050
what they call Epi genetics.

4128
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:44,980
It's not the genes,

4129
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:49,210
but it's the things that control the
genes so you can influence the genes

4130
01:58:49,211 --> 01:58:51,820
directly and then you can influence the,

4131
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:52,690
um,

4132
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:55,390
the way the genes are
expressed and epigenetics.

4133
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,740
So I think they'll find,

4134
01:58:56,741 --> 01:58:59,440
once they finalize the,

4135
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:00,490
we have the map,

4136
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,800
but we don't know where we're
going with genetic coding.

4137
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:05,520
We know that that's ACD BBB bit,

4138
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:07,660
but we don't know what that piece does.

4139
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:08,110
Right.

4140
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:08,870
We don't know.

4141
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:09,131
You know,

4142
01:59:09,131 --> 01:59:11,440
we know the Br gene for breast cancer,

4143
01:59:11,441 --> 01:59:13,720
we know this thing for
that cancer and so forth.

4144
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:18,070
And we're still trying to figure
out what that coding means,

4145
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:20,110
what each piece of it means.

4146
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:21,490
It's a piece of a puzzle and it's,

4147
01:59:21,491 --> 01:59:25,480
is it just because it's a new science and
it's just an incredibly complex puzzle

4148
01:59:25,481 --> 01:59:25,900
and,

4149
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,291
but you,

4150
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:26,531
you,

4151
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:29,440
you're confident that eventually they'll
have eventually I'll have it in once

4152
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:33,430
they learn how to master without
creating zombies or something.

4153
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,620
Fuck Dude.

4154
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:37,630
Yeah.

4155
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:39,340
My kids got me into walking dead.

4156
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:40,823
You're going to quit.

4157
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,340
I already did last season.

4158
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:43,480
You're going to get upset with yourself.

4159
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,230
Well,

4160
01:59:44,230 --> 01:59:47,140
for watching the first season
was fucking spectacular.

4161
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:50,290
The first season got everybody hooked
and it's just not like that anymore.

4162
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:54,300
But when you see something like World
War z or you see something like that and

4163
01:59:54,301 --> 01:59:54,470
you,

4164
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:56,830
do you worry that one day
there's going to be some sort of,

4165
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:57,100
uh,

4166
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:57,970
absolutely.

4167
01:59:59,050 --> 01:59:59,920
Absolutely.

4168
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:01,283
You know,

4169
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:01,841
you know,

4170
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:04,780
the old saying don't
fuck with Mother Nature.

4171
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:05,620
I never heard that.

4172
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,610
I know you're New Jersey.

4173
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:09,400
Oh fuck.

4174
02:00:09,401 --> 02:00:11,870
With Mother Nature Boston in New Jersey.

4175
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:12,400
Yeah,

4176
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:12,910
sure,

4177
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:13,360
sure.

4178
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,710
They didn't teach us
that in Boston either.

4179
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:15,460
No,

4180
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:16,530
don't feel broke.

4181
02:00:16,610 --> 02:00:16,960
You,

4182
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,980
you're in parochial school,

4183
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,780
Mother Nature was a content made it snow,

4184
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:20,780
so it was,

4185
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:21,613
okay.

4186
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:22,630
Cool.

4187
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,910
So what's going to ensure
exactly what parochial school is?

4188
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:25,773
That's right.

4189
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:26,883
You get parole.

4190
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,090
It's a religious school.

4191
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:29,050
Oh No,

4192
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:31,090
we would boys Catholic
school for one year.

4193
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:31,690
Oh,

4194
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:32,080
sorry.

4195
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,070
So what we did,

4196
02:00:33,071 --> 02:00:34,870
Loyola for two good Jewish boy.

4197
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:35,580
Oh,

4198
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,190
I got my graduate through regulations.

4199
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:37,661
You made it through,

4200
02:00:37,661 --> 02:00:37,931
that's like,

4201
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:38,764
Nah.

4202
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:40,240
Absolutely.

4203
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:40,980
So tell me,

4204
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:41,590
um,

4205
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,423
you know,

4206
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:47,640
my fear is that when we start playing
with stuff we don't fully understand,

4207
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:51,820
we're going to have a lot of
errors are a number of errors.

4208
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:53,940
That's why up in aren't Arctica.

4209
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:55,900
They have those little compounds.

4210
02:00:55,901 --> 02:00:57,430
So in case anything goes wrong,

4211
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:59,500
it's in one little area.

4212
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:01,210
Do you listen to the Alex Jones show?

4213
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:02,253
No.

4214
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:05,950
I know the FEMA camps and Antarctica.

4215
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:07,301
No,

4216
02:01:07,301 --> 02:01:08,870
this is biotechnology council.

4217
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,330
Okay.

4218
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:09,700
Yeah.

4219
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:09,851
Oh,

4220
02:01:09,851 --> 02:01:13,990
so they have like in case the
shit hits the fan it cold areas,

4221
02:01:13,991 --> 02:01:14,171
you know,

4222
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:15,160
it's not like a,

4223
02:01:15,161 --> 02:01:16,060
what was that from?

4224
02:01:16,061 --> 02:01:16,894
Um,

4225
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:17,920
uh,

4226
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,753
Jeez,

4227
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:20,560
the Zombie movie.

4228
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,151
Uh,

4229
02:01:21,151 --> 02:01:22,900
the first one that
started the whole series,

4230
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:24,610
it was from a computer program,

4231
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:25,923
computer game,

4232
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:27,520
computer games.

4233
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:31,080
I came out of computer game where
the a Zombie came out of a computer.

4234
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:32,500
Now it back off.

4235
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:33,041
Hey,

4236
02:01:33,041 --> 02:01:33,461
easy.

4237
02:01:33,461 --> 02:01:35,010
You don't want a shitty
at explaining things.

4238
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:38,170
I just can't remember the name of
the program because I don't do games.

4239
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:38,950
Right.

4240
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:39,800
I play games.

4241
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,130
Oh,

4242
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,210
I know what you're talking about.

4243
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:41,451
Meat,

4244
02:01:41,451 --> 02:01:41,990
Milos,

4245
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:42,710
Milos,

4246
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:43,543
your bitch.

4247
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:50,200
The evil resident evil that was a computer
game wasn't hot for surface that she

4248
02:01:53,061 --> 02:01:55,700
gets surface of the
Sun hot like Gary Hart,

4249
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:56,541
like ruin your life.

4250
02:01:56,541 --> 02:01:57,374
Hot.

4251
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:58,693
She's matured.

4252
02:01:58,910 --> 02:01:59,743
So anyway,

4253
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:00,883
playing with,

4254
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:05,600
tried to enhance the quality of life
and they came with a retro virus that

4255
02:02:05,601 --> 02:02:07,070
created the problem.

4256
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:08,810
So if you look at probably walking dead,

4257
02:02:08,811 --> 02:02:09,960
it's for retro virus.

4258
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:13,520
Well rage was the stuff that
they'd given the chimpanzee.

4259
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:15,350
Oh look at that.

4260
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,011
God Damn,

4261
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:16,844
that's a woman.

4262
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:19,730
Oh that shit makes me nervous.

4263
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,740
But she doesn't like that.

4264
02:02:21,741 --> 02:02:22,311
Make me nervous,

4265
02:02:22,311 --> 02:02:22,820
man.

4266
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:23,121
I know,

4267
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:23,301
man.

4268
02:02:23,301 --> 02:02:24,980
I'm too stupid to be
around someone like that.

4269
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,113
Um,

4270
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:27,170
so that was a,

4271
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:28,070
in the movie,

4272
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:29,270
28 days later,

4273
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,410
that rage,

4274
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:33,800
they had given it to these chimpanzees
and they had developed some sort of a

4275
02:02:33,801 --> 02:02:35,390
genetic disease,

4276
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:39,160
some creation and artificial disease
and it got out and turned everybody into

4277
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:40,003
savages.

4278
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:42,230
That was a realistic scenario.

4279
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:42,680
Well,

4280
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:46,700
they're all potentially realistic when
we start screwing around with genetics.

4281
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:47,693
Oh No.

4282
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,400
It's all potential.

4283
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:50,540
It's like,

4284
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:50,811
you know,

4285
02:02:50,811 --> 02:02:52,460
when they were making the atomic bomb,

4286
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:52,820
they,

4287
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:57,200
they were afraid to light it off because
they thought that the ionosphere would

4288
02:02:57,201 --> 02:02:59,120
be ignited in the earth would burn.

4289
02:02:59,210 --> 02:02:59,750
Yeah.

4290
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:00,231
But they said,

4291
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:00,381
well,

4292
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:00,890
let's see.

4293
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:01,310
We'll see.

4294
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:01,820
That's right.

4295
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,001
Yeah.

4296
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:03,380
That's the attitude they took.

4297
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:05,760
Retro virus.

4298
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:05,990
Uh,

4299
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:06,250
you know,

4300
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:07,700
it can make zombies out of everybody,

4301
02:03:07,701 --> 02:03:08,870
but we're not sure.

4302
02:03:08,871 --> 02:03:11,660
Let's see if it enhances them
before it makes him into a Zombie.

4303
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:15,320
And it's not like we don't have
massive amounts of examples of terrible

4304
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:20,321
situations when it comes to like animal
life and like as spiders and tigers in

4305
02:03:20,331 --> 02:03:23,090
Africa or tigers in Asia
and lions in Africa,

4306
02:03:23,091 --> 02:03:23,401
like there,

4307
02:03:23,401 --> 02:03:26,480
there's plenty of examples
of horrific hell's on earth.

4308
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:27,051
You know,

4309
02:03:27,051 --> 02:03:30,680
if you happen to be in them and if
you're a an antelope and you're running

4310
02:03:30,681 --> 02:03:33,620
around and there was no lions and
all of sudden the line was there,

4311
02:03:33,621 --> 02:03:34,041
he'd be like,

4312
02:03:34,041 --> 02:03:34,970
fuck.

4313
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:35,451
Well,

4314
02:03:35,451 --> 02:03:38,570
if we're running around cities and there's
no zombies and then one day there are

4315
02:03:38,571 --> 02:03:41,240
zombies that's gone off fucking suck.

4316
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,970
And if it is one of those things where
they bite you and then you have it and

4317
02:03:43,971 --> 02:03:46,730
then you bite someone and they haven't
and it just spreads like in that fucking

4318
02:03:46,731 --> 02:03:47,810
World War z movie,

4319
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:48,620
but,

4320
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:50,600
but in walking dead,

4321
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:54,320
what's the premise there that
we all already have it in us.

4322
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:55,520
That premise is whack.

4323
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:56,680
How did it happen that uh,

4324
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:57,081
if I,

4325
02:03:57,081 --> 02:03:58,760
if I found out that I
was going to be a Zombie,

4326
02:03:58,761 --> 02:04:00,140
I'd shoot myself in the fucking head.

4327
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:00,974
What am I going to do?

4328
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:04,700
This band of fucking scallywags they're
trotting around the country with,

4329
02:04:04,701 --> 02:04:05,534
they're going to fix it.

4330
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:08,500
They're not going to fix that badly.

4331
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:09,280
What seasoned,

4332
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:14,280
seasoned them billion just
fucks try watching it on
television and get broken up

4333
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:16,380
every five minutes with a tie.

4334
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:19,160
Dad Try watching that shit on TV?

4335
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:20,180
No.

4336
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,290
So you're worried about,

4337
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:23,350
you're worried about genetic engineering?

4338
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:24,080
Yeah.

4339
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:25,130
Are you worried about it with foods?

4340
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:25,460
Do you,

4341
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:28,340
do you eat like totally organic
and no Gmos and all that shit?

4342
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:29,180
What is it sir?

4343
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:29,900
Brought you one.

4344
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,380
What is it?

4345
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:31,213
No Gmo.

4346
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:32,150
What is it called?

4347
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:34,160
Ratio ratio and a,

4348
02:04:34,161 --> 02:04:35,210
is it a protein bar?

4349
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:37,040
24 grams of protein,

4350
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:38,250
of net carbs

4351
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:39,570
and four of a fiber.

4352
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:40,980
No Gmo,

4353
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:42,630
no artificial stuff in it.

4354
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:44,010
What's the source of the protein?

4355
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:45,293
Um,

4356
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,193
come.

4357
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,033
Hey,

4358
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,160
what kind of fucking doctor you,

4359
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:54,120
there's people out there
that are writing this down.

4360
02:04:54,410 --> 02:04:58,770
They're like c u m for
common used materials.

4361
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,793
Soy.

4362
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:01,973
This is soy.

4363
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:07,120
So I thought so I made sure tits
grow maybe on you or try went here,

4364
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:07,450
Jamie.

4365
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:08,283
Wow.

4366
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:09,743
Yeah.

4367
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:12,030
The one that I didn't bring you was
the peanut butter and chocolate.

4368
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:14,820
Now I thought soy for real.

4369
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:16,320
I thought it made dudes go pregnant.

4370
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,370
Make your estrogen grow.

4371
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:21,240
No,

4372
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:22,560
it has a light estrogens.

4373
02:05:22,561 --> 02:05:24,420
Genistein and Diastat has founded soil,

4374
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,980
but you have to eat a whole bunch of that.

4375
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:29,130
And that's not true
because Brian Red Band,

4376
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:29,860
you didn't meet him.

4377
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:31,890
He ate like three edit
mommies and he started crying.

4378
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,970
It was watching was in Meg Ryan Film.

4379
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:36,571
Oh yeah,

4380
02:05:36,571 --> 02:05:37,620
that'll do it every time.

4381
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:39,240
And I'm on Ed.

4382
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,250
A mommy will get you do.

4383
02:05:40,350 --> 02:05:41,111
I love that stuff.

4384
02:05:41,111 --> 02:05:41,640
Soya sauce.

4385
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:42,473
That shit will get you.

4386
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:43,351
Well,

4387
02:05:43,351 --> 02:05:47,790
it's a premise that I have is white and
I apologize to any of my Asian brothers

4388
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:48,713
and sisters.

4389
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:50,120
Something raise coming.

4390
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:51,870
It's like saying I'm not a racist,

4391
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:56,370
but this is a theory that I'm working on.

4392
02:05:56,371 --> 02:06:00,570
Why is it that Asian women have
smaller breasts in Western world women.

4393
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:03,570
And the reason is that you
look at their soy intake.

4394
02:06:03,571 --> 02:06:04,440
Soy Is,

4395
02:06:04,441 --> 02:06:05,430
has these two chemicals,

4396
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:06,610
Genistein and Diastat,

4397
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,710
which can block the estrogen receptors
cause it's a weak estrogen receptor.

4398
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:13,610
And the strongest generous
estrogen is Estradiol,

4399
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:15,210
which causes breast tissue to grow.

4400
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:17,520
So women who were in Asia,

4401
02:06:17,521 --> 02:06:19,680
who migrate to Hawaii have higher,

4402
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:20,551
larger breasts,

4403
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:22,260
higher estrodial functioning,

4404
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:26,130
and the come to the United States even
higher because we got so much shit xeno

4405
02:06:26,131 --> 02:06:27,390
estrogens in our food.

4406
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:29,660
That's why we talk with a
high voice with them times.

4407
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:30,900
Wow.

4408
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,740
We have a lot of hormones.

4409
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:32,431
The federal government,

4410
02:06:32,431 --> 02:06:36,780
thank God just said we had to take out
antibiotics from some of our poultry.

4411
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:38,730
We can no longer use in livestock.

4412
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:39,481
Uh,

4413
02:06:39,481 --> 02:06:40,640
I think this year it starts,

4414
02:06:40,641 --> 02:06:45,600
or next year they can't use antibiotics
because our resistance to antibiotics is

4415
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:49,590
possibly coming from the fact that a
lot of our meat has antibiotics in it so

4416
02:06:49,591 --> 02:06:51,060
that the animals are protected.

4417
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:52,350
So that transfers when a,

4418
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:54,450
when an animal gets 10
transcripts and you get the meat,

4419
02:06:54,451 --> 02:06:55,440
you get that antibiotic,

4420
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:56,610
what do you think it reservoirs.

4421
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:58,050
Reservoirs in the tissue.

4422
02:06:58,080 --> 02:06:58,321
Right.

4423
02:06:58,321 --> 02:07:01,050
And is it killed off by heat
or temperature or anything?

4424
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:02,130
You'd have to really cook it.

4425
02:07:02,330 --> 02:07:02,780
Oh,

4426
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:03,271
I'm gonna be really,

4427
02:07:03,271 --> 02:07:04,590
and that's all we do know.

4428
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:06,720
So how do you like your,

4429
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:07,580
sorry.

4430
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:08,413
How do you like your meat?

4431
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,653
I like venison.

4432
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:10,450
Venison.

4433
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:10,670
Yeah,

4434
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:11,460
I'm on a goal.

4435
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:11,661
My,

4436
02:07:11,661 --> 02:07:16,661
I have a goal in 2014 by the end of 2014
I want to be entirely game meat in my

4437
02:07:16,711 --> 02:07:17,544
house.

4438
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:19,140
So you're going to go out and yes,

4439
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:19,891
shooting things.

4440
02:07:19,891 --> 02:07:20,880
I shoved that thing over there.

4441
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:22,590
You shut the skull.

4442
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:22,921
No.

4443
02:07:22,921 --> 02:07:23,700
Shut the whole deer.

4444
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:24,680
That's what's left.

4445
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:25,981
I shot another one.

4446
02:07:25,981 --> 02:07:27,270
This goal then delicious.

4447
02:07:27,271 --> 02:07:27,421
It's,

4448
02:07:27,421 --> 02:07:30,600
it's a thousand times better than any
meat you'd ever get a supermarket.

4449
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,070
And on top of that,

4450
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:33,770
it's way healthier.

4451
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:35,160
It tastes different.

4452
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:35,771
When you eat it,

4453
02:07:35,771 --> 02:07:36,100
you feel

4454
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,850
energized.

4455
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:38,560
That shit is good for free range.

4456
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:39,760
100%.

4457
02:07:39,761 --> 02:07:42,370
So that mother fucker was
hanging out in Montana,

4458
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:42,630
in,

4459
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:43,510
in the mountains.

4460
02:07:44,470 --> 02:07:47,010
We crept up on them and ganged him,

4461
02:07:47,450 --> 02:07:48,283
shot him.

4462
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:51,660
I shot him with a bullet with,

4463
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:52,240
um,

4464
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:52,751
with a gun,

4465
02:07:52,751 --> 02:07:53,890
but I'm going to start.

4466
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,520
Um,

4467
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:54,760
she,

4468
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,990
I'm shooting archery now.

4469
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,550
I just started doing that to practice,

4470
02:07:58,240 --> 02:07:59,050
but I'm not,

4471
02:07:59,050 --> 02:08:02,590
I'm not even thinking about shooting an
animal until I got really fucking good.

4472
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:04,750
I wounded a deer because my,

4473
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:05,351
my,

4474
02:08:05,351 --> 02:08:05,590
uh,

4475
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:08,710
scope was off because I had fallen
and when I fall on the right,

4476
02:08:08,711 --> 02:08:10,630
and I didn't know it was
so easy to throw it off,

4477
02:08:10,631 --> 02:08:13,510
even ask somebody if it could
it be thrown off if you fell.

4478
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:13,991
He's like,

4479
02:08:13,991 --> 02:08:14,950
you'd have to fall really hard.

4480
02:08:14,951 --> 02:08:16,180
You could drop those
things and they're fine.

4481
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:18,220
But it turns out that the
guy who installed my scope,

4482
02:08:18,221 --> 02:08:19,600
he didn't tighten it down very much.

4483
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:20,800
So I wounded an animal.

4484
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:22,000
It's a terrible feeling.

4485
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:24,310
You chase after for two hours,

4486
02:08:24,311 --> 02:08:25,480
we look for it for two hours.

4487
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,290
Um,

4488
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:27,130
and then um,

4489
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:30,650
we came to the conclusion that it's
probably wounded but not mortally wounded.

4490
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:33,550
It's a fairy fucking
horrible depressing feeling.

4491
02:08:34,350 --> 02:08:34,630
You know,

4492
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:38,320
especially when I put a shitload
of time into marksmanship.

4493
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:43,680
I went to the range and shot 90 rounds
one day and then another at least 30 or

4494
02:08:45,221 --> 02:08:48,910
40 the next day before we went just
to get everything tightened down.

4495
02:08:48,911 --> 02:08:51,730
And I was doing it with that 300
win mag are really powerful rifle.

4496
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:53,770
So I wanted to make sure that I was real.

4497
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:54,910
So the first deer I killed,

4498
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:56,260
perfect clean shot.

4499
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:00,700
But the second one I missed it all
together and then I wounded and the second

4500
02:09:00,701 --> 02:09:01,534
attempt to hit it.

4501
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:04,690
So you were at the range where
the full round with a full loads,

4502
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:05,111
well,

4503
02:09:05,111 --> 02:09:06,220
this some rifle ranges,

4504
02:09:06,221 --> 02:09:07,630
you can go to their outdoors,

4505
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:11,980
but their rifle ranges specifically and
they have targets set up at 400 yards.

4506
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,540
700 yards is 900 yards,

4507
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:14,231
100 yards,

4508
02:09:14,231 --> 02:09:15,064
200 yards,

4509
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:15,910
the whole deal.

4510
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:19,240
They have like fucking these little
metal things way out in the distance.

4511
02:09:19,241 --> 02:09:19,840
You can shoot,

4512
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:20,673
hold the plate.

4513
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:21,250
It's good.

4514
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:26,150
You're going to a either a
crossbow or a longbow because uh,

4515
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,000
probably won't be able to get the bullets.

4516
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:28,541
Well,

4517
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:29,590
you can use copper.

4518
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:30,670
You can use copper.

4519
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:30,941
Yeah.

4520
02:09:30,941 --> 02:09:35,620
That's what's going on now with like
hunting and a lot of ranches and things in

4521
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:36,221
California,

4522
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:39,460
they're trying to eliminate lead
because lead is really dangerous to the

4523
02:09:39,461 --> 02:09:39,971
environment,

4524
02:09:39,971 --> 02:09:41,080
to the animals that eat it.

4525
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,810
Birds put it in their
gullet and they get sick.

4526
02:09:43,811 --> 02:09:44,980
Animals eat the birds.

4527
02:09:44,981 --> 02:09:46,420
People eat the animals that eat the birds.

4528
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:46,750
Yeah.

4529
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:50,620
I'm thinking more on the
lines of a homeland security
buying up the millions and

4530
02:09:50,621 --> 02:09:51,580
millions of rounds.

4531
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:52,330
Is that true?

4532
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:52,870
Yep.

4533
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,800
That's an Alex Jones stuff.

4534
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:54,790
Nope.

4535
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:56,260
Homeland Security's buying up bullets.

4536
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:57,183
What are they going to do with them?

4537
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:59,860
They're buying the giveaway of a giveaway.

4538
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:01,600
Look at if they buy them,

4539
02:10:01,601 --> 02:10:03,370
it means less for us to buy.

4540
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:03,821
Yeah,

4541
02:10:03,821 --> 02:10:04,331
that's true.

4542
02:10:04,331 --> 02:10:05,620
But people are always gonna make bullets.

4543
02:10:05,621 --> 02:10:07,150
They're just going to help
out the bullet industry.

4544
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:12,180
People make their own loads to do you
know that the US government used to return

4545
02:10:13,061 --> 02:10:15,460
the metal jackets to the United States,

4546
02:10:15,461 --> 02:10:19,330
be smelted down and regenerated four
bullets and it went into the general

4547
02:10:19,331 --> 02:10:20,260
population to do it.

4548
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:21,790
You know where it's going now?

4549
02:10:22,030 --> 02:10:23,390
Where China Dammit,

4550
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,273
I knew it was China.

4551
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:25,713
China.

4552
02:10:26,590 --> 02:10:28,150
Now you've got aluminum jackets.

4553
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:28,780
Yeah,

4554
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:29,920
you've got aluminum jackets.

4555
02:10:29,921 --> 02:10:30,640
Now,

4556
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,320
some of them with copper,

4557
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:33,733
copper bullets.

4558
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,161
Well,

4559
02:10:34,161 --> 02:10:35,330
some of them are still brass.

4560
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,380
A lot of them are brass.

4561
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:37,700
But either way.

4562
02:10:37,701 --> 02:10:38,421
I mean the,

4563
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:38,990
um,

4564
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:40,370
the federal government
trying to take away,

4565
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:41,540
but what's at this point,

4566
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:42,950
it seems pretty insane.

4567
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:43,843
Unbelievable.

4568
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:47,000
I was reading an article
where there was an Alec jobs.

4569
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:48,230
What are they doing with all that?

4570
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:49,640
Unless they plan on killing us.

4571
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:50,743
They're young.

4572
02:10:52,150 --> 02:10:53,150
They're like the Internet.

4573
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:53,721
These fucks.

4574
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,100
We're going to shoot everybody's computer.

4575
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:56,010
Go look at the,

4576
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:58,940
I think it's called the
three Oh two or three 27,

4577
02:10:58,941 --> 02:11:01,280
which is the sniper rifle rounds.

4578
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:02,300
Look at how many they bought.

4579
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:03,221
Oh my God,

4580
02:11:03,221 --> 02:11:04,100
they're gonna Snipe us.

4581
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,810
And this is for homeland security,

4582
02:11:05,811 --> 02:11:08,330
not for the military going
outside the United States.

4583
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:10,160
Well that's depressing.

4584
02:11:10,161 --> 02:11:11,960
Maybe they know about an
alien invasion that we don't.

4585
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:13,070
How about that?

4586
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:13,903
Maybe it's already here.

4587
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:15,620
Maybe that's why Obama is going gray.

4588
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:17,150
They told him about the aliens.

4589
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:19,260
It's like fuck God,

4590
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:19,970
goddammit by them.

4591
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:20,960
But just by the bullets,

4592
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:21,860
by the bullets.

4593
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:23,030
Did you ever set up snipers?

4594
02:11:23,031 --> 02:11:24,110
Everybody get practice.

4595
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:26,900
The Youtube has something about,

4596
02:11:26,901 --> 02:11:27,734
um,

4597
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,900
lizard eyes or the Lizard people.

4598
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:30,201
I mean,

4599
02:11:30,201 --> 02:11:30,800
David Eick.

4600
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:31,320
David.

4601
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:31,810
Yeah.

4602
02:11:31,810 --> 02:11:32,300
David said,

4603
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:33,260
come on the podcast.

4604
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:34,491
I don't know,

4605
02:11:34,491 --> 02:11:34,820
uh,

4606
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:37,250
if I could have them on and
not talk about the lizards,

4607
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:39,290
but I don't think he wants to
talk about the lizards anymore.

4608
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:40,250
What is he on now?

4609
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:41,600
Um,

4610
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:46,310
while he's got some actually interesting
valid points on corruption and you

4611
02:11:46,311 --> 02:11:46,640
know,

4612
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:48,320
the Illuminati and you know,

4613
02:11:48,321 --> 02:11:49,580
just the way of the world.

4614
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:50,960
But at one point in time,

4615
02:11:50,961 --> 02:11:55,961
he apparently allegedly was stating that
there was certain people that are in

4616
02:11:56,091 --> 02:11:59,720
control and positions of power in
the world that actually are lizards,

4617
02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:00,920
lizard people.

4618
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,753
The reptilians,

4619
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:03,590
the rough shape shifters or some shit.

4620
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:05,120
And everybody was like,

4621
02:12:05,170 --> 02:12:06,003
uh,

4622
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:07,610
you know,

4623
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:08,720
now he doesn't say that anymore.

4624
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,760
What happens is all this,

4625
02:12:10,761 --> 02:12:15,761
this information is to refute people
like David stating about the Reptilian

4626
02:12:16,101 --> 02:12:17,480
people and they really exist.

4627
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,480
The Rep telling and people don't exist.

4628
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:20,360
I'll tell you right now,

4629
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:20,811
okay,

4630
02:12:20,811 --> 02:12:22,640
here's a bunch of shit
that's not real ready.

4631
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:23,590
Go.

4632
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:24,423
Um,

4633
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,740
black people looking for big foot,

4634
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:29,060
not real.

4635
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:29,893
That doesn't exist.

4636
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:30,860
Uh,

4637
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:31,281
let me think.

4638
02:12:31,281 --> 02:12:31,851
What else does it,

4639
02:12:31,851 --> 02:12:33,380
real unicorns,

4640
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:34,460
definitely not real.

4641
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,960
Um,

4642
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:37,363
big foot.

4643
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,170
I got to go with not real.

4644
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:40,041
I know.

4645
02:12:40,041 --> 02:12:41,000
I want to go with real.

4646
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:42,170
Wish it was real.

4647
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:42,861
This is,

4648
02:12:42,861 --> 02:12:43,520
um,

4649
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:43,850
uh,

4650
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:44,690
Pat Mcgee.

4651
02:12:45,030 --> 02:12:45,770
This is,

4652
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:48,470
this is the guy who made the
Werewolf in the front yard.

4653
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:49,191
He's,

4654
02:12:49,191 --> 02:12:49,850
uh,

4655
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:51,140
he's going to make a movie,

4656
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:51,511
uh,

4657
02:12:51,511 --> 02:12:55,180
on big foot and these crowd sourcing
it and he's building all of the,

4658
02:12:55,181 --> 02:12:55,291
uh,

4659
02:12:55,291 --> 02:12:57,800
the parts in his lab here.

4660
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:59,660
And he made this video
and sent it to me today.

4661
02:12:59,661 --> 02:13:00,920
It's fucking sick.

4662
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:05,450
It's if they wanted to do like one
of those Patterson Gimlin movies now,

4663
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:06,141
boy,

4664
02:13:06,141 --> 02:13:08,270
they could freak people the fuck out.

4665
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:13,190
Cause the artificial Bigfoot's that they
create now or are amazing the work that

4666
02:13:13,191 --> 02:13:14,110
they've done in,

4667
02:13:14,111 --> 02:13:15,030
in special effects.

4668
02:13:15,031 --> 02:13:15,441
Let's look at this.

4669
02:13:15,441 --> 02:13:17,090
They're doing this one hair at a time.

4670
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:19,130
This is incredible.

4671
02:13:21,290 --> 02:13:22,670
The face looks to duck like

4672
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:26,360
until they put the skin over it.

4673
02:13:26,990 --> 02:13:27,261
Yeah.

4674
02:13:27,261 --> 02:13:27,441
No,

4675
02:13:27,441 --> 02:13:28,460
it's incredible.

4676
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:29,863
Look at this

4677
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:32,010
so you won't

4678
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,843
get Tbi.

4679
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,260
It's got a lot of protection on it.

4680
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:37,650
That is so wild.

4681
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:38,803
It's neat.

4682
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,440
Yeah.

4683
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:41,273
Wow.

4684
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,260
And that's what it looks
like when it's all done.

4685
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,191
God Damn.

4686
02:13:44,191 --> 02:13:45,024
That's awesome.

4687
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:46,743
Ah,

4688
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:48,120
that's,

4689
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:52,350
that seems like something that would
be in like a modern version of twilight

4690
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:52,620
zone.

4691
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:53,221
God Damn.

4692
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:55,710
That is amazing for will rage.

4693
02:13:58,230 --> 02:13:59,610
That looks really cool.

4694
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,410
As long as it's all shadowy,

4695
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:04,260
they make a big mistake when they try to
make monster movies and make everything

4696
02:14:04,261 --> 02:14:05,640
like real crystal clear,

4697
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:06,960
like come on stupid.

4698
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:08,550
You got to keep shit in the shadows.

4699
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:08,860
The,

4700
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:10,290
your CGI is not that good.

4701
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:11,220
Stop showing off.

4702
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:14,250
Stop showing off with your
fucking fake big foot,

4703
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:16,290
big foot royal.

4704
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:18,330
Why don't even think it's real.

4705
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:18,961
Well,

4706
02:14:18,961 --> 02:14:19,470
um,

4707
02:14:19,470 --> 02:14:19,950
I,

4708
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:21,330
I don't not think it's real.

4709
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:21,990
Um,

4710
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:25,380
I went to the Pacific northwest actually
looking for bigfoot for the Scifi show

4711
02:14:25,381 --> 02:14:26,710
that I did and I'm,

4712
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:30,330
I'm convinced that I talked to people
that believe that they saw something.

4713
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:31,021
Uh,

4714
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:31,920
what it actually is,

4715
02:14:31,921 --> 02:14:32,371
who knows?

4716
02:14:32,371 --> 02:14:36,690
But the reality of the Pacific northwest
is the density of the forest is

4717
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:37,501
incredible.

4718
02:14:37,501 --> 02:14:40,050
It's hard to imagine if
you've never visited there.

4719
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:42,510
I had an idea in my head
what it would be like,

4720
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:43,431
but the,

4721
02:14:43,431 --> 02:14:48,120
the enormity of it all
and how insignificant tiny
I felt when I was in it.

4722
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:51,240
That place is like a magical rain forest.

4723
02:14:51,241 --> 02:14:52,830
It's a true rain forest.

4724
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:54,060
It's gorgeous.

4725
02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:58,890
And the inside is filled with bright
green moss and the trees are filled with

4726
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:02,580
bright green leaves and it's only sunny
like every other day or something like

4727
02:15:02,581 --> 02:15:02,791
that.

4728
02:15:02,791 --> 02:15:07,680
Most of the time it's just raining
constantly and it's fucking lush man.

4729
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:08,190
Like,

4730
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:11,350
like a dense box of Q tips
is how I described like the,

4731
02:15:11,351 --> 02:15:12,240
the trees there.

4732
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:14,610
And you realize once you're there like,

4733
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:14,791
Oh,

4734
02:15:14,791 --> 02:15:16,110
who knows what's out here?

4735
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:17,580
They might be anything out here,

4736
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:21,930
but the idea that it's gone this long
with all these people looking for it and

4737
02:15:21,931 --> 02:15:23,250
no one's brought back a body,

4738
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:24,270
nobody came across,

4739
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,110
nobody shot it.

4740
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:25,943
Nobody.

4741
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:28,140
Most likely bullshit.

4742
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:31,260
So you're basically saying because
they haven't had more evidence,

4743
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:33,330
there's not enough evidence,

4744
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:33,930
um,

4745
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:37,110
that is every evidence
that they've ever found,

4746
02:15:37,111 --> 02:15:38,670
whether it's DNA testing,

4747
02:15:38,671 --> 02:15:39,271
whether it's a,

4748
02:15:39,271 --> 02:15:40,560
that's me and Duncan in the woods.

4749
02:15:40,561 --> 02:15:41,370
Look at us.

4750
02:15:41,370 --> 02:15:42,240
We were looking around,

4751
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:44,970
we were squatting with John and Steve.

4752
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:46,083
Um,

4753
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:48,270
every piece of evidence
that they've ever found,

4754
02:15:48,271 --> 02:15:49,860
it's turned out to be bear shit.

4755
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:54,510
Or this was a fascinating thing we found
at tp of trees that were ripped out of

4756
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:55,260
the ground.

4757
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:56,670
And then like put into position,

4758
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:57,541
you know,

4759
02:15:57,541 --> 02:15:59,010
and some of them like we're like,

4760
02:15:59,030 --> 02:16:00,810
well literally ripped
out by the root ball.

4761
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:03,430
Like the amount of strength that someone
would have to have to do that and then

4762
02:16:03,431 --> 02:16:04,264
do it that way.

4763
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:05,363
So that was it.

4764
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:08,970
That was another piece there was was it
was a broke off branch that was broke

4765
02:16:08,971 --> 02:16:11,970
off in the middle of the tree and these
guys were convinced a big foot did that.

4766
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:13,771
Cool guys.

4767
02:16:13,771 --> 02:16:14,160
Man,

4768
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:16,920
they had a cool attitude too because
their attitude was even if there's no big

4769
02:16:16,921 --> 02:16:17,131
foot,

4770
02:16:17,131 --> 02:16:17,970
they're still out camping,

4771
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:21,430
enjoying nature and like
indulging in this no footprints.

4772
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:22,620
They do find footprints.

4773
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:24,690
But the issue with this area
of the Pacific northwest,

4774
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:25,470
is that what you,

4775
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:27,300
you see these guys walking on right here.

4776
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:29,250
That stuff is so soft.

4777
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,790
It's so incredibly dense.

4778
02:16:30,791 --> 02:16:34,720
With pine needles they said that there's
between five and six feet of compressed

4779
02:16:34,721 --> 02:16:38,580
pine needles under your feet and then
eventually becomes dirt and you know,

4780
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:39,543
breaks down.

4781
02:16:39,790 --> 02:16:41,500
But it's so soft.

4782
02:16:41,501 --> 02:16:42,370
You're walking on everything.

4783
02:16:42,371 --> 02:16:44,600
It's like a big sponge
so you can't get fleet.

4784
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:45,220
Cool.

4785
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,900
It's really fucking cool though.

4786
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:49,270
You see elk everywhere.

4787
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:51,550
They're just running through
that place like rats.

4788
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:53,110
And this woman who was,

4789
02:16:53,111 --> 02:16:53,470
uh,

4790
02:16:53,470 --> 02:16:55,840
one of the people that lives up there
in the mountain up in Mount Rainier,

4791
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:59,590
she was the most convincing because she
just didn't seem like a bullshit artist

4792
02:16:59,591 --> 02:17:00,250
at all.

4793
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:04,270
And she said she saw these elk running
and she was looking to see what they were

4794
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:04,900
running from.

4795
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,730
She was on a hike and she turned,

4796
02:17:06,731 --> 02:17:07,210
she's like,

4797
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:07,331
oh,

4798
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:08,164
there's a gorilla.

4799
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:09,610
Oh my God,

4800
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:10,420
that's big foot.

4801
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,110
And she said,

4802
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,190
it's the only time she ever saw it.

4803
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:13,390
She never saw it since.

4804
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:14,830
But she said she saw this thing,

4805
02:17:14,831 --> 02:17:16,690
she sought for about five or six seconds,

4806
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:19,000
maybe a little bit more
and move in between trees.

4807
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:19,121
You know,

4808
02:17:19,121 --> 02:17:20,920
just trying to estimate
while she's freaking out.

4809
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:21,851
And she realized,

4810
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:22,211
Holy Shit,

4811
02:17:22,211 --> 02:17:23,140
I saw a Sasquatch.

4812
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:26,950
Maybe it was a bear that got
hit in the face with a rock.

4813
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:28,740
You know what else it was?

4814
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,460
The Canadian Indians,

4815
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:32,260
the native Indians of Canada,

4816
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:34,000
they have lots of stories on,

4817
02:17:34,570 --> 02:17:35,051
not just,

4818
02:17:35,051 --> 02:17:36,100
they have lots of stories.

4819
02:17:36,101 --> 02:17:38,230
They have over 200 different names for it.

4820
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:41,860
This is interesting because it doesn't
mean that people haven't made up,

4821
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:42,580
you know,

4822
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:44,530
mythical animals and things in the past.

4823
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:45,363
They certainly have,

4824
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:50,550
and if you wanted to think about some
old man that lives in the woods and you

4825
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:53,920
know some why you don't and you never
know what the fucks are on any corner when

4826
02:17:53,921 --> 02:17:54,581
you're in the woods,

4827
02:17:54,581 --> 02:17:56,290
especially back then and the Indian days,

4828
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:57,011
you know,

4829
02:17:57,011 --> 02:17:57,311
they,

4830
02:17:57,311 --> 02:18:01,450
it's probably a good cautionary tale
to pretend there's some giant wild man

4831
02:18:01,451 --> 02:18:04,840
living in the woods that much larger
than you and it doesn't give a fuck and

4832
02:18:04,841 --> 02:18:05,920
hides from cameras.

4833
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:06,971
You know?

4834
02:18:06,971 --> 02:18:09,580
It seems like it's a good
thing to tell your kids.

4835
02:18:10,570 --> 02:18:11,201
What was that movie,

4836
02:18:11,201 --> 02:18:14,050
Henry and the Henderson that
was most likely real then?

4837
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:15,570
That was about,

4838
02:18:15,570 --> 02:18:16,403
it was going to say,

4839
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,540
I believed that move.

4840
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:20,380
I think that it's possible that there
could be an animal that we haven't

4841
02:18:20,381 --> 02:18:21,850
discovered that it's that animal.

4842
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:22,121
Ooh,

4843
02:18:22,121 --> 02:18:22,954
that's a tough one.

4844
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,380
It's such a dense vegetation up.

4845
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:26,423
It's so big.

4846
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:27,491
That's the problem.

4847
02:18:27,491 --> 02:18:28,241
This thing's giant.

4848
02:18:28,241 --> 02:18:29,380
It would need to eat a lot of food.

4849
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:33,220
They would need to be fucking eating
constantly cause anyone sent a set up

4850
02:18:33,221 --> 02:18:34,600
either thermal sensors,

4851
02:18:35,210 --> 02:18:37,600
they set up everything and trembles the,

4852
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:39,220
they've set up a game.

4853
02:18:39,221 --> 02:18:39,880
Cameras.

4854
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:42,040
No one's ever caught a
big foot on a game camera.

4855
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:44,590
When you stop and think about how
much shit gets caught on game cameras,

4856
02:18:44,591 --> 02:18:47,890
that's quite shocking because
they're really prevalent now.

4857
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:50,890
It's like the same argument about
Ufos and cell phone cameras.

4858
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,161
Well,

4859
02:18:51,161 --> 02:18:52,030
why didn't you take a picture?

4860
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:52,661
I didn't have a camera.

4861
02:18:52,661 --> 02:18:53,680
Everybody has a camera now,

4862
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:57,610
but there's still not like this
massive influx of UFO videos that are

4863
02:18:57,611 --> 02:18:58,150
legitimate.

4864
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:59,230
There's still all horse shit.

4865
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:00,310
So as they,

4866
02:19:00,310 --> 02:19:03,550
these game cameras become more and more
prevalent in the woods where people go

4867
02:19:03,551 --> 02:19:04,670
out hunting or they'd go outside,

4868
02:19:04,671 --> 02:19:06,100
outside seeing or looking for animals.

4869
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:07,160
You know,

4870
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:07,961
they're a recent,

4871
02:19:07,961 --> 02:19:09,640
in the northwest,

4872
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:10,541
there was a,

4873
02:19:10,541 --> 02:19:11,351
or Midwest,

4874
02:19:11,351 --> 02:19:13,990
there was a sighting with
lights that were just hovering.

4875
02:19:14,650 --> 02:19:16,390
Hundreds of people took pictures of it.

4876
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:16,631
Oh,

4877
02:19:16,631 --> 02:19:17,500
you're talking about,

4878
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:17,760
um,

4879
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:18,130
the,

4880
02:19:18,130 --> 02:19:19,420
the Phoenix Lights,

4881
02:19:20,380 --> 02:19:21,161
the Phoenix Lights.

4882
02:19:21,161 --> 02:19:22,750
I think that was in the late nineties.

4883
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,010
I would want something more.

4884
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:25,900
I think more recent really.

4885
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:26,350
Maybe,

4886
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:27,950
maybe Phoenix lights were,

4887
02:19:27,951 --> 02:19:28,784
um,

4888
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:31,610
I believe it was the nineties gas bubbles.

4889
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:34,820
I talked to people that when
I go to Phoenix all the time,

4890
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:35,121
in fact,

4891
02:19:35,121 --> 02:19:36,170
I'm going to Phoenix this weekend,

4892
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:37,641
this weekend,

4893
02:19:37,641 --> 02:19:41,540
these gentlemen stand up live with
the lovely and talented Thompson era.

4894
02:19:41,810 --> 02:19:42,590
But um,

4895
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:45,140
I've talked to people that were there
when that happened and they were pretty

4896
02:19:45,141 --> 02:19:45,651
convincing,

4897
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:45,920
man.

4898
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,190
They,

4899
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:46,490
they,

4900
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:46,910
they,

4901
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:48,320
they believe they saw something,

4902
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:49,640
but what it was like,

4903
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:50,474
who knows?

4904
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:55,750
They all described like a bunch of people
describe this giant like triangle that

4905
02:19:56,841 --> 02:20:00,530
was flying silently through
the sky and you know,

4906
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:01,753
maybe,

4907
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:04,610
or that could have been
just fucking freaking out

4908
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:08,630
area 51 area 51 I think that's what it is.

4909
02:20:08,631 --> 02:20:09,800
Area 51 they launched,

4910
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:10,431
they just said,

4911
02:20:10,431 --> 02:20:11,390
let's just freak out.

4912
02:20:11,391 --> 02:20:12,170
Phoenix.

4913
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:17,170
How do you think we went through such a
rapid technological advancement since 19

4914
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:19,640
late fifties?

4915
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:20,690
You think it's because the aliens,

4916
02:20:21,450 --> 02:20:22,670
where do you get a really analogy?

4917
02:20:22,671 --> 02:20:24,190
You think you're a full on nutter,

4918
02:20:24,430 --> 02:20:26,240
you the anti vaccine.

4919
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:27,440
We believe in aliens.

4920
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:31,340
You believe that alien technology
has not alone in the universe?

4921
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:31,701
Hey,

4922
02:20:31,701 --> 02:20:33,530
you say that I feel really alone.

4923
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:34,610
You do sometimes again,

4924
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:35,473
I'll give you a hug later.

4925
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:37,160
Yeah.

4926
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:38,270
So you believe that,

4927
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:40,420
that it's actually
possible that someone has,

4928
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:41,293
uh,

4929
02:20:41,410 --> 02:20:45,460
somehow or another cat people from the
information that human beings have been

4930
02:20:45,461 --> 02:20:48,580
visited and that we have actually
received technology from aliens.

4931
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,130
The possibilities there.

4932
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:51,120
Wow.

4933
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,230
What would you say a percentage?

4934
02:20:52,231 --> 02:20:52,771
I agree with you.

4935
02:20:52,771 --> 02:20:53,730
The possibility is there.

4936
02:20:53,731 --> 02:20:55,800
I don't know what the percentage would be.

4937
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:56,370
You know,

4938
02:20:56,370 --> 02:20:59,730
what is the one that keeps
me sane percentage versus,

4939
02:20:59,731 --> 02:21:00,120
you know,

4940
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:00,760
crazy.

4941
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:01,410
Hmm.

4942
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:03,420
What's the percentage there is no,

4943
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:04,110
there's no,

4944
02:21:04,110 --> 02:21:04,560
well,

4945
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:05,100
I,

4946
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:05,761
I honestly,

4947
02:21:05,761 --> 02:21:07,290
I mean all bullshit aside,

4948
02:21:07,291 --> 02:21:08,310
putting myself out there,

4949
02:21:08,311 --> 02:21:08,551
not,

4950
02:21:08,551 --> 02:21:10,200
not worried about what I look like,

4951
02:21:10,410 --> 02:21:10,711
you know,

4952
02:21:10,711 --> 02:21:12,030
because if you start talking about aliens,

4953
02:21:12,031 --> 02:21:12,930
you do a Vegan idiot.

4954
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:15,030
Let's just accept that.

4955
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:16,350
I submit to that.

4956
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:17,490
Um,

4957
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:19,080
I don't think we look
like regular monkeys.

4958
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,230
I think we looked at Fred.

4959
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:21,030
It's weird.

4960
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:23,310
It's weird how we look different and
I know that there's been a bunch of

4961
02:21:23,311 --> 02:21:25,080
different stages of us along the way.

4962
02:21:25,230 --> 02:21:26,063
I get all that,

4963
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:26,731
but man,

4964
02:21:26,731 --> 02:21:28,050
they seem like they were pretty recent.

4965
02:21:28,410 --> 02:21:30,000
Those fucking things seemed pretty recent.

4966
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:33,660
And when they find out that people's
brain size doubled over a period of 2

4967
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,510
million years and there's
no logical explanation,

4968
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:37,200
I go,

4969
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:38,033
oh,

4970
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:38,880
what,

4971
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:39,713
wait a minute.

4972
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:40,770
How do we,

4973
02:21:40,770 --> 02:21:41,750
how do we start talking?

4974
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:42,750
Had all that happen.

4975
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:46,890
What is it possible that something
came down and fucked with us?

4976
02:21:46,891 --> 02:21:49,920
The same way we fuck with virtually
everything that we find in the wild.

4977
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:54,980
And is that possible when we inject
fucking lipstick and the rabbits to see if

4978
02:21:55,261 --> 02:21:56,010
it kills him?

4979
02:21:56,010 --> 02:21:57,410
You know why no one,

4980
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,170
yeah,

4981
02:21:58,170 --> 02:21:59,003
Bat Shit.

4982
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:00,510
That's what they use for lipstick.

4983
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:02,250
Used to be what it was used.

4984
02:22:02,251 --> 02:22:04,980
I think they still using
it in some manufacturing

4985
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:07,590
or the most horrible story about bad shit.

4986
02:22:08,130 --> 02:22:09,240
These guys in Africa,

4987
02:22:09,241 --> 02:22:12,420
these scientists were
doing some sort of a,

4988
02:22:12,421 --> 02:22:13,254
um,

4989
02:22:13,410 --> 02:22:14,243
uh,

4990
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:16,230
exploration on bats.

4991
02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:18,390
And there was a one particular,

4992
02:22:18,391 --> 02:22:22,440
a cave where these bats came out at
night and they came out in massive,

4993
02:22:22,441 --> 02:22:23,400
massive numbers.

4994
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:24,720
So these guys set up a,

4995
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:27,480
and they stayed out there to catch it.

4996
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:29,280
So as the bats are flying out of the cave,

4997
02:22:29,281 --> 02:22:29,571
they would,

4998
02:22:29,571 --> 02:22:29,790
uh,

4999
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:30,810
take the shots of them.

5000
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:35,850
They didn't realize or think that the
bats shit when they come out of the cage.

5001
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:37,440
So the cave rather.

5002
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:38,450
So the bats,

5003
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:40,980
these millions upon millions of bats,

5004
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:46,010
all shit on them and they got deathly
ill and were dead within weeks.

5005
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:50,460
Both men died of just horrible diseases,

5006
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:53,040
horrible like hemorrhagic viruses.

5007
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:54,750
Their eyes were fucking bleeding.

5008
02:22:54,751 --> 02:22:54,991
I mean,

5009
02:22:54,991 --> 02:22:57,000
like really terrible ways to die.

5010
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:01,380
They got introduced to all sorts of
terrible pathogens from bat shit.

5011
02:23:01,820 --> 02:23:04,380
Bats are shifting so much on them,

5012
02:23:04,381 --> 02:23:05,580
like inches of shit.

5013
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:10,850
So they were covered in this horrible
toxic shit from these flying monsters.

5014
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:14,520
Sounds like a great
premise for a movie team.

5015
02:23:14,521 --> 02:23:15,060
People,

5016
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:15,310
Ladies,

5017
02:23:15,310 --> 02:23:16,143
gentlemen,

5018
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:17,490
I'm on team people.

5019
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:19,410
Baths can go fuck themselves.

5020
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:20,790
That's wrong.

5021
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:22,110
Shitting on scientists.

5022
02:23:22,410 --> 02:23:24,480
Meanwhile that those guys could
have been saved with an umbrella.

5023
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:25,403
How about that,

5024
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:26,431
you know,

5025
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:28,950
an umbrella Newark and
a map of the territory.

5026
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,181
Why didn't they,

5027
02:23:30,181 --> 02:23:30,510
uh,

5028
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:32,850
set something up in advance to,

5029
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:33,180
uh,

5030
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:33,810
like what's,

5031
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:35,220
let's see what happens first.

5032
02:23:35,221 --> 02:23:36,090
Let's not be there.

5033
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:37,320
Can we set a remote camera?

5034
02:23:37,321 --> 02:23:37,531
I mean,

5035
02:23:37,531 --> 02:23:39,790
what if something weird
happens like Dracula,

5036
02:23:39,791 --> 02:23:40,624
it comes out with them.

5037
02:23:41,530 --> 02:23:42,363
Hmm.

5038
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:43,990
Healed.

5039
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:45,220
That's a terrible way to die though,

5040
02:23:45,221 --> 02:23:45,850
man.

5041
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:46,631
Death by bat.

5042
02:23:46,631 --> 02:23:47,464
Shit.

5043
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:48,490
Viruses.

5044
02:23:48,490 --> 02:23:49,210
Even worse.

5045
02:23:49,210 --> 02:23:49,450
Yeah.

5046
02:23:49,450 --> 02:23:50,590
There's a lot of ugly ones,

5047
02:23:50,591 --> 02:23:51,424
Huh?

5048
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:52,600
Ebola.

5049
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,433
Yeah.

5050
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:54,700
Did they have that one?

5051
02:23:54,730 --> 02:23:55,211
Their control.

5052
02:23:55,211 --> 02:23:56,044
How do you get Ebola?

5053
02:23:57,430 --> 02:23:58,390
It was manufactured.

5054
02:23:58,660 --> 02:23:59,493
Really.

5055
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:00,370
You think so?

5056
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:01,970
I think a lot of the
virus in manufacturing,

5057
02:24:01,990 --> 02:24:04,210
there was a documentary on the HIV.

5058
02:24:05,230 --> 02:24:06,063
Freaked me out.

5059
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:06,661
That's a,

5060
02:24:06,661 --> 02:24:09,480
that's how my uncle who
was a homophobe uses it.

5061
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:09,750
Yeah.

5062
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:11,220
They all got the HIV.

5063
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:12,203
Mm hmm.

5064
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:15,200
I was fucking with the HIV,

5065
02:24:15,201 --> 02:24:15,561
you know,

5066
02:24:15,561 --> 02:24:16,394
these guys,

5067
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:18,921
the HIV,

5068
02:24:18,921 --> 02:24:20,870
it was a documentary on,

5069
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:21,913
on HIV,

5070
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:22,730
no,

5071
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:23,563
HIV.

5072
02:24:24,110 --> 02:24:29,090
Trying to go through the history of how
it developed and the way that story was

5073
02:24:29,091 --> 02:24:30,830
told was there was a French,

5074
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:31,190
you know,

5075
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:34,550
one of the largest vaccine
companies as a French company.

5076
02:24:34,551 --> 02:24:36,500
It starts with an M and,

5077
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:36,921
a.

5078
02:24:36,921 --> 02:24:41,921
They were in desire year and at a camp
trying to grow a smallpox vaccine on a

5079
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:47,690
culture and they couldn't do it.

5080
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:48,860
So what they ended up doing,

5081
02:24:48,861 --> 02:24:49,611
because it would die,

5082
02:24:49,611 --> 02:24:50,450
it wouldn't sustain it.

5083
02:24:50,510 --> 02:24:51,890
So they ended up getting Simeon,

5084
02:24:51,891 --> 02:24:53,120
which is monkey liver.

5085
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:54,740
Oh or monkey kidney.

5086
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:55,640
Oh.

5087
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:56,321
And the groove.

5088
02:24:56,321 --> 02:24:57,154
The virus,

5089
02:24:57,170 --> 02:24:58,820
the smallpox virus on it.

5090
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:04,360
And what happened was they believe that
the monkeys virus crossed over from

5091
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:08,840
monkey to human and in this vaccine.

5092
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:11,450
And who was the first
case that was documented?

5093
02:25:11,480 --> 02:25:15,080
This French guy that was came
to the United States was the

5094
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:17,180
plague,

5095
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:18,590
the typhoid Mary,

5096
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:19,820
you know,

5097
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:20,990
who brought it over to the states.

5098
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,160
So a French guy came over
here and so he's patient

5099
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,180
zero in the United States.

5100
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,800
How many days like that guy?

5101
02:25:26,801 --> 02:25:27,634
Like a million.

5102
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:28,690
Don't know if it was gay.

5103
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,960
It wasn't Gary while he was,

5104
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,451
he was,

5105
02:25:31,451 --> 02:25:31,721
yeah,

5106
02:25:31,721 --> 02:25:31,991
it was.

5107
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:33,520
I'm trying to find this documentary.

5108
02:25:33,521 --> 02:25:35,800
It was like two hours long
and it was just awesome.

5109
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,560
Is it substantiated like as a disputed,

5110
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:39,281
has there been,

5111
02:25:39,281 --> 02:25:40,300
as it been debunked?

5112
02:25:40,330 --> 02:25:40,990
Do you know?

5113
02:25:40,990 --> 02:25:42,490
That would be the first thing
that I would want would happen

5114
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:44,400
most the people that
were doing the project,

5115
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:45,630
the program.

5116
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:48,090
Do you what's called a no,

5117
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,983
it was

5118
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:54,750
maybe almost 10 years ago
that it was on and it's a,

5119
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:57,780
it was a documentary on
smallpox and smallpox,

5120
02:25:57,781 --> 02:26:00,480
HIV and um,

5121
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:05,540
they went to the Louis Pasture Institute
in Paris and there was supposedly a

5122
02:26:07,321 --> 02:26:10,800
sample of the original culture that they,

5123
02:26:10,801 --> 02:26:12,930
if they would go through
that original culture,

5124
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:17,960
they would see the Simian virus
becoming a mutating over to being human.

5125
02:26:19,890 --> 02:26:20,580
Whoa.

5126
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:24,160
The Simeon a s I Siv.

5127
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:26,460
He was Simeon immune virus.

5128
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:30,150
And then when it's a
humans human immuno virus,

5129
02:26:30,151 --> 02:26:30,984
HIV.

5130
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:32,340
Wow.

5131
02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:32,970
Yeah.

5132
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:37,970
Someone gave me a book on experiments on
of viral and in it talks about HIV and

5133
02:26:38,881 --> 02:26:39,510
Ebola.

5134
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:40,670
I'll give you the book if you want it.

5135
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:45,080
So how come that's like hidden knowledge,

5136
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:47,180
knowledge about that.

5137
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:48,530
It's hiding in plain sight.

5138
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:49,551
It's hiding in plain sight,

5139
02:26:49,551 --> 02:26:50,390
but nobody talks about it.

5140
02:26:50,420 --> 02:26:51,111
No one talks about,

5141
02:26:51,111 --> 02:26:55,670
no one reads it because there was that
old Sam Kinison joke about aids coming

5142
02:26:55,671 --> 02:26:56,504
from a monkey.

5143
02:26:57,110 --> 02:27:00,470
And then Dave Chappelle had an even better
job actually just like talking about

5144
02:27:00,471 --> 02:27:02,120
how hard it was to fuck a monkey.

5145
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:04,060
Cause Somebody fucking monkey.

5146
02:27:04,370 --> 02:27:05,900
You're telling me someone fucked a monkey?

5147
02:27:06,110 --> 02:27:06,943
I don't believe it

5148
02:27:08,810 --> 02:27:09,890
has such a great premise.

5149
02:27:09,891 --> 02:27:10,790
Just thinking about that.

5150
02:27:10,791 --> 02:27:11,600
It's so true.

5151
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:12,291
It makes you laugh.

5152
02:27:12,291 --> 02:27:15,560
Just thinking about a guy trying to
hold onto a monkey was biting him.

5153
02:27:18,650 --> 02:27:19,730
Spider Monkey.

5154
02:27:20,030 --> 02:27:21,230
I don't know if I buy that.

5155
02:27:21,231 --> 02:27:24,530
I feel like if that was the truth
that that would be out there.

5156
02:27:24,770 --> 02:27:25,101
Okay.

5157
02:27:25,101 --> 02:27:25,640
What is it?

5158
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:25,941
Let's,

5159
02:27:25,941 --> 02:27:28,940
let's try to do a Google search on
it and see if there's a debunking.

5160
02:27:29,210 --> 02:27:30,950
Since you haven't done your due diligence,

5161
02:27:30,951 --> 02:27:31,760
sir,

5162
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,810
before you come out with us with his
outlandish claim was the smallpox virus?

5163
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:36,471
Yeah,

5164
02:27:36,471 --> 02:27:37,040
it was based.

5165
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:40,670
It was in Zaire French
company fringe group,

5166
02:27:42,590 --> 02:27:44,780
and I don't know if it was origin of aids.

5167
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:45,141
Okay.

5168
02:27:45,141 --> 02:27:46,520
There's a smallpox virus,

5169
02:27:46,521 --> 02:27:47,900
HIV documentary.

5170
02:27:48,650 --> 02:27:49,730
Here it goes.

5171
02:27:50,150 --> 02:27:50,983
What year?

5172
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:51,823
Um,

5173
02:27:51,890 --> 02:27:54,140
AIDS linked to smallpox vaccine.

5174
02:27:54,141 --> 02:27:54,974
Let's see.

5175
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:57,080
I think it's called the origin.

5176
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:57,591
Oh,

5177
02:27:57,591 --> 02:27:59,420
the world's most dangerous virus.

5178
02:28:01,270 --> 02:28:02,103
Hmm.

5179
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:02,651
No,

5180
02:28:02,651 --> 02:28:03,484
that's not it.

5181
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:05,320
I was seeing a Nova documentary on it,

5182
02:28:05,321 --> 02:28:06,160
but I don't know if that's the one.

5183
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:06,791
Yeah,

5184
02:28:06,791 --> 02:28:08,290
it seems like there's quite a few.

5185
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:09,100
Um,

5186
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:09,970
it's hard to tell,

5187
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:11,783
right?

5188
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:12,861
Yeah.

5189
02:28:12,861 --> 02:28:13,221
I don't know.

5190
02:28:13,221 --> 02:28:13,780
I don't know.

5191
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:13,980
Yep.

5192
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:15,990
But sitting there watching
and I was just glued to it.

5193
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:19,590
I usually don't watch tovs knife if I
can avoid it except for walking dead,

5194
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:22,220
which now going to stop since you said

5195
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:23,390
you have this,

5196
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:23,721
well,

5197
02:28:23,721 --> 02:28:23,961
I don't,

5198
02:28:23,961 --> 02:28:24,531
I'm just kidding.

5199
02:28:24,531 --> 02:28:25,191
I'll still watch it.

5200
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:26,024
I'm a bitch.

5201
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:28,880
I'm just upset that they're
beating me up my brain up.

5202
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:29,451
Yeah.

5203
02:28:29,451 --> 02:28:33,110
There's an article in here from the
London Times about smallpox vaccine

5204
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:37,490
triggered aids virus and aids epidemic
may have been triggered by the mass

5205
02:28:37,491 --> 02:28:38,960
vaccination campaign,

5206
02:28:38,961 --> 02:28:40,610
which eradicated smallpox.

5207
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:41,600
Whoa.

5208
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,800
The World Health Organization,

5209
02:28:42,801 --> 02:28:44,900
which masterminded a 13 year campaign,

5210
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:47,630
is studying the new scientific evidence,

5211
02:28:47,631 --> 02:28:52,550
suggesting that the immunizations with
immunization with smallpox vaccine,

5212
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:53,420
um,

5213
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:53,830
v,

5214
02:28:53,830 --> 02:28:54,101
a,

5215
02:28:54,101 --> 02:28:54,351
C,

5216
02:28:54,351 --> 02:28:54,621
c,

5217
02:28:54,621 --> 02:28:56,910
I n I a vaccine and Nah,

5218
02:28:57,300 --> 02:28:59,420
I can fix India.

5219
02:28:59,590 --> 02:29:04,590
Facsia awakened the unsuspected dormant
human immune deficient virus infection

5220
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:08,940
in this program.

5221
02:29:09,150 --> 02:29:09,990
They said it,

5222
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:10,973
it was,

5223
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:11,873
um,

5224
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:13,080
it was a term for it.

5225
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:15,600
It crossed species.

5226
02:29:15,810 --> 02:29:17,460
So is that they're positive spin on it,

5227
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:22,640
that it awakened the unsuspected dormant
human immunodeficiency virus instead of

5228
02:29:23,641 --> 02:29:24,250
created it.

5229
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:25,083
It created it.

5230
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:29,650
Simian virus stay viruses
and monkeys stay in monkeys.

5231
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:31,690
Human viruses stay in humans,

5232
02:29:31,691 --> 02:29:34,150
but when it crosses the species,

5233
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:37,630
which is a very difficult
thing to do unless it mutates.

5234
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:42,990
So what happened in this premise of this
documentary quote that I saw was that

5235
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:47,800
by culturing the smallpox vaccine,

5236
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:52,630
smallpox in on Simeon monkey kidneys,

5237
02:29:52,810 --> 02:29:55,060
that whatever they were feeding,

5238
02:29:55,061 --> 02:29:57,100
it allowed it to cross the genetics.

5239
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:58,720
I see.

5240
02:29:58,720 --> 02:29:59,290
Got It.

5241
02:29:59,290 --> 02:30:00,123
I see.

5242
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:03,310
So much like swine flu and
things along those lines,

5243
02:30:03,311 --> 02:30:06,880
costs cross from cattle
and livestock and birds.

5244
02:30:07,290 --> 02:30:08,590
They cross over to paypal.

5245
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:09,840
They crossover that.

5246
02:30:09,910 --> 02:30:10,780
That's a real issue,

5247
02:30:10,810 --> 02:30:11,510
isn't it?

5248
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:12,343
That's

5249
02:30:12,410 --> 02:30:16,250
that's why they're manipulating or
people manipulating and genetic code and

5250
02:30:16,251 --> 02:30:17,570
mixing things together.

5251
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:18,913
It scares me.

5252
02:30:19,210 --> 02:30:19,511
Yeah,

5253
02:30:19,511 --> 02:30:21,730
it seems like it should
and it seems like a,

5254
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:22,240
I mean,

5255
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:23,320
I joke around about it,

5256
02:30:23,321 --> 02:30:25,810
but when people are concerned about that,

5257
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:28,210
they get late labeled into that category.

5258
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:28,540
Oh,

5259
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:29,740
you're one of those guys,

5260
02:30:29,741 --> 02:30:30,400
Huh?

5261
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:30,851
Listen,

5262
02:30:30,851 --> 02:30:32,680
if it wasn't for GMO food,

5263
02:30:32,681 --> 02:30:34,000
it wasn't for golden rice,

5264
02:30:34,001 --> 02:30:35,770
it'd be a billion less
people on the earth.

5265
02:30:36,550 --> 02:30:38,980
People will always tell you that
the golden rice is a big one.

5266
02:30:38,981 --> 02:30:39,850
They always bring that one up,

5267
02:30:40,930 --> 02:30:41,763
whatever.

5268
02:30:41,770 --> 02:30:43,450
Maybe the earth could use
a billion less people.

5269
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:47,950
That's why we have diseases
and why we have wars.

5270
02:30:48,610 --> 02:30:49,990
Do you really think that wars are for that

5271
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:53,950
did wipe out people on purpose,

5272
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:56,350
like the Illuminati gets together
and they work out a deal?

5273
02:30:57,100 --> 02:30:57,933
I think it,

5274
02:30:58,390 --> 02:31:03,010
it's not specifically only about
eliminating people and population control,

5275
02:31:03,011 --> 02:31:03,850
but I think there's,

5276
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:05,020
if you look at the,

5277
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:10,060
the best financing war machinery
war is incredible financing.

5278
02:31:10,541 --> 02:31:13,690
How much money have we spent in in Iraq?

5279
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:15,900
$50 that would be,

5280
02:31:15,901 --> 02:31:16,081
yeah,

5281
02:31:16,081 --> 02:31:16,440
it's,

5282
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:19,590
it's a bargain when you really
find out what the numbers,

5283
02:31:19,591 --> 02:31:20,424
so

5284
02:31:21,390 --> 02:31:23,580
that'd be like the Super
Kohlberg character.

5285
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:25,500
A guy just makes up numbers,

5286
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,750
did the truth about Afghanistan,

5287
02:31:27,751 --> 02:31:28,584
Iraq,

5288
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:30,600
$50 that's it.

5289
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,280
Everything else was donated,

5290
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:34,230
donated from churches and good people.

5291
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:38,250
They wanted us to go over there
and kill those fucks and let's see.

5292
02:31:38,251 --> 02:31:43,251
All the oil fields in Iraq were given to
what Gulf and Exxon is a gift for their

5293
02:31:43,891 --> 02:31:46,440
humanitarian service
to the military there.

5294
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:47,540
I buy that now.

5295
02:31:47,930 --> 02:31:48,870
It's totally logical.

5296
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:53,370
And then the $20 billion that was sitting
in the bank from all the oil being

5297
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:55,290
sold worldwide world war was going on.

5298
02:31:55,291 --> 02:31:57,330
And why didn't they use that for the war?

5299
02:31:57,580 --> 02:31:58,770
Because we were busy.

5300
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:00,250
We had shit to do.

5301
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:01,440
We need money here.

5302
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:02,580
Fighting for freedom.

5303
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:03,360
Yeah.

5304
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:04,380
Don't worry about you.

5305
02:32:04,381 --> 02:32:05,430
Worry about your own shit.

5306
02:32:05,730 --> 02:32:06,361
Worry about us.

5307
02:32:06,361 --> 02:32:07,194
We're taking care of you.

5308
02:32:07,390 --> 02:32:08,223
It wasn't for us.

5309
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:10,730
You wouldn't even be getting any freedom.

5310
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:11,480
Yeah.

5311
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:13,340
Well it's a great argument.

5312
02:32:14,330 --> 02:32:14,780
Yeah.

5313
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:17,030
As long as you're not going
around creating the AIDS virus.

5314
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:17,241
Yeah.

5315
02:32:17,241 --> 02:32:18,051
A few good men,

5316
02:32:18,051 --> 02:32:18,884
Huh?

5317
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:20,930
Creating the AIDS virus
in your spare time.

5318
02:32:21,470 --> 02:32:22,170
Um,

5319
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:26,360
is it possible that other diseases you
think that had been accidentally created

5320
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:28,753
stupidity.

5321
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:29,691
Stupidity.

5322
02:32:29,691 --> 02:32:31,880
Is that a disease or is
that just a function?

5323
02:32:31,881 --> 02:32:32,910
It's a function of punk,

5324
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:34,850
human and being allowed to be stupid here.

5325
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,290
We give people the option to be stupid.

5326
02:32:36,291 --> 02:32:38,240
They will often be on your
cell phone all the time.

5327
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:38,780
Okay.

5328
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:39,860
Play stupid games.

5329
02:32:39,950 --> 02:32:40,581
I don't do those.

5330
02:32:40,581 --> 02:32:41,420
Watch television.

5331
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,280
I have discipline dumbing down,

5332
02:32:43,550 --> 02:32:44,420
not me buddy.

5333
02:32:44,510 --> 02:32:45,890
I'm up at six doing kettlebells.

5334
02:32:46,970 --> 02:32:48,340
6:00 PM I get out.

5335
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:53,720
I do like to get up early
every now and then just to say,

5336
02:32:53,721 --> 02:32:54,021
boy,

5337
02:32:54,021 --> 02:32:54,591
this sucks.

5338
02:32:54,591 --> 02:32:55,520
I don't want to do this anymore.

5339
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:55,791
I'm done.

5340
02:32:55,791 --> 02:32:56,624
Kids get up,

5341
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:57,560
they get up early.

5342
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:58,310
I'm just kidding.

5343
02:32:58,310 --> 02:32:58,770
I know you were.

5344
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:01,090
I take them to school
when I take him to school,

5345
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:01,550
uh,

5346
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:02,750
most of the time my wife does,

5347
02:33:02,751 --> 02:33:03,800
but when I do take them to school,

5348
02:33:03,801 --> 02:33:06,980
I actually run with the five year
old does just like running track.

5349
02:33:06,981 --> 02:33:08,060
We'll run laps and shit.

5350
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:11,420
They have a whole thing they're doing to
try to introduce kids to exercise in an

5351
02:33:11,421 --> 02:33:15,230
early age and they make it fun and
exciting for them and cut out all the crap

5352
02:33:15,231 --> 02:33:15,980
and their diet.

5353
02:33:15,980 --> 02:33:16,791
That's a problem,

5354
02:33:16,791 --> 02:33:17,031
man.

5355
02:33:17,031 --> 02:33:19,670
I see some of the things her
little friends have and uh,

5356
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:20,001
you know,

5357
02:33:20,001 --> 02:33:22,520
a little five year olds are
eaten Gish hint for lunch.

5358
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:23,121
Like God,

5359
02:33:23,121 --> 02:33:23,750
it's just like,

5360
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:26,420
just things that they think their kid
will eat and they're worried that the kid

5361
02:33:26,421 --> 02:33:27,440
won't eat healthy food.

5362
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:29,420
Like your kids lead healthy food,

5363
02:33:29,421 --> 02:33:29,661
man,

5364
02:33:29,661 --> 02:33:30,660
you just got gotta you know,

5365
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:31,120
train them.

5366
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:31,450
Yeah,

5367
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:33,700
we'll give him the healthy
food and then give him,

5368
02:33:33,730 --> 02:33:34,040
you know,

5369
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:37,070
a little bit of delicious
treats as a reward.

5370
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:37,611
You know,

5371
02:33:37,611 --> 02:33:40,580
give them something because they did
their homework because they let him have a

5372
02:33:40,581 --> 02:33:41,510
little every now and then,

5373
02:33:41,511 --> 02:33:43,230
don't make it a big deal that I'm,

5374
02:33:43,231 --> 02:33:44,000
have a little cake,

5375
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:44,900
let him have a little ice cream.

5376
02:33:45,110 --> 02:33:48,320
But you got to make sure
that they understand that in
order for their body to be

5377
02:33:48,321 --> 02:33:51,680
healthy and not get disease isn't
sound like it's a communication thing.

5378
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:53,450
And some people don't
even want to do that work.

5379
02:33:53,451 --> 02:33:53,750
They're like,

5380
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:55,070
it's fucking kid's not listening.

5381
02:33:55,071 --> 02:33:55,904
Give them a cake.

5382
02:33:56,090 --> 02:33:56,923
Give him the cake.

5383
02:33:56,940 --> 02:33:57,773
Give him the candy.

5384
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:59,440
I'm tired of him crying and I'm okay.

5385
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,133
You little fuck.

5386
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:02,570
It's terrible.

5387
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:03,500
It's to pass away.

5388
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:05,240
It's just weak people,

5389
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:05,541
you know?

5390
02:34:05,541 --> 02:34:06,590
And it's also people that aren't,

5391
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:08,510
are on concerned about their own diets.

5392
02:34:08,660 --> 02:34:08,930
You know,

5393
02:34:08,930 --> 02:34:12,830
I know many people who never give any
consideration whatsoever to the fuel that

5394
02:34:12,831 --> 02:34:13,820
they put inside their body.

5395
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:14,660
They just don't,

5396
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:15,920
they don't think about vegetables,

5397
02:34:15,921 --> 02:34:16,910
they don't think about Fido.

5398
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:20,020
You don't think about minerals and
they don't think about being hydrated.

5399
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:22,390
They treat their body
like it's some rental car.

5400
02:34:22,391 --> 02:34:24,670
They just pour in shit down into like,

5401
02:34:24,671 --> 02:34:26,410
oh well it drove run on premium.

5402
02:34:26,411 --> 02:34:26,890
Yes.

5403
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:28,390
Would also run on human shit.

5404
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:28,771
Yes.

5405
02:34:28,771 --> 02:34:28,870
It,

5406
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:29,101
well,

5407
02:34:29,101 --> 02:34:32,230
well I'm just going to back my ass
up to this fucking hoes and shit.

5408
02:34:32,270 --> 02:34:33,103
Then my car,

5409
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:33,641
you know,

5410
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:35,170
that's what people would do if they could,

5411
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:35,850
that's what they choose.

5412
02:34:35,850 --> 02:34:36,700
How they treat their body.

5413
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:40,060
You could have a guy who
works all day and you know,

5414
02:34:40,061 --> 02:34:41,590
forces his body to do,

5415
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:41,951
you know,

5416
02:34:41,951 --> 02:34:46,180
very stressful computations and he's
running on coffee and cheeseburgers from

5417
02:34:46,181 --> 02:34:51,181
Mcdonald's and candy and a fucking
protein bar that's filled with GMO corn.

5418
02:34:52,990 --> 02:34:54,100
That's all possible.

5419
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:54,601
And you,

5420
02:34:54,601 --> 02:34:55,830
you wonder what's,

5421
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:59,110
what the fuck is wrong with us as a
society when we can't get our mental shit

5422
02:34:59,111 --> 02:34:59,441
together.

5423
02:34:59,441 --> 02:35:01,030
Why bodies are rotting apart.

5424
02:35:01,031 --> 02:35:04,000
Dr. Gordon and you got
it rotting all part.

5425
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:05,560
Where's my kroner Renee?

5426
02:35:06,830 --> 02:35:09,850
I cronut cronut the cronut.

5427
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:10,720
What's a krone?

5428
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,890
So croissant donut.

5429
02:35:12,070 --> 02:35:12,521
Oh,

5430
02:35:12,521 --> 02:35:13,000
krona.

5431
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:13,151
Well,

5432
02:35:13,151 --> 02:35:14,050
you're very specific.

5433
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:15,213
How would you even expect?

5434
02:35:15,250 --> 02:35:16,120
Expect me to know that.

5435
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:18,040
If you said like a chocolate croissant.

5436
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:18,431
No,

5437
02:35:18,431 --> 02:35:19,900
I would say I've had those.

5438
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:24,160
This is a calm that where they have
lines waiting for the people to eat them.

5439
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:25,010
Oh,

5440
02:35:25,010 --> 02:35:27,830
is it some famous thing or
something relatively do is,

5441
02:35:27,850 --> 02:35:28,240
yeah.

5442
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:31,330
People line up to buy a
special type of donut guy.

5443
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:32,320
We were so stupid.

5444
02:35:32,770 --> 02:35:33,670
People are so dumb.

5445
02:35:34,570 --> 02:35:35,403
Yeah.

5446
02:35:35,710 --> 02:35:39,940
You should've seen the line of black and
whites line the black and white people.

5447
02:35:39,941 --> 02:35:40,630
Is that what you're saying?

5448
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:42,580
Oh Jesus Christ.

5449
02:35:42,581 --> 02:35:43,414
I don't know what you're saying.

5450
02:35:44,110 --> 02:35:47,080
You mean cops so the cops are lining
up to get these special donuts.

5451
02:35:47,081 --> 02:35:47,914
That's what you're saying.

5452
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:51,400
Did you just tell it a
cop donut joke on my show?

5453
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:52,201
Absolute dairy.

5454
02:35:52,201 --> 02:35:53,034
You doctor.

5455
02:35:53,230 --> 02:35:55,330
That's like me showing up
in your office with Voodoo.

5456
02:35:55,430 --> 02:35:58,040
I compensate by line.

5457
02:35:58,190 --> 02:35:58,450
Yeah.

5458
02:35:58,450 --> 02:35:59,111
Oh my God.

5459
02:35:59,111 --> 02:35:59,561
Where is it?

5460
02:35:59,561 --> 02:36:00,430
New York is New York,

5461
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:00,971
New York.

5462
02:36:00,971 --> 02:36:02,560
They're all in line to get a donut.

5463
02:36:02,590 --> 02:36:03,830
I fucking hate krone.

5464
02:36:03,831 --> 02:36:04,900
Everyone in that line.

5465
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,430
I hate all of you there.

5466
02:36:06,431 --> 02:36:08,650
What two blue are all of the problem.

5467
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:10,010
You fuck heads.

5468
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:12,310
You are all crazy and ridiculous.

5469
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:15,070
That's a mile long line
for a fucking doughnut.

5470
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:19,030
How dare you when you see it
doesn't fuck with Krispy Kreme.

5471
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:20,200
I don't care what anybody says.

5472
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,890
It can't.

5473
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:22,990
Krispy Kreme doughnuts when
they're right out of the oven,

5474
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:25,570
does not a thing that can
tastes better than that.

5475
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:26,980
It doesn't get better than that.

5476
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,870
Where's the Krispy Kreme plays all over?

5477
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,400
Santa Monica is the closest to here,

5478
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,990
so there's Burbank.

5479
02:36:31,991 --> 02:36:32,231
Yeah,

5480
02:36:32,231 --> 02:36:33,790
but that's closed down.

5481
02:36:33,791 --> 02:36:34,990
I heard a lot of them did.

5482
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:36,190
That's just cause of communism.

5483
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:36,820
Ah,

5484
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:37,241
that's what,

5485
02:36:37,241 --> 02:36:37,841
that's what it is.

5486
02:36:37,841 --> 02:36:38,674
Socialism,

5487
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:40,030
try to keep the man down.

5488
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,410
They need to expand.

5489
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:42,820
They should have Krispy Kremes everywhere.

5490
02:36:42,821 --> 02:36:45,550
If you want to do something decadent
that's horrible for your body.

5491
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:47,170
Why are you fucking around?

5492
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:49,720
You need just a couple of Krispy Kremes.

5493
02:36:49,721 --> 02:36:51,400
You'll feel like shit after they're down,

5494
02:36:51,610 --> 02:36:54,370
but when they're going down
it will be goddamned Gloria.

5495
02:36:54,371 --> 02:36:57,160
I'm going to find some cronuts
and bring them to you when they,

5496
02:36:57,250 --> 02:36:59,890
when you eat one of those maple ones.

5497
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:01,360
Do you know those warm maple ones?

5498
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:03,250
You hear Bon Jovi singing

5499
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:05,800
when you bite into it.

5500
02:37:05,990 --> 02:37:06,823
Shop,

5501
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:11,100
you feel it,

5502
02:37:11,100 --> 02:37:12,120
you feel it in your bones.

5503
02:37:12,121 --> 02:37:13,140
You toes tingle,

5504
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:13,801
you know,

5505
02:37:13,801 --> 02:37:16,190
you've given yourself cancer and you care.

5506
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:17,270
You don't care.

5507
02:37:17,450 --> 02:37:19,370
It's a million milligrams of sugar.

5508
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:20,090
1 million.

5509
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:22,700
That's what I heard when
I saw a documentary.

5510
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:23,713
1 million.

5511
02:37:24,190 --> 02:37:27,980
It's exactly the amount of sugar
that you can eat and not die.

5512
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:30,800
That's what's in a box of
Krispy Kreme donut burger.

5513
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:30,951
Oh,

5514
02:37:30,951 --> 02:37:31,790
that's ridiculous.

5515
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,910
I've had bacon on mine.

5516
02:37:35,350 --> 02:37:36,240
I don't need that.

5517
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,760
So it's a croissant donut mix
with a cheeseburger and um,

5518
02:37:43,730 --> 02:37:47,750
they smash it all together and put
powdered sugar on the top of why we hate

5519
02:37:47,751 --> 02:37:48,584
ourselves.

5520
02:37:49,010 --> 02:37:50,510
Fucking humans hate ourselves.

5521
02:37:50,570 --> 02:37:51,403
We're crazy.

5522
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:53,120
That looks almost edible.

5523
02:37:53,690 --> 02:37:54,950
Do you allow yourself cheat days?

5524
02:37:54,951 --> 02:37:56,870
I know you're really
healthy for the most part.

5525
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:57,291
No,

5526
02:37:57,291 --> 02:37:58,310
I don't have cheat days.

5527
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,330
Do you have cheat meals?

5528
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:00,650
I don't have cheat meals.

5529
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:01,970
Do you have cheat desserts?

5530
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:02,570
Nope.

5531
02:38:02,570 --> 02:38:03,410
Do you eat dessert?

5532
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:04,040
Yup.

5533
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:04,873
So you just eat it.

5534
02:38:05,210 --> 02:38:05,751
I just need it.

5535
02:38:05,751 --> 02:38:06,501
It's not a cheat.

5536
02:38:06,501 --> 02:38:11,501
It's part of the entire diet and
nutrition desert is a part of nutrition.

5537
02:38:12,470 --> 02:38:15,170
Tell me more apples with peanut.

5538
02:38:15,171 --> 02:38:15,710
What should I eat?

5539
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:15,921
Oh,

5540
02:38:15,921 --> 02:38:16,450
you fucked.

5541
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:18,440
Bolstered up isn't that is not dessert.

5542
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,750
How dare you fucking dare you.

5543
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:22,430
The grades on this guy.

5544
02:38:22,431 --> 02:38:26,570
How about that is not
man yogurt with a sigh.

5545
02:38:26,571 --> 02:38:28,010
He dark chocolate.

5546
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:29,400
[inaudible] Osi.

5547
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:30,710
He sie

5548
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:36,350
peanuts and walnuts and pine nuts.

5549
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:37,011
I've got a better idea.

5550
02:38:37,011 --> 02:38:38,180
How about a hot fudge Sundae?

5551
02:38:38,181 --> 02:38:38,710
Fuck,

5552
02:38:38,710 --> 02:38:39,680
I want a Brownie.

5553
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:41,630
How about a Brownie with hot fudge on it?

5554
02:38:41,631 --> 02:38:44,150
Just read Katari 31 flavors.

5555
02:38:44,151 --> 02:38:44,984
I'm there.

5556
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:45,501
Yeah,

5557
02:38:45,501 --> 02:38:46,370
so you eat those too.

5558
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:47,120
I'll lead it.

5559
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:50,000
But for the most part you try to reward
yourself with delicious things that are

5560
02:38:50,001 --> 02:38:50,990
actually new trends or things.

5561
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:53,330
I might have a carbonated
drink once a month.

5562
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:54,800
My friend Mike Dolce,

5563
02:38:54,801 --> 02:38:55,171
he's a,

5564
02:38:55,171 --> 02:38:57,260
I'm a nutritionist to
a lot of MMA fighters.

5565
02:38:57,261 --> 02:38:59,090
Helps them with their
diet and losing weight.

5566
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:00,740
He doesn't believe in cheat days,

5567
02:39:00,741 --> 02:39:02,990
but he believes in reward meals.

5568
02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:05,990
Like you will reward
yourself to cheat meal.

5569
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:09,350
It's just semantics for your hard work.

5570
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:10,260
It's semantics.

5571
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:10,850
Come on.

5572
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:11,540
Why you got to call it,

5573
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:15,060
why you gotta be near this cheat is
a negative and reward as a positive.

5574
02:39:15,061 --> 02:39:15,461
Exactly.

5575
02:39:15,461 --> 02:39:17,450
That's what he's a glass
half full kind of a guy.

5576
02:39:17,510 --> 02:39:17,961
I got it.

5577
02:39:17,961 --> 02:39:18,600
So I said,

5578
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:20,450
so you can't find it for him.

5579
02:39:20,750 --> 02:39:22,610
He tried to break him
down there he is like,

5580
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:23,330
oh,

5581
02:39:23,330 --> 02:39:26,030
that's the rock of the
rocks cheat days or epic.

5582
02:39:26,270 --> 02:39:27,200
Look at the size of that guy.

5583
02:39:27,230 --> 02:39:28,063
What is he eating?

5584
02:39:28,130 --> 02:39:30,170
Look at the size of that guy who
gives a fuck what he's eating.

5585
02:39:30,171 --> 02:39:32,450
He is Goddamn he huge.

5586
02:39:32,930 --> 02:39:37,040
He used to be a normal size like
big athlete but now he's fucking,

5587
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:39,170
that guy is obsessed with working out too.

5588
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:41,390
If you go to is if you're a
guy that likes to work out,

5589
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,800
subscribe to the rocks,

5590
02:39:42,801 --> 02:39:47,450
Twitter and is his Twitter
and his Instagram or epic
because this guy will fly

5591
02:39:47,451 --> 02:39:49,100
into a city at like four
o'clock in the morning.

5592
02:39:49,101 --> 02:39:51,350
It'd be at the gym at six taking pictures,

5593
02:39:51,351 --> 02:39:52,760
tweeting and going crazy.

5594
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:55,670
He just believes in
like constant hard work,

5595
02:39:55,850 --> 02:39:57,110
doing things that are difficult,

5596
02:39:57,111 --> 02:40:00,690
making yourself work out when you don't
want to and he's very strictly as die

5597
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:01,670
except one day.

5598
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:06,020
And that one day he has these fucking
epic cheat days where he takes photos of

5599
02:40:06,021 --> 02:40:10,850
stacks of donuts and
literally like jugs of milk,

5600
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:13,980
like five gallon jugs of
milk and fucking giant

5601
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,813
savage.

5602
02:40:14,890 --> 02:40:15,131
See,

5603
02:40:15,131 --> 02:40:15,401
to me,

5604
02:40:15,401 --> 02:40:20,080
that's like injecting yourself with a
thousand milligrams of testosterone in one

5605
02:40:20,081 --> 02:40:22,900
day as opposed to taking
20 milligrams every day.

5606
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:23,291
Well,

5607
02:40:23,291 --> 02:40:23,800
I have,

5608
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,910
I think he's mentally,

5609
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:25,330
uh,

5610
02:40:25,330 --> 02:40:26,680
he's probably a crazy person.

5611
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:27,431
Look at the size of them.

5612
02:40:27,431 --> 02:40:28,330
That's what you used to look like.

5613
02:40:28,331 --> 02:40:29,200
That's what it looks like now.

5614
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:29,860
Wow.

5615
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:30,071
Yeah,

5616
02:40:30,071 --> 02:40:30,760
he's giant.

5617
02:40:30,760 --> 02:40:35,170
I think he is a crazy person as
I think he's a in the good way.

5618
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:37,840
I think he's a crazy person for a success.

5619
02:40:38,050 --> 02:40:38,261
You know,

5620
02:40:38,261 --> 02:40:39,820
he's a crazy person for achievement,

5621
02:40:39,970 --> 02:40:43,630
so he's just getting crazy for pumping
his body up into this ultimate super

5622
02:40:43,631 --> 02:40:44,590
athlete machine.

5623
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:44,891
She,

5624
02:40:44,891 --> 02:40:46,240
I feel small.

5625
02:40:46,310 --> 02:40:49,690
Do you should feel small next to
him were both producing estrogen.

5626
02:40:50,380 --> 02:40:51,970
That's speak for yourself.

5627
02:40:52,010 --> 02:40:53,980
We both produce androgen for
standing next to the rock.

5628
02:40:53,981 --> 02:40:54,580
I met the guy,

5629
02:40:54,580 --> 02:40:55,310
trust me,

5630
02:40:55,310 --> 02:40:56,143
he's too big.

5631
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:57,490
Still look at the size of that guy.

5632
02:40:57,610 --> 02:40:58,870
I mean that's a big fella.

5633
02:40:58,960 --> 02:40:59,500
Jeez.

5634
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:00,400
Jesus Christ.

5635
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:01,810
Yeah.

5636
02:41:01,810 --> 02:41:03,370
So if you look at for inspiration,

5637
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:04,420
follow him on Instagram.

5638
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:05,470
Um,

5639
02:41:05,470 --> 02:41:06,310
for the average guy,

5640
02:41:06,970 --> 02:41:07,330
um,

5641
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:07,641
what,

5642
02:41:07,641 --> 02:41:10,210
what should the average person do if
they want to find out that something,

5643
02:41:10,270 --> 02:41:11,650
what's going on with their hormones,

5644
02:41:11,651 --> 02:41:12,820
where their hormone levels are,

5645
02:41:12,970 --> 02:41:13,361
what's the,

5646
02:41:13,361 --> 02:41:15,430
what's the steps that they
should take to find out?

5647
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:16,563
Well,

5648
02:41:16,810 --> 02:41:20,140
we have an automated system
to make it easier if they go,

5649
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:24,070
if they have a traumatic brain injury
or have had a traumatic brain injury,

5650
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,630
and I'll just interject this,

5651
02:41:25,631 --> 02:41:30,100
if they're with the military or would
the police department or with the NFL

5652
02:41:30,101 --> 02:41:31,300
retiree we have,

5653
02:41:31,330 --> 02:41:33,610
I have three grants to pay for.

5654
02:41:33,611 --> 02:41:37,150
There are two thousand one hundred two
thousand two hundred dollars laboratory

5655
02:41:37,151 --> 02:41:37,984
testing.

5656
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:39,760
He'll be paid for by a grant.

5657
02:41:40,510 --> 02:41:45,510
So they go to the website and they fill
out an application and within 12 to 24

5658
02:41:45,821 --> 02:41:46,181
hours,

5659
02:41:46,181 --> 02:41:48,880
someone in our office calls to
just confirm a couple of things.

5660
02:41:48,881 --> 02:41:51,940
And send them out about
20 pages worth of intake.

5661
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:52,731
Any your,

5662
02:41:52,731 --> 02:41:53,060
um,

5663
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:57,920
experience a lot of the people that
are experiencing real bad results from

5664
02:41:57,921 --> 02:41:59,300
traumatic brain injury,

5665
02:41:59,330 --> 02:42:01,150
oftentimes it's hormonally related,

5666
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:01,980
correct?

5667
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:02,640
Well,

5668
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:03,473
you know,

5669
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:06,030
I take care of what's
called mild to moderate.

5670
02:42:06,031 --> 02:42:09,630
These are people who might not have
lost consciousness in the mild.

5671
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:14,490
Some of them might have a little
amnesia that lasts for less than 12,

5672
02:42:14,491 --> 02:42:15,324
24 hours.

5673
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:18,810
Is it shocking for you how
easy it is to damage the brain?

5674
02:42:18,930 --> 02:42:19,763
Unbelievable.

5675
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:20,940
Uh,

5676
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:25,320
one case that just finished a gentleman
was rear ended at five to seven miles an

5677
02:42:25,321 --> 02:42:28,830
hour and ended up getting
traumatic brain injury so crazy.

5678
02:42:28,850 --> 02:42:29,111
Uh,

5679
02:42:29,111 --> 02:42:30,060
the brain sits,

5680
02:42:30,061 --> 02:42:30,511
you know,

5681
02:42:30,511 --> 02:42:32,880
in an envelope with fluid supporting it.

5682
02:42:33,390 --> 02:42:36,510
But there's the front part of the inside
of the brain and the backside at the

5683
02:42:36,511 --> 02:42:37,710
front pilot called the sweet,

5684
02:42:37,711 --> 02:42:38,400
annoyed,

5685
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:39,210
plateaued.

5686
02:42:39,210 --> 02:42:42,840
It's a sharp area that all
you have to do is stop short.

5687
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:44,490
You just have to shake your head,

5688
02:42:44,491 --> 02:42:45,301
shaking baby,

5689
02:42:45,301 --> 02:42:50,301
working on a pneumatic drill or
a pneumatic hammer or a knee,

5690
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:55,650
a skiing moguls where you're up and
down or doing waterskiing where you're

5691
02:42:55,651 --> 02:42:57,750
hitting the waves and
you're bouncing up and down.

5692
02:42:58,050 --> 02:42:58,800
Wow.

5693
02:42:58,800 --> 02:42:59,970
That's how simple it is.

5694
02:42:59,971 --> 02:43:04,860
And we've taken it for granted that
the brain is impervious to damage.

5695
02:43:04,890 --> 02:43:07,110
So waterskiing could
give you brain damage.

5696
02:43:07,140 --> 02:43:07,560
Correct.

5697
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:08,430
It's repetitive.

5698
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:09,750
It's a form of repetitive.

5699
02:43:09,751 --> 02:43:10,584
Think of it this way.

5700
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:12,070
You're standing there in the rank

5701
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:14,350
and someone's just tapping you.

5702
02:43:15,350 --> 02:43:15,940
Hey Bro,

5703
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:16,370
I know,

5704
02:43:16,370 --> 02:43:17,340
move on.

5705
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:18,183
Right.

5706
02:43:18,270 --> 02:43:19,720
Slick Brunel,

5707
02:43:19,721 --> 02:43:20,554
Whitaker and his PR,

5708
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:21,663
your rope a dope.

5709
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:22,771
Anyway,

5710
02:43:22,771 --> 02:43:24,330
if you were getting hit lightly,

5711
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:25,470
the accumulate,

5712
02:43:25,471 --> 02:43:27,000
the damage accumulates over time.

5713
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:28,810
That totally makes sense.

5714
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:29,260
Um,

5715
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:29,771
there was,

5716
02:43:29,771 --> 02:43:30,604
uh,

5717
02:43:31,630 --> 02:43:34,000
there's been quite a
few actually guys who,

5718
02:43:34,001 --> 02:43:34,510
uh,

5719
02:43:34,510 --> 02:43:38,530
realized after a while that they
couldn't take punishment anymore,

5720
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:42,070
that their brain just was simply not
allowing them to take those shots.

5721
02:43:42,071 --> 02:43:44,200
They'd get hit and their
body would just give out.

5722
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,053
Right.

5723
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:45,881
When you see that,

5724
02:43:45,881 --> 02:43:49,540
is that like just like hurting
a knee or hurting your back,

5725
02:43:49,541 --> 02:43:50,860
you're more likely to hurt it again?

5726
02:43:50,950 --> 02:43:51,401
Like if you,

5727
02:43:51,401 --> 02:43:52,340
if you hurt your knee and you,

5728
02:43:52,341 --> 02:43:53,530
you tear your meniscus,

5729
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:54,341
it's,

5730
02:43:54,341 --> 02:43:56,560
there's a high probability of
you entering that knee again,

5731
02:43:56,561 --> 02:43:57,850
that knee has now been weakened,

5732
02:43:58,060 --> 02:43:58,510
correct.

5733
02:43:58,510 --> 02:43:59,920
Is that how the brain is as well?

5734
02:43:59,921 --> 02:44:00,191
Well,

5735
02:44:00,191 --> 02:44:01,024
it's,

5736
02:44:01,410 --> 02:44:03,300
the brain is just awesome.

5737
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:07,650
There is connections from the
different lobes of the brain,

5738
02:44:07,651 --> 02:44:08,820
from the left to right,

5739
02:44:08,821 --> 02:44:09,750
the front to the back.

5740
02:44:10,290 --> 02:44:12,270
And there are connections
that can be torn,

5741
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:13,613
called sharing.

5742
02:44:13,710 --> 02:44:15,300
And if you tear enough of them,

5743
02:44:15,301 --> 02:44:17,550
what happens is you
lose cognitive ability,

5744
02:44:17,551 --> 02:44:18,540
mental ability,

5745
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:20,010
your personality changes.

5746
02:44:20,430 --> 02:44:23,520
And over a period of time you might
have this slow progression towards

5747
02:44:23,521 --> 02:44:28,020
depression or slow progression
towards memory loss or fatigue.

5748
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:29,513
So

5749
02:44:31,530 --> 02:44:33,310
it happens over a long period of time.

5750
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:36,330
There's a 30 year pro pro spective study,

5751
02:44:36,331 --> 02:44:39,750
which means they had people who had head
trauma and they followed them for 30

5752
02:44:39,751 --> 02:44:40,584
years.

5753
02:44:40,590 --> 02:44:41,400
That's creepy.

5754
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:42,840
48 I'll follow my man.

5755
02:44:43,590 --> 02:44:44,670
25 fucking years.

5756
02:44:44,700 --> 02:44:46,170
I am your shadows to fall on me,

5757
02:44:46,171 --> 02:44:46,860
man.

5758
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:50,250
So they found something like
48% of the people had a,

5759
02:44:50,330 --> 02:44:52,320
a psychological problem.

5760
02:44:52,321 --> 02:44:55,420
28% of them had depression
and 8% paranoia.

5761
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:57,690
Drug abuse is a very
large thing that happens.

5762
02:44:58,140 --> 02:45:02,040
And I'm starting to look at
kids who are addicted to drugs,

5763
02:45:02,041 --> 02:45:03,900
whether or not it's a methamphetamine,

5764
02:45:03,901 --> 02:45:04,734
heroin,

5765
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:05,703
uh,

5766
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:06,773
Oxycontin,

5767
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:07,800
narcotics or whatever,

5768
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:13,220
that they have a history of having had
head trauma and they've just been looking

5769
02:45:13,951 --> 02:45:14,731
for medication,

5770
02:45:14,731 --> 02:45:16,530
drugs to help them feel better.

5771
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:18,300
They're looking for their own cure.

5772
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:19,051
You know,

5773
02:45:19,051 --> 02:45:21,660
if you look back in the add beginning of,

5774
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:22,200
uh,

5775
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,460
attention deficit disorder,

5776
02:45:23,730 --> 02:45:24,990
you had kids looking for,

5777
02:45:24,991 --> 02:45:26,250
they felt a hyper,

5778
02:45:26,251 --> 02:45:27,570
so they would take downers.

5779
02:45:27,690 --> 02:45:28,020
Well,

5780
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:29,550
what happens is called paradoxical.

5781
02:45:29,551 --> 02:45:31,110
If they take it down or they get spit up,

5782
02:45:31,710 --> 02:45:33,300
they take an upper that get spent down.

5783
02:45:33,301 --> 02:45:34,440
That's what Ritalin is,

5784
02:45:34,470 --> 02:45:34,730
right?

5785
02:45:34,730 --> 02:45:36,780
That's what methamphetamine
or the Adderall is.

5786
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:40,600
So it's an Adderall they prescribed
for people who are too hyper.

5787
02:45:40,770 --> 02:45:41,603
Correct.

5788
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:43,290
It doesn't make sense,

5789
02:45:43,291 --> 02:45:44,730
but it's called paradoxical.

5790
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:46,920
It does the opposite
effect of what it should.

5791
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:48,540
And it's only in certain people,

5792
02:45:48,541 --> 02:45:50,890
like people with attention
deficit disorder,

5793
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:53,790
a Ahdh hyper activity.

5794
02:45:54,450 --> 02:45:55,560
And um,

5795
02:45:57,480 --> 02:45:57,781
you know,

5796
02:45:57,781 --> 02:45:58,614
we're looking,

5797
02:45:58,650 --> 02:45:59,850
they're looking for,

5798
02:45:59,851 --> 02:46:00,630
for drugs,

5799
02:46:00,630 --> 02:46:01,470
alcohol.

5800
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:04,140
A guy that came from Boston.

5801
02:46:04,510 --> 02:46:05,730
I'll tell you a Boston story.

5802
02:46:05,731 --> 02:46:06,420
Uh,

5803
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:10,910
Jr came from Boston rugby
player five head Traumas,

5804
02:46:10,911 --> 02:46:13,160
three loss of consciousness
in one hospitalization.

5805
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:13,860
Pussy.

5806
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:14,270
Yeah.

5807
02:46:14,270 --> 02:46:14,950
Really?

5808
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:18,470
And between the ages of 23,

5809
02:46:19,010 --> 02:46:20,260
23 and 35,

5810
02:46:20,261 --> 02:46:23,150
he became an alcoholic at
35 be crashed and burned.

5811
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:28,310
And he was institutionalized and he was
put on three antidepressants and he flew

5812
02:46:28,311 --> 02:46:29,150
out from Boston.

5813
02:46:29,151 --> 02:46:32,030
We did our testing and even though
he's on three antidepressants,

5814
02:46:32,031 --> 02:46:32,960
he was still depressed.

5815
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:34,660
It's Jesus Christ still depressed.

5816
02:46:34,661 --> 02:46:37,130
And this is one of the hallmarks
of traumatic brain injury.

5817
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:40,220
It's called treatment
resistant depression.

5818
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:44,960
We're finding that people who are put
onto one medication and it doesn't work or

5819
02:46:44,961 --> 02:46:48,080
two does work or get shifted
around because they stop working.

5820
02:46:48,290 --> 02:46:49,610
You need to look at the hormones,

5821
02:46:50,370 --> 02:46:55,370
we need to look at hormones and we
put him on 60 milligrams that to,

5822
02:46:55,770 --> 02:46:58,400
because his level of
testosterone was extremely low,

5823
02:46:58,430 --> 02:47:00,260
60 milligrams of testosterone a week,

5824
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:01,610
six months later,

5825
02:47:01,611 --> 02:47:02,600
his psychiatrist,

5826
02:47:02,630 --> 02:47:04,160
he had to get a new psychiatrist,

5827
02:47:04,190 --> 02:47:05,180
took him off his drugs.

5828
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:06,110
He's back in Boston.

5829
02:47:06,111 --> 02:47:08,270
He's investment banking now.

5830
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:09,471
When,

5831
02:47:09,471 --> 02:47:09,801
when,

5832
02:47:09,801 --> 02:47:11,300
when a guy has an issue,

5833
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:13,970
if there's something or a cow or anybody,

5834
02:47:14,450 --> 02:47:15,610
Kara called girl Gal,

5835
02:47:15,611 --> 02:47:16,444
you're kind of creepy,

5836
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:17,773
what do you want to call it?

5837
02:47:18,290 --> 02:47:19,050
Weird.

5838
02:47:19,050 --> 02:47:20,200
So that's like when,

5839
02:47:20,210 --> 02:47:22,190
when you definitely don't
wanna fuck female Gal,

5840
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:23,300
she's a great old Gal.

5841
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:25,293
Um,

5842
02:47:25,580 --> 02:47:27,070
if someone has had,

5843
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:32,440
if someone has had enough of an impact
on their brain that they have to seek

5844
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:33,351
exogenous,

5845
02:47:33,351 --> 02:47:33,830
is that the word?

5846
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:34,370
Yup.

5847
02:47:34,370 --> 02:47:35,640
Exogenous hormones to,

5848
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:37,550
to fix whatever problem they have.

5849
02:47:38,260 --> 02:47:38,710
What,

5850
02:47:38,710 --> 02:47:43,040
what would you do if that person was
still engaging in the very activities that

5851
02:47:43,041 --> 02:47:44,000
caused them to,

5852
02:47:44,060 --> 02:47:44,900
to have this,

5853
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:46,580
this issue with their body?

5854
02:47:46,760 --> 02:47:47,421
Absolutely.

5855
02:47:47,421 --> 02:47:48,170
Pull them.

5856
02:47:48,170 --> 02:47:49,010
So in MMA,

5857
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:49,911
so an MMA,

5858
02:47:49,911 --> 02:47:52,070
when you see these people
getting testosterone,

5859
02:47:52,071 --> 02:47:52,341
which is,

5860
02:47:52,341 --> 02:47:53,174
you know,

5861
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:54,041
what,

5862
02:47:54,041 --> 02:47:54,890
what do you think about that?

5863
02:47:55,490 --> 02:47:55,761
Well,

5864
02:47:55,761 --> 02:48:00,761
hopefully the doctor has
done the relationship of his
activity MMA and he's done

5865
02:48:01,761 --> 02:48:02,301
the workup,

5866
02:48:02,301 --> 02:48:03,200
which includes,

5867
02:48:03,380 --> 02:48:03,920
you know,

5868
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:08,450
laboratory testing as well as the
radiological evaluation to see what the

5869
02:48:08,451 --> 02:48:10,160
damages and if you see,

5870
02:48:10,430 --> 02:48:10,701
you know,

5871
02:48:10,701 --> 02:48:14,030
areas that are very classical
for damaged scarring,

5872
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:14,701
Exxon,

5873
02:48:14,701 --> 02:48:15,471
no scarring,

5874
02:48:15,471 --> 02:48:16,240
brain scarring,

5875
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:18,290
the old believed that he had,

5876
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:18,591
well,

5877
02:48:18,591 --> 02:48:19,281
if they had a bleed,

5878
02:48:19,281 --> 02:48:21,230
they would have been
in the hospital mostly.

5879
02:48:21,270 --> 02:48:22,640
Hopefully not everybody.

5880
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:23,840
It would.

5881
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:27,980
That's what you would use to decide
whether or not the person who is at risk.

5882
02:48:27,981 --> 02:48:31,610
I've got a case right now from the
entertainment world where it's a stunt man

5883
02:48:31,611 --> 02:48:32,150
who is,

5884
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:35,150
he's been through a lot of
traumas and his last trauma,

5885
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:37,190
beginning of last year,

5886
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:38,630
I left him depressed.

5887
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:40,940
He was in a coma and left
him depressed and so forth.

5888
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,980
And within five weeks he's better.

5889
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:44,240
And the question became,

5890
02:48:44,241 --> 02:48:45,980
he's good enough to go back to work,

5891
02:48:45,981 --> 02:48:47,540
but you don't want him to go back to work,

5892
02:48:47,630 --> 02:48:48,463
right?

5893
02:48:48,680 --> 02:48:50,480
Because if he gets banged around again,

5894
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:52,100
you lose everything you've gained.

5895
02:48:52,610 --> 02:48:53,600
Oh boy.

5896
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:56,510
So this is why people don't
want to talk about it.

5897
02:48:56,511 --> 02:48:59,180
You've got some great football
players who've been dinged.

5898
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:01,070
You don't want to go
do that test that says,

5899
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:01,933
I'm sorry,

5900
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:02,571
but uh,

5901
02:49:02,571 --> 02:49:04,040
you can no longer play football.

5902
02:49:04,041 --> 02:49:07,470
You're 25 years of age and
you've got scars in the brain,

5903
02:49:07,471 --> 02:49:09,600
which means you're at
high risk for developing,

5904
02:49:09,810 --> 02:49:10,021
you know,

5905
02:49:10,021 --> 02:49:10,890
the CTE.

5906
02:49:11,430 --> 02:49:14,460
Do you remember when that a
football player died because
he fell out of the back

5907
02:49:14,461 --> 02:49:15,031
of his truck?

5908
02:49:15,031 --> 02:49:16,530
His girlfriend was
driving away in his truck.

5909
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:20,420
They did a brain scan on him after he
died and they did his autopsy and they out

5910
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:22,980
had the brain of like an
Alzheimer's efficient CTE.

5911
02:49:22,980 --> 02:49:23,880
And here's another thing,

5912
02:49:24,770 --> 02:49:25,291
and it was young,

5913
02:49:25,291 --> 02:49:25,860
right?

5914
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:26,693
He was young.

5915
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:28,980
I didn't bring my presentation.

5916
02:49:28,981 --> 02:49:29,541
I do like what?

5917
02:49:29,541 --> 02:49:30,374
Let's fuck.

5918
02:49:30,510 --> 02:49:30,990
Sorry.

5919
02:49:30,990 --> 02:49:31,823
Come on man.

5920
02:49:31,830 --> 02:49:33,810
I didn't know you had PPTs
and me professionally,

5921
02:49:33,811 --> 02:49:36,790
I have lava lamps here
and rock salt lights,

5922
02:49:36,810 --> 02:49:37,980
nice color and everything.

5923
02:49:37,981 --> 02:49:39,210
I figured you would be prepared.

5924
02:49:39,230 --> 02:49:42,420
So what they found is with head trauma,

5925
02:49:42,790 --> 02:49:47,790
you will develop Alzheimer's Disease 19
Times faster than if you don't have head

5926
02:49:49,831 --> 02:49:50,310
trauma.

5927
02:49:50,310 --> 02:49:52,290
Jesus Christ 19 times.

5928
02:49:52,291 --> 02:49:55,590
And I was in Vegas giving a lecture on
traumatic brain injury and there was a

5929
02:49:55,591 --> 02:50:00,330
doc talking specifically about head trauma
and Alzheimer's and his documentation

5930
02:50:00,331 --> 02:50:05,010
was irrefutably supportive
of the relationship and
they know it so they don't

5931
02:50:05,011 --> 02:50:05,671
want to tell someone,

5932
02:50:05,671 --> 02:50:09,330
look at keep playing football likelihood
is you'll retire and you'll develop

5933
02:50:09,331 --> 02:50:11,250
Alzheimer's and does die at 54.

5934
02:50:11,251 --> 02:50:13,140
How old was a hundred waters?

5935
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:14,393
I don't know.

5936
02:50:14,430 --> 02:50:15,061
Young guys,

5937
02:50:15,061 --> 02:50:15,660
he was young.

5938
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:16,920
All the guys that have died.

5939
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:21,150
Who was the last one was San
Diego who died at 24 years of age.

5940
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:23,023
This,

5941
02:50:23,180 --> 02:50:23,700
you know,

5942
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:24,300
I dunno.

5943
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:25,680
It's depressing.

5944
02:50:25,710 --> 02:50:27,720
So in your opinion,

5945
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:28,471
uh,

5946
02:50:28,471 --> 02:50:29,760
as an expert on the subject,

5947
02:50:29,790 --> 02:50:33,750
when a guy gets to a point where he
needs testosterone because of this,

5948
02:50:33,870 --> 02:50:37,890
they really shouldn't be engaging in
whatever caused them to lose their ability

5949
02:50:37,891 --> 02:50:38,820
to produce testosterone.

5950
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:41,940
That would be a late case scenario.

5951
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:46,530
So someone getting a testosterone use
exemption for mixed martial arts in your

5952
02:50:46,531 --> 02:50:47,790
opinion would be a bad idea?

5953
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:48,301
Correct.

5954
02:50:48,301 --> 02:50:53,301
Especially if it was due to head to
positive findings of damage by DT MRI or

5955
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:57,360
functional MRI or Mri.

5956
02:50:57,540 --> 02:51:00,990
So that's the thing
about when someone has a,

5957
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,520
a testosterone use exemption,

5958
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:07,170
they don't have to specify the
cause of testosterone being low.

5959
02:51:07,650 --> 02:51:10,050
They just find that it is
and then supplement it.

5960
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:12,360
How could they find what it is?

5961
02:51:12,361 --> 02:51:12,720
I mean,

5962
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:13,080
are there,

5963
02:51:13,080 --> 02:51:17,280
what are the various reasons
why people besides aging,

5964
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:19,500
why people don't have good testosterone,

5965
02:51:21,150 --> 02:51:21,780
female?

5966
02:51:21,780 --> 02:51:22,110
No.

5967
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:23,610
Females have high levels.

5968
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:24,300
Um,

5969
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:25,133
you know,

5970
02:51:25,650 --> 02:51:27,150
having had to stick your with trauma,

5971
02:51:27,750 --> 02:51:29,040
cooking your testicles,

5972
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:30,260
I cook them break

5973
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:37,070
talking about greater than 105 days
or a lawyer put the onions in it.

5974
02:51:38,970 --> 02:51:39,450
So,

5975
02:51:39,450 --> 02:51:40,283
um,

5976
02:51:41,130 --> 02:51:41,963
head trauma.

5977
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:44,490
It's the regulatory
mechanism in the brain.

5978
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:46,200
And then you have peripheral,

5979
02:51:46,201 --> 02:51:47,580
which is the testicle itself.

5980
02:51:47,610 --> 02:51:48,540
Any kind of damage,

5981
02:51:48,541 --> 02:51:49,260
infections,

5982
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:50,010
mumps,

5983
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:50,850
talking about mumps,

5984
02:51:50,851 --> 02:51:53,280
mumps can cause the
testicles to stop working.

5985
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:54,833
Okay.

5986
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:56,640
So just the viral infection,

5987
02:51:56,860 --> 02:51:58,830
you can get loss of testicular function.

5988
02:51:59,670 --> 02:52:01,710
But in someone who is MMA,

5989
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:04,320
I would have to really
think long and hard about,

5990
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:04,860
hmm,

5991
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:09,860
he has testosterone deficiency has been
an MMA for six years and he's had a,

5992
02:52:10,300 --> 02:52:10,601
you know,

5993
02:52:10,601 --> 02:52:12,960
five documented loss of consciousness.

5994
02:52:12,961 --> 02:52:13,160
A,

5995
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:14,320
he's beaten over the head.

5996
02:52:15,070 --> 02:52:16,300
Who knows how many times in training.

5997
02:52:16,301 --> 02:52:17,134
Correct?

5998
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:18,023
Yeah.

5999
02:52:18,180 --> 02:52:20,710
I have a guide that was
in training and got Kod.

6000
02:52:21,790 --> 02:52:22,151
Yeah.

6001
02:52:22,151 --> 02:52:23,140
That happens all the time.

6002
02:52:23,141 --> 02:52:26,140
And then guys wind up fighting just a
couple of weeks later and they can't take

6003
02:52:26,141 --> 02:52:26,680
a punch.

6004
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:26,891
Right.

6005
02:52:26,891 --> 02:52:27,380
And you know,

6006
02:52:27,380 --> 02:52:28,660
we've seen it many times,

6007
02:52:28,661 --> 02:52:29,360
um,

6008
02:52:29,360 --> 02:52:29,820
is uh,

6009
02:52:29,820 --> 02:52:30,491
Marvin has been,

6010
02:52:30,491 --> 02:52:31,720
Travis Luder is a famous,

6011
02:52:31,721 --> 02:52:35,440
a fight where a Travis Luder knocked out
Marvin Neiman with a punch that looked

6012
02:52:35,441 --> 02:52:36,460
like a barely connected.

6013
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:39,760
And it turned out that we had heard
that Marvin Marvin Eastman had been in

6014
02:52:39,761 --> 02:52:43,270
training camp and had gotten hurt and
training camp got knocked out maybe twice,

6015
02:52:43,570 --> 02:52:44,381
at least once.

6016
02:52:44,381 --> 02:52:46,180
And he's a great fighter
to really tough guy.

6017
02:52:46,181 --> 02:52:47,770
So it didn't make any
sense that he could took,

6018
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:49,270
couldn't take a punch like that.

6019
02:52:49,570 --> 02:52:51,130
It was one of those weird cases.

6020
02:52:51,210 --> 02:52:52,740
What we're starting to
see on the Internet,

6021
02:52:52,741 --> 02:52:56,400
which might be a backdoor
type of self analysis,

6022
02:52:56,820 --> 02:52:59,850
are these cognitive testing programs.

6023
02:52:59,851 --> 02:53:01,140
There's one called impact,

6024
02:53:01,141 --> 02:53:02,520
which is out of um,

6025
02:53:03,070 --> 02:53:03,360
uh,

6026
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:08,360
Pennsylvania with the doctor who is
the neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh

6027
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:09,910
Steelers.

6028
02:53:09,910 --> 02:53:10,743
A duck.

6029
02:53:10,750 --> 02:53:10,950
Sure.

6030
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:11,640
Watch this.

6031
02:53:11,640 --> 02:53:13,110
Travis Luter hits him with his punch.

6032
02:53:13,350 --> 02:53:14,183
It's crazy.

6033
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:17,310
And he goes down like
he got shot by a sniper.

6034
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:18,660
It's a really crazy to watch this.

6035
02:53:21,360 --> 02:53:21,551
I mean,

6036
02:53:21,551 --> 02:53:21,750
he,

6037
02:53:21,750 --> 02:53:22,470
he like,

6038
02:53:22,470 --> 02:53:26,970
I mean he kind of connected but
he's totally out it totally out.

6039
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:28,200
Like watch the punch again.

6040
02:53:29,610 --> 02:53:29,821
I mean,

6041
02:53:29,821 --> 02:53:30,660
you're pretty good shot,

6042
02:53:30,690 --> 02:53:31,530
but man,

6043
02:53:32,010 --> 02:53:33,810
it seemed like he was
on the very end of it.

6044
02:53:33,811 --> 02:53:35,740
It just didn't seem like it
should have that kind of impact.

6045
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:35,860
We,

6046
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:37,110
Travis does hit really hard,

6047
02:53:37,410 --> 02:53:38,370
very strong guy.

6048
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:40,560
But then when you found out that he,

6049
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:42,420
I mean he definitely would
have got hurt by that punch,

6050
02:53:42,421 --> 02:53:44,220
but going out like that seems unusual.

6051
02:53:44,430 --> 02:53:45,330
And I think it was because,

6052
02:53:45,331 --> 02:53:45,850
uh,

6053
02:53:45,850 --> 02:53:47,850
they said that see it like grazes him,

6054
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:49,170
they said Marvin had,

6055
02:53:49,171 --> 02:53:49,380
uh,

6056
02:53:49,380 --> 02:53:52,640
gotten KOD and training
that happened also to,

6057
02:53:52,641 --> 02:53:53,380
um,

6058
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:53,630
uh,

6059
02:53:53,630 --> 02:53:55,860
Forrest Griffin before
he fought Anderson Silva.

6060
02:53:56,010 --> 02:53:58,110
He had apparently had
gotten KOD and training.

6061
02:53:58,410 --> 02:53:58,800
Uh,

6062
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:00,300
I think he said twice too.

6063
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:01,233
Yeah.

6064
02:54:01,400 --> 02:54:02,200
And you sure.

6065
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:05,450
And they're additive so
you don't kill me right.

6066
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:07,210
Through their cumulative additive,

6067
02:54:07,211 --> 02:54:08,044
cumulative.

6068
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:09,850
And it just gets easier.

6069
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:11,530
I hate to have to correct
you in front of those people,

6070
02:54:11,550 --> 02:54:12,850
but sometimes you just fuck up,

6071
02:54:12,851 --> 02:54:13,210
dude.

6072
02:54:13,210 --> 02:54:13,670
Hey,

6073
02:54:13,670 --> 02:54:14,560
I think you're so smart.

6074
02:54:16,150 --> 02:54:18,070
Only you're the one who
thinks I'm so smart.

6075
02:54:18,470 --> 02:54:20,980
Do you think I spent
five days a week reading?

6076
02:54:21,010 --> 02:54:22,480
Because I know so little.

6077
02:54:22,660 --> 02:54:22,931
Yeah.

6078
02:54:22,931 --> 02:54:23,681
Well that's very,

6079
02:54:23,681 --> 02:54:24,514
very humble of you.

6080
02:54:24,550 --> 02:54:25,600
You're also a martial artists.

6081
02:54:25,601 --> 02:54:25,840
You've,

6082
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:25,961
uh,

6083
02:54:25,961 --> 02:54:26,530
so this is a,

6084
02:54:26,530 --> 02:54:28,840
something that's not
like a alien to you've,

6085
02:54:28,841 --> 02:54:29,320
uh,

6086
02:54:29,320 --> 02:54:30,500
it's martial arts for a long time.

6087
02:54:30,680 --> 02:54:30,891
Yeah.

6088
02:54:30,891 --> 02:54:32,460
I did taekwondo sector,

6089
02:54:32,461 --> 02:54:36,440
read black belt on the cover of martial
arts magazine cover of a magazine,

6090
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:41,460
son throwing side kicks on bitches with
my master of young you foot in my mouth.

6091
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:43,820
Did it tastes good?

6092
02:54:43,820 --> 02:54:44,031
No,

6093
02:54:44,031 --> 02:54:44,864
it did.

6094
02:54:45,190 --> 02:54:45,381
Yeah,

6095
02:54:45,381 --> 02:54:47,270
I would imagine it's
waiting for you to answer.

6096
02:54:47,390 --> 02:54:47,781
You answered.

6097
02:54:47,781 --> 02:54:48,614
Correct.

6098
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:50,330
Um,

6099
02:54:50,330 --> 02:54:51,620
if people want to know more about

6100
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:52,011
there's that,

6101
02:54:52,011 --> 02:54:53,130
they're fascinated by it.

6102
02:54:53,131 --> 02:54:55,250
If they think perhaps they
might have an issue themselves.

6103
02:54:55,290 --> 02:54:55,530
Uh,

6104
02:54:55,530 --> 02:54:56,363
what is the weapon?

6105
02:54:56,900 --> 02:54:58,890
The website is TB.

6106
02:54:58,950 --> 02:55:01,740
I Med med legal,

6107
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:03,770
l e g a l.com.

6108
02:55:03,830 --> 02:55:04,940
That's very hard to remember.

6109
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:05,330
Yeah.

6110
02:55:05,330 --> 02:55:06,141
Tbi Med,

6111
02:55:06,141 --> 02:55:07,340
legal.com.

6112
02:55:07,400 --> 02:55:08,091
And it has,

6113
02:55:08,091 --> 02:55:08,720
uh,

6114
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:11,960
about a hundred articles that
are abstracted very shortly.

6115
02:55:11,961 --> 02:55:12,950
You put a link up for,

6116
02:55:12,951 --> 02:55:14,610
for people that are
listening to this podcast.

6117
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:15,890
You crafty bastard.

6118
02:55:15,891 --> 02:55:16,701
You just so professional.

6119
02:55:16,701 --> 02:55:17,534
You make me sad.

6120
02:55:18,430 --> 02:55:19,010
I do.

6121
02:55:19,010 --> 02:55:19,281
Yeah.

6122
02:55:19,281 --> 02:55:20,160
Cause I'm not that.

6123
02:55:20,470 --> 02:55:21,320
Go ahead and click it.

6124
02:55:21,770 --> 02:55:23,690
What happens when you
click that it exploded.

6125
02:55:23,750 --> 02:55:24,021
Oh,

6126
02:55:24,021 --> 02:55:24,501
thank you.

6127
02:55:24,501 --> 02:55:25,334
Joe Rogan did,

6128
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:26,173
but that's not,

6129
02:55:26,540 --> 02:55:28,960
did you sign up for this under
my name or something like that?

6130
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:29,481
Oh,

6131
02:55:29,481 --> 02:55:30,260
it just says that.

6132
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:31,093
Okay.

6133
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:31,600
Yeah.

6134
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:33,440
It's information which goes through it.

6135
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:33,831
Oh,

6136
02:55:33,831 --> 02:55:34,101
I see.

6137
02:55:34,101 --> 02:55:34,371
I see.

6138
02:55:34,371 --> 02:55:34,940
I see.

6139
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:35,181
Um,

6140
02:55:35,181 --> 02:55:40,181
so if people are curious about their own
issue or 30 people have already clicked

6141
02:55:40,821 --> 02:55:40,940
it,

6142
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:41,331
but wait,

6143
02:55:41,331 --> 02:55:42,620
now it's gonna get crazy.

6144
02:55:42,830 --> 02:55:43,341
This is just,

6145
02:55:43,341 --> 02:55:45,410
Ustream has probably,

6146
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:48,140
I don't know what
percentage of the actual,

6147
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:49,730
very small percentage.

6148
02:55:49,940 --> 02:55:52,730
Most people tend to listen to this
while they're doing other things.

6149
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:55,910
Like they listened to it on the subway
or in the gym on the bike or whatever.

6150
02:55:56,170 --> 02:55:56,570
Um,

6151
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:58,010
the amount of people
that actually watch us,

6152
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:00,290
but the people that actually
watch us at the most critical,

6153
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:02,000
crazed nerds,

6154
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:03,230
not in a good way.

6155
02:56:03,290 --> 02:56:03,721
And a good way.

6156
02:56:03,721 --> 02:56:04,321
If you give me a hug,

6157
02:56:04,321 --> 02:56:05,154
give a fuck,

6158
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:07,790
leave Tbi,

6159
02:56:07,791 --> 02:56:08,624
medical,

6160
02:56:08,750 --> 02:56:09,291
middly,

6161
02:56:09,291 --> 02:56:09,880
Med legal,

6162
02:56:09,880 --> 02:56:10,400
Tbi,

6163
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,061
med legal,

6164
02:56:11,061 --> 02:56:12,440
and they could find out all about it.

6165
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:13,610
And um,

6166
02:56:13,670 --> 02:56:16,560
is there anything else you would want
to promote or let people know about what

6167
02:56:16,600 --> 02:56:17,480
here I'm not,

6168
02:56:17,570 --> 02:56:22,070
the only thing I really want to promote
is the knowledge that there's this

6169
02:56:22,550 --> 02:56:26,390
incredible association
between head trauma,

6170
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:28,940
hormone deficiency and
change in personality.

6171
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:31,430
And when you correct the
underlying deficiency,

6172
02:56:31,850 --> 02:56:34,550
you see people blossom to end.

6173
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:39,350
I'll say that we have a 32 year
post traumatic brain injury.

6174
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:40,460
Cal 32 years.

6175
02:56:40,461 --> 02:56:44,990
She cracked her carotid in an auto
accident and partial stroke on the right

6176
02:56:44,991 --> 02:56:45,351
side.

6177
02:56:45,351 --> 02:56:50,351
32 years she's lived with
the incapacitation or
suboptimal life on a multitude

6178
02:56:52,281 --> 02:56:53,114
of drugs.

6179
02:56:53,360 --> 02:56:55,730
12 weeks after starting her program,

6180
02:56:55,820 --> 02:56:57,650
she's off of everything.

6181
02:56:58,160 --> 02:56:58,730
Whoa.

6182
02:56:58,730 --> 02:57:00,200
And she started losing weight.

6183
02:57:00,380 --> 02:57:02,660
She's 53 years of age.

6184
02:57:02,930 --> 02:57:04,430
She started losing weight.

6185
02:57:04,790 --> 02:57:05,210
Uh,

6186
02:57:05,210 --> 02:57:06,440
she swimming again.

6187
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:08,600
I was a swimmer in med school and,

6188
02:57:08,601 --> 02:57:08,990
uh,

6189
02:57:08,990 --> 02:57:09,710
in,

6190
02:57:09,710 --> 02:57:10,820
in Undergrad.

6191
02:57:11,370 --> 02:57:15,770
And so she started back swimming
and she's back in school.

6192
02:57:16,010 --> 02:57:16,700
Uh,

6193
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:18,740
her life is just energized.

6194
02:57:18,741 --> 02:57:19,790
She feels phenomenal.

6195
02:57:19,791 --> 02:57:23,360
And they write their story to me and
there'll be eventually posted on the

6196
02:57:23,361 --> 02:57:24,194
website.

6197
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:29,350
We have you know about 571 271
patients with testosterone.

6198
02:57:30,020 --> 02:57:32,180
Then total about 500 plus people.

6199
02:57:32,181 --> 02:57:34,130
I've been doing this a 10 years,

6200
02:57:34,460 --> 02:57:35,960
just specifically traumatic brain,

6201
02:57:35,961 --> 02:57:38,570
but overall 18 years
with hormone replacement,

6202
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:42,200
not knowing for those first years
that there was so many people,

6203
02:57:42,201 --> 02:57:43,130
which meant eight years,

6204
02:57:43,131 --> 02:57:45,860
first eight years that there are so many
people with traumatic to efficiency.

6205
02:57:45,980 --> 02:57:47,300
The brain is very delicate.

6206
02:57:47,301 --> 02:57:48,620
People choose wisely,

6207
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:49,371
be safe,

6208
02:57:49,371 --> 02:57:51,740
be careful and get your
dome checked out right.

6209
02:57:51,770 --> 02:57:52,490
Dot.

6210
02:57:52,490 --> 02:57:54,860
Absolutely dumb checked out folks.

6211
02:57:55,190 --> 02:57:55,821
Thank you everybody.

6212
02:57:55,821 --> 02:57:57,800
Thanks for tuning in and the the website.

6213
02:57:57,801 --> 02:57:58,341
One more time.

6214
02:57:58,341 --> 02:57:59,500
His TBI MED,

6215
02:57:59,501 --> 02:58:02,100
legal.com go and joy.

6216
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:02,920
Thank you.

6217
02:58:02,920 --> 02:58:03,151
It was like,

6218
02:58:03,151 --> 02:58:04,410
you very much appreciate it brother.

6219
02:58:04,420 --> 02:58:05,070
Always good.
