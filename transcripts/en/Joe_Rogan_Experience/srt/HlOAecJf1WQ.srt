1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,890
That's fish bones.

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:05,281
Yeah,

4
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:05,771
the Salton Sea.

5
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:06,510
It's fish bones.

6
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,291
Say what?

7
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:07,401
No.

8
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,610
The salt and sea is not really a set as
the primary cause of the white sand of

9
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,444
Hawaii.

10
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,200
What is it?

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,070
Why are we playing games?

12
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,680
Don't hide it's parrot fish.

13
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,120
Yet really?

14
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,020
We're literally going to
be walking around on white.

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,921
White Sand.

16
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,260
Beaches are made from parrot fish poop.

17
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,390
Oh my God.

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm so pumped that I taught
jewelry and some crazy.

19
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:34,950
That is insane as possible.

20
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,600
That's in that.

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,411
Oh my God.

22
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:40,230
It just shits like crazy things.

23
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,720
Shit.

24
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,553
Sand.

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,010
Oh my God.

26
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,731
It's shit.

27
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:45,330
Sand.

28
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,030
Does that thing eat like a reef.

29
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,511
What is it?

30
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,520
Eating it at a hunting camp.

31
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,590
What is it?

32
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,490
Eat Worms.

33
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,910
Sponges and oysters also produced
Pacific Ocean stand sand,

34
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,931
but no animal.

35
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,820
This is proficient as the parrot fish

36
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,333
stomachs.

37
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:02,850
Damn.

38
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,760
Meals past bypass,

39
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,470
like a gastric bypass or
someone that has lower

40
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,470
producing as much as 840
pounds of sand per year.

41
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,460
Can you imagine if your poor
little asshole had a process yours?

42
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,880
You're a big giant guy of your
poor little asshole process.

43
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,490
Eight hundred and 40 pounds of sand per.

44
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,300
Well,

45
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,260
let's break that down.

46
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,670
How many pounds is that a day?

47
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,150
Because 365 days in a
year and it's what is.

48
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,530
It's more than double that,

49
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,703
right?

50
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,230
Yeah.

51
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,640
What would a 40 pounds.

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,700
So that is more than two pounds of sand
through your asshole every day for a

53
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:41,641
year.

54
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:42,870
That's insanity.

55
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,250
Now that you're a fish.

56
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,390
So think of that.

57
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,590
It's not even a person.

58
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,910
It's a fish.

59
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,320
A little fish.

60
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,420
It's pumping out more than two pounds
of sand through its tiny little asshole

61
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,530
every day.

62
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,420
That's insane.

63
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,950
There's never been a thing like this.

64
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,870
Yeah.

65
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,510
And instead they dig their heels in and
get confirmation bias from all these

66
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:04,344
other people.

67
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,540
And then they formed
these social media groups,

68
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,710
facebook groups,

69
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,910
they go to websites,

70
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,180
they get on web forums and they
started interacting with each other and

71
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,370
exclusively interacted with each other.

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,500
And then also in forcing
each other's beliefs and.

73
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,170
And great job man.

74
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,680
Good job of attacking those shills right?

75
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,380
You know those,

76
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,430
like if you do know,

77
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,960
if you think the earth is round,

78
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,130
you were at globe tarred.

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,870
That's the newest.

80
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,420
Jamie literally like cringed.

81
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:31,730
He took them head.

82
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,990
I had to like step back.

83
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,873
Blink his eyes.

84
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,560
Yeah.

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
You're a globe toward,

86
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:35,850
uh,

87
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,240
that,

88
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,310
that whole thing is because these people,

89
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,610
someone said something that someone wants.

90
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:40,900
Look,

91
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,540
people love to finance secrets.

92
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,200
They love the dinosaur thing is cool
because it seems to be real and suddenly

93
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,550
see the gal that said that,

94
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,000
uh,

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,470
all the fossils were basically people
doing like kind of Michelangelo deal and

96
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:56,600
Chiseling the matter rock because
the fossils came out of rock.

97
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,781
Oh,

98
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,614
you got in?

99
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,960
She actually what?

100
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,670
She has been pretty nice boobs too.

101
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,030
But yeah,

102
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,930
maybe that's why people are listening,

103
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,450
but it's like I've got a platform now.

104
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
You've gotten tits.

105
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,133
No,

106
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,590
it's really good.

107
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,120
I mean,

108
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,530
yeah.

109
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,630
So she's basically like,

110
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:13,961
okay,

111
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,640
so these things come out of rocks.

112
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,230
So these anthropologists,

113
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,120
because there's millions of dollars in
anthropology or archeology there just

114
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,950
chiseling these bones out of rock.

115
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,130
And here we go into her

116
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,810
fossils that are found in the ground.

117
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,650
You don't want to play
games against dinosaurs.

118
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,180
I wouldn't need to play some of this.

119
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,431
Okay.

120
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm a little bit about the
composition and composition,

121
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,850
what they end up being when
everything is said and done.

122
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:43,780
Um,

123
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,440
so,

124
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,501
uh,

125
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,780
fossil,

126
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,763
fossil,

127
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,430
fossil is actually a bone that was once
in the ground that has been filled with

128
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,910
limestone,

129
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,970
calcium and other kinds of stone link
deposits over the course of many,

130
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:10,820
many years left eyes at a
patch of the day looking like,

131
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,823
why is she doing that?

132
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,830
What's your fucking hair
out of your rock this big?

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,740
And you say,

134
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,573
okay,

135
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,020
there's a bunch of fossils.

136
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,500
Can you hand the rock off?

137
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,440
So paleontologist,

138
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,450
the paleontologist takes a little mallet
and they chip away at it and at some

139
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:33,460
point they come out with something
looking like a bomb and this is a problem.

140
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,791
Hold on,

141
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,570
this is a problem.

142
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,403
Just pause that.

143
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,240
The problem is some fucking idiot.

144
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:41,470
Like this gets to talk about a subject
that she's not educated in and no one is

145
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,304
over her shoulder got,

146
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
that's not true.

147
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
That's not true.

148
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,490
It's strange.

149
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,460
You said something that
I want to go back to.

150
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:47,821
Like what,

151
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,210
what do you think feminism is about?

152
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,130
What's his argument about?

153
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:51,964
About equality?

154
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:52,871
I mean,

155
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,260
to me,

156
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,740
feminism was about equality
and I think that this,

157
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:57,070
this,

158
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,430
this,

159
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,641
you know,

160
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm reading more about it
and learning more about it,

161
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,310
so I'm still very ignorant about it,

162
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,420
but there's more third wave,

163
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,470
what they call third wave feminism,

164
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:05,920
which I'm sure is a term you've heard
that seems to be more about a combative

165
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,530
nature to actually,

166
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,431
you know,

167
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,170
instead of like saying like
men and women are equal,

168
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,660
men and women should deserve the same
rights in the same treatment and all those

169
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,050
kinds of things.

170
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,080
It's actually seems to be
very anti man in a way.

171
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,010
Like it seems to be very,

172
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,620
like almost like the tables
have turned and I'm like,

173
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,470
but why are you turning the tables like
we didn't you achieve what you want in

174
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,820
like in the first place,

175
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,780
which was just that we were
going to be here together at the,

176
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,180
at the,

177
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
at the nexus of everything as two genders.

178
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,620
Part of the problem is that
reinforcing that fake statistic,

179
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,370
the gender pay gap that so
many people have heard that,

180
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,650
like Sarah Silverman was just
talking about it recently and some,

181
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,150
some big thing that she did.

182
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,450
I'm like,

183
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,920
that's not true,

184
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,670
but yet people just say it and
no one stops them from Santa.

185
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,161
A friend of mine,

186
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,900
there's was a very educated guy said it.

187
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,340
We were having a debate about,

188
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:51,990
um,

189
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,850
a divorce and he brought
it up and I'm like,

190
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,110
that's not even true.

191
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,010
And unfortunately in a place with no

192
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,970
cell phone reception,

193
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:01,040
so I had to wait until we
got back to send it to them.

194
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,610
Like,

195
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,600
this is not true.

196
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,950
Like what you're saying is not true.

197
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,750
Like you're repeating it as if you know,

198
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,000
but meanwhile you've
done zero research on it.

199
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,200
It's a talking point that just gets
reiterated over and over again without any

200
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,043
research.

201
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,010
And it's convenient.

202
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,750
It's convenient to
reinforce your argument.

203
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,890
It's a number.

204
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,940
It's a number that deals with a
very complex and nuanced debate.

205
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,450
And I think that the idea of
feminism is to me in a lot of ways,

206
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,060
very similar to the idea of
the men's rights movement.

207
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm not opposed to rights for anybody.

208
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,050
I'm not opposed to anyone.

209
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:35,090
I'm very egalitarianism
ideas about the world,

210
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,390
but I am opposed to anybody that likes
one gender over the other because I think

211
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,181
that's foolish.

212
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,580
Just like I'm opposed to people
that only like white people.

213
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,070
I'm to put pose to people
that only like black people.

214
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,220
I'm opposed to people that generalize
based on an enormous mass of human beings.

215
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,180
Like men are shit,

216
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,163
women rule,

217
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,160
girls rule,

218
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,000
boys drool,

219
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,650
you know,

220
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:56,810
I,

221
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,310
I don't like it the other way either.

222
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,420
I don't like it that he man,

223
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,920
woman haters club I don't like.

224
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,690
I don't like any ideologies that lump
people into these huge groups because I

225
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,890
think it's more on think.

226
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,260
I think it's a stupid way
of looking at the world.

227
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,390
But we have started water towers.

228
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,560
So basically we drill a well and then
we have a water tower which turns into a

229
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:19,160
water kiosk where people from
the community come up to it.

230
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,740
They might pay pay five
shillings for Jerry,

231
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,601
so jerry cans,

232
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,320
five gallons,

233
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,310
they pay five cents,

234
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,560
but eventually all the
people in the community,

235
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,760
the one that Rwanda we're doing,

236
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,410
it's going to serve 4,000 people.

237
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,130
It's at a school so the kids will have
clean water all throughout the day,

238
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,360
but then people come there and the
one in Kenya is funding a school,

239
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,940
but the one in Rwanda is going
to fund more water wells.

240
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,550
So as these people by clean water,

241
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,840
the only clean water around there,

242
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,591
that community,

243
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,850
the only thing they have to drink,

244
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:51,851
there's a lake that has the cows and
everything else drinking out of it.

245
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,110
Cow patties are inside the water

246
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,490
and you can see people collecting water
at the same time that cows are drinking

247
00:07:58,491 --> 00:07:59,450
from it right beside them.

248
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,400
People are washing clothes in it,

249
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,720
they're watching motorcycles in it.

250
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,270
Um,

251
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,850
and then that's their drinking water.

252
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,190
And so we're putting up
this water kiosk where yeah,

253
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,370
we're going to charge them five cents
when they get five gallons of clean water,

254
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,400
but those are going to turn it into
multiple water wells throughout the year.

255
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,670
And so we're trying to do all these
sustainable solutions to where after we do

256
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,504
that in Rwanda,

257
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,040
we're taking that to the Congo,

258
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,580
there'll be close to the soa production
facility in the community development

259
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:22,791
center.

260
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,624
We're going to have,

261
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,471
which will have land,

262
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:24,831
water,

263
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,790
food solutions,

264
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,500
um,

265
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,190
even the forestry we felt to replant
over 4,000 trees in the Congo.

266
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:31,971
And it's like,

267
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,080
because of deforestation,

268
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:33,914
so brutal.

269
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,420
So I think it's just
sitting back and saying,

270
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,380
what do you guys need?

271
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,390
Listening and learning
that need and saying,

272
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,871
okay,

273
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:39,704
where can we fit in?

274
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,300
How can we help in this area?

275
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,710
Who is a specialist?

276
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,360
How can we really make an impact?

277
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,000
I think our lane is definitely water.

278
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,930
I mean from that chiefly Omi village
or the story that you just saw,

279
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,180
the bofi where he made
that knife where you,

280
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,523
um,

281
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,090
you can see that water changes everything.

282
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,310
And so that's going to be what hubs,

283
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,241
that's our hub,

284
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:00,590
that's,

285
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,530
that's our lane.

286
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,420
And that's what all of
the water teams are doing.

287
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,341
But in the Congo,

288
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,410
because of the pygmies are so vulnerable,

289
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
we're trying to find the
ways to help them come up.

290
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,230
And as they come up,

291
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,410
other people are watching and looking and
they're starting to implement the same

292
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,010
kind of things.
