1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,110
So 2003 were in Brazil,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,220
giant match.

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,270
Um,

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,160
Eddie beats could start with Dante says,

6
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:11,700
who was a very high level
Jujitsu black belt and a,

7
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,421
he taps him,

8
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,254
he gets his back.

9
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,240
So I saw that you're pumped up,

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,800
you know,

11
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:15,970
you,

12
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,040
you felt very confident,

13
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,020
you felt good and you were,

14
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,650
you know,

15
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,730
you were zoned in,

16
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:25,380
but the idea that you were going to fight
heuler Gracie seemed so crazy to me.

17
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:25,741
It,

18
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,300
this deep knowing what I know about the,

19
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,030
he's knowing what I know about
the history of the family,

20
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,880
knowing what a legendary
family there to see you.

21
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,180
My best friend standing there with Hoya,

22
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,190
Gracie and you guys are about to grapple.

23
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,701
I'm like,

24
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,070
and we're in Brazil like
to this fucking trip.

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,020
I was starstruck.

26
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,340
I was like on some watching
some three d TV or something.

27
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,700
It feels like you're
right there on the mat.

28
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,913
And uh,

29
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,540
Eddie wound up catching him in a triangle.

30
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,730
It was the craziest fucking
thing I've ever seen in my life.

31
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,151
And,

32
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:57,720
uh,

33
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,330
it was like time stopped and he's like,

34
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,130
when you slapped that triangle on them,

35
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,020
it seemed like time stopped.

36
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,760
It didn't even seem real and you kept,

37
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,440
you kept jailbreaking man,

38
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,810
which is why it was hilarious.

39
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,430
That dexterity that you have with your
legs and you're setting up this alma plot

40
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:15,264
to here

41
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,463
and um,

42
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,320
you got him in like full
full rubber guard here.

43
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,011
Yeah.

44
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,440
That mission control is at the
beginning of the rubber guard,

45
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:23,541
right?

46
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:23,670
Yeah.

47
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,100
You,

48
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,430
what you had then was the
ability to control people.

49
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,320
You just didn't have as many
variations on technique to attack with,

50
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,070
but you had this unbelievable fucking
flexibility that a lot of people aren't

51
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:33,904
aware of.

52
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,890
You got some weird flexibility and not
just flexibility but dexterity like in

53
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,270
places that maybe some people
can grab their leg and put it,

54
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,220
you could put your leg there on its own,

55
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,590
but there's so many guys that are out
there that w it's not that weird of

56
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,251
flexibility.

57
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:56,251
It's just getting into load is like if
you got into yoga and you've got obsessed

58
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:57,190
with it,

59
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,260
eventually two years,

60
00:01:59,261 --> 00:01:59,741
three years,

61
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:00,221
five years,

62
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,580
you'd have to be able to get into
the very basic lotus position.

63
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,270
Yes.

64
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,410
There's a little more than that fell.

65
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,244
Are you being nice?

66
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:06,860
You know,

67
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,660
it's what it is.

68
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,471
I know what you're saying,

69
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,080
but the reality is you
got some crazy legs,

70
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,250
something weird about your legs.

71
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,780
Your legs are like arms.

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,130
They move in strange ways,

73
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,410
right?

74
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,030
Hairs.

75
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,240
If he didn't try to pass right there
and if we had just stayed in my guard,

76
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,720
I wouldn't have gotten them this
one and a half and this transition.

77
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,943
Oh

78
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,330
yeah.

79
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,500
He got aggressive and he
shouldn't have got aggressive.

80
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:30,070
He,

81
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,690
if he would've just been conservative,

82
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,940
I wouldn't have been
able to go right here.

83
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,100
Right into the triangle,

84
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,270
boom over hook.

85
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,121
Oh,

86
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:40,911
John Jack right there.

87
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:41,440
That's all Jay.

88
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,340
You control that wrist
and slapped it over.

89
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:48,170
And now this right here where you
had the triangle locked in once here,

90
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,831
like right there,

91
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,161
I was like,

92
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,030
Holy Shit.

93
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,150
Because before it was like one of
those things where you're not breathing

94
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,650
because it's not totally locked in,

95
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,990
but once you had it
locked behind the knee,

96
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
I was looking at,

97
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,200
I was like,

98
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,350
how is this guy going to
survive and he's tapping.

99
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,911
I was like,

100
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,650
he can't survive like no one can.

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,030
It's a human being.

102
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,410
When you have a guy your size and
you slap a triangle on this tight.

103
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,191
See right here.

104
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,660
I wasn't sure Pam there.

105
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,000
I knew like when once he
dropped down I was like,

106
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,500
holy shit that's locked in.

107
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,450
You were screaming,

108
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,741
oh my God.

109
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,800
And we were the only one screaming
because everybody else was freaking out.

110
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,080
This Brazilian TV station,

111
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,190
it's set up cameras there.

112
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:31,000
They shut down the other matches so they
could better light this match because

113
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,521
Hoya Gray,

114
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:32,830
she's a hero and they,

115
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:37,570
they were going to show boiler Gracie
dominating the first time Abu Dhabi came

116
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,440
to Sao Paulo.

117
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,330
When you slap this triangle on them,

118
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,600
dude,

119
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,630
all you heard was me and Jamie Walsh.

120
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,300
Me and Jamie Walsh are yelling out,

121
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:46,991
pull the head,

122
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:47,860
pull the head.

123
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,300
Oh my God.

124
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,051
Oh my God.

125
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,700
It was just madness.

126
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,450
Like,

127
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,141
Oh shit,

128
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,860
what?

129
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,150
We couldn't even believe it.

130
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,620
And then once you did pull
the head and once he did tap,

131
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,110
it was like the world froze.

132
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,190
It was weird.

133
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,023
It was like a,

134
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,003
it didn't make sense.

135
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,700
The world just became some new place.

136
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,350
The world is a totally
new element opened up.

137
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,850
Like the world became a new place.

138
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,080
Now all of a sudden Eddie Bravo
is a champion martial artist.

139
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,580
Well I didn't win the championship.

140
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,270
It doesn't matter.

141
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,820
You just tap toilet Gracie like you're,

142
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:22,270
you're capable of tapping oil and grease.

143
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,800
That's championship level shit.

144
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,170
He tapped one of the
greatest guys of all time.

145
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,220
It was,

146
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,020
it was a whole new world opened up.

147
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,610
It was just all of a sudden it was like,

148
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,480
Whoa,

149
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,890
this is weird.

150
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,140
It was weird.

151
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,250
It was weird to watch too,

152
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:36,461
man.

153
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:36,730
Cause I'm,

154
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,191
when I met you,

155
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:38,024
you're a purple belt.

156
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:38,950
You know,

157
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,240
you were really good prep belt,

158
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,771
weird,

159
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:41,880
crazy moves and shit.

160
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,430
And then um,

161
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,490
all of a sudden you're a brown belt
and you were brown belt and Abu Dhabi,

162
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,090
Bro.

163
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,923
That's crazy.

164
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,640
You tap them when you were a brown belt.

165
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,150
So 11 long years go by and this
Saturday night they had a rematch.

166
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,320
Um,

167
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,410
Eddie and boiler had a rematch
and metamorris and that's
what we were talking to

168
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,610
Hallett Gracie about on the phone.

169
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,700
They're promoting these professional
Jiu Jitsu matches and uh,

170
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,563
it's awesome.

171
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,710
Uh,

172
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,820
Keenan Cornelius,

173
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,811
a fod,

174
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,510
um,

175
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,860
uh,

176
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,730
Kevin Casey,

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,220
Kevin Casey took Yuppie.

178
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,390
I'll just describe the whole event.

179
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,310
Um,

180
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,190
a lot of really,

181
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,300
really high level fighters.

182
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:23,250
Fought a lot of really good a Jujitsu
fighters fought and the main event was

183
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,990
Eddie versus Hoya,

184
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,220
Gracie and,

185
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,840
uh,

186
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,990
11 years running.

187
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:28,530
I mean,

188
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,180
it's a long time in between
matches and there was so much talk,

189
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,720
so much,

190
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,890
so many haters,

191
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,570
so many believers,

192
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,051
so many.

193
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:37,321
I mean,

194
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,380
there's so much back and forth between,

195
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,161
you know,

196
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:44,640
the people that thought that Eddie
winning the first time was a fluke and the

197
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:49,641
people that legitimately thought that
Eddie has a brilliant mind and a creative

198
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,060
mind for Jujitsu,

199
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,650
that's really unique.

200
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,240
And he can come up with a lot
of techniques and his deck,

201
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,861
like he's talking,

202
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,700
he doesn't want to admit he's
got weird dexterity in his legs,

203
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,220
but he can move his legs in weird ways.

204
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,300
He can wrap you up and
triangles and stuff and,

205
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:07,160
and weird ways without a lot of people
have to grab their foot and place in

206
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,850
places.

207
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,450
Um,

208
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,430
so he has these techniques that he's
developed and like really created a bunch

209
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,110
of paths like been,

210
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,700
and a lot of Jujitsu guys do this,

211
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,630
this is not unique.

212
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,680
Um,

213
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,680
but his past where uniquely his and
that he came up with a lot of different

214
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:28,160
techniques and approaches and refined
a lot of other approaches that,

215
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:31,430
so he sort of adopted
or adapted to Jujitsu.

216
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,500
And um,

217
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,040
the system in 2003 was really,

218
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,770
I'm not even a 10th of what it is now.

219
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,220
Um,

220
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,690
after 2003,

221
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Eddie started teaching
and then it became crazy.

222
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:49,721
Then the system started growing and new
techniques were added and that there

223
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,710
became guys like to any provost who's a,

224
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:57,711
a a world champion as a brown belt guys
came out of there that we're showing

225
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,151
that your,

226
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:03,260
your techniques weren't just for you and
your crazy dexterity but you had broken

227
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:06,800
down things in a way that you know,

228
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,000
uh,

229
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,080
other people hadn't done
before and a weird way your,

230
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:09,380
your,

231
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,550
your positions,

232
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,690
your very unique.

233
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,940
And um,

234
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,430
there was a lot of people that do want
to accept that for whatever reason.

235
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,510
And there was all this,

236
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,721
oh,

237
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:18,351
he got lucky,

238
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,011
all fluke,

239
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,844
all this.

240
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,600
So Saturday night rolls around and
I couldn't imagine there being more

241
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,730
anticipation in a room before something.

242
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,120
And it was a cool anticipation too
because one of the things I like about

243
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,150
Jujitsu is no one's going
to get knocked the fuck out.

244
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,920
Even if you get choked out,

245
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:34,940
you know,

246
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,670
there's something about
like seeing a friend fight.

247
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,170
It gets real rough.

248
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,820
I mean we've been friends
with MMA fighters,

249
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,890
but I've never been as
friendly with an MMA fighters.

250
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:43,511
I am with you,

251
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:44,344
you know I've,

252
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,501
but no one,

253
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,750
a guy and liking a guy and then
watched him get head kicked.

254
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,913
It's hard to do,

255
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,401
you know,

256
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,590
so it didn't have the date that,

257
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:52,580
that aspect to it,

258
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,520
but it was all positive
is what I'm trying to say.

259
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,530
It was all just holy shit,

260
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,364
it's going down.

261
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,523
Um,

262
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,850
and once it did,

263
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,210
there was no points because
it's a 20 minute match.

264
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,510
So for 20 minutes it's either
submission or no points,

265
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,470
but in that 20 minutes you
swept him on multiple occasions.

266
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,940
You've got side control.

267
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,400
He never threatened you in any way,

268
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,300
shape or form.

269
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,430
You swept in with electric chairs.

270
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,510
You threatened him with a neck crank
and you threatened him with this nasty

271
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,070
fucking submission move on his knee.

272
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,450
Which I don't,

273
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:26,841
you know,

274
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,110
I don't know how he didn't tap
cause that was hard to watch,

275
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:30,351
man,

276
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:31,610
when we were sitting there watching.

277
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,391
That was the move.

278
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,350
I got you on the high time.

279
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,213
Yes.

280
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,730
That movie's so painful.

281
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,080
Just that photo shoot,

282
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,190
that shit hurt,

283
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,550
man.

284
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,570
It hurts.

285
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,670
And somehow or another,

286
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,520
a heuler just mean,

287
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:45,741
look,

288
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,461
he's a warrior.

289
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:46,820
He just,

290
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,750
he didn't want to tap.

291
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,970
He just decided he wasn't going to tap.

292
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,230
Um,

293
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,520
for people who,

294
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,210
um,

295
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,800
have never seen Jujitsu before,

296
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,070
um,

297
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
that was like the perfect introduction
match because it was so exciting.

298
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,090
There was so much madness and there
was a bunch of times where you were,

299
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:06,570
uh,

300
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,290
you were working on shit and he rolled
you over onto your back and then he swept

301
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,070
him again.

302
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,650
So there's all these like
seesaws when he would roll,

303
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:14,341
you'd be on your back.

304
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:14,471
Oh,

305
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,270
she has back.

306
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,720
But you on your back is different than
a lot of people on your back because

307
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,280
that's how he tapped
him in the first fight.

308
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,450
You tapped him from your back.

309
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,284
Your back is,

310
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,591
you know,

311
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:22,881
your,

312
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,120
your card is crafty.

313
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,303
So it was,

314
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,300
it was an incredibly thrilling match
because there was constant threat at all

315
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,134
times.

316
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,820
And even from him,

317
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:33,091
man,

318
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:33,840
he's still oily.

319
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,673
Gracie,

320
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,670
you always knew.

321
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,031
I mean,

322
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,260
he's still that champion.

323
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,370
If something went wrong,

324
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,760
if you didn't dot your
i's and cross your t's,

325
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,570
Ellis,

326
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,950
not sure I was going to win this fight.

327
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,010
How could you be sure he's fucking crazy.

328
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,630
I mean,

329
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,790
he's soiler fucking Gracie.

330
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,690
I never said that.

331
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,490
I'm going to go out there
and just strangle them.

332
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,353
I was just,

333
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,290
I didn't know.

334
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,490
I hadn't competed in so long.

335
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:53,911
Look right here,

336
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm faking like I'm going to wrestle

337
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
because I didn't think he was just going
to let me pull them into quarter guard.

338
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,670
I thought at this point my wow.

339
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,420
He just thought he was just going
to try some totally different ship,

340
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,740
but this is what he always does.

341
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,780
Every morning before I work out,

342
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,820
I warm up on the stair master.

343
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,140
I go to youtube,

344
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,950
but Heuler ADCC pick one of his
matches and that's how I get,

345
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,180
that gives me all the motivation.

346
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,720
I just watch him roll
and he's so good at this,

347
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,590
but I thought he would try to pass
to the other side and I thought this

348
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,424
position,

349
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,970
I thought this position was going to be
the hardest to get and this was the key.

350
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,640
If I could just get quarter
guard in this position,

351
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,320
I felt like I could get them

352
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,180
and was a bunch of crazy rules.

353
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,320
In this match as well.

354
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,610
One of the rules was that boiler was
wearing like these skin tight shorts.

355
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,440
Eddie was wearing Gucci Pants.

356
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,520
Um,

357
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,180
and Heuler was allowed to grab Eddie's
ski pants but Eddie wasn't allowed to

358
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,260
grab toilet shorts.

359
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
So it was weird to watch man.

360
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,760
Cause there's times where he's like
giving you a Wedgie and pulling on your

361
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:54,370
pants.

362
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:54,581
Yeah.

363
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,200
He's pulling them down and
could see my underwear.

364
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,710
Yeah.

365
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,450
And when

366
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,500
and when he got to that a leg lock and
he's trying to defend that leg lock and

367
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,450
you're tearing his knee apart
and he's hanging onto your,

368
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:05,150
your cough.

369
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,870
It's saved him.

370
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,740
The pat saved him.

371
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,350
Yeah.

372
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,600
Cause he didn't have the pants.

373
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,300
I would have stomped on that foot
and got the extra power because he,

374
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:11,930
oh,

375
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,030
I mean a man,

376
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,510
his,

377
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,940
I think his knee popped
at least seven times.

378
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,983
We were talking.

379
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm like,

380
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
we could stop this now.

381
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,120
You sure?

382
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,331
He goes,

383
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:20,511
no,

384
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm fine.

385
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,861
And I'm popping.

386
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:22,101
I'm like,

387
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:22,934
what about that?

388
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,983
Cause I'm fine.

389
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,471
I'm like,

390
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,000
it just kept popping on my damn.

391
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,590
Well you sure cause everything's good.

392
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:27,771
I said,

393
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,604
everything's fine.

394
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,950
Like we're talking
throughout this whole match,

395
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:31,641
like right here.

396
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,810
He wanted the under up really,

397
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:33,470
really bad.

398
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,600
So I was saying it's
hard to get this time.

399
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:35,900
Huh?

400
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,600
Cause the first time
he got the under under,

401
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm a lot of work cause that's a hard one.

402
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,110
It's only because I would rather go
against a guy who wasn't really mad at me.

403
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,830
If I could joke with you and get like a,

404
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,140
like this is just for fun.

405
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,550
Right,

406
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:51,720
right.

407
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,550
Then I feel like,

408
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,383
okay,

409
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,680
I can get this guy now because I
could win because he's not mad.

410
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,913
He's mad.

411
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,541
Oh Shit.

412
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,480
Like I would never want to find like a
Diego Sanchez type guy was mad at me.

413
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:01,661
I'm like,

414
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,081
oh no,

415
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:02,231
no,

416
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:02,620
no.

417
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,600
I want to find a guy that's
like friendly and shit.

418
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,113
Hilarious.

419
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,630
We were,

420
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,580
I was just constantly
joking with them constantly.

421
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,540
And uh,

422
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,290
during like after I swept and when I
get on top and the electric turn them,

423
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:16,491
hold him,

424
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:16,661
I go,

425
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,411
you can't move from here.

426
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,820
So just hang on and relax.

427
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,640
I need about a minute to rust and I go,

428
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,510
you can't do nothing.

429
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,344
Just relax.

430
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,230
Because there are some
positions where there,

431
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,071
I don't know,

432
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,440
maybe three or four positions
are like cradles there,

433
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,430
like rustling cradles.

434
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,940
And it happens here where the guy on
the bottom just can't do anything.

435
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,650
He's not getting tapped but he can't move.

436
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:41,530
He's to completely wrapped up
and I used those spots to rest.

437
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,401
So,

438
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,120
uh,

439
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,550
but it's hilarious that you told,

440
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:44,681
oh,

441
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,610
just relax.

442
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,071
When me and John,

443
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,970
Jack Russel,

444
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,240
we are always talking smack to each other.

445
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,231
Me and John.

446
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,030
John always goof and we're,

447
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:55,511
oh,

448
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,680
it's always a joke.

449
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,513
It's always,

450
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,170
always me and Sean.

451
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,570
It's like a thing we do and I do it.

452
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,860
There's certain guys that I
roll with that I do that too.

453
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,440
I don't like to do it too much to my
students because then it seems like,

454
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,100
um,

455
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,780
acting all arrogant against a guy that I,

456
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,911
he's one of my students,

457
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:11,230
he's a blue belt or a white belt.

458
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,470
Right.

459
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,730
I'm not,

460
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,410
that would look really
douchey but playful.

461
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,010
But because John Jack can
smash me anytime he wants.

462
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,710
I talk like I pretend like I'm arrogant
cause it's funny because he didn't do

463
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,544
anything you want.

464
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,680
So no matter how Douchey I get,

465
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,620
we know it's just doesn't make
any sense cause he's killing me.

466
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,053
But um,

467
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,530
uh,

468
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,460
so same thing here.

469
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:35,560
I have so much respect for him that,

470
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,740
that I feel like I could just joke around
with them and I don't want him to be

471
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:39,460
mad at me.

472
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,120
Well that's good.

473
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,620
That's a good attitude to have man.

474
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,920
Especially after 11 years
between the matches.

475
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:45,700
Um,

476
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,630
it's cool that you,

477
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:46,900
uh,

478
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,300
you kept that feeling and you
were completely destroyed,

479
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,560
completely respectful,

480
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,341
rather uh,

481
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,860
the entire way up to the promotion of it.

482
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:54,071
Your,

483
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,060
your opinion of him,

484
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:55,271
you know,

485
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:55,870
you were,

486
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,430
you were like praising what a legend he
is and you were very self deprecating

487
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:03,330
about your first victory to um,

488
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,430
this was a 20 minute match and
because there was no submission,

489
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:06,730
uh,

490
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,361
it's a draw.

491
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,400
Metamorris is doing a
unique thing and they,

492
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,130
I don't know if they've got the rules
totally ironed out where they want him to

493
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:12,401
yet,

494
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,234
but what the,

495
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,360
what they're trying to do is
discourage people from point fighting.

496
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,840
And what that means is work
towards submission at all times.

497
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:22,240
And you may get a submission and
you may not get a submission,

498
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,670
but the,

499
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,040
the idea is you're,

500
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,000
you're seeing real Jujitsu here
and they've accomplished that.

501
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,340
Like everyone was going for submissions,

502
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:33,370
whether it was Guy Mendez or
half a Mendez or you know,

503
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,211
Kenan Cornelia's,

504
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,250
everyone was going for submissions.

505
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:36,730
Um,

506
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,110
sometimes they didn't get them,

507
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,310
but it was really exciting because of
that because guys couldn't just sort of

508
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,500
wrestle to a certain
position and then hold.

509
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,820
Um,

510
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,610
but if this was a scored match,

511
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,990
you would have beat them handily.

512
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,441
I mean,

513
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,740
you swept him times,

514
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,220
you get side

515
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,010
control on them and you
had two near submissions.

516
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:58,490
This is where he gets the under the crowd
goes nuts because he has been fighting

517
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:01,220
for the under hook for five
minutes and he finally gets it.

518
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,650
And this is the position that
we're in and our first match.

519
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,680
So all the grades,

520
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:05,001
there's like,

521
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,450
yes,

522
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,410
he got the undercut so technical
that he finally got it.

523
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,600
And I still have them
in quarter guard here.

524
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:14,120
So I was a little worried,

525
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,340
but you see what I'm
doing with my right hand.

526
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm going under the knee right here.

527
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,270
I never really do that and I
was keeping him from going,

528
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:21,110
no hand pass.

529
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,700
So I'm like,

530
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,461
oh okay cool.

531
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,330
This is nice.

532
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,120
He can't go no ham pass cause I'm
holding his leg out and like that.

533
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,710
And I've never really done that before.

534
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:28,461
This is the first time,

535
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,080
it's crazy.

536
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
You see how I got my left hand?

537
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,521
She can't go.

538
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,301
No hand pass.

539
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,710
I'm holding open his legs.

540
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,700
So I felt comfortable even though
I didn't have the under hook,

541
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,620
I just had to somehow get a lockdown.

542
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:41,330
So for my people,

543
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:41,961
they know,

544
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,880
they see me fighting like this.

545
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:46,070
All this is every day in the gym.

546
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:46,910
This is how it looks.

547
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,560
I start in this position,

548
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,670
this is how it looks.

549
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,560
So to the Gracie side,

550
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,200
they probably thought he
was a winning right here,

551
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,620
right?

552
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,880
My mom was freaking out.

553
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,620
My mom thought he was killing me.

554
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,610
This at this moment.

555
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:02,630
You got the lockdown somewhere in here
you got the lockdown and when you got the

556
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:03,464
lockdown here,

557
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,300
the crowd went fucking crazy.

558
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,441
That was crazy.

559
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,221
I get the lock down.

560
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:08,240
My guys go nuts.

561
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,440
He gets the under hook.

562
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,370
His crowd goes nuts.

563
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,210
I get the lock down.

564
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,150
My crowd goes nuts that it was so crazy.

565
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,530
The lockdowns way bigger though.

566
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,070
The the what?

567
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,400
What?

568
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,120
For folks who don't know the lockdown,

569
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,700
when you got a guy who's really good
at it and he has you in half guard and

570
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,490
slaps it on your legs in jeopardy,

571
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,290
you might tear your fucking knee.

572
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,640
You're getting manipulated.

573
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,110
You've got two legs against one,

574
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,670
and when a guy's really good at it,

575
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,504
a guy like Eddie,

576
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,270
when they're really good at it and
they have two legs against one,

577
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,420
it puts you in a precarious
position and it's,

578
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,770
it makes you vulnerable to
a lot of different sweeps
and here you're flipping a

579
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:41,931
coin.

580
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:42,560
Of course,

581
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
that's when the crowd went nuts.

582
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,530
We'll dude,

583
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:44,770
you're,

584
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,050
you're,

585
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,690
you've got his leg in a
mangled position here.

586
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,400
There's electric chair right here.

587
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,440
I didn't think this was the plan.

588
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,330
The plan was exactly what happened.

589
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,320
That was the plan.

590
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,070
I was going to go,

591
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,160
just do what I do at the gym every night.

592
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,950
This is exactly what I do every night.

593
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:01,790
This is nothing new.

594
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,950
It wasn't a special strategy for boiler.

595
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,930
So that was John jocks.

596
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:10,190
Whole plan is to get me
to do what I normally do.

597
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,211
The Best Shit.

598
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:16,211
I'm at a dude out there on him and
then he reversed you for a second.

599
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,810
I didn't have the leg on my shoulders,

600
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,920
so I go let us go back and
through them and get it.

601
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:22,970
So it looked like he swept me.

602
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:26,540
But I went back to put that leg back on
my shoulder and I went rock right back

603
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,374
up.

604
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,260
I do it all the time,

605
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:30,921
you know?

606
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,420
So now I'm in a position,

607
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,420
this is where you rocked it with momentum
cause you had full control over that

608
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:35,970
leg.

609
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,340
It just wasn't on my shoulder.

610
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,720
I had to go back and scoop it up.

611
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,290
So now I'm on top and now I'm on a,

612
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm in the electric chair on top and
this is where I'm talking to him.

613
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm like,

614
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,140
you can't do anything here.

615
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:45,830
Just relax.

616
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,760
This is where I rest.

617
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,660
I went through a lot of explosion and
I right here I have control of this and

618
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,420
that's why he was doing that thing with
his hands because people would want it.

619
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,020
Like why is he throwing
his hands up in the air?

620
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,741
Like you know,

621
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,170
like he did that a couple of times
when you got him into side control.

622
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,110
He did that and then I pass
the guard pool in right here.

623
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,220
I'm,

624
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm still,

625
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,910
he's still stuck.

626
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:03,840
I got him in a cradle.

627
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,840
But that makes sense now because everybody
wondered why he was doing that with

628
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,291
his hands.

629
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:07,621
People are like,

630
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:07,780
oh,

631
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,613
heuler was complaining.

632
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:08,971
No,

633
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,710
he's complaining because you
were talking shit to him.

634
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,280
You're saying you're stuck here.

635
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:12,841
Don't,

636
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,660
don't move.

637
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,260
He was saying,

638
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,061
I can't do nothing.

639
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,710
He's holding me like,

640
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,610
this is Jujitsu.

641
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,331
We're holding,

642
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,164
we're square,

643
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,940
we're clenching and squeezing.

644
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,230
Right.

645
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,450
You know,

646
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,190
and he's all like,

647
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,520
how could he complain about that?

648
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,780
He's totally a mobile here.

649
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
Even though I pass,

650
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,551
I pass,

651
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,650
I let go the lockdown
and passed his guard.

652
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,760
The reason why the past was guaranteed
is because of the control I have on his

653
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,041
leg.

654
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,560
I have a head and arm and the leg.

655
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,760
So that pass was easy.

656
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,490
As soon as I let go,

657
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,180
the lockdown didn't want to let
it go until I rest a little bit.

658
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,480
And then finally I let go the leg
last and now I'm in side control.

659
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,860
And here's the big transition.

660
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,270
I thought he was going to turn into me,

661
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,410
but he turns away.

662
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,040
So I'm like,

663
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,161
Ooh,

664
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,060
that's even easier.

665
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,920
But he's rolling in a nice way,

666
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,530
but I had to turn it into 100% here.

667
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,670
So this is halfway.

668
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,260
This is a neck crank that I do to
get the guy to give me his back.

669
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:02,850
So I'm net cranking them here and if
he pulls his left arm all the way out,

670
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,630
um,

671
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,000
I usually transition to the back
and that's what he did right there.

672
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:08,460
So now I'm getting up and
his left arms free now.

673
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,750
So all I gotta do is get up on my right
knee and then swirled in the back.

674
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,100
That's what I'm going to do here.

675
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,510
I wanted the twister.

676
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,403
That was the plan.

677
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,000
The plan was to get them in a twister,

678
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:21,390
but he did a really good job
of just shrugging me off.

679
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,040
So now I gotta start over again.

680
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,500
So at this point I'm thinking
this is what I'm really thinking.

681
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,340
Um,

682
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,340
I thought the most important thing is
for me is to go out there and not get

683
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,580
smoked and not get tapped
in 20 seconds or 30 seconds.

684
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:36,414
Cause that would be,

685
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,620
that would crush me.

686
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,570
I would be the worst possible thing.

687
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,250
So let's make sure that doesn't happen.

688
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,810
And if I lose,

689
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,673
if I tap,

690
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,440
at least let me go out there and give,

691
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,610
we have 20 minutes.

692
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,990
Let's see some good 10 plan,

693
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:51,950
a technique from my people just to
show that it works if he taps it.

694
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,570
So at this point I'm thinking
I did so much to them,

695
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:54,781
right.

696
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,690
That textbook 10 planet
shit all the way through.

697
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,150
Note for note that I thought
if the worst case scenario,

698
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,390
if he taps me on one second,

699
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,480
at least I got some good shit in my mind,

700
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,171
in my mind,

701
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,800
cause that's how much
respect I have for right.

702
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,241
I'm like,

703
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,170
she could still get me,

704
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:10,861
I'm not over.

705
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,450
We got 13 minutes.

706
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,550
So in my mind I already won.

707
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,211
I go,

708
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:15,780
I won.

709
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,480
So when you think that way and you're,

710
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,060
I thought I already did all this shit.

711
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,230
So the worst case scenario,

712
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:22,681
he tasks.

713
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,210
Now I did a good job.

714
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,960
So for some reason that made me
just want to attack a more and go,

715
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
let's just keep putting this,

716
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,000
just keep piling it up.

717
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,863
Oh here's another one,

718
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,261
Dan,

719
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:32,220
and see if I could do another one.

720
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,270
Oh here's another one.

721
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,631
And the,

722
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,251
I just change.

723
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:34,531
Should I go?

724
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:35,220
Damn,

725
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm not going to go for a twister.

726
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,190
I'm going to go for a vaporizer.

727
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,350
So when I,

728
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,820
when I get them in an electric chair,

729
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,611
he doesn't tap.

730
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,990
When I test this flexibility,

731
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,250
if they don't tap,

732
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,620
I can just sweep them and get on
top and set them up for a twister.

733
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,520
Which I already tried,

734
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,690
but I made the decision.

735
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:49,931
I go,

736
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:50,560
you know what?

737
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,393
There's a lot.

738
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,320
He's pretty good at
shaking me off the back.

739
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,930
If I just go to the vaporizer,

740
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,070
it'll logistics schools,

741
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:57,904
the twister,

742
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,660
and I do it all the time
and that's good enough.

743
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,560
So that was the plan.

744
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:02,771
I go,

745
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,330
he's not stopping the electric chair,

746
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,010
so I'm a go back and get another another.

747
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,600
I thought about rubber guard for a second,

748
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:07,811
third,

749
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:08,201
and I thought,

750
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:08,800
you know what?

751
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,850
You see how he got the under hood?

752
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,440
You see that I went,

753
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,630
rubber guard locked down,

754
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:14,200
whipped him.

755
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,011
He had the under hook,

756
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:16,090
but that whip boom,

757
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,260
I sucked and wham Bam.

758
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,180
That's a little whipped down Combo,

759
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,280
a very important combo to master.

760
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,420
And now I got the under it.

761
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:25,910
So I thought he's not stopping
the electric car tonight
because if he would have

762
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:26,590
been able to,

763
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,750
he can I,

764
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,770
I'm able to do electric chairs easy.

765
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,990
So I knew I could just go back
and more money in the bank.

766
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,280
I knew he couldn't stop it.

767
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,510
He just was perplexed here.

768
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,111
So I go,

769
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:35,511
you know what,

770
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm,

771
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,010
I got to go to the vaporizer.

772
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:37,571
I that,

773
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:42,571
which means I got to get his leg over
to my left shoulder on the other side.

774
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,110
I need to get my head.

775
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:44,710
I want me,

776
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,550
I just need to squash his
leg down and get on top in a,

777
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,150
uh,

778
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,590
leg drag type position,

779
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:54,310
but a leg drag with a
lockdown to maintain control.

780
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,550
So right now I'd go back to the electric
chair for the third or fourth time,

781
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,650
and I was really confident at this point.

782
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,070
I just knew he wasn't going to tap from
the electric chair and I didn't want to

783
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,170
pass this guard to get on
top and try the twister.

784
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,370
I already made the decision.

785
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,200
So for folks who don't know
what we're talking about here,

786
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,470
the electric chair is a move where you've
got a guy literally in a full split

787
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:13,840
and you're controlling his
bottom leg and the other leg,

788
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,290
you're,

789
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,940
you're forcing it up towards his head.

790
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,360
Most people don't have the flexibility
to tolerate it and a lot of times they

791
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:20,200
tap just from that.

792
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,580
You're like literally ripping their crotch

793
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,513
part.

794
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,581
Yeah.

795
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:24,570
And and right here,

796
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,650
you know what I didn't get,

797
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,330
I didn't get the position I wanted,

798
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:31,980
so I'm letting him get on
top so I can set it up again.

799
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:32,161
I go,

800
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,060
he cannot stop it.

801
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,500
He can't stop my under hugs.

802
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,600
I already knew I had
him beat on the inside.

803
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,291
So I'm going to,

804
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,780
I'm going to set it up again
and go back to the cause.

805
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:41,070
I wanted the vaporizer.

806
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:42,240
He foiled to vaporize.

807
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,290
I lost control of his leg,

808
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,030
so I got to start over again.

809
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,710
So all of these times where he's on top,

810
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:50,200
where the artists I called the
tide has shifted back and forth.

811
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,690
This was just you resetting

812
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,220
did he could not stop my half guard game.

813
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:54,720
I've just,

814
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,940
the confidence just kept
growing and growing.

815
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,390
So even though he has the under a,

816
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,891
I go watch,

817
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,030
I'm going to get the under hook back.

818
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,950
I was already getting it back.

819
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:03,930
There's no way you could stop it.

820
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,600
Right?

821
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,760
I see that boom whip down.

822
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:06,150
I go,

823
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,140
I'm just going to keep doing it.

824
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:07,974
He can't stop it.

825
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,030
So,

826
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,980
and then I'm going to start all over.

827
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:12,270
I know he's not going to be able to,

828
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,250
he's not going to shake the lockdown.

829
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,570
The lockdown is too strong.

830
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,670
He was never close to
ever getting his leg out.

831
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,470
I was so confident at this point
I was getting a little gas and um,

832
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,670
I knew I could recover.

833
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,290
All I need is like a little time.

834
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:25,850
So,

835
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,370
um,

836
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,203
um,

837
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,110
to,

838
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,740
to uh,

839
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,740
hide the gaseous or the gas in is the
fact that he hasn't stopped breathing.

840
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,510
I'm dying inside,

841
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:37,560
but I would stop breathing.

842
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,400
You know,

843
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,810
like when Jason Walks into your house
and you're in the closet and you're like,

844
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,333
but then you go,

845
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,620
yeah,

846
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,150
I was doing that just
so he wouldn't smell.

847
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,140
Now I did it again.

848
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,980
I knew I could do it again.

849
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:50,930
Now I've got to get his
leg to the other side.

850
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,910
I don't look at it at sea.

851
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm holding onto his leg.

852
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,700
I needed to get it to the
other side of my body.

853
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,511
Right?

854
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,080
So I'm like,

855
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,531
you know what?

856
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:57,741
Damn,

857
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,521
I lost it again.

858
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:58,820
Let me,

859
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,780
let me do it again.

860
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,763
So look at that.

861
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,151
He'll be doing it again.

862
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,140
They thought he reversed me.

863
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:03,441
But I go,

864
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm just setting it up now.

865
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,660
I've got the leg over right there.

866
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,494
Boom.

867
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,700
That's where I want to be.

868
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,590
That's the transition right there.

869
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,120
And I go,

870
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,191
well,

871
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,024
I'm going to go after it.

872
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,680
Like I thought about
it for a second there,

873
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:12,981
but I go,

874
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:13,250
no,

875
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,030
you know what?

876
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,750
I'm going to roll.

877
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,100
I can't just reach back for it.

878
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:17,390
I got to have set it up.

879
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,530
I'm going to set it up right here.

880
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:19,251
Squash them down.

881
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,180
I thought about it again,

882
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,520
but then he stopped it
right there and I go,

883
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:22,731
okay,

884
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:23,870
let me set it up differently.

885
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,870
But then we got broke up here and
this is where all the controversial,

886
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,790
what the hell was going on here.

887
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,360
I knew what position we
were in top stoner control,

888
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,590
right.

889
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,291
I knew the position.

890
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,250
I'm there all the time.

891
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,050
He had no idea what I was doing.

892
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,471
So,

893
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:37,370
and he didn't know that.

894
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:37,940
I knew.

895
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,320
He thought it was just some crazy,

896
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,250
weird position.

897
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,443
And uh,

898
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,100
he didn't know where he was.

899
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:43,701
And,

900
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:43,751
uh,

901
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:44,210
I was,

902
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,620
I would say I pulled guard right here
and I was going to say here like gimme

903
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,061
your leg,

904
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:47,750
let me throw it over.

905
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,210
I'm going to get on top and we're going
to go back and I show you exactly the

906
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:50,870
whole thing.

907
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,770
I was going to show it.

908
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,510
I was going to do it from the top.

909
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:53,751
See,

910
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:57,980
I'm trying to do it from step one and
then I was going to take them over and I

911
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:01,340
was showing him the sweep instead
of just getting in the position.

912
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,320
He's all confused.

913
00:25:02,321 --> 00:25:03,260
He don't know what's going on.

914
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,243
I'm trying to,

915
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,491
I go,

916
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:07,210
you got to get your leg over it.

917
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,910
He's not,

918
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,020
he keeps refusing.

919
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,500
I'm like,

920
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:09,861
man,

921
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,020
he's not letting me get
in the position and look.

922
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,381
He's like,

923
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:12,621
no,

924
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:12,831
no,

925
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:13,430
no.

926
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,420
And he didn't know.

927
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,520
In his defense he didn't
know the position,

928
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,050
but I know exactly what's going on.

929
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,250
He refuses to get in the position and
then I'm just thinking I need a rest a

930
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:22,580
little bit.

931
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,300
Anyways,

932
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,010
so this is bullshit.

933
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:25,910
I'm not going to argue with we.

934
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:27,230
We're just arguing here.

935
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,430
He won't let me.

936
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:29,264
I know exactly that.

937
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,010
Then I decided at fuck that.

938
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,173
Fuck this shit.

939
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,530
I'm not going to get fucked here.

940
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,640
And the crowd was going nuts.

941
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:35,030
So young,

942
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,601
replay,

943
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,291
replay,

944
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:40,090
replay and show Scott Nelson
looks over right here.

945
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,270
He looks over to Hallock and he goes,

946
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:41,781
what do you want to do?

947
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,370
Halleck Hallux said stand them up,

948
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,591
start standing.

949
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,424
And when,

950
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:46,730
look,

951
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,780
he's going to walk over right now.

952
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:48,111
And I said,

953
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:48,944
what did he say?

954
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,240
And then they put the replay on,

955
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,810
he goes,

956
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,920
Hal except stand him up.

957
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,401
He said,

958
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,060
stand them up.

959
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,451
And I'm like,

960
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:53,961
fuck that.

961
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,794
We're not standing up.

962
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,600
And then the replay comes on and everybody
looks at the replay and then heuler

963
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,310
just gets down and gets into position.

964
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:01,521
I go,

965
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:02,150
look,

966
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:02,983
look,

967
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,540
I know a position is going
on so he let me have it.

968
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,470
See he said,

969
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:07,304
okay.

970
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,791
No,

971
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:08,630
no resistance.

972
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:09,920
Once the video came out,

973
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,990
they was trying to
sneak that left knee in.

974
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah.

975
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,920
Yeah.

976
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,930
And this is top store control right there.

977
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,010
Right there.

978
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,180
Stone of control from the back.

979
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:17,400
And there's,

980
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,610
you don't have to tough,

981
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,210
he didn't have your risks before.

982
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:20,751
They didn't matter.

983
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:21,350
It didn't matter.

984
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,850
None of it.

985
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,260
What I want here is I want him to push
me away because I'm going to dip and

986
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:26,511
roll.

987
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:27,500
I'm going to Tuck and roll,

988
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,060
but it he holds onto me.

989
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,230
I can't tuck and roll and the whole time
so I got to make it look like I want to

990
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:35,990
smash them and squeeze them
cause I could pass it anytime.

991
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,330
The past is guaranteed.

992
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,060
Do you want the for sure pass or do you
want to try to Tuck and roll and go for

993
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:44,610
the kill right away and go
after the vaporizer and I
thought I'm going right for

994
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:45,330
the vaporizer.

995
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,180
Fuck passing his guard and then he
recovers half guard and all that shit.

996
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,980
I wanted to go for the kill right here.

997
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,450
So right now I'm on my side.

998
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:52,284
I'm setting it up.

999
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,560
I need to be up on my knees but
just only do is need to get up.

1000
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:56,394
See I'm getting up.

1001
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,020
All they gotta do is really get on top,

1002
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,180
but I know I could get on
top of them anytime I want.

1003
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,200
I know this position.

1004
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,071
I'm just waiting.

1005
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:03,180
Now I'm on my knees.

1006
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,440
I collected some gas,

1007
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,274
I recovered.

1008
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
He can't get out.

1009
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:07,380
I'm in control here.

1010
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,760
His legs are all mangled.

1011
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,530
So what I want to do is turn to my
right and roll on my left shoulder.

1012
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,210
But at what a resting,

1013
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,350
all I'm doing is rusting.

1014
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:18,810
I'm going to turn to my right
roll on my left shoulder,

1015
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,070
but I need him to push me.

1016
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,570
So I say I'm cool.

1017
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,720
I'm selling the fact that I want to
squeeze him and I want to see him to see,

1018
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:25,650
and I was pushing away.

1019
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,513
He bought it,

1020
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,320
he bought the fact that
I want us to please.

1021
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,630
So this is what I always do.

1022
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,180
So now I'm gurgling
going like I hate this.

1023
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:33,961
Like I hate this,

1024
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:34,261
but look,

1025
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,580
he's going to help me
see how we helped me.

1026
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:36,414
And he pushed me through.

1027
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,520
He pushed me through this,

1028
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:38,880
done.

1029
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,510
Now you got this and I thought
for sure he was going to tab.

1030
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,680
This is the vaporizer.

1031
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,600
No one has ever not tapped to this.

1032
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,520
This is in my arsenal,

1033
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,690
the nastiest leg lock.

1034
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:49,320
This is a,

1035
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,120
it's a calf crank and it's a toe hold
at the same time and he can't protect

1036
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:57,390
himself with his other leg
is other leggings were on
his other leg so his other

1037
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:58,224
leg is useless.

1038
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,340
I can use both my arms as opposed
to the calf crank from the truck.

1039
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,450
The calf came from the truck.

1040
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:07,360
You can't use both arms for fear of
getting arm barred with one of them who

1041
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,223
left,

1042
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,200
so you need to protect that other leg.

1043
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:10,501
Anyway,

1044
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,000
he's got a free leg to break shit apart,

1045
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,750
but in from the vaporizer he
can't protect with his other leg.

1046
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:19,650
It's out of the mix and you could use
both arms because there's no arm bar and

1047
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:20,030
it's a,

1048
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,520
it's a,

1049
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,770
it's a leg compression and a told in one,

1050
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,860
it's the nastiest leg lock in my arsenal
and the fact that his leg popped at

1051
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:29,431
least seven times,

1052
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,500
it was popping and cracking and
I'm telling them right here,

1053
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,240
I would say,

1054
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,911
I'm asking him,

1055
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:33,091
I go,

1056
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:33,331
dude,

1057
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:34,021
we can end this.

1058
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:34,321
And he's like,

1059
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:34,770
no,

1060
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,101
see that.

1061
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:35,311
He's like,

1062
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:35,760
no,

1063
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,660
we can stop this.

1064
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,381
It keeps popping.

1065
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:37,591
He goes,

1066
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,161
that's normal.

1067
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:38,820
That's normal.

1068
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,470
I go with it keeps popping.

1069
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,880
And uh,

1070
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,440
he refused the tap.

1071
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,060
He refused man.

1072
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,081
And I was yanking.

1073
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,800
So I thought I'm going to,

1074
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,870
I was doing things I never
did to that they Bryson,

1075
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,800
I usually just grab the
toes with both ends,

1076
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,200
twist it in pool and it's really easy.

1077
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,240
And the calf crank from the truck.

1078
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,590
Another thing that you need,

1079
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,680
you need to stomp your left,

1080
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,750
the inside of your left
foot with your right foot.

1081
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,990
You got to shove your leg deeper
into the how nasty that looks.

1082
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,230
But in the CAF crank,

1083
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:11,730
you need to stop in this one.

1084
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,690
You don't need to stomp.

1085
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:13,680
You could just keep your legs,

1086
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:15,720
figure forward both arms.

1087
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,620
That's enough pressure.

1088
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,401
Just leave your legs.

1089
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,000
Figure four.

1090
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,240
But if for some crazy reason
they don't tap like he did,

1091
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,240
then you would go to the stomp
to add even more pressure.

1092
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,160
But he was holding the Geek Pat so I
could see he's holding my right leg.

1093
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,480
I need to use my right foot and
stomp on the inside of my left foot.

1094
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,540
I need to pull it up and stomp on
it and I can get his hands free.

1095
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,430
I can't get my leg free.

1096
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,070
You see I was holding it
but I mean is so I decided,

1097
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,461
you know what,

1098
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:42,851
I'm just,

1099
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:45,070
I generally don't need
to stomp on that foot,

1100
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:48,460
so I'm still trying to make him tap
like everyone else taps without it,

1101
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,600
but see how he's holding it.

1102
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,310
So I grabbed his foot,

1103
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,190
I'm twisting it and I thought
there's like a minute left.

1104
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:54,740
I go,

1105
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,880
I'm want to give it everything.

1106
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:58,450
I got one more time and
I just grabbed his foot,

1107
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:01,060
something I never do when
I twisted it and shoved it,

1108
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,060
like trying to shove it
like in his ribs man.

1109
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,910
And he still wouldn't tap and
near the popping and it just,

1110
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:07,923
he didn't care.

1111
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,100
He just kept going.

1112
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,640
He knew that if he didn't tab it would
be a draw and that's what he needed.

1113
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,110
He couldn't have you tap twice.

1114
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,160
He tap him twice.

1115
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,881
He has nothing.

1116
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,860
The fact that he's holding
onto my g pants there,

1117
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,390
that's what's saving him.

1118
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,770
You know he crazy.

1119
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:21,040
Yeah.

1120
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,930
He's getting serious danger right here.

1121
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,861
If you had to do it again,

1122
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:25,120
would you do it with the pants again?

1123
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,870
Yes.

1124
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,141
Yes.

1125
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:29,740
Because the key pad made
those electric chairs so easy.

1126
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,430
He could,

1127
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,180
he was never close to pulling
his leg out of lockdown.

1128
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,720
So the traction is just unbelievable.

1129
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:36,170
I mean,

1130
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,880
the pants,

1131
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,640
the pants were bad for
him and a lot of ways,

1132
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:42,310
but it saved them right
here in this one position.

1133
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,521
Yeah,

1134
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,354
it did save him,

1135
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,380
but I would,

1136
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:44,681
yeah,

1137
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,060
I would,

1138
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,720
uh,

1139
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,320
I would have went back to pants anyways,

1140
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,790
that whole pants scandal thing,

1141
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,913
um,

1142
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,390
I'm using my hands to wear pants.

1143
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,111
They said,

1144
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:53,321
okay,

1145
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,390
you go wear pants if you
promise not to change your mind.

1146
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,560
I want her to change my mind.

1147
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,731
They said,

1148
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,870
you promise not to change it.

1149
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,590
And then so they made me
wear what I asked for.

1150
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,783
So,

1151
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,440
um,

1152
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,273
I met his lawyer,

1153
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,070
his lawyer.

1154
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,000
It ended up being really,

1155
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:07,481
really cool,

1156
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:07,900
man.

1157
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,630
The guy that was,

1158
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,400
uh,

1159
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,680
trying to protect a heuler from the pant.

1160
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,220
That's when you're twisting it do.

1161
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,530
Yeah.

1162
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,480
I'm pushing down and try to smash.

1163
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,370
He's obviously in some serious pain here,

1164
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,481
but it's incredible.

1165
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,320
He's not tapping.

1166
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,270
What do you think happened to the knee?

1167
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,493
If you had to guess?

1168
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,400
Is this some damage?

1169
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,270
Maybe.

1170
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,880
Maybe he isn't.

1171
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,370
He always pops and that's the thing I'll
say about him is that he won't tap to

1172
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:30,990
joint locks.

1173
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,790
Like you remember when a Sakharova
got him in that Kamora yeah.

1174
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,151
And,

1175
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:34,241
uh,

1176
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:35,350
they stopped the fight and he's like,

1177
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,280
don't stop the fight.

1178
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,760
I,

1179
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,260
I'm there all day.

1180
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:38,850
I'm fine.

1181
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,220
Like,

1182
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,630
I don't get tapped from those things.

1183
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,883
Yeah.

1184
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,640
Um,

1185
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,170
so like how it said,

1186
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,150
please don't watch this on youtube.

1187
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,070
If you do watch on Youtube,

1188
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,440
please support metamorris just go there.

1189
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,750
And I purchased one for 20 bucks.

1190
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,250
There's a lot of high level matches,

1191
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,790
um,

1192
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,121
and,

1193
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,810
uh,

1194
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,111
people,

1195
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,944
it's really fun.

1196
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:06,860
Okay.
