Hello Freak bitches culture.
She worked with this girl Susan,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,160
for years that help you get a different
perspective.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,060
Oh,
you know what,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,160
I didn't think of that.
I didn't take that well.

5
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:11,994
Yeah,
you're right.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,650
So that kind of shit.
Now look,

7
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,830
ultimately you get on the set,
you're going to do it.

8
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,510
You're doing the director's gonna Hey
Steve,

9
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:20,160
you know,
you shouldn't be so angry they or

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,000
whatever,
you know,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,640
he thinks and the guy that wrote it,
you know what I mean?

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,980
But I worked very hard at it and I
worked for years now.

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,370
Now don't forget I'm making a living for
16 years as an actor and I left the

14
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,870
Riviera in 2000.
Isn't that crazy?

15
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,160
Yeah.
Sixteen years.

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,960
So,
and I've done a lot of shit.

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,700
This is,
you saying that 2016 years ago makes me

18
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,060
go,
what is that?

19
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,280
Right?
Unless they,

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,450
I started on the Sopranos in 99.

21
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,550
I went back and forth for a year,
you know,

22
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,200
I didn't quit.
The judge did six episodes.

23
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:51,600
I was still at the river.
What is it like the how?

24
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,720
It must've been fucking strange.
Was still at the river.

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,420
Then I booked it for 10 years.
I,

26
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,390
you know,
I booked the river till 2010.

27
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,300
Chris Rock said you're still dipping
your toe in that shit.

28
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,800
I said,
why not?

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,690
They're paying me.
What the fuck?

30
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,480
How hard is it hard?
Is it to book three comics a week?

31
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,730
I could do it in three days.
Book up six months.

32
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,710
That's hilarious.
You know the book I book guys that,

33
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,500
you know,
that didn't work much,

34
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,960
you know.
Well I think your point is a really

35
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,750
important part of what you're saying is
like the getting a different perspective

36
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,370
or a guy like Kendall feeney.
You would,

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,200
you'd imagine he was so good.

38
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,230
You would imagine that he probably
looked at it from all sorts of different

39
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,280
angles.
So yes he did.

40
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,550
And you saw a lot of different colors,
but he,

41
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,800
you know,
he would work 16 hours.

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,650
Okay.
Sixteen hour days on the Sopranos.

43
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,610
He's in,
he's there.

44
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:38,400
So I mean the guy gets up,
whatever time he got up,

45
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,400
then he's got to go home and learn
tomorrow stuff.

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,760
So sometimes he told me he'd be sitting
in the chair.

47
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,000
He Fall Asleep for two hours.
He wakes up,

48
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,490
she's still there,
just waiting for him to wake up and

49
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,740
they're going to work on the stuff for
tomorrow.

50
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,090
Whoa.
Yeah.

51
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:54,660
And,
and,

52
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,220
and nine months of that,
don't forget,

53
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,540
you know the Sopranos,
Joe,

54
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,120
they were,
when I got on the show was like eight

55
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,370
days.
I came on the second season,

56
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:07,371
so it was like eight days for an episode
that nine and 10 at the last season it

57
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:10,980
was,
we shot nine shows in nine months.

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,840
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

59
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,460
You know,
it was like shooting a movie.

60
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,470
There's no commercials.
So it's a full hour,

61
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,420
but you know,
that's what it was,

62
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,380
man.
It was long.

63
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,180
It was like shooting a movie.
Wow.

64
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,950
I mean month and episodes.
The first episode was 17,

65
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,260
18 working days.
Lorraine Brock was said to me,

66
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,990
you're going to work more in this
episode that I will the whole season

67
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,820
because she only worked one day in
episode.

68
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,860
She had the greatest job in show
business.

69
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,690
Wow.
They shot that in one day.

70
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,921
Oh,
that's beautiful.

71
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:40,170
For her.
Was a great part two.

72
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,063
Yeah,
it was great.

73
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,010
You know,
but I,

74
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,730
I think the coaching wise,
and I think a lot of it is you focus and

75
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,510
concentrate,
know your stuff,

76
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,890
know your lines.
I mean,

77
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,060
you're an actor,
you know,

78
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,250
know your shit.
Don't come in and be like a smart ass.

79
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,620
Yeah.

80
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,940
Maybe I paraphrase.
Know your stuff.

81
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,010
Respect what's on the page,
you know that I'm a,

82
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,710
I'm a big believer in that.
The Sopranos,

83
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:07,180
you didn't Ad Lib the word thought and
I'm not joking you.

84
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,460
There was a,
there was a time that I had to say,

85
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,630
uh,
I got to go and the line was I have to

86
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,740
go.
And they kept correcting me and correct

87
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:17,220
me.
Correct.

88
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,130
Because I just,
you know,

89
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,900
I gotta go home.
I have to go.

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,740
I don't know why,
why,

91
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,970
when I didn't question it.
I mean,

92
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,400
you know,
but that's a crazy amount of work when

93
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,080
you're talking about Gandolfini.
That's really,

94
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,420
that's still fucking with my head.
Now listen,

95
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,840
Jim was one of my closest friends,
couldn't find a better guy.

96
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,950
He worked hardly stories.
Kids,

97
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,340
you know,
his kids,

98
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,410
you know,
uh,

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,250
his daughter wasn't born,
you know,

100
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,520
uh,
while he was on the Sopranos.

101
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,450
But it was like no life.
You could completely gave up your life,

102
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,750
not the rest of us because there was so
many characters,

103
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,600
you know,
I didn't want.

104
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,780
I had a couple of episodes where I
worked the real APP,

105
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,750
but you know,
otherwise this can't be good for your

106
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,090
health.
There was a lot of guys.

107
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,230
I mean,
I think Jimmy Smits I read years ago and

108
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:06,480
ypd he said he couldn't take,
it was 18,

109
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,730
18 hour days and yeah,
it was making a fortune.

110
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:11,350
He said I couldn't do it anymore.
Yeah,

111
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,711
no,
I've,

112
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,330
I've,
I've had friends that had been on dramas

113
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,500
before,
and this is the same thing.

114
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,810
They would tell me that they just,
they just couldn't do it.

115
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,640
They just with would.
And they would just,

116
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,070
would be,
when the season would wrap there to go,

117
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,270
this has got to be my last season.

118
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,270
I mean,
you know,

119
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,210
it's,
it's a point with the money now.

120
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,360
You know,
the thing,

121
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,830
what I love about blue bloods is there's
a lot of character.

122
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,810
So there's different stories.
So it's not like that.

123
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,210
I'm like signature.
Whoa.

124
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,340
He's hanging up.
It's,

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,141
it's,
you know,

126
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,690
like seven of us.
But it's not my signature.

127
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,260
How crazy is that?
Someone's going to fake the signature

128
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,380
hanging up in a nice restaurant.
Bobby voc a lot with the fat stomach

129
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,440
from the days when I wore the fat stone.
Oh,

130
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,790
they made you put like a prosthesis.
Then I got fat enough.

131
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,810
You get
fat enough just so you don't have to

132
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,640
wear that thing one day.
Chase.

133
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,031
Uh,
you know,

134
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,864
I,
I,

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,060
you know,
when I first got the role,

136
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,720
I was seeing all these jokes,
like you're counseling with legs and you

137
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,501
fat.
Fuck.

138
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,490
And you think,
and I'm going,

139
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm not that much fatter than getting
the Fini.

140
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,010
I'm just starting to think that maybe
they catch the wrong guy.

141
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm not joking.
I'm saying P,

142
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,400
I mean these jokes don't make sense and
then they call all you got to come in

143
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,510
for a fat suit.
So I was ridiculous thing.

144
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,470
Then the second year they made it like a
really nice one that costs like a

145
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,460
costume shop.
It had like tits and

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,610
a costume shop in like a Broadway
costume thing.

147
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,100
And uh,
and then one year I was going back and I

148
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:40,330
was at a fitting for the fourth year,
you know,

149
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,930
worked in the next year and he looked at
me and he meant,

150
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,460
and you don't have to wait at anymore.
I said,

151
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,400
all right,
so I'm assuming it was pretty

152
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:53,000
embarrassing at first I was prancing
around that they had an ass on me til

153
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,950
like a big ass fake ass.
And he was gone too big and I was like

154
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,980
going walking back and forth like crazy.

155
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,980
It's fucking,
you will eat

156
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,970
Steve Landesberg comment.
He said to me,

157
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,770
did they actually have permission to do
that?

158
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:08,421
And I said,
no,

159
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:08,931
Steve,
he's,

160
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,460
I want him to fucking there that I want.
Well,

161
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,840
I want to get the job,
you know,

162
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,740
that was a weird time when the sopranos
came out because all the sudden it was

163
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:19,760
like a lot of fake mob guys.
A lot of fake connected.

164
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,620
Got Fake Italian,
you know what I mean?

165
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,200
It's still around.
I call it Gig Guinea actors guild,

166
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,680
but you know what I mean?
It's like that acting that way became in

167
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,060
fashion.
Taste started to taste.

168
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,470
They used to hang around wherever we
weren't around.

169
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,900
They were extras.
It was still around.

170
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,170
But there was,
you know,

171
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,610
we did a appearance in the Kachina.
We do a lot of that stuff.

172
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,440
You know,
they were everywhere.

173
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,640
They were everywhere.

174
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,150
They were hoping to get on the show.
He come out and you did the shot.

175
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,900
It doesn't have to do the show.
I remember Michael Imperioli one time,

176
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,380
we were up in Reno and there's one of
them guys and he was playing blackjack

177
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,740
and you know,
and uh,

178
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,300
except come on,
put me on the show.

179
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,170
I could do,
you do.

180
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,920
I just went off on him.
I've been fucking drive for 20 years,

181
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,440
you know,
blah,

182
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,040
blah,
blah.

183
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,080
And then he got,
he hit Michael and Michael was right.

184
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,260
He got really pissed off.
This is just one of those fucking

185
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,240
Goombas,
you know,

186
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,790
Nigga,
I could do the worst.

187
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,620
Exactly.
This like this.

188
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,810
There's wannabes.
But there's something about Guinea

189
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,970
wannabes.
Just a handful out of here.

190
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:28,260
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

191
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,850
And the thing here,
they congregate together when they try

192
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,300
to like climb out tying
together.

193
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,310
What's the last thing?

194
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,500
Rogan.
How come you got Rogan?

195
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,270
I kinda,
I kinda.

196
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,030
And I try to navigate away from even in
New York,

197
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,010
I kinda,
that's not my thing.

198
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,690
And Sopranos was so good that it almost
killed the genre.

199
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,790
I think so I think you're right about
that because you know what,

200
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,460
unless,
and I get a lot of scripts,

201
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:58,170
Joe,
you know of that crap.

202
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,520
You know,
they make these,

203
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,500
I call them backyard movies,
you know,

204
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,150
you're never gonna see him,
you know,

205
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,570
whatever they're getting paid.
I'm not interested.

206
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,420
It's that same thing.
I'll fuck you up.

207
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,990
You know I am,
you know,

208
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,950
my uncle is my rarest gets
but it's true.

209
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:18,540
But they write this and I say how people
give them the money.

210
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,670
How do you get the money to make these
movies?

211
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,410
Well,
I think for awhile people were making

212
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,840
them just because it's sopranos was so
popular now.

213
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,690
Unless you're going to beat Sopranos
Goodfellas,

214
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,690
you know,
what's the great mob movies?

215
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,840
Some Sopranos,
Goodfellas Casino,

216
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,230
a raging bull had marbella,
right.

217
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,500
Great movie.
Uh,

218
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,200
one of my mission.
It was going to be a few of them,

219
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,730
you know,
some great,

220
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,320
great,
great mob movies.

221
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:49,290
But right now it was after the Sopranos.
I mean,

222
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,520
you don't see.
No.

223
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,790
The Godfather,
godfather to know that there was some,

224
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,880
but you're to have to beat that.
And they tried,

225
00:08:56,881 --> 00:09:00,180
they tried to do some mobby stuff
already.

226
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,730
Donovan's work.
And that's a good trail.

227
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,740
That's a good show.
That's from an Irish perspective.

228
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,570
Well,
I think what happened with those movies

229
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,361
was,
or,

230
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:07,980
or,
uh,

231
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,680
that show rather is,
it was those,

232
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,180
you had a movie every week.
Exactly.

233
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,510
So like every subject was covered.
But trail gambling,

234
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,610
it was funny.
Was funny,

235
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,810
funny,
funny elements.

236
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,150
It was very smart.
That was something,

237
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:24,811
you know,
I would go,

238
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,390
I would be around and people go,
I don't like that show you.

239
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,870
And I'm tired.
Have you ever seen the show?

240
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,560
Have you ever seen the show?
No,

241
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,394
I haven't seen it.
It's like,

242
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,470
it's actually somebody.
I don't.

243
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,950
I don't watch porn.
I hate putting.

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,020
Have you ever seen it?
No.

245
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,430
Well then how do you know you don't like
it?

246
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,050
Or did you see it?
Oh,

247
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,460
do you watch it?
You know what I mean?

248
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,580
But Hey,
they're holding signs of,

249
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,780
I know porn.
That was a big thing,

250
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,810
right?
The Italian American boss society was

251
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,070
telling you,
testing against it.

252
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,100
How about this story?
I wrote a kids book,

253
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,020
Nikki Deuce.
Okay.

254
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,990
Uh,
it took place in Brooklyn and we turned

255
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,860
it into a movie for Nickelodeon,
you know,

256
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,790
we'll try.
We didn't just want to get into treating

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,850
installation movies and I had Michael
Imperioli in it and so rico and uh,

258
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,460
uh,
and Nickelodeon made the movie.

259
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,400
But when I was,
when I wrote the book,

260
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,010
I was doing book signings and you know,
it's about a kid fish out of water.

261
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,340
Who goes back to Brooklyn and grew up in
the suburbs and he winds up with a kid,

262
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,330
Italian neighborhood venture nurse in
Brooklyn,

263
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,750
and then it gets into some mischief.
I don't even call it trouble,

264
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:28,751
but so is guy kept writing letters and
shit and killing me on the Internet and

265
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,460
writing letters to the bookstores are
ahead of me getting there,

266
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,770
you know,
like saying that he's a,

267
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,020
you know,
derogatory against the Italians and he's

268
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,090
now he's bringing kids into it and blah,
blah,

269
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:41,840
blah,
blah blah.

270
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,860
So finally I get the guy's number and I
called the guy.

271
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,160
I swear to you.
I say to him,

272
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:50,550
listen,
I think his name is Zane.

273
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,920
I think his name is anthony.
I said,

274
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:52,521
listen,
Anthony,

275
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:52,761
blah,
blah,

276
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,011
blah,
blah,

277
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,400
blah.
This is the world I know,

278
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,840
like rappers rap about what they know.
This is what I know,

279
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,740
you know.

280
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,650
And uh,
he said to me,

281
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,200
I said,
you know,

282
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,580
what can I do?
Tell me what I can do.

283
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:08,790
Let's fix this.
I mean,

284
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,650
because you know,
you up papa.

285
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,271
He said,
well,

286
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,000
you can make a donation to my
organization.

287
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,670
It was the Italian American bullshit.
I said,

288
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,820
you got to be kidding me.
Hundred

289
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,830
true story.
Trying to shake me down.

290
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,740
There's a whole bunch of.
When the movie came out,

291
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,110
we got some heat for the Nicky deuce
movie.

292
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,840
Really?
And it's not really about mob.

293
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,000
It's intention.
I mean,

294
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,130
exactly.
You know,

295
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,260
and they did that with the cement,
but people would say all the time,

296
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:37,881
you know,
Joe,

297
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:38,641
uh,
yeah,

298
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,430
I don't want you to think I'm an
Italian.

299
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
You guys talked bad about the times.
You know,

300
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,230
they didn't,
they,

301
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,720
they,
they showed what really was.

302
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,850
I thought it was very authentic.
You know,

303
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,570
oh,
well,

304
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,670
this apprentices is authentic,
is a guess.

305
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,080
If you know anybody like that,
you know,

306
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:53,880
those people exist.
10,

307
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,840
they don't exist.
Is that fencing?

308
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,970
Exactly.
I think it was a story that needs to be

309
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,090
told.
I don't think in stone this is what it

310
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,710
is.
But it was such a fascinating show

311
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,340
because Gandel feeney was a bad guy.
Like his character.

312
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,740
You're rooted for a bad guy,
a murder for a murderer or cheated on.

313
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:14,960
His wife stole.
Rob shook people down slowly,

314
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,290
but he was your guy.
He was,

315
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,890
I think the first.
I think I could be wrong,

316
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:24,340
the first like anti hero that people
will default to.

317
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,280
I think you're right.
I can't imagine before that it was,

318
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:27,951
you know,
your,

319
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:29,560
your roof for the guy,
you know,

320
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:34,030
he was a real anti hero murderer,
a con man.

321
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:38,430
I mean all of the above
to people in the mob.

322
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,660
They did it to people,
you know,

323
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,440
like on the show.

324
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,400
There wasn't just within each other.
They went outside,

325
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:47,460
they were robbing people and busting up,
uh,

326
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,690
uh,
you know,

327
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,090
businesses and doing all this stuff that
they do.

328
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,440
Yeah,
it was great.

329
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,020
Show was good.
It was very small.

330
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,730
It was a very smart show.
And if it was,

331
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,750
if they put it back on now,
they would get higher ratings than some

332
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:01,990
of these shows now.
I bet.

333
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,020
I bet.
Well,

334
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,980
it was so good.
I think a lot of people forgot how good

335
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:08,430
it was and it also changed a lot.
If you go to the first episode,

336
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,040
the first episode was essentially like a
slapstick comedy.

337
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,620
You remember that?
I'm not in the rain brought out with the

338
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,290
rain Brocco a who was the woman that
played a his wife Edi file community.

339
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:24,210
Falco and Falco had a fucking machine
gun and like the doctor was trying to

340
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,900
come down and see that and she's outside
with a machine gun point matter.

341
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,450
It was way more slapsticky.
It was weird.

342
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:31,790
It was like a comedy.
They shot.

343
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,720
Got The show aired in [inaudible] 99,
right.

344
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,020
I think they shot that like in
[inaudible] 98,

345
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,090
if I'm not mistaken,
really,

346
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,080
if I'm not mistaken at 98,
I believe [inaudible] 97 even.

347
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:49,350
They go back and then it took six months
and then they started shooting them.

348
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:52,380
You know how,
how David Chase did it?

349
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,470
He didn't do it like a regular show
where you shoot it and then in three

350
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,570
weeks it's on the air.
You know,

351
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,740
he put them all in the can.
They were finished and locked and you

352
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:05,940
know,
you know what I mean?

353
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:06,481
Like you,
you know,

354
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,370
you finished your,
your whatever.

355
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,490
It took nine months and then he edited
them and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.

356
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,910
And then they added,
you know,

357
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,350
it was done a completely different way
while also they would,

358
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,480
uh,
they would,

359
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,550
you know,
if they didn't like what you did,

360
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I mean he replaced you and you never
even knew it really.

361
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,440
It was placed here,
you know,

362
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:32,310
like I had a scene with a guy and they
called back,

363
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,860
you know,
a month or so later and said,

364
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:37,410
you got to shoot the scene again with a
different actor for whatever reason,

365
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:41,610
whether you know the guy didn't do a
good job or a,

366
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,460
he looked too young or too old or just
didn't fit.

367
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,230
He had the,
he had the capacity to just shoot it

368
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,670
again if it,
if it scene,

369
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:55,130
didn't he rewrite the scene?
You shoot the scene again three months

370
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:57,230
later.
What's interesting about those kinds of

371
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,480
shows too,
is that they're so big and so popular

372
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,330
that you become that character.
Whoever that character is,

373
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,400
you become that guy.
You're that guy forever.

374
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,840
Of course.
I mean,

375
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,460
that's part of the deal.
That's okay.

376
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,540
I had no career before that.
So it's not.

377
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,430
I'm not saying with you what I'm saying,
like there's some people that you've

378
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:15,530
worked since then you'll continue to
work,

379
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,710
but there's some people that were on
that show that we're really famous when

380
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,080
that show was on the air and the
vanished.

381
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

382
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,690
Well you're in the,
you know,

383
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,390
you got people all over the world
watching.

384
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,700
I mean,
I've been stopped with people literally

385
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,100
from all over the world that have
watched the show.

386
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,280
It was like a cult hit,
like nothing that ever hit before,

387
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,410
like big pussies,
big pussy for the rest of his fucking.

388
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,120
He's also,
he,

389
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,780
he embraces that too,
you know what I mean?

390
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,890
For him it works and he's okay.
He works.

391
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,710
He does his things.
Know he's always going to work.

392
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,820
He's a very good actor.
He's got his music.

393
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,580
He's a musician and stuff,
but I,

394
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,570
I hear Ya know,
especially the name,

395
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,070
big pussy.
That was a big thing.

396
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,700
People like to say that.
Yeah.

397
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,860
Yeah.
They do like to say that,

398
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,530
but also his,
you know the scene in the movie when

399
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,090
they kill him,
like the whole,

400
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,950
the whole way it plays out.

401
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,270
It was very intense.
It was like,

402
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,070
Whoa,
I can't believe they killed big pussy.

403
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,220
That was the big thing.
It was the first time,

404
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,640
uh,
to have regular cast member gets killed.

405
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,030
I mean,
they're not killing the,

406
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,070
you know,
uh,

407
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,090
the guy from friends.
Exactly.

408
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,030
David Schwimmer and getting killed,
you know,

409
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,280
whole one,
one Friday night.

410
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,510
Oh my God,
they killed David.

411
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,250
Tremendous five friends now,
you know.

412
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,230
So that was a big character that gets
killed and then big carried this kept

413
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:33,240
getting killed,
which is why guys will worry.

414
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,450
I mean,
there was a real concern that you

415
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:36,860
weren't going to get killed off the
show.

416
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,990
The material they gave you,
the more of shot you're getting killed.

417
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

418
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,780
I mean,
you know,

419
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,850
and let's not kid ourselves.
It's not just,

420
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,050
you know,
you're out of work.

421
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,490
They just put you out of work.
And the biggest show that Glenn,

422
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,570
when Gandolfini killed him periodically,
I was like,

423
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:56,840
Whoa,
Holy Shit.

424
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,840
His knows.
They're like,

425
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,501
what?
But,

426
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,000
but you know what,
once you made it into the last season,

427
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,800
it was like,
hey listen,

428
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:07,820
you know,
we've done paid however the story ends.

429
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,280
It's probably better if I would have got
killed early on,

430
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,160
I would've felt really Shitty,
I'll tell Ya.

431
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,580
So all the stuff that happened because
you know,

432
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,540
you know what I mean.
And plus,

433
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,620
you know,
we didn't mention we started making

434
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,470
money towards the middle and the end,
you know,

435
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,860
not the guys at the beginning,
I'm making a lot of money while those

436
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:29,861
shows are hard to make money like hbo
and Hbo Pace and they pay now even

437
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,370
better than just shows off the end nine
years.

438
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,660
Wow.
Now,

439
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,530
you know,
we went into,

440
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,510
you know,
and then there was other money coming in

441
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,580
because he had opportunities to do other
shit,

442
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,890
you know.
Well that show was also groundbreaking

443
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:47,090
in that it was one of the first shows
like that and now hbo specializes in

444
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:51,480
those kinds of shows.
And so the show time.

445
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,201
Yup.
Yeah.

446
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:52,980
I mean,
you know,

447
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,660
it all kind of connected in the soprano
is the first time they,

448
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,940
they're hiring a,
you know,

449
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,650
a fat,
bald guy.

450
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,450
You know,
Jim wasn't a leading man,

451
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,313
right?
They,

452
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,250
they wanted,
you know,

453
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,100
you figure it's a good look at mob guy.
You know what I mean?

454
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:10,130
But he was intense and charismatic and
one of the girls loved them and we used

455
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,511
to joke,
you know,

456
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,070
they say TV puts 10 pounds on the.
I say it takes 50 off.

457
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:16,904
Yeah.

458
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,350
Well he was just,
it was such an interesting character.

459
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,010
He was so intense and like when he got
into that murderous rage,

460
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,260
like you fucking bought it,
hook,

461
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,240
line and sinker.
When you acted with him,

462
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,300
you didn't have to,
uh,

463
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,070
you know,
you didn't have to act scared.

464
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,890
Like if it was a scene,
I got to be scared.

465
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:35,830
You got to yell at me,
you know,

466
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,730
he was fucking,
you know,

467
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,380
he gave you the whole thing,
you know,

468
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,730
we had that fight,
you know,

469
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:44,110
me and him had that fight in the first
episode of that list.

470
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:44,701
So,
you know what I mean.

471
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,680
You know that.
We shot that for a day and a half.

472
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,360
Whoa.
That was tough.

473
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,130
He was choking me.
He said,

474
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,090
listen,
you know,

475
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,800
let's try to take this as far as we can
and we can turn it.

476
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,350
I was pulling his hair.
He was fucking choking me that I was

477
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,880
getting cut from the.

478
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,400
I was wearing a necklace,
you know,

479
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,130
I was getting cut from that.
I mean we've all banged up,

480
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,040
banged up for real and that's why I look
real.

481
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,230
It was like two fat out of shape guys.
Find the fuck out of,

482
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,890
you know guys,
it's not Steven Seagal where we look,

483
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,410
you know,
what the hell this was like a fight

484
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,540
like.
So when you do something like that,

485
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,700
like how hard you hit each other,
you know,

486
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,220
as hard as she could without really
hurting.

487
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,730
And he had said that,
let's go as far as we could and we will

488
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,870
pull my hair,
put my hair,

489
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,020
fucking a stroking me,
go ahead.

490
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,090
Go further.
You know,

491
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,680
like I said,
we were good friends.

492
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,380
You know,
if you do it with a stranger you could

493
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,510
get a little funky.
You know what I mean?

494
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:46,051
Like,
Hey,

495
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:46,591
well,
you know,

496
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:47,130
you know.
