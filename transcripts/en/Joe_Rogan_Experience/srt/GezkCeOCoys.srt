1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,721
Yeah,
they're great.

2
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:03,190
We've got two of them.
I love it.

3
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:07,180
You could pick the front of the bag.
That's an interesting way to start to

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,760
your weight.
You can start it.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,390
We're talking about these toilets that
have a built in.

6
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,000
It's not really a bad day.
It's more like a buck cleaner.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,950
Right.
But the days are kind of crude.

8
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,500
You ever use it a day?
That's what it was.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,840
It is,
but it's not good at it.

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,610
Know what I mean?
This was

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,590
this stream of water.
It was the perfect size and pressure

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,590
warmth and I have had,
I mean if we want to get into it right,

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,590
right off the bat,
I've had an anal orgasm before with a

14
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:38,280
vibrator and the only once in my life
and that day I was like,

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,040
if I stayed on here like 10 more minutes
I could get you.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,890
I think it could a lot of gals out there
taking notes.

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,400
I was like,
I think I just use like diaper wipes in

18
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,890
my butt.
Yeah,

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,870
that's good too.
But I like think about it like,

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,170
you know,
like if my beard,

21
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,610
if I had like shit smeared all over,
would that be cool with the diaper wipe

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,440
and just going out in public?
I don't think so.

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,670
So the idea is to power wash it.
Yeah.

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,150
That's what that power wash my face
though.

25
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,090
I scrub it,
shower,

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,180
put my head in a tub of water for a
little bit.

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,780
They're very smart with it,
but day and the day never caught on here

28
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,310
in America,
they just went with paper,

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,250
which,
which gets caught in your butt and it

30
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:23,610
gets caught if you're a girl with not a
neatly tucked vagina.

31
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,960
Like most women,
little pieces break off ones that soft.

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,300
Yeah.
That's why I use Scott brand toilet

33
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,640
paper instead of Sharman.
Everyone thinks I'm being cheap and I'm

34
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:33,001
like,
no,

35
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,790
I just don't want toilet paper stuck in
my vagina.

36
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,730
You ever wipe your Dick with toilet
paper or not?

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,030
It's just your bottle.
No drip,

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,040
drip,
drop it right back.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,273
Don't worry about it.

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,640
Not a concern.
I've always wondered that.

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,660
Yeah,
it's different.

42
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,650
I mean girls,
you know,

43
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:55,470
it's obviously it's not as efficient
delivery method.

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,410
Really.
Gotta be careful about the wiping front

45
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,600
to back.
What do you got?

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,390
Oh No.
Ryan,

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,960
you want to send my daughter once my
young daughter got sick from that.

48
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,210
I learned the hard way.
Yeah.

49
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,630
She didn't understand and we were on
vacation.

50
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,180
I actually got sick from it.
She gets a fever

51
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,270
I think.
I want to say she was three or,

52
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,930
oh wow.
Yeah.

53
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,531
It's like,
you know,

54
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,650
you want to like,
even if you tell them it doesn't make

55
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:23,970
sense to them,
you know,

56
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,190
back to front is the way you'd normally
it would go,

57
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,490
but then you gotta do it in your head.
You go that way until your arms get

58
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,110
longer.
Yeah.

59
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,770
Yeah.
And then you got to lift your leg up.

60
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,440
I can reach all the way around now.
Do you wipe your ass with your leg up on

61
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,670
the toilet?
No,

62
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:40,290
I stand up to wipe my ass.
I like to get in there squat though.

63
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,590
You could get into but whole area.
It's true.

64
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,830
I always do a captain Morgan stance to
clean out the area.

65
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,380
He has.
Oh and the leg up on the barrel because

66
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,790
when you stand up you gotta wipe and
wipe and wipe.

67
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,090
And when you're like,
what is this going to end?

68
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,860
Yeah.
Well that's why I think every toilet

69
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,160
should really,
I mean it would it be hard

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,090
to have one of those jet things and
every toilet it doesn't seem that.

71
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,040
I don't think that's a big ask.
Yeah.

72
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,570
My concern is so like if you're
squirting and then like poop crumbles

73
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,520
are coming out right,
and they're going back down.

74
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,790
Like could it ever then hit the thing
that's squirting on you and then could

75
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,520
poop squirt gun.
That's my,

76
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,780
that's my main concern.

77
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,460
Well there's bigger concerns in life,
but that is one.

78
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,960
No,
I mean we're just specifically talking

79
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:28,290
about toilet concerns that a major one.

80
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,900
I don't think that because of the water
pressure,

81
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,900
I don't think you would have to have all
like all of them,

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,780
like shit.
I mean it would have to prairie dogging,

83
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,391
right?
Yeah.

84
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:41,990
It would have to be like a cow patty
fiber diet,

85
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,860
who's already
anyway,

86
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,220
we're sex birth.
Well,

87
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,400
you're human.
Every new how sex is in some way.

88
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,630
A sexpert.
Yeah.

89
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,400
That's our platform because we don't,
we're not,

90
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,400
we're not experts at all.
I said the other day to corrine,

91
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,070
what's the name of the whole that hugs
the Tampon and she was like,

92
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,520
wow,
okay Christina.

93
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,640
That's the,
we did look it up.

94
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,260
Well,
because people call the whole thing the

95
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:09,920
vagina and that's inaccurate.
Vaginas are so complicated.

96
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,770
How the whole thing,
it's the thing is not a vagina and

97
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,320
that's inaccurate.
The just the,

98
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,560
the sex hole is the vagina.
No,

99
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,590
people call the whole thing the vagina,
but that's not technically accurate.

100
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,970
If the doors are closed and you look at
on the outside,

101
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,621
you'd go,
hey,

102
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,610
that's a vagina.
Like,

103
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,990
nope,
that's not technically correct.

104
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,820
My Labor.
Yeah,

105
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,500
that's Lavia you're looking at there.
Yeah.

106
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,460
Here's the church.
Here's the staple because the door,

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,160
the,
let me tell you how I feel about it.

108
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:37,910
I think it's fucking gross.
The operation where they remove labial

109
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,970
lips,
that seems so goddamn right.

110
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,420
Labioplasty yeah.
Somebody actually,

111
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:46,410
cause that doesn't do your vagina's
fully functioning and it works fine.

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,110
It's just the aesthetic.
And then if you get the surgery and it

113
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:50,790
goes awry,
that's not good.

114
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,200
Somebody had emailed us once about Dane
Cook had a bit about like meaty posy

115
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,830
lips a while ago and she'd got
labioplasty because of that bit.

116
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,900
And I was like,
no,

117
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,640
I like Dane Cook a Laba and I,
but I had talked about that because I

118
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,590
was,
I was watching his special and I just

119
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,300
put my hands over my face.
I was like,

120
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:12,450
this is not what we need it all.
But I was like,

121
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:15,480
surely no one's going to do it.
Cause he said that it's a joke.

122
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,300
He's a comic and he's a cute comics.
So then you're like,

123
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,360
should I do it?
Not me personally.

124
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:25,020
I mean,
but it also desensitizes the area a lot.

125
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:28,650
So you're,
imagine you're cutting meat stitching

126
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,750
things back up and things get numb.
Oh,

127
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,110
nice surgery.

128
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,140
And the slight,
there's a slice down my knee that I had

129
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:38,830
this knee operated on in 1994 and it's
still numb.

130
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,020
Oh whoa.
Yeah.

131
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,250
This skin,
like where they did what's called a

132
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,280
Patella tendon graft with,
oh my God,

133
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,330
they cut along.
Slice.

134
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,180
They took a piece of your Patella,
they pull that out and then they stitch

135
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:54,130
it inside the knee and that area in the
front where they took the scar,

136
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,390
like where the scars,
it's numb.

137
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,470
So just no nerves,
nerve endings there.

138
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,130
I don't feel,

139
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,820
well it feels notice will be different
than the sides.

140
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,420
Like that one strip where the scar is
very different.

141
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,254
So imagine that.
Sure.

142
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,851
Yeah.
I was like,

143
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:09,070
imagine your policies,
your knee and that just so what's the

144
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,750
point of life?
What's the point of living now?

145
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:13,270
I'm always just an envision your knees
as my pussy.

146
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,650
Whenever I see plessy knee,
it would be big

147
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,690
pussy too because it's little pussies
opening.

148
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,770
Yeah,
and that's why babies come out.

149
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,170
Otherwise you have to get c sections and
then the,

150
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,790
the baby doesn't get the product out of
China.

151
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,791
Juices on the baby and they don't get
the right healthy bacteria.

152
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,043
Right?
Yeah.

153
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,781
No,
I know why.

154
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:34,470
There's a notepad here.
I'm taking notes.

155
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,803
Underline this

156
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,240
baby born by Cesarean section,
especially elective Sicilian and

157
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:44,560
section.
It's actually unhealthy for the baby's

158
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,890
immune system.
I thought you were gonna say hotter

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,980
because you're placing your face doesn't
get sued.

160
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,200
Exactly.
They're not mashed when they come out,

161
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,540
they don't look like they've got a
facebook photo,

162
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,370
ratty face tune.
We've heard,

163
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,730
we've heard that.
We didn't know what phase,

164
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,200
tuning wise,
we've been in La for like three days.

165
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,380
We've heard face tuning it five times.
You know you can auto tune Britney

166
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,990
spears voice.
So it sounds listenable to the general

167
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,520
public,
but you can also do that to your fucking

168
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,810
face.
Okay.

169
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:18,140
So it's like,
it's an app and then beyond filters you

170
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,480
actually can take your finger.
And if my,

171
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,110
I think my face looks too fat,
I can smudge it in so that it's thinner.

172
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,360
But then you meet somebody in person,
they're like,

173
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,420
oh fatty,
all the celebrities do it apparently.

174
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,790
Oh,
come

175
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,351
on.
Oh,

176
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:31,320
not all of them.
Well not,

177
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,750
not you.
Well the weird ones do,

178
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,480
but it see,
the thing is like if you're doing that

179
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,520
and then someone meets you in person,
like that was the,

180
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,610
the issue with,
you know,

181
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,760
the Kim Kardashians,
Mexico pictures,

182
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,790
you know,
that's the whole thing.

183
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,580
Kim Carter.
You can imagine.

184
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,550
I love that you're up on this though.
I am a bitch.

185
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,410
Kim Kardashians brings photographers
with her and they pretend that she's

186
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,260
getting paparazzied.
Oh really?

187
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,300
She hires these people.
Then they take the photos and then they

188
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,310
doctor the photos.
They photoshop them and then they

189
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,440
release them as candid photos.
Well,

190
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,350
she went down to Mexico and some real
Paparazzi.

191
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,120
Were there some real unpaid ones and
they got unreached touched ashots and it

192
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,990
is a monster.
Really?

193
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,150
Well,
it's not cellulite.

194
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:15,150
Here's the thing.
It's fat taken out of her body and

195
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:17,580
stuffed into her ass to give her this
diaper.

196
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,440
Look,
it's a,

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,970
it's a meat diaper and you don't realize
how gross it looks until you see it in

198
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,950
real life.
I've seen one of those in real life and

199
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,010
it's chaotic.
Oh,

200
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,110
always seen him.
What pants on?

201
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:29,790
I haven't seen him naked,
but I saw one.

202
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,220
I was like,
what in the fuck are you doing your

203
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,580
body?
It's chaos because you suck and fat out

204
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,310
of your sides and your inner thigh and
all this.

205
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,090
Like,
look at that.

206
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,640
Whoa.
What in the fuck is that?

207
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,990
What the fuck is a diaper?
And to say,

208
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,600
I don't think it looks that bad.
Oh,

209
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:48,540
you're crazy.
Let's find the Mexico pictures because

210
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,700
there's the,
there was Paparazzi pictures of her

211
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,200
walking on the beach.
Okay.

212
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,920
Oh,
see?

213
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,960
Yeah,
that's not even the bad ones.

214
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,010
This makes me like

215
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,390
her more.
Why?

216
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,080
Because she's not perfect.
Humanizes her.

217
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,921
Okay,
but wait a minute.

218
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:06,060
She's projecting a face sheet section
and that's her business.

219
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,250
Anyone who thinks Kim guard issue cat
Kardashians actually perfect is

220
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,010
ridiculous.
We're young and impressionable.

221
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,980
People are held up to way higher
standards.

222
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,690
You look at that and you go,
oh my God,

223
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
how can I be like that?
That's a new role models though.

224
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,280
It's a parent's job or guardian's job to
step in and be like,

225
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,030
maybe you have maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg
give her her to her.

226
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,991
Well,
that's true,

227
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,410
but here's the reality is if you're a
little kid and you're paying attention

228
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:37,200
to online stuff without supervision and
you're hanging out with friends at

229
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,180
school,
you're going to be affected by this

230
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,760
because this woman makes hundreds of
millions of dollars.

231
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,850
She's super glamorous,
she's on television and you find out

232
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,170
that she got fat stuffed into her ass to
make that thing cause she cheated

233
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,830
guided.

234
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,850
That's what it feels like.
It's like,

235
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,590
well if you're,
if you're projecting this image of

236
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,570
perfection and then it's like,
well no that's not really,

237
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,900
that's a lot of work to get the
Paparazzi that you hire to edit it and

238
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,160
then put it out like casually on the
beach.

239
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,170
In her defense it's a business or
businesses this looking,

240
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,940
I mean I don't even know.
It sounds like

241
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,110
I would just play a sentence to my child
and be like,

242
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,950
you know,
it doesn't matter to us.

243
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,290
You can say that.
You could say that,

244
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:24,210
but if you're a 16 year old girl and you
know you see her on television and you

245
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:28,530
see her popular at one time and there
certainly were people who looked hotter

246
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:33,150
but I still turned out okay and like I
don't by any means have a a perfect 10

247
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:34,240
bodies,
but she has confidence.

248
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,190
My body,
I don't have any problems with it and I

249
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:41,850
still ingested a lot of this kind of
like fluffy pop culture.

250
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,550
I actually love pop culture.
It's one of my favorite things,

251
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,020
like just inane information about
celebrities,

252
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,340
but this is a different kind of pop
culture because this is pop culture that

253
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,480
is famous for just being,
if this is what I would call it,

254
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,090
instagram culture,
like these instagram models and

255
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,130
everything,
you do have to be careful about that

256
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:03,510
because even I find myself at 32
flipping through instagram and going

257
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:04,500
like,
wow,

258
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:07,080
there's a lot of work to do.
There was some dude,

259
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,880
I don't know who he was,
some black guy,

260
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,220
I don't know.
He was,

261
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,260
he just was some funny dude who had this
video post about instagram girls saying,

262
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:19,020
I want to thank all my fans.
He goes,

263
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:19,830
Yo,
listen,

264
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,140
you don't have fans.
I'm just a pervert.

265
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm not your fan.
He goes,

266
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,230
and if you keep showing pictures of your
ass,

267
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,210
I'll keep looking because I'm like that
shit.

268
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,550
Stop pretending that you've got some
talent,

269
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,760
people who love you.
That's uncomfortable

270
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,230
talent to have fans though.
Sadly,

271
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,130
you just gotta be hot.
I sometimes,

272
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,310
there are people who I'm just fans of
their ass.

273
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,510
You're not fans of anyone's ass bodies.
I guess I'm a fan of looking at Kim

274
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,730
Kardashian and I have no problem with
saying no.

275
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:54,190
I am enjoying funny.
That's where my point was pointing

276
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,180
it out.
Like you're like,

277
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,350
well,
let's go break it down.

278
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,560
Specifically.
Don't put me on this hierarchy of a fan.

279
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,570
I'm a down to,
you're jerking off team a bedroom.

280
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,340
Yeah.
I'm a fan of certain musicians.

281
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,170
Right,
exactly.

282
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,930
I don't follow you around this.
Some people do,

283
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:08,291
but yeah,
no.

284
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,650
Karen was always very naturally
confident and she's the only person I

285
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,840
know that's a woman that has actually
confident,

286
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,040
Eh,
you eat my snow.

287
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,990
Someone else they way.
No,

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,320
just like the way you are confident is
very unique because she truly doesn't

289
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,360
give a shit.
And I only talent and everyone comes up

290
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:26,650
to me and they're like,
it's Krinn.

291
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:27,910
Quinsig really insecure.
Right?

292
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,380
I'm like,
she's honestly not.

293
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,590
Thank you.
That's very nice.

294
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,420
Are you a confident,
are you insecure?

295
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,000
What's your insecurities?
Um,

296
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm pretty confident,
I guess,

297
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,550
but everyone's insecure little,
a little bit of your own mortality.

298
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,210
You worry about all sorts of things.
We're going to die.

299
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm constantly worried about that
constantly.

300
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,800
We're worried about everything.
You worried about your health,

301
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:55,060
you're worried about social status
position in society,

302
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,610
your friends worry about your health is
an insecurity though.

303
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:02,010
That's just carry the Kale security.
Like it's,

304
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,580
it's a broad definition,
isn't it?

305
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:06,160
Like we have to think of insecurity.
What do you think of just like how

306
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,250
people perceive you that don't know you?
I think it's,

307
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,230
you know,
constantly trying to make up for

308
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:15,030
something that you feel like you're
lacking in an area you're lacking in.

309
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,150
So a lot of people aren't confident in
their intelligence there.

310
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,080
How funny.
We know whatever occupation you are that

311
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,730
you're not the best in it.
I mean,

312
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,340
I constantly think I have things to work
on.

313
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,950
I'll never be satisfied until I'm the
best,

314
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:30,790
which will never happen.

315
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,800
So it's just a constant loop,
the best,

316
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,560
uh,
anything existing,

317
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,300
existing,
anything I want to do,

318
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:38,470
I want,
like I want to try to do.

319
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,870
And I don't,
I tend not to do things if I don't think

320
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,870
that I can excel in them,
which is why I don't have fun.

321
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
It's so true.
It's very true.

322
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:49,210
You don't have any fun.
We did go to universal studios

323
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,320
yesterday.
That was fun.

324
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:51,460
What do you mean by you don't have any
fun?

325
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,900
I don't,
I mean I don't,

326
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,970
I don't like fun.
What?

327
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,810
Yeah,
I have like a,

328
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,620
I have a bit about how I don't like fun
and I,

329
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:58,780
and I don't know,
I just,

330
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,700
I like working as opposed to fun,
like just frivolous fun.

331
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,770
If I feel like it's like a waste of like
just hanging out.

332
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:09,160
I have a hard time just like hanging out
like a hard time relaxing because we're

333
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,000
not doing something.

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,740
That's why I like hanging out with
Christina because me and my friend,

335
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,550
but we're also getting work done at the
same time or in universal.

336
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,450
We were in line,
we were creating the intro for the show

337
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,010
last night and we were all always were
always working.

338
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,070
Yeah,
that's cool.

339
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,200
But then I discovered psychedelics and I
feel like that's the only kind of like

340
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,650
that's the release that I need.
Hmm.

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,370
So you don't enjoy like recreational
activities?

342
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:30,220
Like you don't want to go fishing or
whitewater rafting.

343
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,210
So I feel like that is productive
because I'm making my body stronger.

344
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,580
So I do like stuff like that.
This is very analytical,

345
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:39,350
has to be a purpose to it.
I mean

346
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,510
I like skiing but it's because I was
like,

347
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,760
I'm doing something,
I'm learning a new skill.

348
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,760
I'm getting exercise.
Want a party with that girl?

349
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,171
No.
Yeah,

350
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,004
no.
I mean,

351
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,010
Gosh,
I mean unless

352
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm drinking,
which yeah,

353
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,040
like dmt or some shit.
Yeah.

354
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,650
Then that's super fun.
She's so sweet when she's drunk.

355
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,200
It's so weird cause she like gives you
compliments and you'd never hear a

356
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,000
compliment from her and she,
she's like,

357
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,770
you like look really good tonight,
Christina.

358
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:04,650
I'm like,
bitch,

359
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,560
you wasted.
You always look good though.

360
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:09,350
I think it's important to just space out
compliments so that they're really

361
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,420
powerful when you space them out.
Yeah.

362
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,000
When you give them that ration them.
Yes,

363
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:14,661
yes,
yes.

364
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:19,000
Exactly.
Interesting you see,

365
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,490
you seem,
you seem interested like what is going

366
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:23,750
on in your head right now?
Nothing.

367
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,670
Just trying to figure out why.
You know,

368
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,290
why you would issue fun,
why you would,

369
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,180
I mean it's not,
it's not a bad thing.

370
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,000
That's great that you're going to get
more work done but it has it served you

371
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:35,450
well?

372
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,370
Yes.
I mean we're sitting here because of a

373
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:44,570
great name for a podcast by the way.
I use you guys an example all the time

374
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,230
and when you do people email us,
they tweet us and we go up like 10

375
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,810
positions of the podcast charts.
All of them.

376
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:52,610
Like God Dad,
I know my manager was like the Rogan

377
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:54,120
bump.
I was like so cool.

378
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,930
I usually guys,
this is a great example of people that

379
00:15:56,931 --> 00:16:00,080
didn't have like a big social media
profile or a big,

380
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,320
you weren't on big TV shows or podcasts
shot up because it's good cause it's

381
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,490
fun.
I like how you guys banter with each

382
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:09,560
other too.
You almost finish each other's sentences

383
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,870
and you almost talk over each other but
you don't.

384
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,470
It's like you have like you have a
thought and you'll interject with your

385
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,260
thought while you're having a thought
and then you pick up your thought right

386
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:18,680
after her.

387
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,760
It's like you guys have a ads.
We've been working together for many

388
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,240
years before the podcast so I think and
there was a lot of episodes of guys we

389
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,650
fucked that I'd have to go back and
listen to.

390
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:31,490
It will be very embarrassed by how many
times I interrupted the fucking guests

391
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,830
or her and so it's hard,
right?

392
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:37,580
When you're enthusiastic and you're in
his car and someone's talking,

393
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,290
you don't know when to do it.
Yeah,

394
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,460
but a secret twin language,
we've said like the same sentence,

395
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,670
a long sentence at the same time and
it's very creepy.

396
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,030
We'll talk with our eyes when we're
doing like a live show and know exactly

397
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:53,210
what,
what the next thing we need to do is now

398
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,430
when you say you guys worked together
before he did the podcast,

399
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,440
what'd you do?
We are a comedy duo is called,

400
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,400
sorry about last night.

401
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,080
So we did a standup shows me,
we were produced,

402
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,940
we the two woman show at UCB.
We would do sketches,

403
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,410
video sketches,
just shit.

404
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,270
Anything we thought was funny,
and this was one of the,

405
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,250
the impetus for the podcast was a
breakup crane got dumped in a Panera

406
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,870
bread and it was like the worst I've
ever seen anybody handle a breakup

407
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,410
meeting.
Like it really took a toll on her and it

408
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:22,410
was not good.
She doesn't show a lot of emotion.

409
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:23,840
So I'd like to see her cry.
I was like,

410
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,030
Oh shit.
And then one day she texted me,

411
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:27,560
she's like,
we should just interview every guy we've

412
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,450
ever fucked.
We'll do that on a podcast,

413
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,830
which is called guys we fucked.
And I was like,

414
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,080
yeah,
actually that's,

415
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,190
yeah,
that's good.

416
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,240
I like how you call,
you call it an anti slut shaming podcast

417
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,300
too.
Yeah.

418
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,930
That's why that was my addition.
That needs to stop.

419
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,740
It's a ridiculous,
it's ridiculous.

420
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,320
And also you need to stop slut shaming
yourself.

421
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,860
I think a lot of people do that to
themselves.

422
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,180
And I got to say like I feel like guys
we fucked is the female Viagra because

423
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,880
it gets,
women have written us like I want to go

424
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:59,760
out and have sex cause now I know how to
communicate what I want.

425
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,740
I know it's not weird to say what I
want.

426
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,281
It's not,
I don't,

427
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,490
I'm not a slut if I sleep with somebody
on the first date or have a one night

428
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,650
stand and it's like,
that's really cool.

429
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,710
Well,
I think this country,

430
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,320
we still have the echoes of the puritans
that landed here.

431
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:11,951
I mean,
yeah,

432
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:16,630
there's some weird sexual politics that
go on in this country.

433
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:20,890
There's some weird way that we have a
viewing sex that I think is directly

434
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,500
connected to the original way this
country was founded.

435
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,930
Oh,
he's like some serious pr prudishness

436
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:29,230
that exists in America.
It doesn't exist in other places and

437
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,880
some people here,
it's a good thing because they think

438
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,410
that we get more work done because of
it.

439
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,620
That our society is more geared towards
productivity and getting ahead as

440
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:41,040
opposed to some societies that don't.
But if you,

441
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,160
if you stifle a part of yourself though,
that's going to come out somehow.

442
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:48,190
And that's why people sexually assault,
say the repression.

443
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,520
I think black people act out sexually in
any religion,

444
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:54,250
any religion that oppresses people that
were leaving.

445
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,140
It's like you're going to explode one
day.

446
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,213
Catholicism.

447
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,820
I mean,
it's the classic example and there's,

448
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,910
if there was as many people in Nascar
that fuck kids as Catholic priests,

449
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,550
how quick would they shut down Nascar?
Yes.

450
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:09,070
Very quickly.
Like religion is so controlling,

451
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,710
but you can watch documentary after
documentary,

452
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:12,311
you know,
the whole,

453
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,990
do you know the whole story about
ratzinger?

454
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:16,240
Who was the last pope?
He was,

455
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,370
uh,
he was wanted for crimes against

456
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,240
humanity.
I mean,

457
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,810
it's got literally cannot leave Rome if
he goes to certain places.

458
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,300
He could be tried for pro crimes against
humanity.

459
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,620
What he did when he was a bishop or
whatever the fuck the position they

460
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:32,020
call,
he was taking priests that were

461
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:36,280
molesting kids and covering it up and
moving them to another parish.

462
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,900
He moved one priest to a place where he
molested 100 deaf kids.

463
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,580
Oh God.
Damn.

464
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,050
Yeah.
And this was a hundred percent factual,

465
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,790
proven,
non speculative.

466
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,120
I mean he's,
he's responsible for moving these people

467
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:55,300
and the number of Catholic priests,
I mean,

468
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:57,100
first of all,
there's gotta be some Catholic priests

469
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,920
out there who were wonderful people and
I'm sorry you get lumped into this,

470
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,450
but the sheer number of Catholic priests
that have been involved in most dating,

471
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,680
molesting kids,

472
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,220
fucking stunning.
It's terrifying.

473
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,540
Yeah.
We had a guy emailed us,

474
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,790
so it was in Boston.
It was molested by one of the priests

475
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,950
and he got interviewed on the,
on the,

476
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,120
by the,
by that breaking piece about them,

477
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,280
we get w one thing I've learned from
doing guys,

478
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,350
we fucked all that.
I that really surprised me.

479
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,480
I feel like 85% of the population has
either been molested as children or

480
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,840
raped or sexually assaulted in some way.
Like some big way.

481
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,640
Not just like groping.
Yeah.

482
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,620
And it's,
I had no idea it was that common.

483
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,880
And then I thought back,
I'm like,

484
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,070
shit,
I get like one time I went to this

485
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:38,790
doctor because I had to get blood work.
So I picked a general doctor and he was

486
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,750
like,
it was this old man.

487
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:40,970
He's like,
I'm gonna give you a breast exam.

488
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,670
I was like,
Huh,

489
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,900
okay.
And then I,

490
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,990
and he went real slow with it and then I
left.

491
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,250
I had put my shirt back on and I,
when I left the doctor's

492
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,350
office and I was walking home and I was
like,

493
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,340
wait a second.
Ah God damn it.

494
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,060
I was so,
and I was like,

495
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,050
I'll let that slide.
And then I turned into a bit,

496
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,550
I was like,
you ever been sexually assaulted?

497
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,960
But she didn't realize until afterwards
there's been a series of doctors that

498
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,370
had been arrested for drug in their
patients and then molesting whether

499
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,770
under camera's like some patients with
suspected it.

500
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,700
And so they had done the investigation
and put hidden cameras and caught the

501
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,370
doctors feeling them.
I even caught doctors having sex with

502
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:22,950
patients while they were under.
These are things that I may be just a

503
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,990
neat to know.
There's some fucking creeps out there.

504
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,830
I know you're from Jersey as well.
I was born there,

505
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,930
but I only lived there toe seven cause I
was like,

506
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:36,250
my grandfather was in the hospital for
cancer when that angel of death,

507
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,650
I don't know if you heard about this
doctor that coming around like killing

508
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:42,620
people and we're pretty,
we're pretty sure that's what happened.

509
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,760
My grandfather died like pretty
abruptly.

510
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,390
My Mom's gonna kill me.
But she had said something to me

511
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,760
privately,
and I guess it was just two of settings.

512
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,790
You can't trust anybody.
It's not that you can't trust anybody.

513
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,120
He's like,
you're going to run into so many people

514
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,150
that if,
just like we were talking before the

515
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:07,720
podcast started about social media,
but like one out of 10 if you have nine

516
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:10,630
people that are awesome and then one out
of 10 is just a fucking creep,

517
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,630
you get upset.
God dammit.

518
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,290
Now think about running into people.
How many hundreds of people you run

519
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,120
into.
All it takes is one creep.

520
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,760
And so it's not that you can't trust
people,

521
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,570
it's just like you're going to run into
a certain amount of creeps just based on

522
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:29,800
the numbers.
The majority of people are not sexual

523
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:33,910
predators are not giant pieces of shit,
but the ones that are really stick out.

524
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,060
I think what you're talking about too is
big too about the suppression.

525
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,050
I think the suppression,
any sort of suppression of desires,

526
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,740
it,
it fosters that sort of creepy behavior.

527
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,130
It builds up and it looks for some sort
of an outlet.

528
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,170
And that outlet comes out in really
weird ways.

529
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:54,430
Like I have a friend,
well Jim Norton Pretty Open about it.

530
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,580
He loves dominatrix,
he gets,

531
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,930
he goes to them and all that kind of
shit.

532
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:02,470
And one of the things that he tells me
is that these ladies say that a giant

533
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:06,010
percentage of their business is like
really powerful ceos,

534
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,360
buttoned down men who have to like be in
control all the time,

535
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,430
have to,
you know,

536
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,740
have a very rigid,
uh,

537
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,590
profile that they're projecting to their
company.

538
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:22,591
And that these guys love to get shit on,
kicked in the balls and the love to be

539
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:24,640
told what to do.
Work hard,

540
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:27,190
play hard.
What's in there,

541
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,163
right?
It's,

542
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,550
there's a,
there's a thing that's happening to

543
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:32,950
people when you have to pretend to be
something that you're not.

544
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,030
Oh yeah.
That's why you find a lot of Ortho.

545
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm Jewish and so like a lot of orthodox
Jewish men are veil.

546
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,430
There's a lot of,
you know,

547
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:44,930
hiring sex workers and it download and a
lot of,

548
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,310
I mean this is a very

549
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,130
broad statement to make,
but you know a lot of touching on the

550
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,520
subway kind of behavior.
You just see it more.

551
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,220
Did you see the,
they're making sex robots that would

552
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,630
look really,
they look like actual women.

553
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:01,290
I mean you could tell it's a robot but
it's,

554
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,620
it looks very close.
And I was thinking like,

555
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:06,890
because women have,
I think with women they oppress

556
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:09,500
themselves with their own sexuality and
I'm like man,

557
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,170
women are the ones that should be
getting this sex dolls because then we

558
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:15,380
can feel what it's like to have sex
without giving a shit what the person

559
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,930
we're having sex with.
Thanks cause it's a fucking doll.

560
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,350
And you could really go buck wild and
let loose and be vulnerable.

561
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,220
Be Vulnerable.

562
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,830
Brian,
if you can use a vibrator,

563
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:25,420
you could use a robot.
Yeah.

564
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,300
Oh,
I would love just sex robot.

565
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,850
But the robot do foreplay.
I have to get one of those toilet seats.

566
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:34,714
And then maybe,
yeah,

567
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,200
these are dolls though.
These are guys who choose dolls is their

568
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:40,420
life partners.
I did an article,

569
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,090
whatever you want to do,
what?

570
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:46,660
I wrote this article,
this guy contacted me and he told me he

571
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:51,661
had severe acne when he was young and
then he's disfigured and he's never had

572
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:53,590
sex with a woman.
And this is why.

573
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:54,370
And he said,
if you want,

574
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,920
if you want to ask me some questions,
I'd be happy to answer you.

575
00:24:56,921 --> 00:25:00,520
It was all anonymously through email.
So he and I started going back and forth

576
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:01,810
about this,
you know,

577
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,860
cause he was upset that at the article
that I was mocking these guys that think

578
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:07,270
that this is their girlfriend.
Okay,

579
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,450
I see where you're coming from.
Yeah,

580
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,510
I see his point too though.
Imagine if you were just,

581
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,600
he has an insecurity and he didn't want
to be vulnerable with a person because

582
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:19,210
you're risking the rejection and that
rejection hurts.

583
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:21,970
But I feel like in addition to the
repression thing though,

584
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:25,030
I think masculinity,
I watched this documentary called I'm

585
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,220
the mask I live in on Netflix.
It's so good.

586
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,720
And it points out these little things
that little boys pick up like a,

587
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,230
um,
you know,

588
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,190
I was at a pool with my friend one
summer and this dad was trying to get

589
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:37,450
his son to jump in the pool and he was
like,

590
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,500
come on,
don't be a girl.

591
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:39,520
Jumped in the pool.
And then,

592
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:42,640
then he jumped in with those little tiny
things get in your head.

593
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,890
And it gets to the point where when
you're a grown man,

594
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:48,940
you feel like you deserve pussy.
Or the getting pussy or getting girls is

595
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:50,500
gonna make you up,
you know,

596
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,260
raise in status and that's,
that's

597
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,520
fucked up.
It's also a code kind of a perpetuating

598
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,400
cycle because if you're an idiot and you
raise kids that are idiots,

599
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,310
you know what I mean?
If your parents were dumb and they

600
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,680
raised you,
you might have some really shitty ideas

601
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:06,060
in your head that you've got to iron
out.

602
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,620
Yeah.
And sometimes it takes like a lot of

603
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:11,280
life experience to figure out what those
are and how to get them out.

604
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,410
If you,
if you ever are self aware of it.

605
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:14,760
And I feel like people go through their
whole lives,

606
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:17,130
they never know 100%.
I mean there's a lot of people you run

607
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:19,530
into that are 70 that are like,
I was watching this,

608
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:20,570
um,
um,

609
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,430
video on youtube.
This guy looked like he was in his late

610
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,030
sixties,
and it was,

611
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,970
um,
giving some Asian guy a hard time on the

612
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:30,300
bus and he was saying all this ratio.
I watch that too.

613
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,580
He and I was like,
Jesus Christ,

614
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:34,860
this is an old guy,
old guy.

615
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,340
He also seemed a little not,
yeah,

616
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,360
he was a little mentally unstable.
I think that night I saw that video

617
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,040
actually,
there

618
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,960
was a guy doing the same thing to a
black,

619
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,270
uh,
that was at a Panera bread and there's

620
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:49,460
this black guy.
I was working there and,

621
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,910
but it's always an opinion.
We're trying to get them to sponsor our

622
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:57,990
tour
gift cards instead and give them out as

623
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,900
prizes is that just show
dealt with this guy.

624
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,790
But he wasn't old but he was saying the
n word like re like very,

625
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,890
I was like,
I want to intervene but I,

626
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:10,770
he might stab me,
just say that about someone to the,

627
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,340
to the employee and the employee was
trying to brush it off.

628
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,730
I'm like,
Oh God damn it.

629
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,500
That sucks.
And he was obviously,

630
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,750
I don't know what the hell was up with
him mentally,

631
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,720
but he had some,
some issues and he was talking to

632
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,120
himself and smacking himself and pushed
his chair over and picking it back up.

633
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,580
And I was like,
you need to get the fuck outta here man.

634
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,470
And then I like kind of like went away.
I'm like,

635
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:29,670
don't hit me.
And,

636
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,440
but then he eventually left,
but I was like,

637
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,230
fine line.
Like when do you intervene if someone's

638
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:38,320
mentally unstable?
You can't fix them now to shame them.

639
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,070
They're talking to voices that aren't
even talking to them.

640
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,990
You know,
if you say,

641
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,190
hey,
you need to get the fuck outta here.

642
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,270
Then they decided to shoot you and then
you're done.

643
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,020
Then employee like he know,
he realized that the guy wasn't there

644
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,590
like all there hopefully and was like,
this doesn't,

645
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,830
this doesn't matter.
This guy in the subway figured that out

646
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:57,960
too.
He was so chill.

647
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,080
Gay was,
I seen that a lot in New York City

648
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,720
though.
People that seem disturbed and then just

649
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:07,110
going off on racist rants to people or
their faces.

650
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,340
I'm like,
Damn.

651
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,770
A lot of homophobic grants I've seen
too,

652
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,000
like was straight up to gay people,
but I mean again,

653
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,170
people who are,
who are,

654
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:19,980
as you say off,
I mean there was a guy not too long ago

655
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,230
who just went up to the man sitting next
to me and he was like,

656
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,700
Yo,
I saw you looking at me.

657
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,230
You're looking at me.
I'm not like that.

658
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:28,470
I'm not going to fuck you and this and
this young woman,

659
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,690
this young woman did very much like
Kristina and I'm kind of just thinking

660
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:37,740
in my head,
I love to step in but that was not one

661
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:41,310
some ways mentally unstable,
it's we just all realized like,

662
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,720
okay,
we're not going to take anything this

663
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,320
person saying to heart so boys are so
weird cause you jam and that little

664
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,060
thing with people and they know you
can't get out.

665
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,500
That feeling of vulnerability is always
in the air and because of that people

666
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,360
that are fucked up,
we'll take advantage of that.

667
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,040
It's also a great,
great place for sexual assault.

668
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,980
Like all,
most of the sexual assaults I've

669
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:03,360
experienced have been on the subway,
just hard cox elbow in the motorway

670
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,840
stomach versus when you're on the subway
late at night and there's not many

671
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:09,900
people in the car and then you'll look
up across from you and there's this guy

672
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,510
with his hand down his pants.
He's going to town on his dick and

673
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,590
you're like,
I want to die.

674
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,110
And you make eye contact with them and
you're like fuck.

675
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,190
Or when someone sits right next to you
when there's absolutely no reason to do

676
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,080
that.
Yeah,

677
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,590
yeah,
yeah,

678
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,770
yeah,
man.

679
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:23,910
Yeah.
Wash it happens on the subway.

680
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:28,230
I've seen people take his shit
multiple times.

681
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,180
Once on the platform.
They just take a shit early in the

682
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,800
morning,
his bathroom usage time.

683
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,110
If you don't have a bathroom to go to in
the subway.

684
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,720
So do they do it on the floor to do the
over the edge?

685
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,770
On the floor?
On the floor.

686
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:41,950
I don't have that Guy Kersey.

687
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,460
C'Mon.
Yeah.

688
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,170
They don't want to get hurt like
homeless people?

689
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,630
I think so.
I would say yes,

690
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,310
but maybe one or two of them haven't
been.

691
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:50,790
I don't know.
We're just in a hurry or they be staging

692
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,800
caveman.
How many people have you seen shit on

693
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:58,090
the floor for?
Wow.

694
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,100
You've more than me.
I think I only saw two.

695
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,910
How many masturbator is have you seen?
Endless.

696
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,400
Ruined my favorite Mcdonald's for me
once I've ruined it.

697
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:07,990
Audition.
This guy like an Ellis,

698
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,620
he had like elephant titus of the Dick.
He's Dick.

699
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,560
He had sweatpants on,
but it was like a process.

700
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,830
It was like the size of that bar that
would inbox in his pants and I'm like,

701
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,190
no way.
And then he was like,

702
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
I'm like,
oh no,

703
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,460
totally fucked up the audition in the
pants,

704
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,870
but his hands were outside of the pants.

705
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,290
I don't know.
He was cradling it.

706
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,780
He's cradling it is just doing a little
jokey joke.

707
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,800
So I had a hard big cock.
He's one of those youtube pranksters

708
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,400
like that was his thing.
Hey,

709
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,810
if he was great prankster really thought
fucked you up for a couple of years.

710
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,450
Me Up for a while was just sell from
impractical jokers.

711
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,990
Trust.
Know that San Francisco,

712
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,660
they have such a problem with shitting
people shitting on this trip.

713
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,390
They have an APP,
they have an app where you could find

714
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:58,150
out where the human shit is and report
it so you could avoid it.

715
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,800
Yeah,
they have like piles.

716
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,990
San Francisco is super duper liberal
almost to the point where they're like

717
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,150
creative unless you want to share.
It's like they're just super open minded

718
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:12,820
lefties.
That's where we invited the homeless man

719
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:17,060
in San Francisco to do Karaoke with us,
but it was the best night ever lives

720
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,090
there and he was like,
well,

721
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,070
I think they're trying to combat that by
shitting on the street.

722
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,880
That's a good tactic to shit on the
street who areas that have been,

723
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,070
see there's like a can be near the
tenderloin.

724
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,240
Right.
That's probably where a lot of people

725
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:38,074
do.
They're shitting,

726
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,310
I love San Francisco by the way,
but one of the things about them is that

727
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,960
they're so progressive.
There's,

728
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:48,961
there's so left hard left that they just
tolerate shit on the street bowl in like

729
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:54,640
a really weird way.
The homeless people in San Francisco

730
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:59,620
tend to have a reputation of being
aggressive and we were a karaoke night

731
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,340
before I took the week cookie cookie of
dude,

732
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,020
I got it from a fan
now we've since learned

733
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,430
after our show here with her brother and
the

734
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,610
really fun and there was this homeless
guy comes up.

735
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,670
He was like dancing to the music and it
was like those scenes where everyone's

736
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:29,950
having a fun,
warm Christmas inside and then we'll

737
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,850
come in.
You want to dance.

738
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:40,130
We bought him beers,
went so well.

739
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,240
It was my brother reacted like you and
that's it.

740
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,630
Everybody else.
And then the match of the guys,

741
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:49,940
we fucked dowels.
Brought him in.

742
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,610
We did buy him a couple of beers and
then later found out he was an

743
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,620
alcoholic,
but he was already drunk.

744
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,240
So I was like,
Eh,

745
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,470
this is not the day that he was.
He was a veteran back on the wagon.

746
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,980
And I asked him about him and his life
and you know,

747
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,210
when was the last time you hung out
with?

748
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,190
Like,
I was just asking him about himself and

749
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:09,620
he seemed to really like the way he was
answering.

750
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,300
And it was like no one ever asked me
about me.

751
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,440
I'm like,
whoa.

752
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,030
He said it was like the best night of
his life.

753
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,400
And then he did mildly grew up
Christina.

754
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,590
Oh yeah.
But

755
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,940
again,
I wasn't on the week cookie at that

756
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:23,900
point.
Shit,

757
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,900
I really get groped a lot and I don't
know what situation.

758
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:28,670
It's like,
you know,

759
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,980
I grew up for your service.
Where did he grow up?

760
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:35,570
Me.
I love how I'm asking Kerryn where and

761
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:40,571
when I got slow,
I like a city released from the hug.

762
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:42,560
You know,
sometimes like normally when you hug,

763
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:46,840
you release out.
You don't have to slide to release a

764
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,670
minute.
Wait a minute.

765
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,770
He was drunk.
Right?

766
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,010
Who knows if he even knew what he was.
You know what?

767
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,500
I didn't care.
That was what he did pretty,

768
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:02,501
I'm pretty fluent in groping
millions of lines,

769
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,930
but she doesn't realize it.
Are you sure you have the same

770
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:10,490
definitions as her touching someone's
breast without them wanting you to

771
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:11,630
touch?
It is growing,

772
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,970
but it's tricky.
If you have someone,

773
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:18,740
you're holding them on the side and you
listen.

774
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,620
I'm not trying to know this guy lose his
cameo on house of cards.

775
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,473
It's fine.

776
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,020
I remember I say anything.
Then you're like,

777
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,260
no,
not the policy.

778
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,330
Hands off the
breast.

779
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:35,380
But you know,
it was an,

780
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,450
it was an area.
One of the areas I do remember going,

781
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,201
no,
no,

782
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:43,970
no.
Don't ruin yourself for me,

783
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:46,790
please.
You guys were hanging out.

784
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,260
You had a few drinks and he got feeling.
Yeah,

785
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,930
but I didn't get,
I didn't care.

786
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:53,300
I was happy that he had a good time and
he was smiling.

787
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,070
Not because he wasn't smiling because of
that.

788
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,550
Hopefully like a spectrum for sexual
assault.

789
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,413
Yes,
there is.

790
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,070
There's like the casual,
like not quite touched your breasts,

791
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:04,980
but hey,
you went to,

792
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,270
you grabbed me right here is getting,
this isn't a hug.

793
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,280
You using your hands is underwire.
Right

794
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,980
under tick on your hands is not good.
I could feel breasts on a hug.

795
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,780
Chest to chest hugs are good because his
hands move to good.

796
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,810
Even though you can feel it with your
chest.

797
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,440
You're not a hurricane.
A hugger.

798
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:32,420
Odd Girl.
No,

799
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,390
she is a good way
stream.

800
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,980
I,
it's strange

801
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,490
to hug someone the first time you meet
them without knowing anything about

802
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,400
them.
Like I w we shook hands and when I first

803
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:47,880
met you and I will now hug you on the
way out if I'm allowed with your

804
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,970
consent,
I want to consent.

805
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,390
The was going for the hug and I was
like,

806
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,870
I don't know why he's thinking I was
comfortable until you just used your

807
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:00,690
hands.
Is The underwire now I'm scared or did

808
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,524
this,

809
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,020
I'll tell you that I'm very sensitive.
Breasts on my crest.

810
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,450
Mckee hug me.
I don't really have a sensitive your

811
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,300
face Danny Dick Style.
Oh yeah.

812
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,260
When a guy for five years,
man that's over,

813
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:22,261
jerked off in front of me,
open the door once my trailing is

814
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,280
jerking off,
knocked on the door and let me open the

815
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:30,340
door and he's jerking off and get into
your trailer.

816
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,430
I don't know what he was doing.
He was either being silly,

817
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:36,370
which is andy or he was high as fuck,
which is Andy.

818
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,320
He was looking to fuck me,
which is also Andy.

819
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,810
Yeah,
he should have been a number of

820
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:43,990
different things.
Stephen and I might see him as my

821
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:44,711
boyfriend and,
and we've,

822
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,400
we've met Andy,
we hung out with a new bunch of,

823
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,430
and it'll say in front of Steve,
like when you get to leave your

824
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:49,950
boyfriend and come fight where to stop.

825
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,840
Something like really funny in front of
Steven and I fucking love it.

826
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,970
Like I just get funny dude.
He is,

827
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,630
but he's,
he has no filter and he has no control.

828
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,390
And he wants to sometimes and like he'll
go on,

829
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,380
like he did my podcast once and he was
talking about being sober.

830
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,490
He's like,
I'm sober now.

831
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,260
I'm really happy I go,
so you're going to stay sober.

832
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:09,340
He goes,
I don't know.

833
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,270
We'll just have to see how it plays out.
It was,

834
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:14,650
but it was also one of those things
where you,

835
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,010
you understand his mindset is not like
he,

836
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,850
he's embraced his lack of control and
some sort of strange way.

837
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:26,851
Instead of like trying to re formulate
the way he views the parameters that he

838
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,820
establishes what for him to have a
healthy,

839
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:34,600
happy life because he was living in his
ex wife's shed.

840
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,680
He had a podcast called shed lights like
that.

841
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,530
Yeah.
Turn it into a comedy turn.

842
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:43,270
Turn your shit.
The shit show.

843
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:46,090
That's what he called it.
His programming is great.

844
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:49,720
Does your also remember that reality TV
show called the ass assistant,

845
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,840
which is to this day one of the funniest
things I've ever seen.

846
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:55,330
It's right where you like abuse,
potential assistance.

847
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,360
Just funny physical,
what?

848
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,010
Back in the days when people could,
you know,

849
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,420
just appreciate physical assault for
what it was.

850
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,700
Yeah,
let's go back to that time.

851
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,550
It's not the same with him because he's
so crazy and you know it going in,

852
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,300
but still,
if you're standing next to him and then

853
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,860
he just reaches over and grabs your tit,
it's still wrong.

854
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,120
Of course.
I have a love for him in my heart that

855
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:22,220
I,
that part of who he is is like kind of

856
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,050
like,
you never know what he's going to do

857
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,310
kind of thing.
To me,

858
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,600
I don't have it in my hand when I hang
out with them.

859
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,880
Like is it going to assault me?
Like I never,

860
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:29,990
I don't never think that,
but it's,

861
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,940
what I love about him is he's very
unpredictable.

862
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,560
He's a sweet,
you know,

863
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,370
and he's super

864
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,770
talented.
Like I would do scenes together.

865
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:41,090
I would have to Redo the scene over and
over again cause I'd cry.

866
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah,
it'd be a real problem.

867
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,740
He's really talented.
Yeah.

868
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,700
Well,
the thing with him is,

869
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,230
yeah,
when we met him,

870
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,380
he was sober.
So we kind of went into it knowing sober

871
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,450
Andy Dick.
And we actually met him at,

872
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,770
I mean,
I think it's supposed to be called these

873
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:56,170
days Rehab facility.
It was a halfway house.

874
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,030
And we met him and he had just,
I reached out and to his agent's

875
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:04,360
assistant and he randomly agreed to do
our podcasts.

876
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:08,590
We met him in the music room of his a
rehab facility.

877
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,640
And he told us the only reason that he
agreed to do the podcast was because he

878
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,474
learned,
uh,

879
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,170
in a that as a,
as an alcoholic,

880
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:19,810
he's been really selfish,
wasted people's time,

881
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,300
hurt people.
And so he said yes to doing guys we

882
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:27,301
fucked because he was trying to make
amends for all the bad he had done it.

883
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,650
And I thought,
I just thought that was really nice.

884
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,260
Like what a,
what a nice reason to do something.

885
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:32,460
Right.

886
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,070
But he didn't do any bad to you guys.
It sounds more like you want it to be on

887
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:36,480
your podcast because it's popular.

888
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,320
No,
no,

889
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,153
he didn't.
No,

890
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,440
he had no fucking idea what it was.
This was a couple of years ago.

891
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:41,960
I know.
Right.

892
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,793
I miss,
you know,

893
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,653
he was in,
it was,

894
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,740
it was a Karma thing.
I mean,

895
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:46,090
yes,
we aren't the people he hurt,

896
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:49,390
but I think he was just trying to put
good out into the universe and I really

897
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,880
believed him and that's not something I
would normally believe is like a year

898
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:53,230
and a half,
two years ago we interviewed,

899
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:54,550
it was a while ago.
Yeah,

900
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,090
that makes sense.
Yeah.

901
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:58,760
I mean he's,
he's definitely had these moments of

902
00:39:58,761 --> 00:39:59,930
clarity.
Yeah.

903
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,360
Yeah.
Well it was funny when he got fired from

904
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:06,530
this movie recently for licking somebody
and you said a misconduct is my middle

905
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:07,364
name.

906
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,900
I agree.
He's such a fucking care.

907
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,530
Those I think about like,
uh,

908
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,050
the Wiva I have a monthly show that I
run in New York City,

909
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
uh,
where my friend and I opened it up as

910
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,200
characters,
uh,

911
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,490
need.
And Simone were like,

912
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:24,590
prostitutes.
And where we have a guy,

913
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,230
this guy will comes up and he intros us
every month.

914
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,530
And as I'll,
I'll smack his ass and I've been

915
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:33,800
thinking lately,
I'm like shit probably shouldn't do

916
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,370
that.
Huh?

917
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,950
Did you ask him if it's okay?
No I did it.

918
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:37,680
I just,
I,

919
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,400
I he doesn't did it mine or if he did,
he didn't tell me.

920
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:42,270
I mean he hasn't and we were were brand
new take on it

921
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,710
is my take on it.
There's a difference between girl doing

922
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,420
it to a guy because a girl can't rape a
guy.

923
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,640
This is,
you don't have a physical advantage over

924
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,580
dry them.
You could do anything shore if you drug

925
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,860
them.
But like smacking guy in the ass is very

926
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:55,840
different.
There were some women who are bigger

927
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:57,460
than some men.
Sure.

928
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,530
Yeah.
This is where those are outliers.

929
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,340
There is absolutely the most part.
There's a difference between a girl

930
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,380
doing something like that to a guy and
that's the difference.

931
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,310
Yeah.
Cause you're no fear for your life.

932
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,540
It's the physical threats.

933
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,460
Well,
I got a buddy of mine who was sexually

934
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:14,300
harassed by his boss was a woman and he
said it was super fucking disturbing

935
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:18,290
cause he's kind of introverted and is
his boss would grab his ass when he was

936
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,050
like getting coffee.
Oh go to the coffee machine and she'd

937
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:22,730
grab his ass,
he'd Joel.

938
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,990
And he was like really stunned and
worried about being around her and she

939
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:30,890
would tease him about him being approved
and he said it made it really

940
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,060
uncomfortable.
And he said,

941
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,020
now I know what like to be a woman.

942
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,730
And it was joking around about it,
but yeah.

943
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,450
Did you ever address it with her?
No,

944
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,360
I think he quit.
Okay.

945
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,230
One up quitting.
It was a situation where I was like,

946
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,310
you know,
he was,

947
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,660
he was below her in the,
the social food chain of the office.

948
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,990
She was his boss.
She could fire him and you know,

949
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,990
he wouldn't have any money and nobody
would ever believe that she had done

950
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,520
that to him.
There was no proof there was,

951
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:58,820
it was a weird sort of reversal of the
dynamics.

952
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,290
And then that anxiety got created and
he's working environment.

953
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,320
I feel like women with women,
it's like little things happen

954
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,750
throughout your life when you're a chick
that just,

955
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,910
they're not,
they don't make you feel unsafe.

956
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:09,744
It's just like,
ah,

957
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,640
I just want to go to the God damn
grocery store.

958
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:13,920
Can you knock off to me?
I just don't,

959
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,350
and then that all adds up.
Whether it's big things,

960
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,630
little things is,
and usually it's a combination of both

961
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,070
and then that adds up to the feeling
unsafe and then you hear stories and

962
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:24,300
then you're like,
oh fuck is.

963
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,180
Well the cosby thing freaked so many
fucking people out,

964
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,910
but I know a bunch of girls who've been
drugged.

965
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,950
I know a bunch of girls who have been at
a bar and then how to drink that someone

966
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:37,690
gave them,
then all of a sudden their legs started

967
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,524
giving out.
Right.

968
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,130
[inaudible] as far as Ruthie,
Ruthie,

969
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,410
yes.
This part ended there though.

970
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:47,620
But yeah,
I was somehow got,

971
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:49,120
my friends were with me.
It was at a bar,

972
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,150
my own birthday party,
a cup maybe when I was like 25 in that

973
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,590
year of 24,
25 and uh,

974
00:42:56,591 --> 00:42:59,260
I was pushed in my,
my friends pushed me in a cab because

975
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:00,550
they just thought I was like,
blackout drunk,

976
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:02,650
but I really had been roofing that
person's sins.

977
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:04,030
Committed suicide.
Yes.

978
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:05,950
I'm not the person who roofie do.
Yeah.

979
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:07,240
I'm not mad.
I knew who it was.

980
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:08,710
I'm not,
I'm not mad about it.

981
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,820
People are like,
aren't you angry?

982
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:10,391
I'm like,
no.

983
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:13,170
That person had demons so much bigger
than me getting roof.

984
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,190
He didn't,
I'm so thankful that nothing happened to

985
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:16,560
me.
Like I,

986
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,970
I feel honestly,
if that's what being a woman,

987
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,620
that when you get roofie to,
if you're lucky,

988
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:21,820
you don't get raped.

989
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,770
I feel lucky.
And that's being a woman.

990
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,010
Yeah.
It's weird to feel lucky that I've never

991
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:28,370
been raped.
It is.

992
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,880
It's a,
we're really luck because we hear about

993
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:31,211
it.
I mean,

994
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:33,730
now the public is hearing about how
often happens at Hollywood,

995
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:37,870
which a lot of us already knew.
But it happens in every economic status,

996
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:40,330
every class of people,
every eight.

997
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,150
It happens so much.
I mean we,

998
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,550
it's to the point where a couple of
times on our podcast,

999
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:48,910
I've said statistically there has to be
rapists listening to us.

1000
00:43:48,911 --> 00:43:52,000
Somebody listening to us has,
has raped somebody and I'm sure so

1001
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:55,060
fucking sick of hearing it.
But I hear from the victims all God damn

1002
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:57,850
day and I,
it doesn't help me get to the bottom of

1003
00:43:57,851 --> 00:43:59,650
why this is happening.
And so I'm like,

1004
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:02,750
if you're a rapist,
make a fake email and email is,

1005
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:06,000
because I helped me understand this
because I think about it all the time

1006
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:10,750
because we are constantly getting really
pourable heartbreaking emails about it.

1007
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,540
And we've had a couple of guys email us.
One Guy,

1008
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:14,950
uh,
was,

1009
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,780
uh,
he said he was really sick and tired of

1010
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:19,870
seeing other men be Douche bags to women
lie to women.

1011
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:23,740
And then they get laid.
And by the time he turned 30 he said he

1012
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:26,770
broke and he started putting ads out on
craigslist and then would rape the

1013
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,030
women.
Then he still does it.

1014
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,060
But I'm like,
the problem there is you felt entitled

1015
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,430
to a woman.
Okay.

1016
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:35,580
Because he was acting like an asshole
that has nothing to do with you.

1017
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,750
So I think that entitlement thing is,
is an important building block in what,

1018
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,760
why people do this?

1019
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,900
Well people start that.
One thing that does happen,

1020
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,710
I've seen with men as they get older,
as they start to associate women with

1021
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:52,480
pain because they get rejected and
because they didn't try to hit on girls

1022
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,060
and they get shit on and they get
rejected and they get angry.

1023
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,990
And then there's this antagonistic
relationship between women and them.

1024
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:03,520
They look at women as the enemy and then
they look at women as the cause of

1025
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,020
emotional pain and then they start to
insult them and say nasty shit to them.

1026
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:09,610
I've seen it.
I've seen it happen with guys where

1027
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:10,331
they,
you know,

1028
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:14,530
they start off kind of like carefree and
then as they get into their thirties and

1029
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:16,210
then they start getting more shitty and
then they,

1030
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,500
well you see the arc.
I've seen the arc.

1031
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,281
Yeah,
I've seen it.

1032
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:21,140
A couple of guys.
Are they your friends?

1033
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,040
No.
Okay.

1034
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,770
I was going to ask if you've ever talked
to them about that because one thing I

1035
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:27,260
think would help is if dudes were like,
hey,

1036
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,213
don't,
don't do that.

1037
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,000
Well,
one of the reason why I'm not friends

1038
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:32,280
with,
and one guy in particular is because of,

1039
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:34,560
uh,
extreme lack of awareness that became

1040
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:37,410
more and more apparent as he got older
where you couldn't talk to him about

1041
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:39,390
things.
And if you can't talk to some about

1042
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:40,970
things,
if they're doing something wrong and

1043
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,020
they're not going to ever learn,
and if they're not going to ever learn

1044
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:44,550
and grow,
you're always gonna have this weird

1045
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:45,820
blockade whenever you talk.

1046
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,940
I hate that.
Yeah,

1047
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,580
you can't talk to those people.
It's just not one system because that's

1048
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,260
what that's he should learn.
Like,

1049
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:53,780
hopefully if you lose it,
if his friends continued to do that and

1050
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:54,231
he's like,
wait,

1051
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:56,540
why the fuck weren't everybody go?
Some people deep

1052
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,610
seated trenches,
these,

1053
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:03,300
these defense mechanisms that they just
fall right into every time.

1054
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:05,400
And it's almost like they can't stay on
the edges.

1055
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,160
Yeah.
And whatever for whatever psychological

1056
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:08,731
reason.
I mean,

1057
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:10,770
I'm not a psychologist,
I don't know what's causing it,

1058
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:14,850
but there's,
there's a lot of men that I think as

1059
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:17,670
time goes on and they get,
maybe they're not attractive,

1060
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:19,470
maybe they're not successful.
Maybe it's both.

1061
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,350
But as time goes on,
they get more and more resentful and

1062
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:23,250
angry about women.

1063
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,490
Yeah.
Sometimes man,

1064
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:26,080
we meet men that are,
you know,

1065
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,270
and it's not often,
but you meet them and you're like,

1066
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,970
you hate women,
you hate women.

1067
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,110
And a lot of times I've been doing this
lately when we get like shitty things

1068
00:46:35,111 --> 00:46:36,820
said to us on twitter,
uh,

1069
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:38,620
all respond back with like,
uh,

1070
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,840
you know,
with a really nice thing to say,

1071
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,160
like a compliment.
And then he'll,

1072
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:43,840
it'll like break them down and be like,
Oh,

1073
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:45,040
who's brief on phony?
And I'm like,

1074
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:45,761
okay.
You know,

1075
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,970
and it's because to me when I see a man
do that,

1076
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,290
when they do it,
to me personally,

1077
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,090
it's hard not to take it personal,
but that's,

1078
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,840
it's not a personal thing.
They're projecting what they feel

1079
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,340
do that to me all the time and they're
doing it because they just want to get a

1080
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,200
reaction out of you.
And one of the best ways to get a

1081
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,850
reaction down to you and make you feel
bad.

1082
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,900
Yeah,
that's true.

1083
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,810
If they say something nice to you,
you don't respond,

1084
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:06,770
you know?
And then,

1085
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,860
oh,
I just retweeted it.

1086
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,330
Well let me try it.
Let me just,

1087
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,780
I want it to be honest.
Maybe they try to respond.

1088
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,650
Thank you josh.
Bond everybody.

1089
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:18,570
Right?
What,

1090
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,290
when guys do that to you?
Like what?

1091
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:24,370
What are the flag tries to say mean
things Meghan call you a loser or

1092
00:47:24,371 --> 00:47:25,204
whatever.
And you know,

1093
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,790
there's always someone who's trying to
push a button.

1094
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,170
Yes,
I mean mean,

1095
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,130
but why

1096
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,650
do they do that?
This is the only reason cause they're

1097
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:34,780
losers.
There's no one is like a happy,

1098
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:39,130
fulfilled person who hates on twitter.
Doesn't exist.

1099
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,110
Do that exactly.
I mean maybe you like I'm going to

1100
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,740
dedicate five minutes a day to be in a
cut.

1101
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,690
I'm just gonna go online.
I'm going to shit on people.

1102
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Then I'm might go after cut times over.
I'm going to just go water the garden

1103
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:54,370
and be nice to everybody and be very
cathartic copies.

1104
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:58,870
You wouldn't do it.
People need to squeeze in some current

1105
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:01,210
time in their day.
I really think

1106
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,270
the social media version of a rage room
where it's not really hurting anybody

1107
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,580
and no it's no one's actual dishes.
You're breaking,

1108
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:13,240
someone's just bought at a thrift store
and then you can let it out and then you

1109
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:17,080
can let your punching back cause God,
John Ronson is one of the smartest

1110
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:19,840
people we've ever had the honor of
talking to him and was super cry and

1111
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:23,890
he's like when are we going to stop
making people are play thing or what?

1112
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,880
What was the quote a week?
People are play things or play toys like

1113
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:32,881
another quote that I don't know.
It exists in chickens.

1114
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,020
You know,
like I have chickens and one of the

1115
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:38,050
things you always hear about chickens is
the thing called the pecking order.

1116
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,650
That shit is real as fuck and I,
we have a big chicken coop,

1117
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:46,030
we have 22 chickens and one things that
happens is the chickens will find the

1118
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:47,890
smallest chicken.
They fucked that chicken.

1119
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,350
Oh my gosh.
The other chickens will pile on and

1120
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:54,340
they'll chase the chicken around and
peck it for no reason and sound like the

1121
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:56,770
chicken.
So anything like it's just a smallest

1122
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:59,170
chicken because the chicken die
sometimes.

1123
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,350
Sometimes chickens die and the other
ones will peck at the whole,

1124
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,790
Oh my God.
And try to eat it.

1125
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,620
Pitches being crazy terrifies her dogs
and dogs.

1126
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:09,454
It exists.

1127
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,140
There's the Alpha and then there's the
Betas,

1128
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,880
wolf packs.
It exists.

1129
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:18,190
I mean it's just a normal thing about
nature where when humans see someone

1130
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:22,000
who's weak,
you have to work very hard to resist the

1131
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,720
urge to go get the fuck Outta here,
get your shit together,

1132
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:27,880
Pussy,
stop fucking crying like that.

1133
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,530
That instinct to be cruel to someone
whose week is like genetically

1134
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:36,310
predisposed and people,
it's a part of what made the genes of

1135
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:41,140
the stronger people keep moving and ones
that were weak and they couldn't handle

1136
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:44,470
emotional stress and then they were
shunned when they were pushed out of the

1137
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:47,440
community.
But we're finding now with this new

1138
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:51,790
society that live when we live in where
people are able to gather information

1139
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:55,780
and communicate and doing things that
don't even involve like person to person

1140
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:59,320
contact is that these people who are
introverts and these people that are shy

1141
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:02,650
and maybe even like socially awkward or
have are a huge problem with

1142
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:05,140
confrontation and you would consider
them week.

1143
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,580
They have a type of creativity that
doesn't exist in the Alphas.

1144
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,440
They have a type of creativity and they
have a perspective and it may be in an

1145
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,590
introspective way of approaching things
that is super valuable to like computer

1146
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:25,531
coding to a lot of other things that you
would normally think of as being um,

1147
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,090
well they're not even normally think of,
but it's

1148
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,100
there.
There are alternative methods of

1149
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:31,550
thinking.

1150
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,640
You would perceive that an outgoing
person would perceive that as like what

1151
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:35,640
are you an idiot or something?
Well,

1152
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:36,530
they don't exist in the [inaudible]

1153
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,830
normal paradigm.
Like the,

1154
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,300
like if you look at human societies up
until like the last couple hundred

1155
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,560
years,
you're dealing with people that have

1156
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:46,650
these hardworking jobs.
There's a few artists,

1157
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:48,660
musicians and painters and things along
those lines.

1158
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:51,330
But most of what you're doing,
if you're not a craftsperson,

1159
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,940
hard labor,
very difficult jobs.

1160
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,980
There's no computer coding.
There's no,

1161
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,630
there's no,
well there's so many of these

1162
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,080
alternative positions as far as like the
way the human mind works that were never

1163
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,020
available to someone who lived three,
four,

1164
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,330
500 years ago.
So we're finding value,

1165
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,220
we're finding value in different kinds
of thinking and people with a different

1166
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:18,030
people that are on the spectrum,
asperger's and autism artist,

1167
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,930
while they have a different sort of
intelligence and we are looking at them

1168
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:24,450
as if there's something wrong with them
because they don't,

1169
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:28,290
they don't interact with people in the
same way as most people do emotionally.

1170
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,720
And sometimes they have like a real
difficult funding,

1171
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:33,930
difficult time finding emotional and
social bonds with people.

1172
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,900
But when it comes to numbers,
when it comes to a lot of other things,

1173
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:38,340
some of these people,
not all of them,

1174
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:42,600
but some of them excel at those things
in a way that a lot of people can't,

1175
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,910
aren't even capable of.
That's one of the things they say about

1176
00:51:44,911 --> 00:51:47,310
people in Silicon Valley that work in a
lot of,

1177
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,180
a lot of these um,
jobs that involve computer coding and

1178
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,140
programming and things along that lines.
You have a giant percentage of the

1179
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:57,560
people that are on the spectrum.
Jonathan like it,

1180
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:59,820
it might be like 90 [inaudible] works
there,

1181
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:00,450
but he's,
yeah,

1182
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,690
he's not,
he is mike much,

1183
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:04,590
much more social than me.
You're not interacting with people a lot

1184
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:05,600
in that job.
Yeah.

1185
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,680
That makes sense.
That your bullock excel at that they

1186
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:08,514
want done.

1187
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,250
You know,
I think we have to realize that this is

1188
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,350
like if it was for you,
the three of us,

1189
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:16,290
there'd be no fucking cell phones cause
we were on a deserted island.

1190
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,960
You could live forever.
The three of us,

1191
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,960
we live forever,
whether it's his or her daughter and

1192
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:24,000
shit.
The animals.

1193
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah.
I've started a fire.

1194
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,420
Yeah.
And we'd,

1195
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,300
I'd show you how to kill animals and
maybe you guys could show me some

1196
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:31,460
emotional intelligence.
Yeah,

1197
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,120
yeah.
We can talk about working on feelings.

1198
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,670
I could make you a beautiful,
like a mask for your face.

1199
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:37,780
You'd have great skin.
Oh yeah.

1200
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:43,470
The urge to be cruel to someone who's
weaker than you has to be resisted in,

1201
00:52:44,191 --> 00:52:47,250
in any sort of a comfortable society.
And that's not reinforced enough.

1202
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,430
That should be on a bumper sticker.
That trail where I thought you were

1203
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:52,080
going with this.
I thought you were going to be,

1204
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,510
be like people who call a,
you know,

1205
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:59,511
people out in a articles in jazz,
the Bellin broadly are really meek when

1206
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:02,120
you meet him in person.
That's what I thought that was,

1207
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,580
that's a good point.
That's how I wasn't sure.

1208
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,260
And then I was falling and I was like,
that's not at all where he's going with

1209
00:53:07,261 --> 00:53:08,094
this.
No,

1210
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,970
I think that's also true though.
My experience is

1211
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,770
kind of true in a lot of ways.
But I think even what they're doing,

1212
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:16,440
like I don't want to mention anyone in
particular,

1213
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:21,120
but this one particular feminist writer
that I know who like will attack and go

1214
00:53:21,121 --> 00:53:24,120
after women,
she's like severely depressed and sad

1215
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,243
hurt.
She's,

1216
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,580
she's overweight and she's unhappy and
unhealthy and it's,

1217
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,540
it's a,
she aware of that core.

1218
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,040
Sorry.
Okay.

1219
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,400
I got a mirror.
You know,

1220
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,170
and you know what,
thank you for saying that.

1221
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,210
Whether or not she revels in that
awareness,

1222
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,440
right.
But that's more,

1223
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:42,570
I guess what a lot of these people that
are calling people out,

1224
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,250
look,
there's people that are calling people

1225
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:48,030
out there doing the world a service
because they're exposing real

1226
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:50,450
problematic behavior that I don't
expect.

1227
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,960
Like,
look what I was talking about my friend

1228
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,180
who gets sexually harassed by a woman.
I don't experience that.

1229
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:56,160
Okay.
I don't have a job where I have a boss

1230
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:57,360
who's a woman,
you know.

1231
00:53:57,361 --> 00:54:00,180
But if I was a woman and I had a boss
who was a man who was trying to fuck me

1232
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:00,991
all the time,
it would be,

1233
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,070
hell yeah.
You know,

1234
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:02,970
what,
if you,

1235
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,070
you know,
you're worried you have to be a certain

1236
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:08,790
amount of flirtatious with this guy at a
certain level so that you can maintain

1237
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,550
your position or maybe even like get a
job,

1238
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,430
you know,
a better job or promotion.

1239
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:14,970
I mean,
that's some real shit.

1240
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,610
Yeah.
I mean it's also a place though too into

1241
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,290
like,
even in comedy,

1242
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:20,880
like when Karen and I started comedy,
I'm like,

1243
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:24,300
okay,
I'm gonna I first made friends with

1244
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,120
older male comics because it was easier
cause I hadn't,

1245
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,710
it's not that we wanted to fuck each
other,

1246
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:31,470
but I at least had some,
uh,

1247
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,440
currency in the flirting.
Like there was currency in that.

1248
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:34,990
Like,
no,

1249
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:38,250
it can be friendly with them and they
will enjoy that and they would talk to

1250
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:38,761
you.
Yeah.

1251
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:41,580
You just need to find people who are
willing to give you the time of day.

1252
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,490
And a lot of times like it's because I
want to look at you.

1253
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:47,370
So you're just like,
but it's in a way that's not creepy.

1254
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,810
They don't cross a line.
It's just,

1255
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,030
it's just like,
we got our flow 40 and that's okay.

1256
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:54,210
You're just using each other,
they're using you to feel good and young

1257
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,990
and sexual and you're using them to get
comedy pro tip.

1258
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,040
Yeah.
And none of us are being assholes to

1259
00:54:59,041 --> 00:54:59,874
each other.

1260
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,720
I mean,
obviously we're talking about a bunch of

1261
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:03,820
different exchanges,
but it doesn't always have to be

1262
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:04,654
negative either.
Yeah.

1263
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,890
You can just be friendly with each
other.

1264
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,790
Yeah.
You know,

1265
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,060
like I,
the last time I dated a female comedian,

1266
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:13,900
we were both 21 you know,
and it was when I was in Boston and I

1267
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:14,910
was like,
this is terrible.

1268
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1269
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,800
As I say,
it sounds like a bull fucking crazy.

1270
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,220
Sounds like the beginning of a bad
wrong.

1271
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,201
It doesn't.
Yeah.

1272
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:23,440
It doesn't work.
But I think one of the things that

1273
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:26,270
happen,
and we can work comedian Thomson around

1274
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,410
Christina possess gaelic super happy and
yeah,

1275
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,030
they're both really funny.
Bonnie and red rash.

1276
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,800
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1277
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:37,801
I'm Natasha and they are a great couple.
We found three thousands and thousands

1278
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,330
of sure.
Interactions.

1279
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,420
Meyers.
Yeah,

1280
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,780
that's a good one as well.

1281
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,750
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it works.

1282
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:47,310
And we looked,
I hate absolutes.

1283
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,800
Right.
I never do this or never do that unless

1284
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:51,120
you saying like never eat babies.

1285
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,340
Right.
That's a good absolute to have a good

1286
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:54,320
one.
Nope.

1287
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:55,154
Time.
Um,

1288
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,420
but like also too with the flirting
thing,

1289
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,880
I'm more comfortable,
there was a time where I look back,

1290
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:03,060
I'm like,
I don't not friends with any big female

1291
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:05,100
comedians.
It's only male because I feel more

1292
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:08,940
comfortable going up to the mail cause I
feel like there's something of like,

1293
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,840
I have something to offer only it's only
flirting.

1294
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:13,621
That's it.
We're not going to,

1295
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:15,570
I've never,
I've had been in a relationship as long

1296
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:17,160
as I've been doing standup,
so,

1297
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,040
but if not a fool,
I would have probably fucked a lot

1298
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,230
comics,
but a better this way,

1299
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:23,350
you know?
And uh,

1300
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,250
but probably now

1301
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,260
for sure.
But when I think of going up to

1302
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,420
everybody,
I know it's great going up to a woman.

1303
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,760
No,
no.

1304
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,020
My boyfriend,
boyfriend,

1305
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,140
my boyfriend's guide.
But you know,

1306
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,290
in the past you could book a great open
mic.

1307
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,183
Yeah,
good.

1308
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,260
But going up to a female comic,
I'm like,

1309
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:43,330
what do I have to,
why would she want to talk to me?

1310
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,100
Because you're a human.
Why would,

1311
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,320
why you may think of that?
[inaudible] want to talk to me?

1312
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:48,960
Well,
you're looking at yourself as what

1313
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:49,960
you're like the shit.

1314
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:50,993
Yeah,
but I mean,

1315
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,390
I've been doing standup for a long time.
I've always had men friends that are

1316
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,270
coming in and friends and men and women
friends.

1317
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,640
Yes.
I have friends that are female friends

1318
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,770
that are comedians.
A lot that are on our same level.

1319
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:03,600
That started in the same time as us,
but like,

1320
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,411
you know,
a pro.

1321
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:06,390
I remember when I asked Bonnie Mcfarlane
do the podcast.

1322
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:09,660
I was really nervous to approach her.
She was super sweet and she was like,

1323
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:11,820
yeah,
she's so supportive of other women.

1324
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:16,590
Reach whining.
Just really champion championing women

1325
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:17,730
aren't funny.
Her documentary.

1326
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:18,211
Yes.
Yes.

1327
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:19,001
For.
I liked it a lot.

1328
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,080
It's so funny.
It's really and really like raw.

1329
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,100
Yeah.
Opened up about a lot of shit.

1330
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,660
Yeah.
I surprised.

1331
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,040
No,
I've known Bonnie forever.

1332
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,600
We still have the same manager.
Oh really?

1333
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,520
She's 1990.
Oh,

1334
00:57:29,521 --> 00:57:30,354
it was like,
was it mine?

1335
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,190
Oh,
okay.

1336
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,990
Or some shit like that long ass time
ago.

1337
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,170
She's awesome.
But it's um,

1338
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,450
it's a different animal when,
when you're a woman,

1339
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,140
you know.
Yeah.

1340
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:42,530
And I think that's one of the things
that I'm Eliza brought up when she was

1341
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:45,110
talking about this a whole Louis C k
thing.

1342
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,580
She was talking about how some men,
especially when she first started with

1343
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:52,100
treat her because she was just starting
out,

1344
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,070
she wasn't very good yet.
You know,

1345
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,200
she was,
and someone who is established and is

1346
00:57:57,201 --> 00:58:00,260
better and really has like their careers
cooking,

1347
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,340
they will look at you like you are a
lesser thing than them.

1348
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,120
They don't look at you like a peer.
And I tried to tell this to as many

1349
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:10,260
young comics as I can.
Um,

1350
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:14,090
that is incredibly important that we
look at all of us,

1351
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,580
all of us that are doing this thing as
the same thing.

1352
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,200
Yeah.
Somebody might be doing it for three

1353
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:20,030
days and someone might be doing it for
30 years,

1354
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,370
but we're all doing the same thing.
We're all together.

1355
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,900
Yeah.
So like doorman,

1356
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,180
like I,
I'm super friendly with everybody who

1357
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:29,330
works at the comedy store is a great
example that because everybody who works

1358
00:58:29,331 --> 00:58:30,690
there is a comic.
Like,

1359
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,820
yeah,
the people who are the,

1360
00:58:31,821 --> 00:58:35,480
the security or comics,
a lot of people that were managers were

1361
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:37,370
comics and people,
bartenders are comics.

1362
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:40,410
I know like a lot of the people like
Josh Martin and Punky there,

1363
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:43,540
they're fucking comics.
Even paid regulars and they still work.

1364
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:44,050
Yeah.

1365
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:45,400
Oh Wow.
That's cool.

1366
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,490
So there's a like an intense community
there.

1367
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:49,363
It's,
it's,

1368
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:50,860
it's,
it's amazing.

1369
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:54,790
And then you never get a place where you
have a pro shows every night and an

1370
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,800
indie show upstairs like that.
Never,

1371
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,100
there's no place in New York that has
won multiple rooms like that.

1372
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,780
A couple do,
but their not,

1373
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,270
the quality of,
of the spectrum of,

1374
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:07,570
of Comedians in terms of experience is,
is so vast.

1375
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,730
Any night of the week there.
And it's so cool.

1376
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,060
And that's really supportive.
Yeah,

1377
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:14,550
it is a super support and people that
are not supportive,

1378
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,160
they get pushed.

1379
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,100
Oh,
and I love that.

1380
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:19,640
I think the comedy community in New York
too was very supportive and we're very,

1381
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,130
we do bet we give each other when,
when

1382
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,840
we think of goods and it's,
we just,

1383
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,310
we,
we talk about comedy,

1384
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,270
we live and breathe it and we nerd out
on in the green rooms and we really are

1385
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:31,010
supportive and,
and uh,

1386
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,090
yeah,
I like it.

1387
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,180
It's awesome.
It did.

1388
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,260
Don't you guys think that now it's
easier to do that too because it's not

1389
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:39,920
like everyone's competing for a very
small amount of spots.

1390
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,010
Like it used to be like there was only
so many spots on a sitcom.

1391
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:46,550
There's only so many spots to host a
late night show and everybody was like

1392
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,260
hyper competitive.
Yeah.

1393
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:48,770
Now

1394
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,240
you're on opportunity.
Create your on saying,

1395
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,700
I mean there's some examples of it guys.
We fucked one of them.

1396
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:54,130
I'm broad city.
Yeah.

1397
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,160
I love the story of broad city.
Abby and Alana couldn't get on house

1398
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,450
teams.
They just kept getting rejected from

1399
00:59:59,451 --> 01:00:01,520
house teams at UCB.
They were,

1400
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,830
they started working on this web series
together.

1401
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:04,940
It blew up.
I mean,

1402
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:08,120
the quality of the web series before I
made it to air is phenomenal.

1403
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:10,190
They just put a lot of hard work into it
and they said,

1404
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,870
we're not going to take no for an
answer.

1405
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,480
And if this community that we've worked
in so long is saying no,

1406
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:16,340
we're going to do it on our own.
And they did,

1407
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,970
you can do that.
And also one of the things is that like

1408
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:21,010
podcasters and people that do things
online,

1409
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,080
they support other people to do things
online.

1410
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,700
Like you never see someone from a show
on CBS getting promoted from a show on

1411
01:00:27,701 --> 01:00:28,470
NBC.
Right,

1412
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,500
right.
Super Rare.

1413
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,810
But in the world of podcasting,
it's super common.

1414
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,460
Yeah.
Like everybody has everybody on their

1415
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:35,410
shows and we always talk everybody up
and hey,

1416
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:38,710
go see she's playing here.
And he's playing there and you promote

1417
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:42,100
their dates and it's a,
it's a way more egalitarian,

1418
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:47,101
way more like supportive community.
And it's a win win for everybody because

1419
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:50,080
it never feels good to be supportive of
people you respect and admire.

1420
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,540
Talented.
And you know,

1421
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,351
and,
and it too,

1422
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:56,170
that's why I love standup because you're
the only one who's going to do your act.

1423
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,320
Yeah.
So don't worry about the company.

1424
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,460
Hopefully.
That's true.

1425
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,140
Yeah.
But uh,

1426
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,130
but yeah,
I mean there's only one.

1427
01:01:03,131 --> 01:01:03,230
Yeah.

1428
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,740
You and the people that are shitty to
other comedians they get,

1429
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,050
I mean,
if you're a comic,

1430
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:10,940
you don't have any comedian friends.
Like that's,

1431
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,560
that's a giant problem.

1432
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,720
Just like a
famous person.

1433
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,740
Oh,
you can think of a lot of famous one.

1434
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:18,574
Yeah.

1435
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,180
Some famous ones that come to the store
and the,

1436
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,660
the door people get super bummed out and
just look past them.

1437
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:27,240
They don't say hi to them.
They'll go straight to bill burr or

1438
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:30,420
straight to someone famous and only
talked to them and they don't talk to

1439
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:31,254
regular folks,

1440
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,850
I feel like too.
But I've had interactions with famous

1441
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:35,230
comics.
Like the first one,

1442
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,940
the person was being a dick and just
like looking down and,

1443
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:40,330
and I was being introduced by his friend
and he was like,

1444
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,100
hey,
how are you doing when it had sunglasses

1445
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:42,970
indoors?
I'm like,

1446
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,720
yeah,
but it was La Barf all over.

1447
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:52,610
You gimme a name they rhyme with.
Well you're going to absolutely know.

1448
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,160
But then the second time we met him,
if some couldn't have been nicer,

1449
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,210
maybe going through some weird shit.
Exactly.

1450
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,060
Yeah.

1451
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,160
Somewhat run into someone like at the
wrong.

1452
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,640
Yeah,
and I labeled them.

1453
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,850
I labeled them an asshole though.
He was going through some shit while

1454
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:10,940
showing pictures of himself to another
person.

1455
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:14,510
But then is that how you act out
sometimes if you're having a bad day or

1456
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:18,020
you're like,
just go right to naked photos.

1457
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,830
Yeah.
Get those modes in baby.

1458
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,960
Only if my ass,
I just show them my app.

1459
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,390
Oh,
that's what I do.

1460
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,690
Do you take nudes?
No.

1461
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,640
Why not?
Thinking of doing it now?

1462
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,850
Really just from two seconds.
I want to see your recommended it,

1463
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:31,680
but just to be like a close up your
butthole.

1464
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,700
Let's redefine the nude.
I don't have any that I need to show

1465
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:36,534
anybody.
Yeah,

1466
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,870
no.
Do you,

1467
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,230
have you ever taken one?
I don't need to see it.

1468
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,750
Uh,
I'm sure I've taken pictures of it.

1469
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,330
Okay.
Really just for because it was,

1470
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:46,160
cause you have a camera.

1471
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,410
Good lighting,
dude.

1472
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,830
He started taking pictures of
everything.

1473
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,800
Take pictures of my policy.
I never taken a picture of my po.

1474
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,650
I've never taken it as a check.
If you have a weird feeling down there

1475
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:56,920
and just make sure everything's okay,
it's,

1476
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,940
it's your own doctor.
If I was a girl,

1477
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,260
I would definitely take pictures so I
would really know what it looks like

1478
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,670
cause otherwise you can't really see it.
Just a gold squat.

1479
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,770
A mirror.
Yeah.

1480
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,850
Or you're super flexible.
You'd have to like,

1481
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,060
oh Geez.
One of them tap around.

1482
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:14,640
You've got to be a contortionist back.
See my own pussy from here.

1483
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,440
Yeah,
but you can't because we were discussed

1484
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:18,270
that you've seen the Labia,
you're not really sure.

1485
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,580
We'll see.
Is the whole thing right?

1486
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,500
The giant.
It hugs the Tampon.

1487
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,960
That's the vagina would be the whole
thing.

1488
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:27,200
I would say the Vaginas,
just the,

1489
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,070
the,
the whole that we're most concerned

1490
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,720
about.
The Pussy is the house,

1491
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,910
but the vagina is like the living room.

1492
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:35,830
Okay.
I think so.

1493
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,660
Okay.
Yeah.

1494
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,130
You could be wrong.
He could be right.

1495
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:40,140
And I honestly don't know which one it
is.

1496
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,220
That's why we're relatable.
Were you,

1497
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,590
when you started like being sexually
active when you were younger,

1498
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:48,690
were you like a vagina?
How do I,

1499
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,060
what do I even,
what do I do?

1500
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,700
I,
cause I kind of feel like men going into

1501
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,130
straight and by men that are going to be
having sex with women.

1502
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:59,970
Like seib confusing cause it dick.
It's like you have to void the Dick.

1503
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:00,870
Yeah,
you already have one.

1504
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,270
But also like a woman as a woman who
doesn't have a dick.

1505
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,580
I feel I know what to deal with it a
little.

1506
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,770
Well guys share information with each
other to grow.

1507
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:09,330
Share information about what to do with
Dick's.

1508
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,620
Yeah,
I didn't know guys shared information

1509
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,430
for sure.
Oh because we've heard a lot guys like

1510
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:16,200
don't talk about it.
I'm like why not?

1511
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,770
What you missing out on some tips?
What's some information you've got and

1512
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,500
oh you just start talking about like a,
what do you do?

1513
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,880
18 or 15 the 1st of May going out with a
girl.

1514
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,360
Like you should let your finger.
Yeah.

1515
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,830
Bring Nice,
clean being fingered at 14 is a fucking

1516
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:34,290
worst.
It's just like Jack Camera.

1517
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,450
Like someone's ringing a doorbell
inside.

1518
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:37,800
Yeah.
They're not clean.

1519
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,210
Yeah.
And there is no doorbell,

1520
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:40,210
but they don't know that.
Oh,

1521
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,520
you got to pretend.
Yeah,

1522
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,463
yeah,

1523
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,700
yeah.
It sucked.

1524
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,980
Well jackhammer fingers,
man.

1525
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:50,720
It's gotta be better now then when we
were young and it's gotta be better when

1526
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:52,490
we were young then when our parents were
young.

1527
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,140
That is very true.
It's all,

1528
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,790
and don't think that's the same thing.
I mean I think that's with everything.

1529
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:01,160
I think one of the things that's going
on right now,

1530
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,090
and one of the things with,
uh,

1531
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:08,110
all this sexual assault stuff that's
making the news is that we're,

1532
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,270
we're in the middle of a giant social
change.

1533
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,940
I feel that too.
And it's like our hurricane around us

1534
01:05:13,941 --> 01:05:18,010
and fucking bathtubs and are flying
through the

1535
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,850
air and we're in the middle of it.
And I think a lot of times you don't

1536
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,340
realize how much change is actually
taking place.

1537
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:29,500
But if you just try to look at comedy
from the 1980s and look at comedy from

1538
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:31,630
now,
like what you can get away with then and

1539
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,220
we you like go watch Eddie Murphy Raw.
And you would never do that today?

1540
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:39,300
No.
Carla like a lot of them had like a lot

1541
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,220
homophobic shit.
But you know Andrew dice clay would

1542
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:46,110
never fly today.
Maybe because he was a director.

1543
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,120
I don't know.
I don't know that that would work.

1544
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,740
He used to be Andrew Silverstein,
you know Andrew Silverstein was,

1545
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:57,100
he would do straight stand up and then
he had a bunch of characters he would

1546
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:59,380
do.
One of the characters he's just do was

1547
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:01,270
the dice man dies,
man.

1548
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:06,010
He put the jacket on,
do these nursery rhymes.

1549
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,750
Fuck yourself.
He would just light a cigarette.

1550
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,110
Yeah.
And then he became the dice man.

1551
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:16,240
It's like more comfortable to be that
guy all the time.

1552
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,133
Yeah,
that's true.

1553
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,150
That makes sense.
It's comfortable being in a character.

1554
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:21,820
I'm not my stage.
My bits are very,

1555
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,380
well,
there's a lot of people that have done

1556
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:26,380
that and they got trapped like emo
Phillips got trapped.

1557
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,850
I Aye.
Yes.

1558
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:29,950
I just watched a documentary at dying
laughing.

1559
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:34,951
I think it's called and he was on hell
no,

1560
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,660
he's not like that cause I saw him when
he stopped doing that.

1561
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,670
He stopped doing that for awhile and
then he went back to it.

1562
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,270
Bobcat goldthwait talk to me about it.
Like you talked about it on the podcast.

1563
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:46,300
It was really hard for him to stop doing
it because everybody's like,

1564
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,960
hey man,
do the Bob cat thing.

1565
01:06:47,961 --> 01:06:48,311
He's like,
Hey,

1566
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:49,144
fuck you.

1567
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,950
I'm just a person just going to do my
standup.

1568
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,290
And he's like,
for a long time it was like really hard.

1569
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,500
Oh that would piss me off because
everybody wanted him to go

1570
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,080
this thing for the longest time and he
just got older and it was like,

1571
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:04,900
what the fuck am I doing?
Oops.

1572
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:09,040
And it was really funny when he was
younger then it just didn't want to do

1573
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,050
it anymore.
But if you have that character,

1574
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,060
like if you're in a character all the
time,

1575
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:14,610
you get stuck.
Yeah,

1576
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,110
yeah,
yeah.

1577
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,640
I mean we see hard to perform it never
feel like yourself.

1578
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:22,240
That's what I like about it and that's
why their objections stings that much

1579
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:26,770
more because like you were rejecting my
soul or rejecting you or what you're

1580
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:29,350
presenting.
Then you really got to take a second and

1581
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:30,100
think,
well,

1582
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:35,100
I think for sure this is a tumultuous
time of change and I think ultimately

1583
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:38,890
it's going to be very good,
but I think I got some weird ideas on it

1584
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:39,130
though.

1585
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,850
I really think that one of the things
that holds us up is the ability of ally

1586
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:46,180
and I think that that's,
that is not forever.

1587
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,140
I think the ability to lie,
like I think I,

1588
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:52,420
I believe that we are,
I don't know how many years away,

1589
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:55,960
whether it's 10 or 20 we're 20 whatever
it is,

1590
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,370
years away of some Rosetta stone of
human interaction that takes place

1591
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:03,130
electronically.
I think they're going to figure out some

1592
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:07,780
way where we can teach children a
language that's a universal language

1593
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:12,781
that's transmitted through computers or
through some sort of a human internet

1594
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,860
interface,
some sort of a neural interface that

1595
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:16,250
they're

1596
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:19,060
working on hundreds of different
versions of this right now where there

1597
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:23,030
they can already send thoughts back and
forth to people from the Internet.

1598
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,670
They can send images to other people's
minds.

1599
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:28,460
One person could send an image of a
triangle to your mind.

1600
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,930
They can currently do that current.
Wow.

1601
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:35,100
They do it through some sort of
electrical stimulation of various parts

1602
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:39,510
of the brain where you send a signal and
that signal through your thoughts of

1603
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:42,390
this object.
Like you have this idea like say if you

1604
01:08:42,391 --> 01:08:45,330
think of a bottle of water like well
something really a triangle.

1605
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:48,840
Let's go back to that shape.
It's a very obvious sit symbol,

1606
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:49,950
right?
You know what it looks like.

1607
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:52,080
I know what it looks like and if I can
think of that,

1608
01:08:52,081 --> 01:08:55,620
there is a pattern in my brain that I
can transmit to you through this very

1609
01:08:55,621 --> 01:08:57,780
rudimentary technology.
So I,

1610
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,360
I liken it to like a Morse code machine.

1611
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:02,140
Did do,

1612
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,400
they used to be able to communicate with
those as good as you get.

1613
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,530
Now obviously you took a video on your
phone,

1614
01:09:07,531 --> 01:09:09,060
he sent it to someone New Zealand,
right.

1615
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:09,871
It's,
we're,

1616
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:12,420
we're in a different world.
It's not that far away.

1617
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,340
I mean you're talking about just a
couple of hundred years.

1618
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:17,830
We've gone from the Morse code to
sending a video to New Zealand in real

1619
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:18,664
time.

1620
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,640
Well have you ever heard of a Fisher
Wallace stimulator?

1621
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:22,820
I've heard of that.
Yeah.

1622
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,350
So my mom has had depression most of her
life and she was,

1623
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:28,780
has been on 25 different meds and made
her worse.

1624
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:32,500
And as a doctor prescribed a Fisher
Wallace stimulator,

1625
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,010
it's just a little tiny machine with two
pads or sponges.

1626
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,710
You what the sponge is a little bit and
you put them on your temples.

1627
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,380
And she did it twice a day for about 20
minutes.

1628
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:45,160
And her fucking depression went away.
And I felt,

1629
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,260
felt like I got my mom like a,
you know,

1630
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:49,400
cause she just,
it,

1631
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:54,450
the meds would just make her so numb and
like emotionless and that would depress

1632
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:57,760
her and she like,
I just lived my whole life I've been

1633
01:09:57,761 --> 01:10:02,050
seeing her do these peaks and valleys
and the Fisher Wallace stimulator,

1634
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:05,320
there's no side effects.
If anything she gets a headache but

1635
01:10:05,321 --> 01:10:08,410
there's no mental side effects and uh,
and hurt.

1636
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:12,220
It's insane how often the chef to do it.
She has it twice a day.

1637
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,220
The only thing that I've noticed it,
I guess it,

1638
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:18,040
this is a side effect.
It makes her a little bit hyper and not

1639
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,180
hungry.
She's getting are both

1640
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,110
hyper.
I'm trying to tell as many people about.

1641
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:29,080
But I'm wondering if that's similar
types of technology that are already

1642
01:10:29,081 --> 01:10:30,940
happy.
What if it'll make you fucking ecstatic?

1643
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:32,470
I don't know,
but that's what I was wondering.

1644
01:10:32,471 --> 01:10:33,370
I'm like,
Mako borrow.

1645
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:36,490
If you slap that bitch on when you get
on that Japanese toilet,

1646
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,750
hot water pumping up your claim like a
molly machine.

1647
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:41,800
Yeah.
Whoa.

1648
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,640
Put those babies on a,
I've got to go to the bathroom now.

1649
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,430
That's great.
Yeah,

1650
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:52,450
I just got to go light 20 milligrams.
I had a fan,

1651
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:55,870
gave us a cookie in San Fran and uh,
it was labeled,

1652
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,250
you know,
but I didn't know how much he ate and we

1653
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:58,270
had to go on a plane.
So I'm like,

1654
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,820
I'm going to throw this out.
And I was like,

1655
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,340
at the end of a two week tour,
we're doing two shows and I was so

1656
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,210
tired.
I'm like,

1657
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:05,560
I don't want to get held up on the
plane.

1658
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:09,300
So I took a little chunk,
I ate it and then it kicked in when we

1659
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:11,260
were at the gate.
And crim was like,

1660
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:13,090
I'm gonna go get starbucks.
You want anything like that?

1661
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:13,980
Fine.
And

1662
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,450
then all of a sudden I'm like,
no,

1663
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:17,670
I'm not fine.
And I texted chrome like,

1664
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,500
you're going to hate me,
but uh,

1665
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,050
oof.
I'm going to die soon.

1666
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:23,700
And uh,
this is not okay.

1667
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:26,640
And then I just started having a panic
attack is already someone who is not

1668
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:27,820
going to have flying.
No.

1669
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,430
Yeah,
I would have panic attacks all the time.

1670
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:31,440
And then there's like,
I was bawling my eyes out in this

1671
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,490
little girl came up like two feet in
front of me and she was like,

1672
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,320
and she just tilted her head and stared
at me and my career.

1673
01:11:38,321 --> 01:11:40,330
Why is she doing that?
That's weird.

1674
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,171
Yeah,
it was.

1675
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,510
I thought I was going to die.
I,

1676
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,520
that's the only time in my life I ever
remember having the feeling of like,

1677
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:50,020
you're about to die.
I got a nine little girl just came over

1678
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:52,780
like a normal little girl.
And then when Christina said,

1679
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:54,370
why is this little girl looking at me?
And I said,

1680
01:11:54,371 --> 01:11:57,280
probably because she's never seen a
grown woman have a tantrum in an airport

1681
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,730
and anxiety tantrum.
And then,

1682
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:01,960
oh,
getting on that plane,

1683
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:03,760
man.
I thought I was gonna get kicked off

1684
01:12:03,761 --> 01:12:05,070
that plane.
She,

1685
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,550
uh,
she almost did because it wants to it,

1686
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,200
I think in 2017,
like saying did,

1687
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,270
she's not,
I was like,

1688
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:13,870
she's not good at flying like that does,
that doesn't fly anymore.

1689
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,753
And,
uh,

1690
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,860
the lady was like,
does she need to get off?

1691
01:12:17,861 --> 01:12:18,460
And I was like,
no,

1692
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,840
she's fine.
She's going to be fine.

1693
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:22,160
We're going to get through this.
We're going to get back home.

1694
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,310
How far?
How far was the flight?

1695
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,140
Oh,
it's from San Fran and New York,

1696
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:26,510
right?
Yeah,

1697
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,730
it was all cross country.

1698
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:32,890
An hour after I got home to my
apartment,

1699
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,560
she just put a blanket over her and I
was like,

1700
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,920
why?
We're going to have like,

1701
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,350
it was good.
It was,

1702
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:41,950
well you wrote the Ro the storm.
I did and I survived.

1703
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,910
Goddamn.
But yeah,

1704
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:44,290
the edibles fucked me up.
Well,

1705
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:46,960
they're just too God damn strong.
Especially if you just try to eat a

1706
01:12:46,961 --> 01:12:48,430
whole cookie.
That could have been hundreds of

1707
01:12:48,431 --> 01:12:50,590
milligrams.
I just took a little chunk of it.

1708
01:12:50,591 --> 01:12:53,110
It was a big ass cookie and I took a
quarter of it.

1709
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,720
But then also,
well yeah,

1710
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,340
quarter but that's why I'm scared like
Corindus psychedelics.

1711
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:02,500
I,
I feel like if you have anxiety,

1712
01:13:02,501 --> 01:13:06,220
I've had a lot of anxiety,
probably not for me it's a different

1713
01:13:06,221 --> 01:13:11,221
thing because the anxiety that you get
from edible marijuana is very peculiar.

1714
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:14,030
It's intensely introspective.
Hmm.

1715
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,790
I don't love edibles either.
I much prefer mushrooms,

1716
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:18,830
acid.
I did DMT recently.

1717
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,430
I studied using partially using your
documentaries.

1718
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,690
The thank you.
Yeah.

1719
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,680
Thank you.
It was very important.

1720
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:26,780
I mean cause that's scary shit.
You need to study.

1721
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,950
Yeah.
It's definitely not something you should

1722
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:29,630
take.

1723
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:30,470
No,
absolutely not.

1724
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,450
I studied for,
I had it sitting on my table and I

1725
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:35,990
studied for like a good two months.
Watched a lot of stuff on the Internet.

1726
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:36,320
Right.

1727
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,240
A lot about it.
Talk to people who had done it.

1728
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,390
What's crazy is a natural part of human
neurochemistry chemistry that exists,

1729
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,520
that your brain's making that stuff all
the time and then you can just extract

1730
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:49,970
it from a thousand different plants and
then you take it,

1731
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,730
smoke it,
and then you meet Jesus and aliens and

1732
01:13:52,731 --> 01:13:54,140
everything.
Have you met Jesus?

1733
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,560
Meet everything.
Things that are changing.

1734
01:13:57,561 --> 01:13:59,360
So whatever the fuck they were a second
ago,

1735
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:02,230
they're not the same thing a second
later shift.

1736
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,520
This is pretty fucking intense.
Such a curious person and you really try

1737
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,510
has,
has psychedelics made you cause people,

1738
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:12,010
it really makes a

1739
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,190
positive shift in their consciousness
and their curiosity.

1740
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,220
I've seen it happen and sometimes it
goes the other way but um,

1741
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,000
is that where we always are kind of
purposes

1742
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,730
curious,
but it made my curiosity,

1743
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,870
it confirmed the need for it like that.
If you do,

1744
01:14:26,871 --> 01:14:31,871
when you do something like Dmt,
it is so profoundly bizarre that after

1745
01:14:32,211 --> 01:14:37,070
it's over you are so stunned at how few
people know about this and how you

1746
01:14:37,071 --> 01:14:39,890
didn't know about until that happened
and how you'll never be the same again.

1747
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,370
Oh you'll never be the same again.
No.

1748
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,300
Right.
Are you never going to be the same

1749
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:45,560
again?
Cause you know that's a real,

1750
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:50,620
you know that you could go through this
chemical portal to what's essentially

1751
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,110
another dimension.
I mean is it sounds like it another

1752
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:57,980
dimension where you're,
you are interacting with ideas that seem

1753
01:14:57,981 --> 01:15:00,380
to be sent in.
They seem to be alive.

1754
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,251
You're,
you're,

1755
01:15:01,251 --> 01:15:04,370
you're,
you're being inundated with thoughts and

1756
01:15:04,371 --> 01:15:07,460
words that come at you without like a
physical presence.

1757
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:11,180
Like no one's saying a word.
But like if I said to you,

1758
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,920
hey,
let's get a cup of coffee,

1759
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:16,370
like that signal goes into your brain
because you're hearing my words.

1760
01:15:16,371 --> 01:15:21,050
You interpret them.
You get the same thing from these dmt

1761
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:23,660
states,
but you don't actually hear the words.

1762
01:15:23,661 --> 01:15:28,070
But you know what the words are fucking
titanic.

1763
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:28,904
Really Bizarre.

1764
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,970
Have you ever seen a heel,
like a psych Akilah or have you ever had

1765
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,980
I've ever heard a psychic surgery and
believe them,

1766
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,070
so I,
okay.

1767
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,500
I don't like,
I never really talk about this cause I

1768
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:38,910
don't,
I don't need people,

1769
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:41,040
I'm not trying to convert anybody to
believe in this shit,

1770
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,620
right.
But I've had psychic surgery once and I,

1771
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:45,490
and my mom and I had from this work,
uh,

1772
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:46,980
so he,
this guy,

1773
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:49,210
his name was Dr V.
Uh,

1774
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,790
and
he did,

1775
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,520
I did have my shirt off the,
that you wake up,

1776
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,550
know what?
Ours is another revolution of another

1777
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:02,190
sexual assault.
I was conscious the whole time,

1778
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:03,024
but,
uh,

1779
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,970
I like my mom had,
uh,

1780
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:08,180
breast tissue that was really hard in
her breast because she had all these

1781
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:09,660
surgeries for,
to get little tumors removed,

1782
01:16:09,661 --> 01:16:12,570
they weren't cancerous and it really
hurt or like if you've touched her boob,

1783
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:14,460
like it would hurt and he,
okay,

1784
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:18,590
so this doctor,
he used to work for NASA and a,

1785
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,720
he's Russian and he,
he's very mysterious.

1786
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,250
You looked into his background.
I tried to Google it,

1787
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,100
but I didn't have the,
I didn't have,

1788
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,750
it didn't seem,
which we're going to new,

1789
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:30,870
a tiny little apartment and this old
lady was answering and she was like,

1790
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:31,704
come in.
And I'm like,

1791
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,260
but uh,
but he did,

1792
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,280
he didn't touch her and he just,
he kept moving his hands like this and

1793
01:16:38,281 --> 01:16:39,240
he would,
he would do this,

1794
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:42,690
like he was trying to get warm and then
he would flick it and then he would,

1795
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:47,750
he would circle around her boob and then
pull out like an imaginary thing and it

1796
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,070
was gone.
The heart tissue was gone.

1797
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,730
It's the weirdest fucking thing.
And he did it to me with my knee.

1798
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,140
It was the weirdest thing.
And I mean it's like seeing a ghost like

1799
01:16:58,141 --> 01:16:58,974
you.
You don't,

1800
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,450
you're like,
I need that just happened.

1801
01:17:00,451 --> 01:17:01,320
That's undeniable.

1802
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:03,230
Well,
if you believe in it,

1803
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,860
your body can produce some pretty
incredible results.

1804
01:17:06,861 --> 01:17:08,840
And that's what the power of suggestion
is.

1805
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,620
That's what placebo effect is.
Placebo effects a hundred percent real

1806
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,930
totally.
But I didn't even know that psychic

1807
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:17,060
surgery was a thing before he actually
did it.

1808
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,830
I had no,
he's not doing anything.

1809
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:22,160
He's just getting you convinced that
he's doing something and by him being

1810
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,020
convincing you that he's doing
something,

1811
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,770
you feel some sort of a positive
response because your body reacts as if

1812
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:30,320
he's done something to you.
That's a service in and of itself.

1813
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:30,711
Yeah.
I mean,

1814
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:33,230
I'll take it is,
it is a service in and of itself,

1815
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:36,500
but it's also deceptive.
There's a weird thing that people do,

1816
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,970
like where they,
you know,

1817
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:41,120
there's a lot of weird healers where
they do like Reiki and all this

1818
01:17:41,121 --> 01:17:42,000
different shit.
I am,

1819
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,520
there's no science behind it.
It's not,

1820
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,680
it's not real.
But if you think that it's doing

1821
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,210
something to you,
you can feel better.

1822
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:50,300
[inaudible] acupuncture.
I don't know anything.

1823
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:51,520
I don't know.
I've had it.

1824
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:53,390
I've had it,
but the guy was a quack,

1825
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,790
but it doesn't mean that it's not real.

1826
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:58,140
That's the I'm,
I'm very skeptical,

1827
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,320
but I was working in a,
but that was like a receptionist at a

1828
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:06,321
spa was my day job while pursuing comedy
and there was an acupuncturist there and

1829
01:18:07,111 --> 01:18:08,310
I was like,
let me try it.

1830
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,680
Really?
I was in a really deep depression and

1831
01:18:10,681 --> 01:18:13,560
like the mind body connection,
I got to say she and she's,

1832
01:18:13,561 --> 01:18:15,600
and she's an md.
She's not just the person off the

1833
01:18:15,601 --> 01:18:16,830
street.
This woman's an MD,

1834
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,330
a young woman,
and it,

1835
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,010
it changed my life and I hate to even
say that I'm embarrassed to even be like

1836
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,070
I have an acupuncturist.
It seems so hippy dippy mind

1837
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,900
body connection is a misnomer,
right?

1838
01:18:27,901 --> 01:18:29,640
Because your mind is a part of your
body.

1839
01:18:29,641 --> 01:18:32,340
I mean it's all one thing.
That's why one of the things with people

1840
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:33,890
don't have healthy bodies.
Yeah.

1841
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:36,720
But if you don't have a healthy body,
your mind's not going to function at its

1842
01:18:36,721 --> 01:18:38,670
best.
You can be a brilliant person with an

1843
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:39,880
unhealthy body.
Yes.

1844
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,400
But you will be better if you,
your body functions well.

1845
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:47,730
It's not giving you trump problems.
It's not causing you issues.

1846
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,910
Yeah.
It's not a,

1847
01:18:48,911 --> 01:18:51,720
uh,
like a source of stress and concern.

1848
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,280
And I think that what these people can
do or there's a lot of different things

1849
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:59,970
that are not supportive whatsoever by
science and a lot of people that are

1850
01:18:59,971 --> 01:19:01,710
very scientifically minded,
they ish,

1851
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,460
they,
they shun those things and they think

1852
01:19:05,461 --> 01:19:08,700
those things have zero benefit.
And they also put religion in that group

1853
01:19:08,701 --> 01:19:09,060
as well.

1854
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:13,580
And I think they're very similar in that
if you believe in certain things like a,

1855
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:17,370
there was a thing that,
a article recently by Robert Sapolsky

1856
01:19:17,371 --> 01:19:18,410
who is a,
um,

1857
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,410
he's a out of state,
he's a professor at Stanford University

1858
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:24,480
and we had him on the podcast.
We talked about,

1859
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,840
um,
about primates and he's a really,

1860
01:19:27,841 --> 01:19:29,400
really fascinating guy.
Scott,

1861
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:33,390
some amazing studies that he's done on
baboons and primate behavior.

1862
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:36,930
But one of the things he was talking
about is the stress relieving aspect of,

1863
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,420
uh,
an actual religious belief.

1864
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,630
So you could say that if you really do
believe that everything's going to be

1865
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:45,030
fine cause God's looking out for you,
that just,

1866
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:46,590
that alone,
whether or not it's real or

1867
01:19:46,591 --> 01:19:51,060
scientifically verifiable,
that proof or it is not necessary for

1868
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:52,110
you to feel good.
Yeah.

1869
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:55,620
I mean I choose to be a positive person
because that's my survival mechanism.

1870
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:57,640
I wouldn't have made it through life
without being positive.

1871
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:01,020
Positive is one thing,
but an actual belief that something is

1872
01:20:01,021 --> 01:20:05,820
happening to your body that's not
scientifically possible like that

1873
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:09,660
someone can rub their right I all the
bad juju out of your body.

1874
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:12,000
Yeah.
But if you believe that though,

1875
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:16,590
just the belief in that can trigger a
lot of what human neuro chemistry that

1876
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:17,640
literally will make you feel.

1877
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,390
That's true.
I can now,

1878
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,670
uh,
after that experience,

1879
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:22,110
that was a couple of years ago,
I can,

1880
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,020
if I like lay on my bed and meditate,
I don't really do that cause I don't

1881
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,280
have time.
But I can,

1882
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:30,210
if I think really hard,
I can make certain parts of my body like

1883
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:33,000
have those pins and needle feeling,
which I'm like,

1884
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:33,834
that's cool.

1885
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:36,920
You should make the time.
You probably do have kind of cool.

1886
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,770
Yeah.
But it's weird like people worry about

1887
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:41,800
like the discipline of doing something
like that,

1888
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:42,220
that it,
it,

1889
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,540
it gets them concerned.
Like I don't have time for that.

1890
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:48,230
And they pushed it off because this is
something,

1891
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:51,050
there's a weird way that human beings
are programmed that we,

1892
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:54,710
we avoid certain types of strenuous
activity.

1893
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,600
Avoid getting up early when you know you
should,

1894
01:20:56,601 --> 01:21:01,340
there's a lot of things that we do where
we go towards comfort and a way from

1895
01:21:01,341 --> 01:21:04,160
these uncomfortable feelings and some of
those uncomfortable feelings are just

1896
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,140
sitting alone,
meditating,

1897
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:08,810
just sitting alone and concentrating on
your breath for 20 minutes a day.

1898
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:09,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1899
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,120
Big benefits to that.

1900
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,340
But yeah.
And then you get down on yourself and

1901
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:15,760
then that stress and then you're like,
whoa shit.

1902
01:21:15,761 --> 01:21:17,110
And then you're in your room all day and
you're like,

1903
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,330
fuck that.
Then you go on the Internet and then

1904
01:21:19,331 --> 01:21:21,880
you're saying your room for another week
and then you read some bad comments.

1905
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:25,630
He's just masturbate real comments.
That's the key to life.

1906
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,670
Not really give a shit about the
comments.

1907
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,000
I don't read them.
Yeah.

1908
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,550
I very rarely will like glance through
and look really quickly,

1909
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:33,630
but if I do it once a day,

1910
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,310
oh yeah.
Well sometimes I want to get pissed off

1911
01:21:36,311 --> 01:21:38,830
and then sometimes we just make fun of
it cause it's so hot.

1912
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,340
It's hilarious.
We've had like a men's rights activists

1913
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,830
write articles about us,
like calling has come dumpsters.

1914
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,150
I love it.
And I didn't know that.

1915
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:51,100
I didn't know the phrase cum dumpster.
How'd you make it to this part of life?

1916
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:54,170
I don't know.
Did you feel least barfed

1917
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:58,450
first sentence in our book is,
are you a degenerate cum dumpster?

1918
01:21:58,451 --> 01:22:00,790
Unworthy of love and affection,
a zealot.

1919
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,800
Somebody called you unworthy of love and
affection that we said that we had sand

1920
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:06,850
in his cum dumpster.

1921
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:08,760
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

1922
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,710
If he said that,
that would've made it even better

1923
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:13,070
because then you would know like how
broken a person.

1924
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,610
No,
we had an inkling.

1925
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:19,520
That whole article.
Yeah,

1926
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,770
it was fine.
But that's how I like,

1927
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:23,800
to me that's the best feeling of like
hate taking control of the situation by

1928
01:22:23,801 --> 01:22:27,820
reading it and then roasting them.
Human intelligence is far greater than a

1929
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,460
insulting

1930
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,130
people.
Did.

1931
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:31,500
You guys don't say mean Shit about men?
I mean you're,

1932
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:32,880
you're pretty honest.
Yeah.

1933
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:36,150
But you're not like anyone else.
You're not negative.

1934
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:38,730
You're not like,
you're not like anti men.

1935
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:39,810
Women,
you mean you,

1936
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:40,810
you,
you rightly,

1937
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,680
no,
not at all for shit that they've done.

1938
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:44,510
That's fucked up.
But you,

1939
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,650
you guys aren't,
we love the show is called guide.

1940
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:48,520
We fuck.
Yeah.

1941
01:22:48,521 --> 01:22:51,120
It's not like you guys were spit on
guys.

1942
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,720
We kicked in the Dick.
I love having sex with men.

1943
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,070
I like how you guys say it.
Two guys.

1944
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,580
We fucked.
And that's why to say it that way.

1945
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,640
Fun Park yet.
But our,

1946
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:02,570
her we're far definition of feminism is
women can be pieces of shit too.

1947
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:03,470
Yeah,
it is.

1948
01:23:03,471 --> 01:23:06,280
And I think that for men,
I think it's a good

1949
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,130
thing to be able to listen to women talk
unfiltered.

1950
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,460
And I don't think and guys avoid that.
They go to war here with these bitches

1951
01:23:12,461 --> 01:23:14,380
have to say,
you should listen.

1952
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,310
You should listen in,
in a,

1953
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:18,490
not saying that you should listen
because you have to agree with them,

1954
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:23,670
but you will gain a more of an
understanding of how someone who is very

1955
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:27,340
different than you views maybe the exact
same interaction and just that,

1956
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:32,500
just that one look at another
perspective might make you sit back and

1957
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:33,334
go,
okay,

1958
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:34,930
maybe I need to look at it from their
point.

1959
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:35,260
Right.

1960
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,480
Oh it's the best.
And my favorite email is when a guy

1961
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:39,370
emails on and he's like,
I gotta be honest.

1962
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:41,680
I listen to your podcast.
I was expecting to like jerk off and

1963
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,470
shit,
but I actually learned something.

1964
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:44,890
I'm like,
oh bless you.

1965
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:47,140
I love you.
Jerk off and shit.

1966
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,350
Sorry to disappoint.
But I know that I love that we like

1967
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,700
that's the best.
When you,

1968
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:54,110
when you,
when you surprise somebody I think is,

1969
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:57,130
and the name of the podcast is people
are going to either go,

1970
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,500
that's hilarious or that's discussing or
what,

1971
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,990
or whatever the reaction is.
They're going to check it out.

1972
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:05,470
They're going to remember.
They're surprised by what they hear

1973
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,390
because it's not what they expected.
It sticks.

1974
01:24:07,391 --> 01:24:08,080
It's stronger.

1975
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,760
Do you guys feel like the podcast has
helped you understand yourselves and

1976
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:13,594
grow better?

1977
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:15,350
Yes.
Yeah.

1978
01:24:15,351 --> 01:24:17,990
I mean that was it.
We had no choice but to grow.

1979
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:19,760
When you have,
when you're sitting down with people who

1980
01:24:19,761 --> 01:24:22,200
you've had these intimate relationships,
uh,

1981
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:26,210
both emotional and sexual with,
it's just like holding a mirror up to

1982
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:27,470
yourself.
And that was the concept.

1983
01:24:27,471 --> 01:24:31,130
The concept was kind of to do this
podcast much like John cusack and high

1984
01:24:31,131 --> 01:24:35,800
fidelity and just learn about yourself
through these people kind of slide you

1985
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,370
human yelp reviews.

1986
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:37,951
Well,
don't you think?

1987
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:41,070
You also learn about yourself from
conversations where you're not looking

1988
01:24:41,071 --> 01:24:43,080
at your phone,
you're not checking the internet,

1989
01:24:43,081 --> 01:24:45,750
you're not watching television,
just sitting there for hours

1990
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:48,300
communicating with each other and that's
a lost art.

1991
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:51,050
It is an eye.
We forget that the microphones are on.

1992
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:52,520
We forget that we're talking all the
time.

1993
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:54,080
Well,
one of the things that's changed for me

1994
01:24:54,081 --> 01:24:56,230
is I settle the podcast.
That,

1995
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,500
and that was the first time I ever said
out loud.

1996
01:24:57,501 --> 01:24:59,120
I was like,
I really want to see my boyfriend.

1997
01:24:59,121 --> 01:25:01,100
Fuck another woman.
I just wanna like masturbate to it.

1998
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:03,540
And then Steven and it must have been
like,

1999
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:09,340
well he edits the podcasts and he's like
hey you want to uh tell me something.

2000
01:25:09,831 --> 01:25:12,440
And I was like what the three way thing
you want to see me.

2001
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,680
I'm like Oh yeah.
And then we've had three ways and it

2002
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:19,550
brought us closer and it's so hot.
So I have a cuckolding fetish that I

2003
01:25:19,551 --> 01:25:23,190
didn't even realize I had
queens queen.

2004
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,940
That sounds so we don't say that one
cause it's,

2005
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:32,010
that's what you type in to porn hub.
But it's like really cause it just cause

2006
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:34,160
it's a chick but it's queen that Q,
u.

2007
01:25:34,161 --> 01:25:34,940
E a.
N.

2008
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:38,030
It's just like cut.
It just sounds like q u.

2009
01:25:38,031 --> 01:25:41,750
E.
A.

2010
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,750
N.
C.

2011
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,750
U.
C.

2012
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,750
K.
Q.

2013
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,750
U.
E.

2014
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,440
A.
N is queen.

2015
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,210
Don't Google it.
No,

2016
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,800
come on.
It'll be fun I believe yet.

2017
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:50,000
Yes it's cut queen.
Cause I was looking up cuckold and I'm

2018
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:52,130
like why the fuck can't I get shit?
And I'm like,

2019
01:25:52,131 --> 01:25:54,650
dissolve for men.
And then a duty male means like just

2020
01:25:54,651 --> 01:25:55,900
diamond cook queen and it's fine.

2021
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:56,531
Oh,
okay.

2022
01:25:56,531 --> 01:26:00,070
That wasn't the whole thing though was
like guys that are like emasculated,

2023
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:01,500
like some big black dude comes in,
right?

2024
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,840
Yeah,
yeah.

2025
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,080
Those I don't,
and

2026
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,070
you cry in a corner and you jerk.
That's your lube.

2027
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,740
Yeah.
And then one of them was like,

2028
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,840
at the end of it,
the guy came in the other guy's mouth

2029
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:13,580
and I was like,
whoa.

2030
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,520
I made the guy that took another,
that's another category.

2031
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:19,520
It wasn't in it in the first place.
It was all strictly for research.

2032
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:22,550
Right at the end of it,
I was like,

2033
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,970
rope,
this would that poor guy that just sits

2034
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:28,340
there and pretends,
I mean it guess it's a guy who wanted me

2035
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:30,890
to suck a dick and they brought him in,
they gave him a script and he's like,

2036
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:32,920
okay,
I need to see these imt.

2037
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,820
But I mean the,
the,

2038
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,360
the,
the thing that they're projecting like

2039
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:41,270
this,
this vision of like this poor guy who's

2040
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:43,720
with this hot girl and he can't control
or any,

2041
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,860
can't satisfy or,
but they're together.

2042
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:48,750
And then the big blackout comes over to
sit the fuck in the corner and watched

2043
01:26:48,751 --> 01:26:49,640
me,
fuck your woman.

2044
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:50,940
And then,
and he's like,

2045
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,780
do you watch just a couple?
Okay.

2046
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,630
Uh,
what were you researching?

2047
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,503
I don't like

2048
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,710
that's what you're talking about.
Googling a product.

2049
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,170
Yeah.

2050
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:08,060
And know how I got there.
Somebody probably googled it for me and

2051
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:09,800
then made me look at it.
It was like,

2052
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:14,630
I don't even orgasm
my pants off this.

2053
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,230
Do you watch a lot of porn?
That a lot.

2054
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:20,780
What's that to you?
What's not a lot like once or twice a

2055
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:22,120
week.
Oh yeah.

2056
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,440
That's not a lot at all.
Yeah.

2057
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,730
I think porn is like anything else.
You can get obsessed with it.

2058
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:30,890
People get obsessed with all sorts of
things and the porn gives you a

2059
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:31,820
stimulation,
right.

2060
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:34,640
And that stimulation is,
you're watching two people sexually

2061
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,430
interact with each other and you can
pretend you're there.

2062
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:41,540
You can pretend you're doing it,
whatever weird stimulation it is that

2063
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:46,400
that like weird thing that you're doing.
People will numb themselves with that if

2064
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:49,170
they have too much stress.
If there's too much going on their life

2065
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,110
and the it,
it becomes almost like a drug.

2066
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,870
Yup.
And then after you're done jerking off

2067
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,560
and you call me,
you're like,

2068
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,310
well why was I even doing this?
What?

2069
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,560
I'm going to go eat cake and it's just
sadness.

2070
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,520
That can happen too.
I was like,

2071
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:02,600
can you say I feel pretty good after but
I don't consume a ton of porn.

2072
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:04,190
Yeah,
I was getting too much.

2073
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:04,741
I was like,
you know what,

2074
01:28:04,741 --> 01:28:09,350
I'm going to try masturbate into my mind
and it's a lot more work but it's more

2075
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:12,560
rewarding.
I love masturbating to I my imagination.

2076
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,570
I've got to start masturbating natural
people.

2077
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:16,820
Yeah I know people you know like truck
drivers.

2078
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:21,500
I don't know any truck drivers
using,

2079
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:24,030
if you weren't using your real people,
were you cleaning Pten,

2080
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,140
creating beans in your mind?
Yeah,

2081
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,280
the sims and my head.
No,

2082
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:30,000
just imagining my boyfriend fucking
somebody else.

2083
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,680
Oh like a real hot chick.
Cause I'm like,

2084
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:34,570
I always think so high other people,
and normally not my boys,

2085
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,251
but I,
you know,

2086
01:28:35,251 --> 01:28:39,180
I'd never allow my brain to like let's
masturbate to like a that neighbor guy

2087
01:28:39,181 --> 01:28:41,360
that we had or airbnb.
Goddamn.

2088
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,810
And I did masturbate to him and it was
really fun because cause I'm like,

2089
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,250
oh what are you playing a new game?
And we got a new kid.

2090
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,970
It's like candy crush.
Yes.

2091
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,950
But it's really fun.
It's like you can go there in your head

2092
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,500
and he doesn't know that.
So it's cool.

2093
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,900
You didn't hurt him,
you didn't hurt your boyfriend and yeah,

2094
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,090
I didn't hurt anybody.
It

2095
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,950
doesn't seem the same as if you found
out that a,

2096
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,040
that you know is

2097
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,020
jerking off to you.
I just don't want to find out.

2098
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:05,400
But if you're doing it,
that's okay.

2099
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:09,000
They shouldn't dm you and tell you like
so many men do.

2100
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:11,940
It's like you keep that to yourself.
I don't mind if people jerk off to me,

2101
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:14,220
but I should never know about it.
And we agree there's a difference

2102
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:17,960
between a girl saying that she plays
with herself to you versus a godsend

2103
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,230
that he plays with them or a girl,
a girl saying it to a guy is different

2104
01:29:22,231 --> 01:29:26,040
than a guy saying it to a girl came up
to me is like I jerked off to once.

2105
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,990
I'm like,
no,

2106
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:29,840
I don't know.
I get excited.

2107
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:33,210
It depends on how much schlage has.
You were attracted to him probably.

2108
01:29:33,211 --> 01:29:33,921
I mean,
and that's,

2109
01:29:33,921 --> 01:29:36,000
and that's this thing that we liked to
pretend that's not true.

2110
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:37,980
Oh my God.

2111
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,990
If he was like this hot,
sexy guy and he told me that,

2112
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:41,830
I'd be like,
well like that article that I was

2113
01:29:41,831 --> 01:29:43,680
pulling the sit on Joe's toilet for a
little bit,

2114
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,760
an article that I pulled up before we
started the podcast.

2115
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:52,780
Well there was a that a women and
straight and gay men are more attracted

2116
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:58,530
to good looking muscular men,
which shows that we're not making any

2117
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:01,300
progress with sexual gender stereotypes.
Like no,

2118
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,620
that's not it.
And that was like Newsweek or it's the

2119
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:06,720
same.
This space go to the safest space,

2120
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,350
which is my favorite,
one of my favorite twitter pages because

2121
01:30:10,351 --> 01:30:15,351
they will retreat the most ridiculous
social justice warrior men with muscles

2122
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:19,050
and money are more attractive to
straight women and gay men showing

2123
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,530
gender roles aren't progressing.
It's in tech and science.

2124
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:23,940
First of all,
it's not tax,

2125
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:27,720
but it's not science that has god to
have nonsense by a male.

2126
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,500
Sydney are female.
I need to know,

2127
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:34,740
I mean,
it matters not showing gender roles

2128
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:39,940
aren't progressing.
Yeah.

2129
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,300
Neither does hot stays hot.
Stupid.

2130
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,660
No.
It's like if you use a lighter and you

2131
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:47,220
burn your skin,
it stays hot.

2132
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:51,780
We're not progressing in our ability to
defuse fire with your fucking skin.

2133
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:56,340
To me,
I like it because that means you're

2134
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:57,930
driven and you don't sit on your ass all
day.

2135
01:30:57,931 --> 01:31:00,060
No one wants to fuck a lazy person.
I mean,

2136
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:01,220
if you do,
that's your own thing.

2137
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:03,470
But uh,
but also muscles.

2138
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,640
You don't like monster.
I was gonna say,

2139
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,710
I was like,
I wasn't surveyed for that,

2140
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:14,820
but I'm more attracted to somebody who
truly like comedian,

2141
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:16,470
like funny.
When you're funny.

2142
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,860
That is so much hotter to me.
You could be overweight,

2143
01:31:18,861 --> 01:31:20,190
you can be under what you could be
whatever.

2144
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,750
When you're funny.
Well,

2145
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:25,290
isn't that the thing about what is
attractive is that everybody's got their

2146
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:27,030
own little thing.
There's,

2147
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:30,510
there's some pretty standard things,
but then

2148
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:38,340
when that go left or right and a bunch
of different weird ways and that's kind

2149
01:31:38,341 --> 01:31:40,140
of one of the cool things about being a
person.

2150
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,330
You know?
I know some women that are into like

2151
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:47,331
really skinny guys,
like super skinny like ribs that heroin

2152
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:48,560
looks.

2153
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,030
Some girls think that's high.
I can't see that being high.

2154
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,590
My boyfriend is always like,
I want to get skinny.

2155
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:55,550
Like iggy pop.
I'm like no sex.

2156
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:58,440
Then chunk stars.
That's my

2157
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,730
God.
It was like a guy with like a legit gut.

2158
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,460
That's like Dave.
I mean the Dave Matthews that people

2159
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:07,410
love that.
And if David,

2160
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:10,120
Dave Matthews lost,
he has a little belly.

2161
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,820
Yeah.
And if he doesn't have that belly less

2162
01:32:12,821 --> 01:32:14,440
hot.
Have you ever been attracted to

2163
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:16,780
somebody,
made you feel uncomfortable or attracted

2164
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,590
to them because it's not your type,
but usually just take such great care of

2165
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:23,860
his body working out and we're like,
we like fat three Paul

2166
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:29,380
triple out and get a donut machine.
Definitely

2167
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,300
rooted out by weird stuff like the
skinny one.

2168
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:37,630
The skinny ones were because that's like
an unhealthy thing that could be looking

2169
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:39,500
at someone and they look like that.

2170
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:42,400
Iggy pop look is like,
boy he doesn't look healthy,

2171
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:46,300
was still using drugs and he still
skinny.

2172
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:50,560
But it just Kinda,
I think I like a guy that's bigger than

2173
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:52,750
me though.
Like physically bigger than me cause I

2174
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:55,930
like that.
Cause then when he hugged me exactly,

2175
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,000
there's a,
it was pretty good

2176
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,100
actually.
I take that back.

2177
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:06,010
He's got some muscles and he did a song
with Kesha.

2178
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:09,590
That's an old man too.
I mean that's impressive.

2179
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,980
He's 60 years old.
They're

2180
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:13,421
like,
yeah,

2181
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,290
that's him.
Young

2182
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,680
man gets so much harder as they get
older.

2183
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,770
There's some women though that just are,
so we went to this summit that was like

2184
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:25,690
a lot of females.
It was just female speakers,

2185
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:29,170
but women of the year summit chick's
doing rad shit.

2186
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:31,810
Right.
And this woman Sheila Nevins who's the

2187
01:33:31,811 --> 01:33:34,990
head of documentaries at Hbo,
I've never heard of her.

2188
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:40,060
She is the sexiest woman I've ever seen.
She hurt her style and her confidence is

2189
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:40,960
very,
she's very graceful.

2190
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:43,000
But then she's like,
just because you're a woman doesn't mean

2191
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:45,100
you're good at shit.
And like she just is very,

2192
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,170
she has this realisticness to her that
I'm like,

2193
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:50,410
you are so sexy.
I don't give a fuck madness.

2194
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:53,570
That's the only a woman over 50 can have
beautiful

2195
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:58,200
in a way that,
cause I think sometimes young women use

2196
01:33:58,230 --> 01:34:01,490
like I don't give a fuck,
but like you give so much like Fox and

2197
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,320
there's,
when you,

2198
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,910
when you truly don't give a fuck,
you don't need to announce the person

2199
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:10,000
posted the most pictures of the
relationship isn't the one in the worst

2200
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:12,190
relationship.
When you've got to say it,

2201
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:15,640
it's sorta like really depressing.
Strippers always have instagram pages

2202
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:17,560
that have a lot of like inspirational
quotes.

2203
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,511
Memes.
Yeah,

2204
01:34:19,511 --> 01:34:21,480
a lot of memes.
Memes.

2205
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:25,480
Like you know,
I get so depressed at strip clubs I

2206
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,910
really can't handle.
I Love Strip clubs.

2207
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:31,510
I love a hot chick dancing on me with
her titties and my face.

2208
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:37,070
I just want to cry every time.
We have nothing in common except our

2209
01:34:38,471 --> 01:34:40,360
sense of humor.
That's what it is.

2210
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:42,270
We like laughing at dark shit,
like,

2211
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,970
like laughing at something that's real
fucked up is the best feeling ever.

2212
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,530
To me,
that's the same relationship I had with

2213
01:34:47,531 --> 01:34:50,170
my brother.
We're polar opposites except we share a

2214
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:52,420
sense of humor and I love that he's one
of my favorite people in the whole

2215
01:34:52,421 --> 01:34:54,940
world.
I mean you don't have to be the same.

2216
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,980
No,
we are not that all the same and it's

2217
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,220
nice to see like I think a lot of people
like seeing two women that like just a

2218
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:02,880
disagree on a lot of shit,
but it's,

2219
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,240
that doesn't mean I don't like her.
Yeah,

2220
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:09,710
that's a problem too is that people get
so married to ideas that you don't like.

2221
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:11,660
People who don't think the same way that
you do,

2222
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:13,340
which just seems to me to be kind of
crazy.

2223
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:16,990
That is a dumb thing right now.
It's really ramping,

2224
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,250
right?
Identity politics and this idea that

2225
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:21,020
like you have to be on one team or the
other.

2226
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:25,040
You've fucking just dig your heels in
and fight the other side with tooth claw

2227
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:27,500
and nail.
What did we see that strongly in?

2228
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:28,311
Politics.
Right.

2229
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:31,880
And it's a gigantic issue in politics.
Politics is fucking,

2230
01:35:31,881 --> 01:35:33,260
it's exhausting,
but you can't,

2231
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:35,900
people can't live in the opposites.
Like you can be both things.

2232
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:39,530
You can be a great comedian and you
could also sexually assault people.

2233
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:41,870
Like he can be kind of Shitty in there,
but you still look good.

2234
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,270
That doesn't,
don't you think that the Colussy k thing

2235
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:47,150
was extra disturbing because he was
doing it to one of us.

2236
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:50,000
Uh,
he wasn't just doing it.

2237
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,540
It wasn't just saying,
hey girls,

2238
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:53,030
stay still.
I jerk off in front of you,

2239
01:35:53,031 --> 01:35:55,280
which is gross.
But he's also doing it to,

2240
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:57,050
it should be appear.
Exactly.

2241
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:59,600
And that's why it's one of the case.
To me it's a power dynamic.

2242
01:35:59,601 --> 01:36:01,340
And it's a,
you could have had a sex work,

2243
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:04,430
you could've jumped off,
a sex worker would have been thrilled to

2244
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:06,890
take your money,
and you could do a scenario where you're

2245
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:09,170
blocked the door and you jerk off and
she's like,

2246
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,300
but that's a conceptual thing,
right?

2247
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:14,600
That's why that indicates that meets the
power struggle because that consensual

2248
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:16,650
thing doesn't give you the buzz that
causes the,

2249
01:36:16,651 --> 01:36:20,480
for Beth thing,
that also says to me though that Louis

2250
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:23,720
is so intelligent that he did think it
through a little bit more than he's

2251
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:25,640
letting on because it's like,
you know,

2252
01:36:25,641 --> 01:36:29,390
they're going to have to keep this
secret because we're all in this club

2253
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:30,150
together.

2254
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:33,800
So if you do it to a young comedian,
I don't know about that.

2255
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:39,890
There's certain thing about standups.
I think everybody will agree we're

2256
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,200
impulsive.
Standups are impulsive people.

2257
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:44,320
It's one of the reasons why you'll say
the funny thing before everybody,

2258
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:47,120
some people might even not even
entertained the thought.

2259
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:49,730
You opened the door and then blurt it
out quicker than everybody else.

2260
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:54,290
There's an impersonal aspect to that.
So you think that could be an impulse?

2261
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,390
No,
I think that he's an impulsive guy.

2262
01:36:56,450 --> 01:37:00,500
I think most comics are,
and there's a wild thrill to that

2263
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:03,740
impulse.
The problem is you're also doing it to a

2264
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:06,770
person that doesn't want you to do it to
them.

2265
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:09,530
And even if you don't,
there's no physical contact.

2266
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:13,910
You're making them watch you beat off,
which is fucked up.

2267
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:14,810
And then,
you know,

2268
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:18,980
the whole tig notaro thing with tig.
Notaro thinks that he started helping

2269
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:23,060
her to show that he was a nice guy cause
he's like a lesbian and a feminist and

2270
01:37:23,061 --> 01:37:24,170
like he's going to promote her thing.

2271
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:26,180
And this is like take some of the weight
off of him.

2272
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,620
She said that she felt burdened by her
relationship with him because she

2273
01:37:30,621 --> 01:37:33,830
believes that he did it on purpose and
he made a conscious decision.

2274
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,570
It could be,
I don't know.

2275
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,520
You know,
it's a good,

2276
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:39,320
it's a good branding move.
It's a good,

2277
01:37:39,321 --> 01:37:41,420
uh,
let's try and save the reputation,

2278
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:44,000
but I don't know.
I don't know.

2279
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:45,230
But,
but with that though,

2280
01:37:45,231 --> 01:37:47,690
it's like the,
when he hosted snl in the monologues

2281
01:37:47,691 --> 01:37:51,050
about pedophilia and he's like,
he related it to like eating a snickers

2282
01:37:51,051 --> 01:37:54,020
bar.
You want to touch that little kid so bad

2283
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:55,980
and you know how horrible and

2284
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,740
how many lives it ruins and how fucked
up it makes you,

2285
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,680
you know the kid,
but you still do it.

2286
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,960
Like that's what I think that with what
he did,

2287
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:06,340
I'm like you really wanting to do that
real bad.

2288
01:38:06,341 --> 01:38:08,520
Cause comics all knew,
we knew about it current and I knew

2289
01:38:08,521 --> 01:38:10,030
about it five years ago.
Yeah,

2290
01:38:10,031 --> 01:38:10,650
I had heard it.
Yeah.

2291
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:13,650
Wasn't true.
And I had heard from someone who knows

2292
01:38:13,651 --> 01:38:15,970
him better than me and I said,
well what do you mean?

2293
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:20,130
And they gave me like this weird
scenario where he was joking around,

2294
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:24,500
they were all joking around together and
then the story got out and you know,

2295
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:28,420
like he like pulled his dick out like as
a joke and everyone was laughing and it

2296
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:32,100
was like he was being silly.
And then the real story came out.

2297
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,000
But I think,
yeah,

2298
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:36,780
we've had people like the Ari Shaffir
was our podcast.

2299
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:37,301
He pulled his,
the,

2300
01:38:37,301 --> 01:38:38,260
I mean he,
he did ask,

2301
01:38:38,261 --> 01:38:40,780
but like that was fine.
I wanted to see his dick.

2302
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:44,710
I want to see had a vasectomy.
So we wanted to see the scars.

2303
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:46,510
I mean,
there was a reason and then also that we

2304
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:47,870
had never seen,
um,

2305
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:52,510
someone who was not circumcised before
and then he was like,

2306
01:38:52,511 --> 01:38:54,010
do you want to see it?
And where they'd said yes.

2307
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:58,530
Does that think about that cutting baby
Dick's is so common that you guys have

2308
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:01,360
gone through all your life to adulthood.

2309
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,800
Sorry,
shift more than the average person

2310
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:04,730
should fears

2311
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:05,201
first.
Dick,

2312
01:39:05,201 --> 01:39:07,670
do you saw that wasn't sliced open as a
baby?

2313
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,820
It wasn't [inaudible].
It would dick that was uncircumcised.

2314
01:39:09,821 --> 01:39:11,950
This was none of these are two separate
dates.

2315
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,340
I can't believe I've never encountered
an uncircumcised penis or he's a super

2316
01:39:15,341 --> 01:39:16,680
Jew.
Of course he's circumstance.

2317
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,910
I was like,
I got the longest balls in the game and

2318
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:19,451
I'm like,
I mean,

2319
01:39:19,451 --> 01:39:20,560
shown to me,
right?

2320
01:39:20,561 --> 01:39:24,400
Like I want to see them and I'm like,
damn you pretty gross.

2321
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,730
Grapefruit and an old lady's planning.
I've seen,

2322
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:30,240
I've seen ours,
Dick and balls multiple times.

2323
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,850
That's one thing that male comics do.
You,

2324
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:35,730
they're done showing each other's dicks.
I've never showed my pussy to anyway.

2325
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:37,750
Chris [inaudible] senior places not,
I didn't like,

2326
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,450
it wasn't a big pussy.
She didn't see your vagina.

2327
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:42,360
I saw it all.
Yeah,

2328
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:44,000
I know.
I didn't open up sliding.

2329
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:46,200
I like show you saw the staple.
I saw the,

2330
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:49,720
yeah.
That's just because here's my tv set.

2331
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,450
Here is my kitchen.
I over slept for a flight and woke up

2332
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:53,920
drunk.
That's why she saw my vagina,

2333
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:57,580
my pussy.
That's a different story.

2334
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,350
There's no like,
genital mutilation tradition amongst

2335
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:02,800
women and people will say,
Oh,

2336
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,890
you're looking at it the wrong way for
skins,

2337
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:06,120
not mutilation.
Bull.

2338
01:40:06,121 --> 01:40:07,530
The fuck it isn't.
It is.

2339
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,510
Yeah.
I saw a truck in Union square a couple

2340
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:12,160
of months ago.
That's like a circumcision is male

2341
01:40:12,161 --> 01:40:13,450
genital mutilation.
And I was like,

2342
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,130
oh,
it is.

2343
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:15,940
Yeah.
A lot

2344
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,770
of kids lose their dicks from it.
Every year.

2345
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:19,410
Perfections.
Yes.

2346
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:22,530
Not only that,
there's so much shit.

2347
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,660
There's a famous story when it comes to,
uh,

2348
01:40:25,690 --> 01:40:30,690
there's a baby that was raised and
raised as a woman because they did a

2349
01:40:31,031 --> 01:40:34,600
botched circumcision on the kid when it
was a baby and the his penis

2350
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:36,760
essentially,
there was a massive infection.

2351
01:40:36,761 --> 01:40:39,880
They had to remove his penis.
And because of that,

2352
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:41,680
um,
they had made the decision to try to

2353
01:40:41,681 --> 01:40:45,940
transition this person into a woman.
And so they transitioned this person to

2354
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:49,270
a woman and they gave him hormones,
but he always wanted to be a man and it

2355
01:40:49,271 --> 01:40:52,300
was like super confusing to him that he
eventually wound up committing suicide

2356
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:53,980
when he was,
it's a horrible

2357
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:54,940
story.

2358
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:57,890
Please leave
your response

2359
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:00,010
connect.
It is,

2360
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:02,350
but what do you do when you cut off a
baby's Dick?

2361
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,770
I did it.
That's the question.

2362
01:41:03,771 --> 01:41:07,240
When was the teacher wasn't a time when
you can try to reconstruct or they did.

2363
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,970
This is the only,
they've only started putting new Dick's

2364
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:12,370
on people,
but in the last year I think there's

2365
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:15,400
actually only been yes,
I think there's actually only been one

2366
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:17,740
or two successful penis transplants.

2367
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,030
Wow.
Yeah.

2368
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:23,050
I mean it is huge.
It is harder to create a penis and it is

2369
01:41:23,790 --> 01:41:25,380
create a penis.
You take it from a cadaver.

2370
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,950
Well,
whoa.

2371
01:41:26,951 --> 01:41:30,250
It's not the same as I may dig where and
when you transitioned male to female,

2372
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:32,380
you're flipping,
you're flipping the deck,

2373
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:34,840
but they're add,
they're adding on cadaver parts when

2374
01:41:34,841 --> 01:41:36,130
they're going female and a male.

2375
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,490
No,
this isn't what I'm talking about.

2376
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:40,760
I'm talking about someone who's Dick
[inaudible] who lost their Dan accident.

2377
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,150
Okay.
Lorena Bobbitt.

2378
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:46,430
Yeah,
I was going to say cut off her day.

2379
01:41:46,431 --> 01:41:48,150
Yeah.
Well they reattach that,

2380
01:41:48,151 --> 01:41:51,500
but that thing,
and they found that in the field and she

2381
01:41:51,501 --> 01:41:53,270
likes you throw out the window.
The window.

2382
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,460
Cause she should have through that in
the river.

2383
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:56,160
I mean,
yeah.

2384
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,810
There's another story about a woman in
Orange County who tired her boyfriend up

2385
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:02,660
after she drugged him,
tied him up and then cut his dick off

2386
01:42:02,661 --> 01:42:05,420
and threw in the garbage disposal.
She's,

2387
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,780
she's in jail.
She shed be though.

2388
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:10,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2389
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,500
Bad Ass.
But would you say that if a guy did that

2390
01:42:12,501 --> 01:42:14,390
to a girl,
that's horrible.

2391
01:42:14,391 --> 01:42:15,490
I have a bit about like,
uh,

2392
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:17,780
lost his penis during circumcision 17
years ago.

2393
01:42:17,781 --> 01:42:22,730
Undergoes worlds third successful penis
transplant with is a color discrepancy

2394
01:42:22,731 --> 01:42:25,250
that surgeons will fix with tattooing.
I mean,

2395
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,390
all right,
you got it.

2396
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,130
A penis transplant,
I wouldn't know.

2397
01:42:28,131 --> 01:42:29,950
Complain about the color.
Crazy.

2398
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:34,130
So goddamn crazy.
People lose their dicks because of

2399
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,730
circumcision and then when it's not
totally common.

2400
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:38,260
I mean it's,
it,

2401
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:41,060
it's rare,
but it happens when you're a cadaver.

2402
01:42:41,061 --> 01:42:44,120
Who gets your dick taken off to put on
another person?

2403
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:45,740
D is that the,

2404
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:47,720
the,
when you check the box on the back

2405
01:42:47,721 --> 01:42:50,160
driver's license to donate your organs,
like it's all right

2406
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,390
for grabs.
Like yes.

2407
01:42:51,391 --> 01:42:52,470
Yeah.
Wow.

2408
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,120
Yeah.
I'll just put that out there.

2409
01:42:54,121 --> 01:42:55,170
If I die,
take my deck.

2410
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:57,800
Go ahead.
That's really nice of you.

2411
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,270
The thing is,
um,

2412
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:04,350
it's probably really hard to get it to
work right?

2413
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:05,071
To get all the,
I mean,

2414
01:43:05,071 --> 01:43:07,500
it's theirs.
It's a such a complicated organ.

2415
01:43:07,501 --> 01:43:10,740
There's so much going on in there as far
as all these different connections and

2416
01:43:10,741 --> 01:43:15,150
apparently the operation takes forever.
It's a long crazy operation.

2417
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:18,120
Yeah.
Kicking balls are so mystical to me.

2418
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,390
Hmm.

2419
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:20,920
Balls.
You ever stare at your balls and they

2420
01:43:20,921 --> 01:43:22,630
just think it's like there's an alien in
it.

2421
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:25,240
It's like they just move like an octopus
or something.

2422
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,430
I definitely weird.
It's so weird.

2423
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,590
The movement.
The first time I gave a hand job though

2424
01:43:29,591 --> 01:43:31,240
did surprise me.
The balls.

2425
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,940
I know the shaft.
I didn't realize it was going to like

2426
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:34,900
move with me.
Oh,

2427
01:43:34,901 --> 01:43:38,710
the skin was going to like,
I didn't say that out loud,

2428
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:41,440
but definitely thought at weight.
The skin moves with you.

2429
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,221
Yeah.
Where it's like,

2430
01:43:42,221 --> 01:43:46,150
so I thought I was actually just to be
like sliding on my hand up and down.

2431
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:48,880
But if there was a little like a give
there.

2432
01:43:48,881 --> 01:43:49,510
Mm.

2433
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,030
A little gift.
I thought that was a,

2434
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,353
Andy's rocky.

2435
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:54,860
Oh,
I thought it.

2436
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:57,640
Okay,
I'm going to revisit that later.

2437
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:00,350
That's her boyfriend have a tech.
He does have a dick.

2438
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:02,370
Well,
he did say God,

2439
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:06,050
that's our first three way I,
this girl gave him a Ninja blow job.

2440
01:44:06,051 --> 01:44:08,930
Like it was so impressive.
He came right away and I've never,

2441
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:11,060
I've sucked his dick many times.
Still do.

2442
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,500
That doesn't happen.
And uh,

2443
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:15,380
I was in the corner going,
Huh,

2444
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,000
okay.
You were in the corner of the bed.

2445
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:20,810
I was not terrorism but uh,
you know,

2446
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,880
I was like Oh word.
Okay.

2447
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,930
Which,
and it was,

2448
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:26,120
you know,
I stole the areas to see what you were

2449
01:44:26,121 --> 01:44:29,000
doing because we learned this year
Christina has been giving blow jobs.

2450
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:33,530
It's all wrong.
I didn't know you had to suck,

2451
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:38,540
suck it when you go up like a fleshlight
is pleasurable because of the suction

2452
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,940
and your,
when you suck a dick you're supposed to

2453
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:42,460
like suck it in as you go.

2454
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:44,480
Read a little airlock,
little suctioning.

2455
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,670
I was just liking it like a lollipop
and you know,

2456
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:52,850
no one told me cause they're probably
just happy I was there.

2457
01:44:52,851 --> 01:44:56,000
I don't know cause I'm like I don't
really love giving blow jobs but it's

2458
01:44:56,001 --> 01:44:57,020
like Christine is like,
I love it.

2459
01:44:57,021 --> 01:44:58,640
I'm like,
yeah cause you're not doing it right.

2460
01:44:58,641 --> 01:45:01,520
I know.
I was just licking the dick the whole

2461
01:45:01,521 --> 01:45:02,810
time.
I would also like,

2462
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,310
well because it is a job,
Joe a leg,

2463
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,570
he's gonna hate me.
My boyfriend takes like,

2464
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:16,640
it takes a long time to calm and so,
I mean just at a certain point your

2465
01:45:16,641 --> 01:45:19,580
mouth is uncomfortable.
That's why I don't like hand jobs.

2466
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:20,480
I'm like,
you do it.

2467
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:23,780
You do it better than me.
I like watching you do it.

2468
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:25,790
Why?
Why are we sitting here and I'm trying

2469
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:26,624
this,
you know,

2470
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,780
unless you really want me to,
but I'm like

2471
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,210
gone.
Are you comfortable talking about sex

2472
01:45:35,211 --> 01:45:36,450
stuff?
Are you sure?

2473
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,740
Yeah.
Do you have sex toys?

2474
01:45:38,741 --> 01:45:41,570
You sex toys?
I used to have a flashlight.

2475
01:45:41,571 --> 01:45:43,970
Was one of the sponsors,
the earliest sponsor of the podcast.

2476
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,470
But you didn't,
did you use it?

2477
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,160
Okay,
so that's a sex toy friend doesn't use

2478
01:45:49,161 --> 01:45:49,460
them.
Anyway,

2479
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,640
I,
we,

2480
01:45:50,670 --> 01:45:54,500
he dated a famous porn star right before
me and I discovered he could held on to

2481
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:58,220
her flashlight while Hurricane Sandy was
flooding my apartment and curtain was

2482
01:45:58,221 --> 01:46:03,221
over comfort or very uncomfortable life
preserver to them.

2483
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,590
It's not telling you?
No.

2484
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,820
I picked up,
I do a bit about this,

2485
01:46:10,821 --> 01:46:13,100
but I picked it up and I thought it was
a flashlight and I thought he'd thrown

2486
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:14,330
it away and I was like,
oh,

2487
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:15,980
that's a butthole.
Okay.

2488
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:19,440
I have a little talk on corrine leaves
the bottle one.

2489
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:21,020
It's just crazy.
They mold it.

2490
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,260
Yeah,
I mean obviously not the internal parts,

2491
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:26,640
but the outside like they literally like
put like,

2492
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:30,020
like rubber on and went to the place
where they do stuff.

2493
01:46:30,021 --> 01:46:35,021
We went to the Doc Johnson factory,
which is in Los Angeles and we saw the

2494
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:40,220
chair that looks like an ob Gyn chair
where the porn stars and there was like

2495
01:46:40,221 --> 01:46:43,910
remnants of like whatever the stuff this
and mentee stuff that they're putting in

2496
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:45,470
their body.
Like this is stuff that we're taking

2497
01:46:45,471 --> 01:46:47,200
picture right.
Disneyland.

2498
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,920
It's our Disneyland.
But when you jerk off with a fleshlight

2499
01:46:49,921 --> 01:46:50,010
are

2500
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,470
you closing your eyes?
Are you looking,

2501
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,630
are you imagining because they make it
look like an actual policy.

2502
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:56,790
But if that,
that's what I thought.

2503
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:00,420
They also made it look like an alien.
They made an Avatar one at one point in

2504
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:01,590
time.
Whoa,

2505
01:47:01,591 --> 01:47:02,670
I'm in a blue one.
Like you know,

2506
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:07,610
fuck that big blue lady that out.
But it's just a,

2507
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:10,380
it's just a little bit of a tube.
It's just the part you need.

2508
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:11,970
You know what else they make that I
thought it was hilarious.

2509
01:47:11,971 --> 01:47:14,940
They make them that are like,
you know those tall boy like pabst blue

2510
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:17,280
ribbon cans.
They make them out of that.

2511
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,170
So you unscrewed that.
It looks like a camp.

2512
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,470
You would have it in the freezer.
Yeah,

2513
01:47:22,471 --> 01:47:24,150
exactly.
The pussy from your wife.

2514
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,730
Have you ever seen those little,
uh,

2515
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:29,820
we'd be like one of these cavemen Nitros
but you screw the top and you could

2516
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:34,020
stash money inside
than it used to put my house keys.

2517
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:37,320
It does not look like a rock.

2518
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:44,070
Classic.
Rock and [inaudible] leave my key in the

2519
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:46,590
door and it would be less obvious than
this rock.

2520
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:49,860
I go one over a friend of mine's house
and he had fake rock speakers in his

2521
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:55,370
backyard,
but the fucking do look like rocks here.

2522
01:47:55,371 --> 01:47:57,070
This is not what real rock pressing.
No one

2523
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,320
is.
It's those fucking catalogs that they

2524
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:03,380
leave on planes.
I love those.

2525
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,220
Remember those?
You'd be going through those.

2526
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:12,660
I need that six foot big foot statue.
My fucking my backyard.

2527
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:14,430
Yeah,
he watches over the garden man.

2528
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:20,130
Fake.
They make torsos.

2529
01:48:20,131 --> 01:48:22,680
You ever seen one of those?
It's just a chick's torso.

2530
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:27,690
Well it looks like those sex dolls,
you know those real doll things.

2531
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,220
You know they have a brothel in Germany
now where it's like a sex doll brothel

2532
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:39,570
in your house are
so bizarre.

2533
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,420
I wouldn't be comfortable with that.
Yeah,

2534
01:48:42,421 --> 01:48:45,150
there it is.
Probable Brothel.

2535
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:46,920
The Johns or getting too weird.

2536
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:55,420
But that again would come in and pay off
in the same hole.

2537
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:01,620
Would you ever fuck a sex doll for their
story?

2538
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:08,100
We could talk about on the podcast.
I'm not stupid so I wouldn't think it's

2539
01:49:11,281 --> 01:49:15,690
a real person because I think was she
beating off and then like when you're

2540
01:49:15,691 --> 01:49:18,870
going so far that you're fucking this
rubber thing pretending it's a person.

2541
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:20,870
You're taking it to a totally different
place.

2542
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:25,300
Like you're not in a fantasy land where
you're masturbating or watching porn and

2543
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,080
porn,
aren't you thinking our guys,

2544
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:33,081
when they watch porn,
like she's sucking my Dick sorta watch

2545
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,140
porn.
You just thinking that the activity is

2546
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,490
exciting.
Like the activity.

2547
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:43,740
Someone sucking a dick as excited and
then you would like it if they were

2548
01:49:43,741 --> 01:49:45,270
doing it to you,
but you're not thinking,

2549
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:46,450
oh,
she's doing it to me cause you're not.

2550
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,333
Oh you're not.
Not,

2551
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:48,190
you're not stupid.

2552
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,620
You know,
but they're not their suspension of

2553
01:49:50,621 --> 01:49:52,450
disbelief.
It's like when you see a movie,

2554
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:53,500
like,
you know you're at a theater,

2555
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:57,130
but if you're like holding onto some
cold rubber and he got her to cold

2556
01:49:57,131 --> 01:50:00,760
rubber feet in the air and you have a
rubber pussy.

2557
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:03,490
Oh that was the other thing.
The Guy told me that I wrote that

2558
01:50:03,491 --> 01:50:05,110
article and I was going back and forth
with him.

2559
01:50:05,111 --> 01:50:08,050
The guy with a relationship with,
he said he puts her in the,

2560
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:10,600
her in the tub.
She,

2561
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:14,680
he fills a tub with hot water to heat up
the temperature of the body.

2562
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:16,240
Oh,
oh,

2563
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:18,760
I mean that's,
yeah,

2564
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:21,700
it does seem like real murderer.
So weird.

2565
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,270
It's very strange.
I want to go over to his house but not

2566
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:26,890
hurting any.
What do you guys think?

2567
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:31,420
Like if there is like this is theirs.
Do you know what crispr is

2568
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:34,190
withdrawing the bottom of me.

2569
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,830
Your Fridge?
Veggies.

2570
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:37,540
Probably not though.
Yes and no.

2571
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:39,910
It is that.
But it's also a new thing that they're

2572
01:50:39,911 --> 01:50:41,060
allowing.
Um,

2573
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,960
they're,
they're starting to experiment with this

2574
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:47,620
new method of altering,
uh,

2575
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:49,360
DNA.
And they're there,

2576
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:54,280
they're figuring out a way to do it with
non-viable human embryos and they're

2577
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:56,620
starting to do it with humans now that
are alive.

2578
01:50:56,621 --> 01:51:01,621
And one a guy was recently one of the
first people to be injected with a DNA

2579
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:06,130
from crispr.
And as Crispr gets more and more complex

2580
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:09,070
and more and more effective,
they think in the future,

2581
01:51:09,071 --> 01:51:12,730
you're not only going to be able to pick
like what happens to your children,

2582
01:51:12,731 --> 01:51:14,800
like what your children are,
what they look like,

2583
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:17,950
what traits they have and don't have.
You literally going to have like a

2584
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:20,170
laundry list of things that you could
pick and choose.

2585
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,150
But you might be able to do it to
yourself.

2586
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:25,840
Like they might be able to accelerate
the,

2587
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,600
the,
the actual capabilities of this

2588
01:51:28,601 --> 01:51:31,690
technology to the point where you could
take you and you'd say,

2589
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:33,790
I want to be a six foot three black
woman.

2590
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,610
And then they shoot this stuff inside of
you.

2591
01:51:36,611 --> 01:51:40,780
And then over the course of like how
ever long it takes to alter your body,

2592
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:44,980
this is all speculative cause this,
this guy was just the first guy ever to

2593
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:46,720
this recent guy.
See if he could find that,

2594
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:52,640
makes
a ton of those people out there.

2595
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:53,733
But this,
um,

2596
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:57,340
this technology's not going to just
change the way you look.

2597
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,280
It will literally change who you are.
It's going to stretch your legs out.

2598
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:02,920
It's going to change your features and
what's in the way your brain works.

2599
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:05,560
They think they're going to go knock out
Alzheimer's.

2600
01:52:05,561 --> 01:52:10,450
They're going mail stop.
A lot of the genes that allow people to

2601
01:52:10,451 --> 01:52:14,140
have Parkinson's and a lot of different,
different ailments that people have.

2602
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,870
They've isolated those,
those genes and they think they can shut

2603
01:52:16,871 --> 01:52:18,280
them off.
Whoa,

2604
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,780
cancer.
I don't want to live to be 150 I'd be

2605
01:52:22,781 --> 01:52:24,400
able to go,
this is what's going to get really

2606
01:52:24,401 --> 01:52:26,020
weird.
Like you might not want to,

2607
01:52:26,021 --> 01:52:28,750
and you might say that,
but maybe if you're 80 and someone says,

2608
01:52:28,751 --> 01:52:30,820
hey,
you want to be 30 again,

2609
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:32,200
you might go,
Whoa,

2610
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,880
he was in good health.
I wouldn't mind it,

2611
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:38,620
but somebody might be willing,
I mean it might physically be possible

2612
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:43,710
for you to not just look 30 but beathard
like literally change your cellular

2613
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:46,364
structure

2614
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,250
to the point where you're a young person
and that's going to be the destruction

2615
01:52:49,251 --> 01:52:51,680
of our society.
Modifying your own jeans is just an

2616
01:52:51,681 --> 01:52:52,550
injection away

2617
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,000
if you're feeling lucky.
Cause right now it's very experimental.

2618
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:57,250
Um,
but this is a seat,

2619
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,700
but this is just speculative.
There's an article with the very first

2620
01:53:00,701 --> 01:53:02,860
guy had it done.
Yeah.

2621
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:05,050
Very first use of crisper on a living
person.

2622
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:08,110
Uh,
so this is like,

2623
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:10,510
you know,
there's this body acceptance thing,

2624
01:53:10,511 --> 01:53:11,980
right?
Like I'm happy with who I am.

2625
01:53:11,981 --> 01:53:13,810
Be Happy girl,
be happy boy.

2626
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:14,703
Be Happy.
We are,

2627
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:16,810
you're happy until someone comes along
and says,

2628
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:17,410
hey man,
you,

2629
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:20,200
you could be thor.
You know,

2630
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:21,880
you want to be thorough.
I have to do to be thor.

2631
01:53:21,881 --> 01:53:23,500
I'm not willing to make any sacrifices.
No,

2632
01:53:23,501 --> 01:53:24,550
you just go to the thor doc.

2633
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:26,290
It's like Halloween for life.
Yeah.

2634
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,910
He shoots a thor shot and your ass and
you look like that.

2635
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:30,380
Christopher,
whatever his name is guy.

2636
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,570
And could you,
you think you would be able to change

2637
01:53:32,571 --> 01:53:33,890
it?
So like one day I'm thor,

2638
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:36,440
but the other next day I'm Cindy
Crawford and might be able to,

2639
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:38,150
well,
probably going to take a while for your

2640
01:53:38,151 --> 01:53:40,820
body to shift to whatever form it's
going to morph.

2641
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:42,680
And maybe if you keep doing it over and
over again,

2642
01:53:42,681 --> 01:53:45,500
it's like a vhs tape where you keep
copying it over and over again and just

2643
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:46,363
scratch.

2644
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:51,680
You might put some errors in your DNA
and grow some extra feet and weird shit.

2645
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:53,270
Fun,
exciting.

2646
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:54,403
Who knows?
I mean,

2647
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:56,690
listen,
there's gonna be some early adopters

2648
01:53:56,691 --> 01:53:59,360
that are very upset and have buyer's
remorse.

2649
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:00,880
There's no doubt about that.
Yeah.

2650
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:02,180
And then what do you do when that
happened?

2651
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:03,890
What do you do?
Sorry,

2652
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:06,020
but it's like plastic surgery you can
alter,

2653
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:09,560
I mean you can't obviously those,
there's limitations for plastic surgery,

2654
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:13,100
but that don't seem to be on this.
Hypothetically if it goes as far as it's

2655
01:54:13,101 --> 01:54:16,370
like plastic surgery in the sense that
there was one way they used to do it,

2656
01:54:16,371 --> 01:54:18,440
which was awful,
and now they're way better at it.

2657
01:54:18,441 --> 01:54:20,330
Yeah.
Sometimes you can't tell.

2658
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,290
Yeah.
Like boob jobs.

2659
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,090
Yeah.
My boob jobs now they make boobs that

2660
01:54:23,091 --> 01:54:24,780
are soft.
They're smushy and you could,

2661
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,480
when people's don't.
I've met a couple of girls that are

2662
01:54:26,481 --> 01:54:26,751
like,
yeah,

2663
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:27,770
these are fake tits.
I'm like,

2664
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:30,070
yeah,
can I touch them?

2665
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:32,960
And then when you touch them,
they feel like a boob.

2666
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

2667
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:36,520
The crazy here.
Or touch a fake boob.

2668
01:54:36,521 --> 01:54:40,400
It felt like a real boob.
Not No,

2669
01:54:40,401 --> 01:54:42,550
but I've touched fake boobs.
I let that alight.

2670
01:54:42,730 --> 01:54:44,060
Yeah.
I like fake boobs.

2671
01:54:44,061 --> 01:54:46,400
I think they're kind of the fun.
They are fun.

2672
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:48,250
What do you think joe there?
Well

2673
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,160
the real is better,
but it's weird.

2674
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:57,220
Like you people accept fake girl parts.
They do not accept fake boy parts.

2675
01:54:57,681 --> 01:54:59,220
It's really interesting.
And yeah,

2676
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,860
calves and shit.
Like what?

2677
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:01,670
What is it?
Fakes.

2678
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:04,700
I know guys that have at peck implants.
Calf implants.

2679
01:55:04,701 --> 01:55:05,360
Yeah,
it did.

2680
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,170
They look,
can you,

2681
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:08,930
can you tell that they're obviously he's
dead.

2682
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:12,530
Oh it's cause he had it and had a lot of
issues and he's getting a lot of weird

2683
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:15,950
surgery and one of the things he got was
peck implants.

2684
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,370
Wow.
Yeah.

2685
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:20,090
That's nice to know that sometimes men
can be just as insecure as living,

2686
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:24,200
but again,
that's not imposes them.

2687
01:55:24,990 --> 01:55:28,070
That's synthroid.
What that guy's doing is he's injecting

2688
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:32,400
oil into his muscles,
muscles larger and bolts and stop.

2689
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,280
It's not healthy,
right?

2690
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:35,310
No,
no,

2691
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:36,110
no,
no.

2692
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:39,420
Those guys getting massive infections.
You're,

2693
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:41,450
you're shooting.
I didn't even know you could still could

2694
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:44,040
get cancer.
16th Century

2695
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,820
Shit.
No,

2696
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:45,690
no.
Mitch Hedberg,

2697
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,480
Mitch Hedberg before he died,
um,

2698
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,970
a couple of years before he wound up
overdosing.

2699
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:55,740
We were a stand hope and I were hanging
out and he got the call that Mitch was

2700
01:55:55,741 --> 01:56:00,060
in the hospital for gang green shooting
heroin into the same spot over and over

2701
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:01,200
again.
Oh,

2702
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:02,034
okay.
That makes sense.

2703
01:56:02,190 --> 01:56:03,930
Yeah.
You can get gang green for sure.

2704
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,450
People get it today.
Shit.

2705
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:07,890
Yeah.
Fuck.

2706
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,990
But um,
the thing is like,

2707
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,980
you should be happy with who you are if
you can't change it.

2708
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:17,970
The we're getting into is this weird
place in the future.

2709
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:19,620
Do you found that article while you're
out there?

2710
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:22,650
Google apps.
I found I have jumped on that,

2711
01:56:22,651 --> 01:56:27,651
that there was an article from very
resells 16 that said someone in China

2712
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:31,020
was really,
really recent.

2713
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:32,910
The recent,
within the last couple of days,

2714
01:56:32,911 --> 01:56:36,600
it said,
man becomes the first living patient for

2715
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:39,720
crispr.
They injected Crispr DNA.

2716
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,430
What's in it was in the last week or
two.

2717
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:43,500
That article,
I'm typing that in.

2718
01:56:43,501 --> 01:56:46,860
It says it's from 2016 and the recent
ones says there's 20 embryos.

2719
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:48,410
They got check.
Little search.

2720
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,190
Really recent.
Really,

2721
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:52,800
really recent.
Have you ever had a poop enemas?

2722
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:53,723
Yeah,
I found.

2723
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,433
Found the guy.
Okay.

2724
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:58,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

2725
01:56:58,051 --> 01:57:00,030
Here it is.
Genes altered inside a person for the

2726
01:57:00,031 --> 01:57:01,070
first time ever.
This is it.

2727
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:03,810
Exactly.
In a bold experiment that has never been

2728
01:57:03,811 --> 01:57:07,080
done before.
A man had his jeans altered permanently

2729
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:12,081
and attempt to cure a disease.
So this is one step and this guy had a

2730
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:17,010
disease and decided to take this chance
and do this and to scientists for the

2731
01:57:17,011 --> 01:57:18,720
first time.
I tried to editing the gene inside the

2732
01:57:18,721 --> 01:57:22,950
body in a bold attempt to permanently
change a person's DNA to cure a disease.

2733
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:27,360
The experiment was done Monday in
California on 44 year old Brian Maddix

2734
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:29,150
met do I do,
um,

2735
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:32,340
through an ivy,
he received billions of copies of a

2736
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:37,341
corrective gene and genetic tool to cut
his DNA in a precise spot.

2737
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:40,620
Uh,
it's kind of humbling to be the first

2738
01:57:40,621 --> 01:57:45,030
test said Medu who has a metabolic
disease called Hunter Syndrome.

2739
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:47,880
I'm willing to take the risk.
Hopefully it will help me and other

2740
01:57:47,881 --> 01:57:51,420
people will good for that guy,
for being the first guy to take that

2741
01:57:51,421 --> 01:57:54,540
chance because that's one of the things
that they need is they need someone

2742
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:55,770
who's willing.
Yeah.

2743
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:57,060
And He,
like I said,

2744
01:57:57,180 --> 01:58:00,360
as an early adopter,
they'll learn from him and maybe be able

2745
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:02,910
to improve it.
But the point is this is happening at an

2746
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:06,030
incredible pace.
Crispr was just discovered a few years

2747
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:09,690
ago.
There's a great radio lab podcast on it.

2748
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,810
It's spelled c,
R.

2749
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:12,810
I.
S.

2750
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:12,811
P.
R,

2751
01:58:12,811 --> 01:58:14,730
I think it is.
I think it has an e in it.

2752
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:17,460
But if you look up the radio lab
podcast,

2753
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:19,780
it is fucking phenomenal.
And it's,

2754
01:58:19,781 --> 01:58:23,910
it's crazy when they explain how they
discovered this and what the

2755
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:26,610
implications are.
I got to tell my mom about that.

2756
01:58:26,611 --> 01:58:30,090
She's got so many health thanks.
And neurological and every doctor was

2757
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:32,790
ever in Canada is like,
I don't know why.

2758
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,930
Sorry.
And she's like,

2759
01:58:33,931 --> 01:58:38,660
really?
Was she around like any sort of like a

2760
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:39,950
farm?
Yeah,

2761
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,240
the only thing,
uh,

2762
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,010
she,

2763
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,840
uh,
she's pretty sure she had lyme disease

2764
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:45,400
and she didn't know I have lymes
disease,

2765
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,360
but uh,
I got,

2766
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,870
I got the bullseye right away and I got
the antibiotics.

2767
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:53,200
Now they give you two weeks antibiotics.
I only had 10 days at the time.

2768
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:54,820
So I feel like maybe I need to go back,
but I don't,

2769
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:57,220
I don't,
I have a very sensitive stomach.

2770
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:59,170
Uh,
and that's all,

2771
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:02,230
that's all you have is a motherfucker
fuck you up.

2772
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:03,910
Yeah.
It doesn't get any worse and worse and

2773
01:59:03,911 --> 01:59:04,744
worse.
Yeah,

2774
01:59:05,450 --> 01:59:06,620
yeah,
yeah,

2775
01:59:06,621 --> 01:59:07,231
yes.
Not Good.

2776
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:07,320
Yeah.

2777
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,660
But I need something like 60% of the
ticks and the upper Hudson valley have

2778
01:59:10,661 --> 01:59:11,291
lyme disease.
Oh,

2779
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:12,190
Jesus.
Yeah.

2780
01:59:12,191 --> 01:59:15,700
Something insane.
Like it's really high levels and it's

2781
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:18,430
all over the east coast.
And you know for a long time doctors

2782
01:59:18,431 --> 01:59:19,100
didn't even know what the fuck

2783
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,320
that was.
Oh yeah.

2784
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:23,500
But that's what I'm pretty sure cause
it's neurological for all her shit

2785
01:59:23,501 --> 01:59:26,350
neurological and she has like,
she has an Arachnoid cyst and the base

2786
01:59:26,351 --> 01:59:29,060
of our stem but they don't know if it
was there when she was born in

2787
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:31,280
[inaudible] arachnoid cyst.
Yeah.

2788
01:59:31,281 --> 01:59:34,030
It's just like a spider says kind of.
It's like a big ball.

2789
01:59:34,031 --> 01:59:38,320
And then it like wraps around her,
the base of her skull and the top of her

2790
01:59:38,321 --> 01:59:39,160
spinal cord.
Yeah.

2791
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:41,980
And they think she just got diagnosed
with dementia and they think that

2792
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:45,220
possibly draining it would do something
but they don't know.

2793
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:48,190
But then she just got half of her
intestines taken out.

2794
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:50,920
She has,
she's the one of the 3% of people who

2795
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:53,620
gets a bell's palsy and it doesn't go
back.

2796
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,220
Oh God.
And she's trouble get bell's palsy is

2797
01:59:56,221 --> 01:59:57,800
from lyme disease.
Oh re.

2798
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,740
Oh yes.
I remember reading that because I didn't

2799
01:59:59,741 --> 02:00:03,280
know you could get bell's palsy and then
it goes back to normal and it's more

2800
02:00:03,281 --> 02:00:06,100
common.
It's like 97% chance your face is going

2801
02:00:06,101 --> 02:00:08,470
to go back to normal.
That the atrophy that happened.

2802
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:09,260
Wow.

2803
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:10,750
A friend of mine,
his son got it.

2804
02:00:10,751 --> 02:00:12,070
He was really young and they brought
him,

2805
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:15,880
the son got lyme disease and he brought
the son to the doctor and doctor didn't

2806
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:19,330
think it was lyme disease and then
finally the kid had bell's palsy and

2807
02:00:19,331 --> 02:00:21,970
that's when they realized and then they
started giving them like the series

2808
02:00:21,971 --> 02:00:24,250
antibiotics and [inaudible] son was very
young too.

2809
02:00:24,251 --> 02:00:26,230
I think he was only four at the top.
Yeah.

2810
02:00:26,231 --> 02:00:26,840
Intense.

2811
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:28,880
She had a,
she had a stroke though when she gave

2812
02:00:28,881 --> 02:00:31,750
birth to my brother.
My older brother are first kid and uh,

2813
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:34,490
that's then after that was when the
bell's palsy happened.

2814
02:00:34,491 --> 02:00:35,590
So I'm like,
it's,

2815
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:37,360
I guess it's the connected to that.
She,

2816
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:40,490
she's like a walking health question
phenomenon.

2817
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:41,450
Yeah,
she is.

2818
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,640
She is crispr.
Yeah.

2819
02:00:43,641 --> 02:00:45,650
I'm sound like June.
That shit probably could help

2820
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:47,030
actually.
Who knows.

2821
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:50,060
I mean we'll see what happens to this
guy with hunter syndrome boat if this

2822
02:00:50,061 --> 02:00:51,830
really works.
And this is all,

2823
02:00:51,831 --> 02:00:55,190
like I said,
this discovery of Crispr is only a

2824
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:56,180
couple of years old.
They're already starting to use it.

2825
02:00:56,181 --> 02:00:57,170
I'm living humans.

2826
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,140
She's at the end of her rope to the
point where she would say whatever do

2827
02:01:01,141 --> 02:01:02,640
it.
I don't care cause I feel like she'd be

2828
02:01:02,641 --> 02:01:04,150
a good candidate for that.

2829
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,370
See,
the thing about lyme disease too is that

2830
02:01:06,371 --> 02:01:10,690
it has a neurotoxic element to it that
it causes like mental disorders.

2831
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:11,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

2832
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:14,830
It's also curry.
It's connected to something called more

2833
02:01:14,831 --> 02:01:16,150
challenge disease.
Oh,

2834
02:01:16,151 --> 02:01:17,930
I've heard of that.
I don't know what Joe does is like

2835
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:20,530
people start thinking they have fibers
growing out of their skin.

2836
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:22,470
They started scratching themselves and
yeah,

2837
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:24,490
and the,
the hallucinate.

2838
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,580
I did a TV show about it and one of the
things that I found that was fascinating

2839
02:01:27,581 --> 02:01:32,581
was there was one doctor who was like a
legitimate doctor who had more

2840
02:01:32,741 --> 02:01:35,650
gentleman's disease and it was
explaining the hallucinations that he

2841
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:37,710
would have while he had,
um,

2842
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:39,560
because he had lyme disease.
Well.

2843
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:44,830
And he was thinking that when you get
bit by a bug and that bug has like lyme

2844
02:01:45,141 --> 02:01:49,250
disease and tick diseases are very,
they vary and they vary in intensity and

2845
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:52,780
they also vary in how many different
different pathogens that tick and

2846
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:53,623
contain.

2847
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,700
And so the way he was describing it to
me,

2848
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:58,550
it's like you're talking about one
symptom,

2849
02:01:58,551 --> 02:02:00,470
like a,
something that happens to you when you

2850
02:02:00,471 --> 02:02:04,250
have a host of different pathogens.
And he said some of those pathogens he

2851
02:02:04,251 --> 02:02:09,080
believes contain neurotoxic elements
that causes people to hallucinate and

2852
02:02:09,081 --> 02:02:12,170
why those hallucinations is they think
that things are growing on their skin.

2853
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:15,890
And they started scratching themselves
and he was seeing it on his eyeball.

2854
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,230
He was saying,
you look in the mirror and he would see

2855
02:02:18,231 --> 02:02:22,310
something crawling across his eyeball.
But he knew knew wasn't really there.

2856
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,590
Fuck.
And because he was so smart and because

2857
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:26,840
he was a doctor,
he was recognizing like,

2858
02:02:26,841 --> 02:02:27,710
okay,
I am,

2859
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:31,940
my brain is malfunctioning.
I've got a real issue here in the toxic

2860
02:02:31,941 --> 02:02:36,740
element of this fucking lyme disease is
spreading through his body and just to

2861
02:02:36,741 --> 02:02:37,580
come to it.
Yeah.

2862
02:02:37,581 --> 02:02:38,250
And so he would,
he,

2863
02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:41,930
the more challenges like widely
dismissed by a lot of medical

2864
02:02:41,931 --> 02:02:44,600
practitioners is beans a psychosomatic
disorder.

2865
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:46,850
They think that people are just crazy
and they're hallucinating,

2866
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,190
but he's saying yes,
but if you look into that,

2867
02:02:49,191 --> 02:02:50,880
they almost all have lyme disease.
Oh,

2868
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,910
okay.
You're saying it is connected and people

2869
02:02:52,911 --> 02:02:53,744
are missing this connect.

2870
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:54,521
Yeah.
Yeah,

2871
02:02:54,521 --> 02:02:55,121
I have.
I,

2872
02:02:55,121 --> 02:02:56,590
yeah.
And I feel like we've,

2873
02:02:56,591 --> 02:02:59,830
we've always debated my mom and I that
for mental shit is from that,

2874
02:02:59,831 --> 02:03:03,760
from limes and then like I've haven't,
I don't have many symptoms of lines.

2875
02:03:03,761 --> 02:03:05,200
Well,
one thing I've been getting lately,

2876
02:03:05,201 --> 02:03:09,790
like the past maybe five years,
it's anger attacks like fucking rage

2877
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:13,090
that I can't,
I have to do something to get it out of

2878
02:03:13,091 --> 02:03:15,650
my body because it's watching that girl
suck your boys deck.

2879
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:17,320
No,
I liked that though.

2880
02:03:18,910 --> 02:03:21,940
But that was fun.
How come I was jerking off to it?

2881
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:23,340
Uh,
no,

2882
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:24,970
but it would just come out of nowhere
and I'm like,

2883
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:26,920
it feel,
it felt like,

2884
02:03:26,921 --> 02:03:28,860
I felt like the incredible hulk.
Like you wanted to,

2885
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,060
it's some medical issue that something
was going on.

2886
02:03:31,061 --> 02:03:31,894
Like there was a,
uh,

2887
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:35,830
like there's like a problem I go because
it didn't,

2888
02:03:35,831 --> 02:03:37,780
it wasn't attached to hormonal,
wasn't pms.

2889
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:40,150
I also have bad pms,
but that's more anxiety.

2890
02:03:40,151 --> 02:03:43,030
It's not anger.
I would get these like anger attacks and

2891
02:03:43,031 --> 02:03:44,880
I would have to scream,
oh,

2892
02:03:44,970 --> 02:03:46,480
my poor boyfriend.
Like I would scream.

2893
02:03:46,481 --> 02:03:49,300
I still do.
I will scream into a pillow until I

2894
02:03:49,301 --> 02:03:51,850
can't talk anymore.
I polyps on my vocal cords and I feel

2895
02:03:51,851 --> 02:03:53,770
like that's mom help one.
But it's,

2896
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:56,200
I need to get it out.
I don't punch somebody,

2897
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:59,970
but I need to break something or I need
a Pi or you need to hurt myself so I can

2898
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:02,410
feel embarrassed and then come down from
it.

2899
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:05,620
But at least you confirmed my suspicions
that all funny people are fucked up.

2900
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:07,600
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2901
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:08,673
Oh,
I got it.

2902
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:09,470
Well,
you don't,

2903
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:11,020
you don't seem very fucked up.
Yeah.

2904
02:04:11,021 --> 02:04:13,890
What's your fucked up?
You fucked up and what?

2905
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,640
We did it out,
but from martial arts,

2906
02:04:15,641 --> 02:04:17,930
but it,
my whole life I've beat people up.

2907
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:18,761
Vote.
No,

2908
02:04:18,761 --> 02:04:19,360
no,
not,

2909
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,460
but I'd been in five competitions.
Yeah.

2910
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:23,350
Oh,
but that's healthy though.

2911
02:04:23,351 --> 02:04:24,790
And then,
yeah,

2912
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,560
maybe not.
Oh,

2913
02:04:26,620 --> 02:04:29,050
I got hit in the head a lot when I was a
while.

2914
02:04:29,051 --> 02:04:31,020
Your brain works well.
You got a lot in there.

2915
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:32,970
Yeah,
it works pretty good,

2916
02:04:32,971 --> 02:04:35,400
but it's also,
there's a hair trigger there.

2917
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:38,940
There's a hair trigger mechanism.
Always wants it to flip off and always

2918
02:04:38,941 --> 02:04:40,080
wants to go dark.

2919
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,620
You did.
Oh Wow.

2920
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:43,570
What could we,
what would trigger

2921
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:45,390
do at an event?
Like some,

2922
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:48,750
some someone doing something bad,
something happening where I'd to you or

2923
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:50,100
to anybody?
To anybody.

2924
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:51,480
Not to me.
To anybody.

2925
02:04:51,481 --> 02:04:52,950
There's just a,
there's a,

2926
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:56,160
there's the anger switch where I'm not
real comfortable that I have,

2927
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:56,701
uh,
you know,

2928
02:04:56,701 --> 02:05:00,480
like if you have your finger on a gun
and the trigger is very light and you,

2929
02:05:00,481 --> 02:05:02,400
you're applying pressure,
but you're very like,

2930
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:03,720
whoa,
this could go off any second.

2931
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:05,140
Now there's that.
Oh,

2932
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:06,080
something goes weird.

2933
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:08,040
Oh,
that sucks.

2934
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:09,960
It's does.
But if you work out a lot,

2935
02:05:09,961 --> 02:05:11,060
you can keep it in check.
Yeah.

2936
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,990
I workout,
I lift weights.

2937
02:05:12,991 --> 02:05:14,760
I do,
I train and I do like,

2938
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:17,100
uh,
like dead lifts and squats and Shit and

2939
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:21,150
that I love physical labor.
I love using my muscles and uh,

2940
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:21,751
and it,
it,

2941
02:05:21,751 --> 02:05:23,760
it,
it takes my anxiety away and it makes

2942
02:05:23,761 --> 02:05:26,490
the rage attacks way less.
I feel like I have a lot of

2943
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:27,470
testosterone.
Yeah,

2944
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,520
you probably do.
I mean this is probably why you like

2945
02:05:29,521 --> 02:05:32,990
threesomes and lot of crazy shit that
some girls wouldn't be into.

2946
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:33,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2947
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:35,330
But there's nothing wrong with that,
you know,

2948
02:05:35,331 --> 02:05:38,780
but as long it's all in like finding
what you need to do to kind of balance

2949
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:40,220
out whatever biological issues.
Yeah.

2950
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,370
That's what it is.
Because right now at this point,

2951
02:05:42,371 --> 02:05:45,220
like I feel like the world doesn't see
the anger attacks when my poor fucking

2952
02:05:45,221 --> 02:05:45,821
boyfriend,
I mean,

2953
02:05:45,821 --> 02:05:47,860
cause I live with them,
so he's the one that gets the brunt of

2954
02:05:47,861 --> 02:05:50,920
it and he cares about me and he'll go do
when this happens.

2955
02:05:50,921 --> 02:05:53,140
Do you want me to come upstairs?
Do you want me to ignore you?

2956
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:54,730
I'm like,
I don't know.

2957
02:05:54,731 --> 02:05:55,564
I'm sorry

2958
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:56,350
for,
um,

2959
02:05:56,350 --> 02:05:59,110
do you ever like do a,
like a boxing class or something?

2960
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:01,720
Did a bar,
a punching bag to kickbox and once and I

2961
02:06:01,721 --> 02:06:06,340
cried the whole class.
Why did you cry?

2962
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:09,220
Cause I was like,
I wonder cry.

2963
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,490
Yeah,
you're crossing.

2964
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:12,550
Even I was in a good mood that day.
I just,

2965
02:06:12,551 --> 02:06:15,700
my friend Melissa like loves kickbox.
She's very athletic and she's like you

2966
02:06:15,701 --> 02:06:18,370
should come with me to a tiger shellmans
class.

2967
02:06:18,371 --> 02:06:21,700
And I was like okay.
And then I came and all man I went to

2968
02:06:21,701 --> 02:06:24,720
town on that punching bag.
I love punching shit over.

2969
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:27,070
Yeah.
Maybe you should do that.

2970
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:28,060
Yeah.
Yeah,

2971
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:30,070
yeah.
I mean the thing like I yeah I should

2972
02:06:30,071 --> 02:06:31,700
take boxing classes.
Just don't like when anybody else's

2973
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:35,410
around cause it Kinda is embarrassing.
Well that's why the rage rooms that we

2974
02:06:35,411 --> 02:06:38,400
were talking about before would be,
cause you're in a rage room by yourself.

2975
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:43,220
They don't have them in New York City or
rage room is a place they have you don't

2976
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:44,054
know about.

2977
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:49,860
You would love this room.
My life is men need rage rooms more than

2978
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:53,090
anyone for rage garage.
Okay.

2979
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:54,550
Do you,
would you break shit?

2980
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:55,421
No.
Okay,

2981
02:06:55,421 --> 02:06:57,370
so these,
they'll go to a thrift store.

2982
02:06:57,371 --> 02:06:59,170
They'll pop by all the,
you know,

2983
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:00,780
away like sweets.
Yeah.

2984
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:02,650
Right.
And you can go in there with a fucking

2985
02:07:02,651 --> 02:07:06,350
baseball bat boy.
Yeah.

2986
02:07:06,370 --> 02:07:09,430
This is my fantasy.
Oh God.

2987
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:13,660
I mean that's Wayne.
I want to break glass for wasteful,

2988
02:07:13,661 --> 02:07:15,340
but yeah,
this seems wasteful to me.

2989
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,473
Nah,
I love it.

2990
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:19,870
I like this guy is like half ass and
that he's not trying hard.

2991
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,850
He's not mad at all.
He's just trying to fuck these girls.

2992
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:25,690
Girls get together like a rage in me
afterwards.

2993
02:07:25,730 --> 02:07:28,430
All my songs,
Nascar.

2994
02:07:29,110 --> 02:07:33,610
So he's got some deep roots.
Might have some like hidden rage.

2995
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,960
Oh Hey.
I like,

2996
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:35,983
Huh?
Yeah.

2997
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:38,600
This guy's like examining is on a hot
to,

2998
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:42,080
so he's not even angry.
They're faking it.

2999
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:43,880
He's an angry.
The way he's hitting things.

3000
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:44,990
I mean,
if I'm in a rage room,

3001
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:47,780
I do not want there to be cameras.
I like how they put chest protectors on

3002
02:07:47,781 --> 02:07:47,991
you.
What?

3003
02:07:47,991 --> 02:07:49,130
A bunch of pussies.
Yeah.

3004
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:50,193
Well,
Amen.

3005
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:53,600
Man Hits you the chair.
You're going to be okay.

3006
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,650
But there's consequences to raise you.
Fuck No.

3007
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:59,780
The whole idea.
But I want it to destroy some shit and

3008
02:07:59,781 --> 02:08:01,340
not have there be any consequences

3009
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:03,820
you should do.
I think you should seriously try to

3010
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:05,350
meditate because I think it would help
you.

3011
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:06,970
Yeah.
Sometimes it makes me angry though.

3012
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:08,530
Yeah.
But then I think you should go to a

3013
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:09,850
martial arts class.
Yeah.

3014
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:11,800
You should do that.
And go take the kickbox.

3015
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:14,150
Go Punch a battle cry.
I bet.

3016
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,730
I bet it'll get it out of your system
now.

3017
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:18,520
I bet it will.
Maybe I've screamed,

3018
02:08:18,521 --> 02:08:19,520
man.
And then morph.

3019
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:21,820
You never tried yoga.
I Love Yoga.

3020
02:08:21,821 --> 02:08:23,100
I do yoga a lot.
I,

3021
02:08:23,101 --> 02:08:24,610
I do.
I use the excuse of time.

3022
02:08:24,611 --> 02:08:25,450
It does help.
I,

3023
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:26,980
but I like,
um,

3024
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,850
like that's why like weightlifting,
like I,

3025
02:08:28,851 --> 02:08:33,130
I got up to a point where I was,
I was squatting 175 pounds and it was,

3026
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:35,740
ugh.
It felt so good and it felt like I was,

3027
02:08:35,741 --> 02:08:38,120
every cell in my body was working for
something and it,

3028
02:08:38,121 --> 02:08:41,170
and I got energy out.
And if I hadn't gotten that energy out,

3029
02:08:41,171 --> 02:08:43,670
I would have just had a fucking angered
right

3030
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:45,610
sites.
Your whole endocrine system to the thing

3031
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:49,180
about lifting weights and specifically
like squats and dead lifts and these are

3032
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:54,100
these big giant complex movements,
is that it forces your body to get

3033
02:08:54,101 --> 02:08:57,010
stronger in a way that it excites your
hormonal system.

3034
02:08:57,790 --> 02:09:00,880
It makes your bones denser.
That's one of the most important things

3035
02:09:00,881 --> 02:09:01,714
about it.
Yeah,

3036
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:04,800
it's a great way to combat osteoporosis
is to lift weights.

3037
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,000
Oh Shit.
I just like it because it's the one time

3038
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:09,250
like I like physical activity because
you can,

3039
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,200
you,
I have to think about the physical

3040
02:09:11,201 --> 02:09:14,740
activity I'm doing so I can't stress
about my career.

3041
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:19,390
Is that the only time I don't think
about like getting a head.

3042
02:09:19,391 --> 02:09:21,370
I'm just like the I,
it's the only time I'm in the moment

3043
02:09:21,371 --> 02:09:23,650
really,
and I love talking to trainers because

3044
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:27,400
you're talking about next is that too in
the moment,

3045
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:30,130
not just tired of her jaws hurting,
hurting.

3046
02:09:30,690 --> 02:09:32,080
My boyfriend said to me the other day,
he's like,

3047
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:33,730
you never look me in the eye when we
fuck.

3048
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:34,670
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

3049
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,810
I guess I don't like we have a sex
podcast.

3050
02:09:37,811 --> 02:09:40,780
So I think that,
I mean before before we had this sex pot

3051
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:42,100
cast,
it was more freeing for me.

3052
02:09:42,101 --> 02:09:47,101
Now I do think of work when I think of
sex because when you have a sex podcast

3053
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:49,790
that is pay my rent.
Yeah.

3054
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:53,830
Well the is the ironic thing about
careers is that especially in a creative

3055
02:09:53,831 --> 02:09:55,660
endeavor,
if you think too much about them,

3056
02:09:55,661 --> 02:09:57,400
you paralyze yourself.
Yeah.

3057
02:09:57,401 --> 02:10:00,250
Like you're paralyzed it creativity
cause you're thinking about advancement

3058
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:04,440
and getting ahead and success instead of
thinking about creative ideas like you

3059
02:10:04,441 --> 02:10:06,640
can,
you could definitely like have too much

3060
02:10:06,641 --> 02:10:09,400
of one or the other.
I mean you can only think about creative

3061
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:11,770
and never,
never get your career online because you

3062
02:10:11,771 --> 02:10:14,260
just never figured out how to monetize
things.

3063
02:10:14,261 --> 02:10:14,550
Yeah.

3064
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:17,640
And don't put pressure on the idea.
Like when guys we fucked it just came

3065
02:10:17,641 --> 02:10:19,050
out of like,
let's just do this.

3066
02:10:19,051 --> 02:10:19,900
We didn't,
I and I,

3067
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:24,270
and I was nervous to do it because the
name was so brash and I knew it was

3068
02:10:24,271 --> 02:10:24,991
good,
but I'm like,

3069
02:10:24,991 --> 02:10:26,430
damn,
my mom's going to find out.

3070
02:10:26,610 --> 02:10:29,430
And I was worried about that.
I hid it from her for two years

3071
02:10:29,431 --> 02:10:30,800
successfully.
That's hilarious.

3072
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:33,320
It started getting too big though.
But we honestly,

3073
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:34,940
both of us were like,
no one's going to,

3074
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:37,070
wasn't a shit.
No one's gonna listen to me talk about

3075
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:39,650
my pussy.
So might as well just talk about it and

3076
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:41,540
not care and see the lesson.

3077
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:46,120
That's the way podcasts evolve the best.
When I first started doing it,

3078
02:10:46,121 --> 02:10:48,430
me and my friend Brian,
we just started fucking around with a

3079
02:10:48,431 --> 02:10:52,870
laptop,
set up a laptop and we're doing it on

3080
02:10:52,871 --> 02:10:55,300
ustream and we didn't even have it
uploaded to itunes.

3081
02:10:55,410 --> 02:10:57,040
Yeah,
you're just doing this live streaming

3082
02:10:57,041 --> 02:10:59,110
thing.
And then people would ask questions and

3083
02:10:59,111 --> 02:11:01,510
there was like 200 people watching.
And it was like,

3084
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:04,510
that was the early days.
There was no pressure on it at all.

3085
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,180
And then it was like,
oh,

3086
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:09,070
do this every week.
And then every week started building and

3087
02:11:09,071 --> 02:11:11,350
building and building.
Then we started getting some numbers in

3088
02:11:11,351 --> 02:11:12,184
and it was like,
hmm.

3089
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:15,580
People watching this thing and then it
got weird.

3090
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,980
Well it's cool cause like doing your
podcast and you can do every fucking

3091
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:20,690
late night show on television and you
get,

3092
02:11:20,730 --> 02:11:23,450
you reach more people because podcasts,
you can hear it anywhere.

3093
02:11:23,451 --> 02:11:25,820
There's Internet in the world.
You can get access to it.

3094
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:26,983
That's so powerful.

3095
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:30,030
There's definitely that.
And there's also no one's interrupting

3096
02:11:30,031 --> 02:11:31,590
you.
No one's telling you what to talk about.

3097
02:11:31,591 --> 02:11:34,080
Like thinking about some of the fucked
up shit we've said in the last couple,

3098
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:38,860
right.
We [inaudible] are fine with it

3099
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:44,850
and pitch like dark shit and just see
the blood draining for their face.

3100
02:11:44,851 --> 02:11:46,540
I'm like,
Oh fuck you pussies.

3101
02:11:46,541 --> 02:11:51,541
But then you remember you have to be,
Jean has never going to sign onto that

3102
02:11:52,391 --> 02:11:53,100
concept.
Yeah.

3103
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:54,610
Hell No.
Different world.

3104
02:11:54,611 --> 02:11:56,770
Those people,
those TV people,

3105
02:11:56,771 --> 02:11:59,440
they live in a world of tricking dummies
in the middle of the country.

3106
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:02,530
That's what they look for the next three
and a half.

3107
02:12:02,531 --> 02:12:05,680
Men like what I get,
what can I need a big bang theory to

3108
02:12:05,681 --> 02:12:08,560
shut down these morons throats?
They were really open about it.

3109
02:12:08,561 --> 02:12:09,950
They're like a lot of concepts we
pitched.

3110
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:10,541
They're like,
yeah,

3111
02:12:10,541 --> 02:12:12,570
but the middle of the country,
they're not going to like,

3112
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:15,670
and there's a lot of great people

3113
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:18,010
in the middle of the country now too.
This is the thing about the middle of

3114
02:12:18,011 --> 02:12:20,080
the country.
It doesn't exist anymore because the

3115
02:12:20,081 --> 02:12:21,460
middle of the country is the Internet
too.

3116
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:25,360
So like ignorance is,
I mean there's going to be pockets of

3117
02:12:25,361 --> 02:12:27,700
ignorance no matter what you do.
And we found that out in

3118
02:12:27,701 --> 02:12:30,040
Charlottesville,
like there was a big shocker for a lot

3119
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:31,090
of people.
They didn't know that.

3120
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:34,240
There's still people with fucking Tiki
torches walking on the street talking

3121
02:12:34,241 --> 02:12:37,390
about the blend of our fathers and all
this goofy shit.

3122
02:12:37,391 --> 02:12:41,140
But you're,
you're finding more and more people.

3123
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,960
Like if you tour,
you can go to places like Kansas City.

3124
02:12:43,961 --> 02:12:44,794
You run it up.

3125
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,820
Cool people,
we were in spokane,

3126
02:12:46,821 --> 02:12:49,850
we had a Gig in spokane are spokane,
Washington.

3127
02:12:49,851 --> 02:12:54,851
It's awesome though.
Alice,

3128
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:58,850
Great Salt Lake City.
I really love Texas.

3129
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:04,080
Texas is awesome.
Our live show is very to love it,

3130
02:13:04,821 --> 02:13:09,000
are going to hate it and I would go to
going to like a more conservative state.

3131
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:10,880
I'm like,
I going to see you.

3132
02:13:10,910 --> 02:13:12,260
They liked it.
You're coming.

3133
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:14,270
Exactly.
It's like they found their,

3134
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:16,970
their podcasts that helps them live in
Dallas,

3135
02:13:16,971 --> 02:13:19,370
Texas or wherever it may be.
We did a segment called,

3136
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,320
we did a segment called sexting theater
and we're like,

3137
02:13:21,321 --> 02:13:22,190
who in here?
Sex?

3138
02:13:22,191 --> 02:13:23,090
And then when they raised their hand
like,

3139
02:13:23,091 --> 02:13:23,860
give me your phone.
I want to,

3140
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:25,730
we do a theatrical interpretation of
their sex.

3141
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:28,310
The raunchiest,
I didn't want to read it.

3142
02:13:28,311 --> 02:13:29,870
I was blushing.
Was in Dallas.

3143
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:32,070
This guy's talking about sucking a fart
out of someone's

3144
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,840
body.
Like it was our first gay man.

3145
02:13:33,841 --> 02:13:37,680
So of course he was.
But I was like,

3146
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:41,850
that's impressive and unexpected.
You were on board with the fart sucking

3147
02:13:41,851 --> 02:13:45,540
until you heard it was a man was trying
to take it all in and then he hit me

3148
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:48,270
with gay man and it won't even further
so much

3149
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:53,720
joe fruit of missed that part of my
life.

3150
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:58,870
Of course you have your
finger on the button.

3151
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:02,940
No,
you have a prostate shit in there.

3152
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:05,550
You don't do it after you've eaten a
Burrito.

3153
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:07,230
I agree with you.
No.

3154
02:14:07,231 --> 02:14:07,950
Okay.
Wait,

3155
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:09,960
I don't want to like,
I'm going to give you a homework

3156
02:14:09,961 --> 02:14:14,010
assignment
for the girl with a bullet for a ring.

3157
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:18,900
That's where bullets belong on jewelry,
but everyone thinks is a cocaine bio.

3158
02:14:18,901 --> 02:14:19,734
I'm like,
oh that's a good point.

3159
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:23,490
And
stimulator.

3160
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:27,150
So your prostate is your g spot and you
just put it in.

3161
02:14:28,330 --> 02:14:30,870
You just put it in you upset.
So we put it in a knee jerk off.

3162
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,560
When I hear men talk about like they
love women when they,

3163
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:36,330
when a woman comes,
it's so hot to them.

3164
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:38,190
I've never experienced that with men
because they're always like,

3165
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:40,980
oh,
this thing I'm telling you,

3166
02:14:43,070 --> 02:14:44,850
I can reenact that.
So many times I've seen it,

3167
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:49,800
but when they had,
when my boyfriend has the product that

3168
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:54,830
we use a narrows Ros,
it's a prostate simulator simulator.

3169
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:57,810
It's a Rog,
you shove in there,

3170
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:04,550
it's more like gently glide with
big and a and you put it in and we have

3171
02:15:09,991 --> 02:15:12,470
sex orgasm.
Yes.

3172
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:16,750
Like a curve baby day ruined to that.
No,

3173
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:20,240
it's like a,
it's like a mini Dildo for your button.

3174
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:21,750
We were all having a nice time.
No,

3175
02:15:21,751 --> 02:15:22,620
but,
and then you have sex,

3176
02:15:22,621 --> 02:15:26,910
you do what you gotta do anyway.
And the orgasm for the guy is so much

3177
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:28,080
more intense to the point where I'm
like,

3178
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:31,410
that's the hottest thing I've ever seen
is the hottest thing I've ever seen.

3179
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,200
And he likes it.
So you should try it.

3180
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:38,860
Do you have a good orgasm face?
I'm not looking in the mirror.

3181
02:15:38,861 --> 02:15:43,160
Why
do you feel it?

3182
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:44,880
Judge her coffin.
Front of the mirror.

3183
02:15:46,210 --> 02:15:47,180
Angry or sad.

3184
02:15:50,230 --> 02:15:55,230
Oh Wow.
The one we use is,

3185
02:15:55,561 --> 02:15:56,760
is black.
I think.

3186
02:15:56,761 --> 02:15:59,010
I don't see jess getting a white would
cause lead,

3187
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:01,990
pull it out,
but also

3188
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:07,730
checking the oil.
This podcast on this note,

3189
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:16,000
really fun.
Like I said before,

3190
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:19,320
I think you guys,
you proved to me that you don't have to

3191
02:16:19,321 --> 02:16:22,110
be like a famous person to have a very
successful podcast.

3192
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:23,730
And people kept saying that to me.
Like,

3193
02:16:23,731 --> 02:16:26,660
oh,
it's oversaturated bullshit.

3194
02:16:26,661 --> 02:16:28,140
And I would say,
what about guys?

3195
02:16:28,141 --> 02:16:29,890
We fucked those girls came out of
nowhere.

3196
02:16:29,891 --> 02:16:30,040
They're

3197
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,020
always top 10 I go,
they're kicking ass.

3198
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,340
And they're just good.
They just,

3199
02:16:33,341 --> 02:16:34,460
they flow together.
You're,

3200
02:16:34,461 --> 02:16:36,030
you're having fun together.
Thank you.

3201
02:16:36,250 --> 02:16:36,780
It's great.

3202
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,990
Every time you mentioned a span of
spiking,

3203
02:16:39,060 --> 02:16:41,010
it's really,
you are powerful.

3204
02:16:41,011 --> 02:16:42,690
You really got a powerful,
but you got a year,

3205
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:45,690
like you're the,
you're the top podcasts all the time.

3206
02:16:46,050 --> 02:16:48,930
One time we were above you and Canada
and everyone freaked down.

3207
02:16:48,931 --> 02:16:50,790
They emailed us and they were like,
Holy Shit.

3208
02:16:50,791 --> 02:16:53,340
And I just felt like we are not worthy.
Oh my God.

3209
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:56,820
But we appreciate it.
It's nice to earn somebody's respect

3210
02:16:56,821 --> 02:16:58,520
that you respect and it's because you,
you,

3211
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,650
you have something.
That's good.

3212
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:02,420
I appreciate you guys too,
and I appreciate the fact that you guys

3213
02:17:02,421 --> 02:17:04,430
are really good at being yourselves,
you know?

3214
02:17:04,431 --> 02:17:06,930
And I think that I'm a professional.
Yeah.

3215
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:07,813
That's

3216
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:10,980
buckets.
You have a huge point though because

3217
02:17:11,010 --> 02:17:12,510
that's,
I mean that's what half of our book is

3218
02:17:12,511 --> 02:17:16,050
about is about that just being me that
damn,

3219
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:17,010
that's all I'm off.

3220
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:19,470
Right?
Isn't it amazing that that in itself is

3221
02:17:19,471 --> 02:17:20,740
incredibly rare?
It,

3222
02:17:21,030 --> 02:17:22,380
it makes me sad,
but yes,

3223
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:25,380
but shouldn't make you sad because I
think it's going to be less rare

3224
02:17:25,430 --> 02:17:26,670
hemophilia change.
I hope.

3225
02:17:26,671 --> 02:17:28,680
I hope so.
I think human beings,

3226
02:17:28,681 --> 02:17:32,550
and I think our culture is evolving like
we were talking about like the the

3227
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:35,730
social climate of this happening and how
many things are going on right now and

3228
02:17:35,731 --> 02:17:39,120
words that people are not supposed to
use any more and things that people used

3229
02:17:39,121 --> 02:17:42,900
to think of as being commonplace and now
thought of as being problematic.

3230
02:17:42,901 --> 02:17:45,930
This lot going on.
It does feel like there's this,

3231
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:47,400
there's a shift.
I feel it.

3232
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:49,860
It's,
I think in along with things like this

3233
02:17:49,861 --> 02:17:53,760
crispr technology and a bunch of other
probably unforeseen technologies that

3234
02:17:53,761 --> 02:17:56,070
are being worked on right now as we
speak.

3235
02:17:56,220 --> 02:17:58,980
I think some weird shit is going down in
40 years.

3236
02:17:58,981 --> 02:18:01,890
We're all going to be like basketball
players and shifts can be fun.

3237
02:18:01,891 --> 02:18:04,120
We're going to be aliens.
I would do that.

3238
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:08,010
I would choose that Crispr,
which go with the big gray head and the

3239
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:08,970
black eyes and

3240
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:13,480
yeah,
that's a hack alien alien would you

3241
02:18:13,481 --> 02:18:14,770
like?
They got titties.

3242
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:19,360
Octopus.
You can kill people.

3243
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:21,940
Number one,
I would be purple and metallic.

3244
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:25,090
Those are an aesthetically I would
choose me to be like that chess monster

3245
02:18:25,091 --> 02:18:27,850
from things you remember,
the guys on your chest,

3246
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:30,270
you might have more control over your
destiny.

3247
02:18:30,271 --> 02:18:31,930
If you could just wham it down on
things.

3248
02:18:32,330 --> 02:18:34,040
I wish I could just put it just,

3249
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:37,120
and on that note,
thank you ladies.

3250
02:18:37,430 --> 02:18:39,280
Thank.
Thank you so much for having us guys.

3251
02:18:39,281 --> 02:18:41,590
We fucked you can get it on itunes and
elsewhere.

3252
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:42,610
Uh,
twitters,

3253
02:18:43,010 --> 02:18:43,741
uh,
philanthropy.

3254
02:18:43,741 --> 02:18:46,650
Gow Christina Hutch with two ys.

3255
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,860
That's it.
Goodbye everybody.

3256
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:52,500
It was so much fun.
