1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,010
Yeah,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,251
Dude.

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:05,521
Who won?

4
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:05,821
Who won?

5
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:07,110
2018 Olympia.

6
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:07,944
This guy,

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,371
dude.

8
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,710
His abs are Blatt.

9
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,603
It's weird.

10
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,241
How come?

11
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,500
That's okay with black faces,

12
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,320
they are allowed to wear that stuff that
makes your skin look dark so that you

13
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:19,240
can see the muscles better,

14
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,510
but they get to a point
where it's literally,

15
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,280
it's blackface,

16
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,190
it's black body,

17
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,630
and we just accept it.

18
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,140
Well,

19
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,973
not only that,

20
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,360
you have to pretend you're one car.

21
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,501
Yeah.

22
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,720
You do either accept the fact that you're
in chocolate body and chocolate face.

23
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,590
What is that?

24
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,424
That's not real.

25
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,690
I think that might be real.

26
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,480
He totally didn't go chocolate face,

27
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,530
chocolate body like this.

28
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,210
They're deer.

29
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,830
Literally spray tanning is people.

30
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:41,461
Exactly what?

31
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,680
They're deer and turning that guy black.

32
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,441
If they listen,

33
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:44,790
man,

34
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,623
I get it.

35
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,830
Black guys look better.

36
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,110
You're just going to have to
deal with see the muscle fiber.

37
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,540
I agreed to just be white body.

38
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
I'll read the first one is that for
say this lady total chocolate face.

39
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,740
How dare you do that?

40
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,870
The most chocolate face.

41
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,720
She's dark chocolate face.

42
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,070
Damn Dude.

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,510
That's okay.

44
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,450
It's okay bro.

45
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,110
It's a fitness Olympia.

46
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,890
I'm just showing you how rip my face,

47
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,650
my face is shredded as fuck.

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,810
I chew gum all day,

49
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,171
Bro.

50
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,040
When I want to stop,

51
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,060
I don't show my fucking cheeks
or has wrapped faces ripped bro.

52
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,070
Look Bro,

53
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,030
how many people just want to wear black
face cause they're super racist and they

54
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,500
can't so they become bodybuilders.

55
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,740
Does that happen dude?

56
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,910
I'm not saying it happens a lot,

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,480
but has it happened once as
just a fucking bodybuilder,

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,333
bro?

59
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,270
Get over it,

60
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:00,620
ma'am,

61
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:00,870
ma'am,

62
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,271
ma'am,

63
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:02,104
ma'am,

64
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,730
ma'am.

65
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,001
Yeah,

66
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,430
get over it and he starts
like rapping and shit

67
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,240
for all you bodybuilders out there.

68
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,290
We don't really care.

69
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,470
No,

70
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,921
keep doing it.

71
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:20,551
A chocolate bar it.

72
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:20,701
Yeah,

73
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,850
we really don't encourage it because
it's hilarious and it makes you look

74
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,270
better.

75
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,840
You're right.

76
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
It's an advantage.

77
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,700
Chalking it up,

78
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:26,940
bro.

79
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,151
Yeah,

80
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:27,720
you're right.

81
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,810
Who wants to be more chocolate?

82
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:32,010
And the only reason why you should go
chocolate face is because otherwise it's

83
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,240
super distracting.

84
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,970
Cause now you gotta go all now.

85
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,870
I don't think you're Tan.

86
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:37,930
I think you're crazy.

87
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,550
You're crazy.

88
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,440
What's going on?

89
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
Do you have like a suit on?
