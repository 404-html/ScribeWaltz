1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,940
It is interesting how the fat patterns
does shrink up.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,060
There's three major fat distributions,
right?

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,260
You got your depo fat.
That's like the love handles are with

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,120
women.
Sometimes it's the saddlebags and the

6
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,030
side of the thigh.
Sometimes you'll see a women and the

7
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:21,070
upper back or the tricep area with guys.
That's usually it.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,430
But la.
Yeah,

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,960
or the belly or the love handles for
most guys,

10
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,970
you know,
then you have internal fat.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,510
That's the dangerous stuff.
They a intra abdominal fat that got fat.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,070
That's what,
that's what can kill you.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,620
Uh,
then you have subcutaneous fat.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,230
It's like the smooth fat underneath the
skin,

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,120
like a,
like an insulation layer.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,360
And then of course they've identified
that Brown fat also,

17
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,870
it's like a act of fat.
It produces heat in the body.

18
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,090
It's like part of the survival
mechanism.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,590
Back when our ancestors had to tolerate
a lot of extremes in temperatures like

20
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,860
cold,
you have this brown fat,

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,380
it's like an metabolically active fat
and uh,

22
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,880
it's,
it's kids have it,

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,120
but by the time you're like 12,
it almost disappears because you know,

24
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,140
we have this,
uh,

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,660
uh,
regulated temperatures all the time.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,950
People don't expose themselves to cold.
They're always bundling up and the homes

27
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,480
are overheated.
But,

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,820
um,
but a lot of people were saying,

29
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,550
now you can actually get that
metabolically active fat.

30
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:21,690
The brown fat sal's gone,
which helps keep you mean,

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,140
uh,
and helps burn the other yellow fat.

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,920
So cold showers,
cold water treatments,

33
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,810
um,
exposing yourself to cold,

34
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,930
a real good thing for develop that and
uh,

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,170
the brown fat and build your immune
system and you,

36
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,220
you have a much better tolerance to cold
and much less likely to get a innovated

37
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:45,090
in cold weather.
So you don't have a tendency to come

38
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,850
down with colds or flu and stuff like
really brown fat,

39
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,470
Brown fat.
I'd never heard of that before.

40
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,190
What is it created by?
Like what it's in your,

41
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:53,671
uh,
it's,

42
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:57,270
some of it's in the peritoneal cavity.
Some of it's a up in the neck,

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,183
uh,
area.

44
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,300
Uh,
and it's,

45
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:04,590
it's just something that nature provided
to help temperature regulation,

46
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,120
helping tolerate cold.

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,210
So is that like more common with inuits
and folks who live in?

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,260
Oh yeah,
for sure.

49
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,210
They have well developed brown fat.
But you and I could do it too if we just

50
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,830
expose yourself a little bit more to the
cold.

51
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,590
He's a narcissism thing.
Just the idea that I should be in charge

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
is all presidents are probably crazy.
I don't think anybody should be

53
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,990
president.
I really don't think that it should be

54
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:26,400
an option.
I think the computer,

55
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,860
yeah.
I mean when we,

56
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,900
we'll probably get there in the next 20
years.

57
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,300
We have a computer we program in all of
our laws,

58
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,650
you know,
and we were like,

59
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:35,670
okay,
now,

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,170
you know,
make the right choice.

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,020
Yeah.
But it's programmed by people and people

62
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,990
can influence the programming.
I mean that was one of the big deals

63
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,940
with electronic voting machines,
right?

64
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,370
No,
we have that computer be built by a

65
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,460
computer.
Oh,

66
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,940
well then we're fucked because he
computer's just going to take over.

67
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,970
Then it's like what Elon Musk is worried
about George P.

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,803
Bush.
She look at that.

69
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,420
That's going to be the next,
he's going to be of a lazy eye.

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,230
The left eye.
The Kennedy,

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,920
somebody punched him.
Can you tell it?

72
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,870
He had a lazy eye.
Yeah.

73
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,280
I dated a girl,
had a lazy eye.

74
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,290
NFM Lazy.
Lazyeyes sexy for a short period of

75
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,320
time.
She was kind of a freak.

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,720
She was a frequent lazy eye.
I developed a lazy eye fetish for at

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,553
least a year.
Did you?

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,460
Yeah.
So the very small youporn search.

79
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,950
Well,
why are glasses hot girls with glasses

80
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,730
or hot,
you know,

81
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,990
girls would,
crutches aren't hot.

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,310
Like why is some disabilities hot?
You know the girl with glasses is

83
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:36,220
something sexy about like,
how is this like a library?

84
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,340
It's like a older authority,
fake glasses or authority.

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Who is that what it is?
Someone is reading so much.

86
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,790
Their eyes go bad.
Yeah.

87
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,890
Look at that hot pitch you came even
see,

88
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,200
plus you could take your glasses off,
your ugly.

89
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,350
She didn't even know
she could feel you though.

90
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,220
If you're fat and ugly,
she'd be like,

91
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,120
Damn Shit,
you feel me?

92
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,970
She can't go the glasses and no hands.
There you go.

93
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,400
Feel your weight on top for it up.
Yeah.

94
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,530
She wraps her legs around you like what
does all this fucking fat slob?

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,470
What are you talking about?
You don't have handguns were being picky

96
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,304
for it,

97
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,840
but that was my mother's fucking main
thing was numbers,

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,530
numbers in Harlem,
so I got to walk around there as a

99
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,390
child.
Then as I got older,

100
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,750
my first arrest wasn't home.
I got caught smoking weed on 160 first

101
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:28,300
street in 1983 the first day after the
superbowl,

102
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,370
I want $800 on the triple.
What's the Miami?

103
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,551
These,
the,

104
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,720
the sleeping,
the bees,

105
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:39,080
whatever the fuck they were when they
beat the redskins and I wanted to a

106
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,540
health food store.
In those days we'd stores were health

107
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,080
food stores in Harlem.
So what does the health food store can

108
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,100
complain of you who's no protein drinks.
In those days it was crude protein

109
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,000
powder,
you know,

110
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,420
vitamins.
And then if you knew the right people,

111
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,790
you want to know you're not in the
glasses wall bulletproof.

112
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,890
Wow.
And you went in and they,

113
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,880
you'd say,
what do you have?

114
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,040
Let me get to raise,
and they,

115
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,510
excuse me,
they put the weed in the glass.

116
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:08,390
You'd take and give him the $30 and
you'd ask permission,

117
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,600
can I roll it in the corner?
And your role,

118
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,361
the joint,
the corner,

119
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,710
and then you could go outside and smoke
it.

120
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,530
I rolled it in the corner and when I lit
it in the corner,

121
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,040
because it was windy,
it was January when I went to put the

122
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,830
light into the joint,
a fucking mailman put a gun to my head

123
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:22,880
and he goes,
get on the floor.

124
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,280
He goes,
if you got more than 20 singles on you,

125
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:28,520
I'm going to beat the fuck outta here.
I got on the floor,

126
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:33,110
I had 800 I had one 800 probably at
seven 40 and he goes,

127
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:36,230
what'd you get this money from me?
And also in cops started pulling up and

128
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,170
they were looking for people who was
selling loose joints.

129
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,230
The kids two blocks away.
So when they realized I lived in Jersey

130
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,020
and I had no idea in those days,
I didn't walk with an ID dog.

131
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,080
My word was my shit.
No idea.

132
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,870
In those days I throw away the ID,
fucking no idea.

133
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:51,770
You want to,
you're a cop,

134
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,890
figure it out the fuck you're fucking
Kadri figure it out.

135
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,810
And the cop told me,
tell me the truth,

136
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,520
your name.
I told him the truth and they put my

137
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,340
finger on one of those things.
That was the early technology,

138
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,430
New York hat,
Lake three vans that have that shit on

139
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,480
it.
Fingerprint thing,

140
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,890
scanner.
And it came back,

141
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,800
Jose Diaz and blast,
they let me go.

142
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,480
In fact,
the cop took wheat out of my bag,

143
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,240
put it on the floor and said,
now it's nine grams.

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,940
I you could keep it and I'll give you a
ticket.

145
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,560
And that was my first legitimate arrest.
I got arrested for that and Manhattan.

146
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,440
I did six months,
the first sentence and I moved to

147
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:30,710
Colorado and I had to write the guy a
letter on the first and call them on the

148
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,540
fifth and they let me go.

149
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,150
All right.
Have you seen that white kid with

150
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,190
tattoos on his face?
He calls himself stitches.

151
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,630
No.
Oh,

152
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,640
I'm going to find you your new favorite
song.

153
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,170
Okay,
that sounds good,

154
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,340
Jay.
This is breaking your face brick.

155
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,010
It's got 5 million hits.
America is in trouble.

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,820
Now what you're going to do with it,
that's what you get.

157
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,750
I'm saying it's going to be all day.
It's going to be in your head now.

158
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,550
What's going to do with it now?
What?

159
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,700
You're going to give me my new tagline
after I submit people?

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,830
Yeah.
Now what you're going to do with it.

161
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,350
That's rude.
Carrie,

162
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:07,750
Tony and Terry.
You first you win and then just stick it

163
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,030
into the white guy was a hell raiser
guy.

164
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,770
You know what I mean?
I think that was him.

165
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,930
I think that was him with a mascot that
was supposed to be him saying,

166
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,190
I've just,
my interpretation of the aura,

167
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,570
I think he should have,
he should have stayed a hundred percent

168
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,300
black shit.
Hell raiser kind of brought it back to

169
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,940
white people because black people don't
like hell raiser and we should've been

170
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:26,190
spawn or starting.
You know?

171
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,190
That's a very good point because hell
raiser was a white guy in the movie,

172
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,020
and black people hate scary movies.

173
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,160
Generally speaking.
I'm sure love scary movies generally.

174
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,250
Yeah.
As all stereotypical,

175
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,030
stereotypical generalizations of how to
raise a people,

176
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,700
you gotta be able to generalize because
if you can't generalize and you can't

177
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:58,060
make any fucking points,
that's so true.

178
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,620
You know what I mean?
You can't make any punch.

179
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:01,440
I know.
I know one guy that doesn't do that.

180
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,500
Like,
yes,

181
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,210
I know a guy too,
but generally,

182
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,890
Jesus Christ.
That's one of the things before you say

183
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:09,820
what you just said,
you go,

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
yeah,
I know this might sound a little bit

185
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,590
racist,
but.
