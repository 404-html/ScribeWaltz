1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,120
The weirdest thing though is that in the
audience I have is so bizarre because

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:07,140
that guy will be there.

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:07,930
There will be a guy there,

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,731
a Panthera guy,

6
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,564
there'll be a guy there,

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,360
was there last summer I did,

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,420
you know an acoustic run of,

9
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:16,310
oh and I did one.

10
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm doing a few festivals.

11
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,610
I show up at one and I
shit you not Joe Rogan,

12
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,060
it's called devil slide or or devil side,

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,380
devil side festival.

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,930
It is nothing but the hardest.

15
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:28,510
Like,

16
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,040
Oh,

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,380
I'm sitting backstage with me and Brian,

18
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,830
the guy who came with me last time
keyboard player and we're like,

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,940
what the fuck man,

20
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,760
this just,

21
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,521
why am I here?

22
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,440
I don't even fucking get him
and were like freaking out.

23
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:43,720
We're like,

24
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:43,830
oh,

25
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,390
they're going to fucking kill us man.

26
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,230
They're going to kill us.

27
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,550
I called my manager,

28
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,440
I'm cursing him to high fucking heaven,

29
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:49,670
Dude.

30
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,740
Like you motherfucker.

31
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,050
You don't even look
where you're booking me,

32
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,650
do you?

33
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,980
You just see a check number and you
take it and you don't even ask where you

34
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:56,341
just say,

35
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:56,581
yeah,

36
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:57,091
we'll do it.

37
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:57,540
Huh?

38
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:57,841
I was like,

39
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,230
I listen to where I am and I'm putting the

40
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,800
band after band of it,

41
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:04,951
man,

42
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm,

43
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,220
I'm actually to get to the point where
it's like I just started embracing that

44
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,600
funniness of it not to live promoters.

45
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:09,901
All right.

46
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,280
There's some things missing from my rider.

47
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:11,641
And they're like,

48
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:11,881
what?

49
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm like,

50
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,840
I need to say Tannic Bible in a
bucket of goat's blood right now.

51
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,561
I was like,

52
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,890
we need to make a sacrifice for we go
out there cause we about to get killed.

53
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,083
And it was,

54
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,820
it was the craziest shit it up.

55
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,403
So,

56
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,333
uh,

57
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,320
I fucking with me,

58
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,163
I tell my boy,

59
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,200
and it wasn't Brian Actually,

60
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:29,010
it was my boy Derek.

61
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,210
We were both playing two guitars.

62
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,691
So,

63
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,120
uh,

64
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,410
we go,

65
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,700
I go and I just tell
him when we got there,

66
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:32,941
I was like,

67
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,440
first thing to get thrown first,

68
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:34,801
anything.

69
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,431
We're fucking up,

70
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:35,891
I'm out of there.

71
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,320
And they fucking,

72
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,190
someone jumps on stage and
just hit him with the guitar,

73
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:38,900
man.

74
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,661
It's like dead ass.

75
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,250
I'm saying this dead seriously.

76
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,140
Like we're about to get killed,

77
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,233
right.

78
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,380
So this band that went on before us,

79
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:49,050
it was like the bread that gets
buttered with bread or something.

80
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:49,550
It was,

81
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,221
that's literally,

82
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:54,120
it was some crazy name like that on the
bread gets buttered or the butter on the

83
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:55,170
bread or something like that.

84
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,990
And it was the most artists like craziest,

85
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,573
craziest,

86
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,880
it ends and the lights and,

87
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,780
and this is the middle of
the day by the way too.

88
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:10,170
This is like four o'clock maybe
five o'clock and we're like,

89
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,921
ah man,

90
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:11,800
Jesus done come.

91
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,020
The whole house clears.

92
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,450
So like all of a sudden I'm
having a little bit of hope,

93
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:15,901
like okay,

94
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:19,110
maybe nobody will just be in here for
our said maybe they all just were like

95
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:19,441
that.

96
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:19,710
No,

97
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,910
we're going to go get a beer.

98
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,090
So they are changing over
the set and come to our turn.

99
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:24,840
And I'm like,

100
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,730
the crowd starts coming
back in and I'm like,

101
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,301
man,

102
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,380
this ugly.

103
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,740
Go out there and we start playing
our guitars and next thing I know,

104
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,900
I see all of these pants,

105
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,130
Tara and crazy metal dudes
and they got chicks with them.

106
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:35,400
Now.

107
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,233
There's not,

108
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,070
there's not a pit.

109
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,881
There's not a pit,

110
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:39,331
there's not pit.

111
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,880
There's all these dudes with their
broad and they're holding their bras and

112
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,900
they're listening and they're,

113
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
and it goes over like fucking gangbusters.

114
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,431
I was like,

115
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,000
we and we,

116
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,770
we literally got offstage dump.

117
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,060
We didn't say words to each other.

118
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,170
We got in our van,

119
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,540
we didn't even set up merchant
this place because we were like,

120
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,541
nobody cares where here we sold like
probably I a box of merchant out the back

121
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,420
of the van when people
catching us cause we were just,

122
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,340
I mean me and Derek was sitting in
the back of the van just like the,

123
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:05,171
that just happened.

124
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:05,381
Man,

125
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,214
that was,

126
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,250
that was one of the craziest
gigs I've ever done in my life.

127
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,000
That's fascinating that they just changed
gears like that and it was no other

128
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,020
thing like that.

129
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,150
It was,

130
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,580
it was,

131
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,000
it was.

132
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,451
I never,

133
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,240
I was just blown away about how it went
and in the way it went over I was like,

134
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,020
wow dude,

135
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,770
that was crazy.

136
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,970
They really dug it.

137
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,870
That's a cool story.

138
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,130
That must have been a cool experience.

139
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,510
So my audience is crazy.

140
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,350
It'll be an old lady.

141
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,490
There'll be like kids,

142
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,000
there'll be,

143
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,420
you know,

144
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,530
the house of pain.

145
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,393
You know,

146
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,510
a rough neck hooligan.

147
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,920
Guy's still hanging on
for that to come back.

148
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,510
Okay.
