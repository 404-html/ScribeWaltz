1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,910
freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,561
Can You keep it real?

4
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:04,950
Can You keep it?

5
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,380
100.

6
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,213
Look at that lady.

7
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,050
What is she doing?

8
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,040
Is She doing the Dab?

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,180
Dab It on him.

10
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,661
Are you sure?

11
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,280
She's dabbled.

12
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,730
She just doing Tai Chi in the park.

13
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,690
Deafness says it on her shirt on a shirt
that she doesn't know she's wearing.

14
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,680
She didn't realize that
she can't read the blind.

15
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,650
No one,

16
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,170
hundred and 50,000 years
old lawyers keep pounding.

17
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,290
Have we think it's so funny when old
people talk as if they were ever young and

18
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,370
fucking like as if they've never had sex.

19
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,000
Like that lady probably at one point
in time was a Dick connoisseur.

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
He's out there in the park not
knowing what the fuck she's wearing.

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,770
The addict connoisseur in the park.

22
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,440
That's probably the best place
probably to be sampling Dick.

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,420
Probably hard to get a good one though
when you're at that age is probably real

24
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,490
tough because it's all about enthusiasm.

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,360
Like dudes are pretty
down with old ladies.

26
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,350
Like old dudes.

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:52,951
You.

28
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,431
Oh yeah.

29
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,540
Well that's an issue.

30
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,950
I'm a friend of mine.

31
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,371
Go on.

32
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:01,371
One of his buddies worked at a old
folks home and said that one of the big

33
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:07,080
issues was these old guys would
get Viagra and these old ladies,

34
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,380
they didn't give a fuck and a lot
of them are on antidepressants,

35
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,120
so they're like la La la who gives a shit
like they're on Xanax and getting stds

36
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,170
will.

37
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,100
I don't know if it was that.

38
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,690
That's something that I heard about,

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,910
like it's rampant
because that's happening.

40
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,290
Well,

41
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,890
that's probably really
bad when you're old,

42
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:23,724
right?

43
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,950
Like your body doesn't heal so good.

44
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,010
No list when you're fucking 98.

45
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,760
Well,

46
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,670
herpes is like an attack
on your immune system.

47
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,300
There it goes.

48
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,920
The new erotic frontier,

49
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,540
sex in nursing homes.

50
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,530
Until recently,

51
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,570
nursing homes frowned on sex.

52
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,760
Now increasingly they smile.

53
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,570
Oh,

54
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,470
it didn't make sense.

55
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,860
Why?

56
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,090
Why shouldn't we have fun?

57
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,720
Look at this.

58
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,730
When Aubrey Davidson age 85 minutes,

59
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,050
special guy at the Hebrew home
in Riverdale in the Bronx,

60
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:52,501
New York,

61
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,560
they did more than sit next to
each other in the dining room.

62
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,930
Then he invited her to his room.

63
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,460
They hung a do not disturb sign on the
door and at breakfast the next morning,

64
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,530
they both sported broad smiles,

65
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,650
terrible writing like a fourth grade,

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,910
but also calling it.

67
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,370
What are the top say that you
see the new erotic frontier.

68
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:12,600
You're like,

69
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:12,751
Ooh,

70
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,280
and it's like sex and nursing homes.

71
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:14,520
You're like,

72
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,790
oh,

73
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,660
there goes the boner.

74
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,960
Well,

75
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,060
it sounded so hot.

76
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,870
Yeah,

77
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,650
that's not.

78
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,080
It's not exciting for me,

79
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,650
but there's a whole category on
youporn that so old people do.

80
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,110
Some people do like watching old people.

81
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:28,944
Fuck,

82
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,121
you know,

83
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:29,941
when I watched the other day,

84
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,661
I'm not proud of it,

85
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,530
but I will admit it to you.

86
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,450
I watched an old thing,

87
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,284
my special.

88
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,530
I watched an old porn stars still at it.

89
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,840
I don't care what he provides.

90
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,990
Exercise or this topic,

91
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,750
and at the time of life,

92
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,380
when many elderly feel cold
sleeping as a payer provides warmth.

93
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:49,950
Oh,

94
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,670
that's cute.

95
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,510
Look at this though.

96
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,100
Killed back to that.

97
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,210
Relationships make people happier
and that happiness reduces stress and

98
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,890
irritability and improves mood,

99
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,650
appetite,

100
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,370
sleep,

101
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,990
sociability and immune function.

102
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,860
Plants.

103
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,630
Read that first.

104
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:03,850
Oh,

105
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,310
how dare you read the first
sentence says the Hebrew home,

106
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,530
that first one at the bottom of the Hebrew
home does more than tolerate resident

107
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,364
nookie.

108
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,880
The faculty hope probably someone who
works at the Hebrew home propaganda that

109
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,350
faculty holds regular happy hours,

110
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,011
dances,

111
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,220
and even organized a dating
service for residents.

112
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,563
Gy Date,

113
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,220
g four grandparents.

114
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,393
I like it.

115
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,090
I didn't mean to force you
into bringing up that subject.

116
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,361
Well,

117
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,760
the other problem with the
second season of fear factor,

118
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,200
and I can say this now because it didn't
happen as I was worried we were going

119
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,034
to kill somebody.

120
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,930
I was really worried.

121
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,180
It seemed too dangerous.

122
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,290
They were ramping up the stents and
they were making things like way more

123
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,660
spectacular and you're,

124
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,320
you're just taking bigger chances and
there was a lot of downtime in between.

125
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,030
There was a lot of preparation.

126
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,630
There was a lot of like
checks and balances and they
really wanted to make sure

127
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,950
that everything was tested and tested
and they really mapped it out well,

128
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,270
but it was still.

129
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,300
There were some hair raising things
he's fucking people had to do.

130
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,840
Maybe fear was too far,

131
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:12,820
maybe it should've been like mildly
uncomfortable factor where you put people

132
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,070
like an mildly uncomfortable situations.

133
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,000
Like,

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,481
Hey,

135
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,240
I want you to go over
and talk to that woman.

136
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,530
She seems kind of attractive.

137
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,820
What I mean.

138
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,990
So it's kind of a mildly
uncomfortable and you.

139
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,240
No one's going to die.

140
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,170
No one's going to mind
if she kills you there.

141
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,990
Um,

142
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,640
they're doing a new one with ludicrous.

143
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,630
It's Kinda that way.

144
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,000
There's a new fear factor and ludicrous.

145
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,840
The rapper is the host and like some
of the fears like forgetting your cell

146
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,150
phone somewhere like for like,

147
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,510
right,

148
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,841
isn't it?

149
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,710
Something stupid like that.

150
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,510
And they don't have to eat anything gross.

151
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,393
Which was,

152
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,090
it was really dumped and keep that out
because that was one of the most popular

153
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,810
parts of the original
series that was gigantic.

154
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,540
Like the eating gross shit part as huge.

155
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,190
I have to be honest with you.

156
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,930
That was,

157
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,200
I couldn't watch that.

158
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,700
That was the hard part for me.

159
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,573
I don't,

160
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,483
I hear you,

161
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,543
you know,

162
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,580
it was hard for me to watch somebody do
something because I wouldn't eat it or

163
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:12,431
drink it.

164
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,020
Then I don't want to watch
somebody else do that,

165
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,130
but that's.

166
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,963
I'm with you.

167
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,541
I mean,

168
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,320
I wouldn't have won.

169
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,770
Well,

170
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,603
that's not true.

171
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,910
I watched somebody sent me a clip of
Steve Hoe with a gas mask on and I tweeted

172
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,364
it,

173
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,860
some guy farting into a tube and it goes
right into Steve [inaudible] face and

174
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:37,120
he threw up into the mask and I
laughed so hard that I retweeted it

175
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,260
and send it to me.

176
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,090
It was actually quite rude of him,

177
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,470
but it was in response to allies of
slessinger his appearance yesterday,

178
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,560
the podcast.

179
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,761
Look at this.

180
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,330
Look,

181
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,310
this guy's got a fart into this tube
and the tube goes right into Steve

182
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,370
[inaudible] face like this.

183
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,420
He farts and Steve,

184
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,560
I liked it.

185
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,370
I almost threw up right there.

186
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,204
I almost threw up.

187
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,030
I'd like to bring like a

188
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,970
revived from the dead,

189
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,470
like Edgar Allen Poe or Mark Twain and
put them in a time machine and bring them

190
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,790
to now and go,

191
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,340
all the stuff you did
was like really cool.

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,091
Check out.

193
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,150
What we're doing now is
show them that video.

194
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
Well video back then if I had a cell
phone camera that he might've given up on

195
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:37,814
poetry,

196
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,780
like fuck all this rave and stuff.

197
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,760
Nobody's buying these
deep black bird poems.

198
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,640
Does anybody have like a gas mask?

199
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,780
He had a fat guy to part two.

200
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,080
Let's make some real entertainment.

201
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,770
And the radio program director came
into my town knew and you know if you've

202
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,491
ever been in radio,

203
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,330
when they come into town,

204
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,320
knew the first thing they're going to
do is change everything because they got

205
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:00,140
to put their own stamp on
it or why are they there?

206
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,640
So this guy comes in and he goes,

207
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
we're gonna rebrand you.

208
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,741
He goes,

209
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:07,220
I want everyone to think of your name
and instantly think of the brand and I'm

210
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:07,551
already,

211
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:07,910
you know,

212
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,430
brand.

213
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,631
Yeah.

214
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:08,841
Okay.

215
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:09,680
So here's what he said.

216
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,920
So I hate to say this because this will
become a meme online that I will have to

217
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:13,754
live with the rest of it,

218
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,170
but it's an absolutely true story.

219
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,250
So the guy says to me,

220
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:16,491
he goes,

221
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:19,850
listen to imagine a billboard
that says Dan Carlin,

222
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
he fucks chickens.

223
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,951
And I said,

224
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:22,491
excuse me?

225
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:22,761
He goes,

226
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:22,941
yeah,

227
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:23,240
I mean,

228
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,070
so that anytime anybody
thought they would think,

229
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:25,311
okay,

230
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,840
he's the chicken fucker and I'm going,

231
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,520
wait a minute.

232
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,920
Really?

233
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,800
He really said that.

234
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,900
And I said to him,

235
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:30,290
I said,

236
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,550
I said two things dude.

237
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,091
I said,

238
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:34,220
the first thing is I got
to live in this town,

239
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:34,820
right?

240
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,920
So really you want that to be
the first thing people think.

241
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:37,280
Okay.

242
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,090
The second thing is I got to have a
career after this stupid idea of yours

243
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:41,924
fails,

244
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,860
right?

245
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,040
Like,

246
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,191
no,

247
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:45,530
you don't understand where we're
building up a mental image,

248
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,640
you will be a household name.

249
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:46,911
I said,

250
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:47,121
yes,

251
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:48,080
I'll be the household name.

252
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,180
The guy who fucks chickens

253
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,740
and finding no,

254
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:51,981
he was.

255
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:52,910
After that I finally.

256
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,601
I said,

257
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,050
dude,

258
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,210
do you want to step outside right now?

259
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,540
My wife laughed at me because I'm already
an old man when I'm saying she goes,

260
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,321
that would have been great.

261
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:00,531
I said,

262
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:00,651
no,

263
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:00,920
this,

264
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,150
this guy was as old as I was,

265
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:07,151
but I was so incensed and so angry that
this guy would be so cavalier with your

266
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,960
future and as a human
being in every family.

267
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,550
I mean,

268
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,383
my kids,

269
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,240
how are they going to
spell fucker on billboards?

270
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:15,651
You know what?

271
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:17,740
Pets have really good credit they
might have had as a euphemism,

272
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:18,801
but I mean,

273
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:19,461
you think about that.

274
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:19,701
You think,

275
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:20,300
okay,

276
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,901
as you said,

277
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,660
this guy's career depends
on him making a difference.

278
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,030
I'm just a tool in his career.

279
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,870
Right?

280
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,710
So you start to realize that when you
did the podcast and it's your podcast,

281
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,880
the person that you're worried
about here is you and not just that,

282
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,250
the ideas that are coming from your.

283
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,490
Not just yours alone,

284
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,324
but you own them.

285
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,781
Right?

286
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:39,100
So,

287
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,030
so when I say something that's stupid,

288
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,811
I own that.

289
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:43,130
It's not like some stations said,

290
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,820
oh listen,

291
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,180
push.

292
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,421
You know,

293
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,720
I got into a fight over the Oj Simpson
thing when the Oj Simpson trial is going

294
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,441
on and everybody,

295
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,490
it's all you hear anywhere,

296
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,260
so I didn't talk about it and so they
got on me about not talking about it.

297
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,490
I had a big fight and I walked
into the studio and I said,

298
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,821
fine,

299
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,391
I'll talk about it.

300
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,050
I said,

301
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,290
you know,

302
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,130
the whole topic was,

303
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,090
isn't there just too much?

304
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,160
Damn Oj Simpson everywhere you go.

305
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,671
Oh,

306
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:02,970
they were,

307
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,420
they were,

308
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,110
they were at the,

309
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,261
you know,

310
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,370
there was a window.

311
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,110
We were like zoo creatures
and I had this window,

312
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,500
they could bring all the sales clients
to watch us perform and I'm doing there

313
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,530
and there's like five executives in
the window just waiting till the next

314
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,850
commercial break because
we're going to be what I mean,

315
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,540
that's why radio is so awful
for me and I didn't get fired.

316
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,000
I must've done a good
enough job to stay employed,

317
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,530
but it was go home and pull your hair out.
