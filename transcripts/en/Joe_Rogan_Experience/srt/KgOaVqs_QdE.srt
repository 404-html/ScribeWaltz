1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Fuckers.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,270
Wait,

3
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,190
we sound the audio?

4
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:02,410
No,

5
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,243
just split it.

6
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,403
Split the audio.

7
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,371
This is over time,

8
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:05,671
folks.

9
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:06,361
This is part two.

10
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,810
We're talking about the differences.

11
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,480
Why is it okay?

12
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:10,314
You got to make it sure

13
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,233
I have a beer.

14
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,601
Yeah,

15
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:15,841
sure.

16
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,410
Man.

17
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:16,801
Go in there.

18
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,790
There's all kinds of shit in there.

19
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,840
There's all kinds of booze.

20
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,640
Oh yeah.

21
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,060
Always tell you to the right.

22
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:23,350
You know what?

23
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,450
If you see a brother and hulk,

24
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,410
coconut water,

25
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,243
coconut water,

26
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,653
coconut water,

27
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,410
he's fucking with them.

28
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,190
Don't let them do it.

29
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,023
And sometimes

30
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
he'll hang onto that for five minutes to,

31
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,413
you'll tap

32
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,371
any problems.

33
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,480
Get the weirdest sense of humor.

34
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,201
It's funny as hell.

35
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,150
He throws people off track.

36
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,060
You don't know him?

37
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,720
No.

38
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:46,920
No.

39
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
Throw me off track.

40
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,990
The other day was fucking Joey Diaz.

41
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,581
Taxi scared me.

42
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:52,891
Hold on.

43
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:53,191
Hold on.

44
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:53,461
Hold on.

45
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:53,740
I want to,

46
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,230
don't say this until we go back on.

47
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,891
Jamie,

48
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:56,461
we're not recording,

49
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,294
are we?

50
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,860
Are we recording?

51
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,250
Yes,

52
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,060
we are right now.

53
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,421
Okay,

54
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:00,870
go ahead.

55
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,290
Sorry.

56
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,070
Coconut water.

57
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,400
Oh,

58
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,911
give me one of them.

59
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,630
Jammies too.

60
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:03,871
Thank you,

61
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,050
sir.

62
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,661
You know they're better.

63
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,650
And the boxes,

64
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,810
not the cans.

65
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,081
No,

66
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,291
no,

67
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:07,550
no.

68
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,640
C Two o is the best.

69
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,211
100%.

70
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,010
You know why this is Thai coconuts?

71
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:11,970
It's a different taste.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,481
I get it,

73
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,500
but when he goes into the cans,

74
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,940
I heard it kills the nutrition.

75
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,441
Oh,

76
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:16,220
a thousand.

77
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,540
This is all the [inaudible] most
of that's been killed anyway,

78
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,020
Bro.

79
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,853
Science,

80
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,173
where'd you get this?

81
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,013
Science is this,

82
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,913
this is

83
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,560
fucking Vegas is crumbling.

84
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,470
$400 million dividend for the city center.

85
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,370
So it's making a lot of money.

86
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,170
Doesn't mean it's not getting torn down.

87
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,840
It's getting torn down.

88
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,710
Nothing.

89
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,330
I read Yahoo News every morning,

90
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:39,481
man.

91
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:40,920
Like a fucking shark.

92
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,970
Like it's my job.

93
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,161
Oh,

94
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:44,970
you questioning young Jamie's
googling skills a little bit.

95
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,810
Whoa.

96
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,800
He's taking his shirt off.

97
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,090
I was trying to scare you.

98
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,920
Look at you getting angry.

99
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,783
He got angry.

100
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,510
He hooked out.

101
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,343
He's upset.

102
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,870
You were taking the fresh,

103
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,411
it's delicious.

104
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:55,770
Right?

105
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,020
C Two O it's so much better
than any other coconut water.

106
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,670
Uh,

107
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:58,861
we,

108
00:01:58,861 --> 00:01:59,281
you know who,

109
00:01:59,281 --> 00:01:59,401
uh,

110
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:02,100
I think it was Earl Warren had these,

111
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,001
it was,

112
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,810
he brought a man.

113
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,950
Why don't you guys brought these in?

114
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,281
I just,

115
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,540
how I found out about [inaudible] oh,

116
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,580
we were training and um,

117
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,690
they had g day,

118
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,120
you know how you used to do gay day.

119
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,850
Do you guys still do that?

120
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,211
Sometimes.

121
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:12,840
Once a year.

122
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,860
The old legends we
stopped and this is like,

123
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:17,161
you know,

124
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,000
coconut waters,

125
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,511
like what?

126
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,250
The Brazilians have been known to drink.

127
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,840
So one of the dudes,

128
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,560
um,

129
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,320
that was training brought in a
massive coconut water just for fun.

130
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,771
Like,

131
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,690
because like it's ski day and my friend,

132
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,770
we want to train like Buddhists.

133
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,310
Elian.

134
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,880
That's cool.

135
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,350
What you found it?

136
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,184
What is it?

137
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,880
Hotel?

138
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,540
What does it say?

139
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,560
The Harmon hotel,

140
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,360
which I was part of the city of center,

141
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,220
it never opened it.

142
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,610
It's going to be torn down in two weeks.

143
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,500
Demolition never opened Harmon
hotel to begin in two weeks.

144
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:43,741
Oh,

145
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:44,041
mark.

146
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,810
Good instructors all fucked up,

147
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,703
right?

148
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:47,980
Oh boy.

149
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,200
That's not the whole city center.

150
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,034
It's just one.

151
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,360
It's like a comp call.

152
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,020
The whole thing real quick.

153
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,261
Eddie,

154
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,840
I exaggerate everything right?

155
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,890
But let's see a picture of it.

156
00:02:58,891 --> 00:02:59,540
Which one is it?

157
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,360
You're the to the left of the Aria side.

158
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:01,871
Oh my God.

159
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,860
Look at this size of it,

160
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,611
dude.

161
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,200
Fuck dog.

162
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,871
The size of it.

163
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,291
They get a tear.

164
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,220
That whole thing down.

165
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,150
Yeah,

166
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,920
like not safe for people.

167
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,420
Oh my God.

168
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,640
Wrapped in black netting prior.

169
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,140
What does that say prior to demolition.

170
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,531
Oh my God.

171
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,000
That's why it's wrapped in black netting.

172
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,680
Whew.

173
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,513
Ooh.

174
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,650
Imagine if you have the
hotel next to it and like,

175
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,484
don't worry dude.

176
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,870
We're not even scratch your shit.

177
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,610
Just like guide all right
next to your Porsche and say,

178
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,121
hey bro,

179
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm going to blow up my car,

180
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,170
but I'm going to put a net over yours.

181
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,183
Just be cool.

182
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,040
Don't sweat it.

183
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,970
Don't sweat it.

184
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:34,541
Don't sweat it.

185
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm just going to blow
it up right next to you.

186
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:36,850
Shit.

187
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
They should have.

188
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,070
They should build up a
solid steel enclosure.

189
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,150
Blow it up and then dispose of rock.

190
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,970
Can you imagine for the
engineer looking at this,

191
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,183
it says here,

192
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,890
he said it was originally to have arisen
49 floors as a show piece of the city

193
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,460
center,

194
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,420
which opened just as Nevada was
entering the depths of the recession,

195
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,500
the 4,000 room,

196
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,310
Aria resort and casino along
with the Mandarin Hotel.

197
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Fewer than 400 rooms and the all suite
57 story Vadera open within a month of

198
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:08,201
each other.

199
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,090
But the Harmon stage shuttered.

200
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,350
It wasn't a recession,

201
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,510
but construction issues that
kept the harm and clothes.

202
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,140
It's construction plan was eventually
scaled down by almost half,

203
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:21,040
but then concerns remained that
it would topple in an earthquake.

204
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,420
Oh Wow.

205
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,770
I knew it while I'm Macau hotel supposed
to open there soon in a big area that's

206
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,250
been under development for
over like 10 years in Vegas.

207
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,480
I watched a documentary about,

208
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,550
it's probably talking about some of this.

209
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,443
Um,

210
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,340
uh,

211
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,390
I think it's like the
MGM crew or one of them.

212
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,820
I don't want to say who
because I don't know exactly,

213
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:44,750
but uh,

214
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,690
they were developing a huge thing
and it fell apart basically.

215
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:50,720
And she had been sitting empty for 10
years and this Macau company is moving in

216
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,700
and it's supposed to open
up and about a year or so,

217
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,500
if it's not opening sooner than that,

218
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
a big multibillion dollar Asian hotel
that all these McCowen Chinese people were

219
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,370
supposed to come in and Save Vegas.

220
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:02,900
Well,

221
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,231
crazy.

222
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:06,170
Would it be if Vegas got
taken over by Chinese,

223
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:12,010
they came in guns blazing and just
built some unbelievable hotels because

224
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,670
they're written money over there.

225
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,000
Just true written money.

226
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,080
So it was my man Donald Trump though.

227
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Yet before bullies get the fuck
outta here with all that nonsense.

228
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,670
Donald Trump can hang with the triads.

229
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,240
They're going to come over here with a
giant space ships zeppelins filled with

230
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,074
diamonds,

231
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,360
just rained them down on Las Vegas.

232
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,300
We're going to build a building
made of entirely of diamonds,

233
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,590
all filled with hookers,

234
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,390
all filled with 10 side meet the Alpha,

235
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,420
drive everybody around it or Rolls Royce.

236
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,820
No one's going to go to any other casino.

237
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,890
You're going to take it to
the most ultimate level ever.

238
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,140
I'm not mad at that if cause it.

239
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:52,790
Macau really is what they say it is.

240
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,500
If it really is 10 times Vegas,

241
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,180
that means they're making 10
times as much money as vague.

242
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,710
Remember that joke says,

243
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,060
Sam

244
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,420
per bleed said that.

245
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,690
Uh,

246
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,690
it was something about how girls will
always be with the guys with money.

247
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,361
No matter what.

248
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,300
Girl doesn't have a recession
for hot Darth Vader.

249
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,400
Darth Vader can come down takeover and,

250
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,120
and I'm,

251
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,330
I'm killing the joke,

252
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,490
but it was one of the Best Sam Tripoli,

253
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,740
Tripoli dead on.

254
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:19,220
Yeah,

255
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,701
I remember.

256
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,360
I can't do it today.

257
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,360
You see some ugly as
dudes with harness chicks.

258
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,860
That's true.

259
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,290
The only reason you guys got mad paper.

260
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,250
Mad Paper makes up for a lot of things.

261
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,720
There's hope for every man out there.

262
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,190
If you're an unattractive woman,

263
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,950
mad paper gets you a gay guy
pretending to be straight.

264
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,660
I ain't that a bitch.

265
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,471
That's what you get.

266
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,960
If you look like a warlock as a
girl and you're a millionaire,

267
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,590
you think Bruce Jenner
was kind of like that?

268
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,281
No,

269
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:46,521
no,

270
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:46,701
no,

271
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:46,881
no.

272
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,620
I think if you live with
crazy bitches on enough,

273
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,310
you become one.

274
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,521
No.

275
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,030
Did you know Bruce Jenner said he's always
felt like a woman even when he was a

276
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:53,690
kid,

277
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,220
he's always felt like it was gay.

278
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,620
It turns out he's gay the whole time.

279
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,250
No,

280
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,701
he's not gay.

281
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,910
He's just felt like he's in a man's body.

282
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,690
The crazy thing about a lot of these
people that become transgender,

283
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,680
there's this like there's so many
different possibilities when it comes to

284
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,490
sexuality.

285
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,323
Wait a minute,

286
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,580
that still like checks.

287
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,200
That's something that a lot of us have
a hard time accepting because we only

288
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,840
have our own version of
sexuality and gender,

289
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,330
but some people are men.

290
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,710
They're attracted to women,

291
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,490
but they're attracted to women and wish
they were a woman and we're in love with

292
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,600
a woman as a lesbian.

293
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,640
They will sacrifice their dick.

294
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,980
They'll sacrifice the ability to come.

295
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,420
They'll sacrifice their testicles,

296
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,950
they'll sacrifice testosterone,

297
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,300
they'll sacrifice their male
gender and still be with women.

298
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,571
Bro,

299
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:39,261
I got one for you.

300
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,520
Have you heard of lady valor?

301
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah,

302
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,460
the fucking navy seal.

303
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,110
This badass navy seal.

304
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,610
Who said he,

305
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,001
he,

306
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,600
she,

307
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,991
she likes me.

308
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:48,620
She,

309
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,420
so he was a navy seal from seal team one
to seal team six and then he was just

310
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:53,571
like,

311
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,020
you know what?

312
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,910
I've always wanted to be
a woman my entire life.

313
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:56,744
I felt like a woman.

314
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,460
Straight dude.

315
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,071
Now you know,

316
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:01,520
you know like trying to look
like a woman in a dress.

317
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,650
Polka dot dress looks like me.

318
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,970
Really Tattoos and shit.

319
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,900
Mascara on.

320
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,000
Teach another navy seals
how to shoot and shit.

321
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,030
Is there a chance or a chance that the
Bruce Jenner thing could be a situation

322
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,770
where he's coming out slowly?

323
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,660
Cause remember Elton John was,

324
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,490
he looked totally gay.

325
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,170
He was flaming but he denied it.

326
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,910
He was managing,

327
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,070
he said he was bi and
then now he's full game.

328
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,270
So he came out first.

329
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,320
They came out where he is by,

330
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,390
he didn't come out fully all the way.

331
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,520
And so maybe Bruce Jenner's like,

332
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:31,751
you know,

333
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:35,000
and I can't come out and say I'm
gay and I want to be a woman.

334
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Let me tell people I want to be a woman
first and then laid or Morrissey saying,

335
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,150
Oh,

336
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,781
I'm not gay,

337
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,220
I'm asexual.

338
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,871
That's what he said.

339
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:45,950
He said he's asexual.

340
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,480
Bruce Jenner sat down with one of
those fucking interviews and it's,

341
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,320
I just read some details about it.

342
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:51,981
He's coming out and saying,

343
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,870
I felt like a woman my entire life.

344
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,770
I believe that.

345
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,710
Why you leave out?

346
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:55,980
Why

347
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,750
would you doubt that
someone would be asexual?

348
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,630
Cause then a lot of ways Stan hope
is asexual at this point in his life.

349
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,070
He doesn't have sex anymore.

350
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,211
He's still a man,

351
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,110
but he doesn't have sex anymore.

352
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,151
Maybe it doesn't,

353
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,150
it doesn't get hard anymore.

354
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,170
Not Interested in his testosterone,

355
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
just so I can just booze.

356
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,900
Damn booze and cigarettes
while he's having a great time.

357
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,590
Doesn't care.

358
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,831
Yeah.

359
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:14,730
Have a great live in life.

360
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,390
Yeah.

361
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,781
Loves it.

362
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:16,330
Teach though.

363
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,163
He's not,

364
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,413
he doesn't give a fuck.

365
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,673
He's having a good time.

366
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,461
I'm serious.

367
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,420
He talks about it openly.

368
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,210
He's like,

369
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,381
he's,

370
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,490
he's down with the slide.

371
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,840
Wow.

372
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,673
Yeah,

373
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,390
so there's different people,

374
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:27,930
man.

375
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,763
Everybody's different.

376
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,041
I mean,

377
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,330
Stan is not the dummy.

378
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:30,660
He's,

379
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,920
that's just what his decision,

380
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,083
he doesn't care.

381
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,890
And there's some people that you know,

382
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,330
like they might be asexual,

383
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,710
Marcy might be asexual.

384
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,940
That might not be bullshit.

385
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,890
It might be just this
is how he is the eye,

386
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:41,724
if everybody,

387
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,440
have you heard some of the smiths songs?

388
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,700
Thankfully,

389
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,151
thankfully,

390
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,480
no.

391
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,313
Okay.

392
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,640
I've heard a few of them,

393
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,590
but they made me sad.

394
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,900
I just only getting sad.

395
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,570
You know there's there,

396
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,590
is it all about having sex with dudes?

397
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:57,901
No.

398
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:58,550
You could just,

399
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,940
I don't think I've heard the songs.

400
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,130
You haven't heard of Smith Smith,

401
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,430
the smiths with Morrissey,

402
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,920
the singer?

403
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,753
Oh No.

404
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,623
How old are you again?

405
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,951
31 okay.

406
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:08,784
It's before your time.

407
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,480
It's like the cure,

408
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,410
the passion mode,

409
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,220
Morrissey,

410
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,580
all the,

411
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
I thought we're talking kind of easy,

412
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,340
like just hip hop everything.

413
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,101
I listen to everything.

414
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:17,761
Do you know this guy?

415
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,500
And he was such a rabid Vegan,

416
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:19,901
not a catch.

417
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:21,630
He won't let anybody who works for him.

418
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,930
He won't let anybody who
works for meet meet this guy.

419
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,291
Yeah.

420
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,640
When people working from like the crew,

421
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,740
he won't let them eat meat like he,

422
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,290
he like if you worked for him on tour,

423
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,280
you cannot eat meat.

424
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,851
Oh fuck.

425
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,380
That's a fucking,

426
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,680
these guys get together and we'll,

427
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,670
the idea that he could dictate
what someone's died is.

428
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,504
It's hilarious.

429
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,970
But he controls not just their
physical body when they work for him,

430
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:45,000
but what they put in their body
when they're on tour with him,

431
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,950
he does not allow them to eat meat.

432
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,641
So the crew,

433
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,140
they get together in one hotel room,

434
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:49,590
they'll find,

435
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,920
pick a hotel room and they ordered
room service and just go off and have

436
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,830
cheeseburgers and steak and shit and
they have to hide it from Morrison here.

437
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,470
This just her from some
kid that told Brennan shop.

438
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,090
I did tell me though,

439
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,023
it was a roadie

440
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,980
who heard it from Brendan
shot then I've heard the band.

441
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,230
I heard it from the guy who
actually worked for him.

442
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,473
The guy was a Rodeo.

443
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,561
Well,

444
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:18,781
he,

445
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,131
you know,

446
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:20,270
he really feels strongly about it.

447
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,150
Like say if you hired a bunch of people
and you found out that they like to eat

448
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:23,810
babies,

449
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,141
he'd be like,

450
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:24,650
look man,

451
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,480
you can't fucking eat babies
if you want to work for me.

452
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,021
I don't get,

453
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,330
maybe babies is a little different,

454
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:34,331
but the idea is just so he's so anti
animal cruelty that he doesn't want anyone

455
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,190
around him working in any
capacity that kills animals.

456
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,900
He feels like they're murderers.

457
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,351
I mean,

458
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,310
I don't agree with them,

459
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,380
but that's where it comes from.

460
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,110
If you found out already eight baby dogs,

461
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,490
would you let him open for you?

462
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,050
I would try to

463
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,040
Benson the naughty baby
dogs after the talk was,

464
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,720
I get a logical argument.

465
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,220
What is a lamb?

466
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,090
What does lamb?

467
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,400
Lamb is a baby sheet.

468
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,160
Exactly.

469
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,750
Mutton is a sheep.

470
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,920
I don't fuck with lamb either.

471
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,813
Lamb has doors.

472
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,340
I don't fuck with landlord veal chops.

473
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,840
I love lamb chops.

474
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,950
Unfortunately I don't,

475
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,880
I don't eat veal.

476
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,740
Veal cancels Gig in Iceland after
venue refuses to go vegetarian,

477
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,680
so he wants everyone to go vegetarian.

478
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,360
No hot dog is this singer.

479
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:20,171
Was due to perform it,

480
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:24,230
the Harper concert hall and
Reggie Avik and Iceland around.

481
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,330
He's still a rock star.

482
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,170
Look at Mick Jagger,

483
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,130
but listen to it loosened this.

484
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,330
It was this request.

485
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,450
Iceland doesn't have any fucking ground.

486
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,340
You can grow vegetables in Asshole,

487
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,870
like you can't be a vegetarian Iceland
unless you're bringing in trucks,

488
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:41,920
load of food or unless you've got some
sort of a crazy fucking greenhouse in

489
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,280
there.

490
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,420
Now look at that face right there.

491
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,040
You'd think he's asexual and I like guys,

492
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,463
he's Asexual,

493
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,470
but I shall leave the Harpa concert hall
to they're cannibalistic flesh eating

494
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,680
blood lust.

495
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,100
Marcy said in a statement,

496
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,450
quick,

497
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,283
fuck this guy.

498
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,371
Fuck this guy.

499
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,204
Real quick,

500
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,103
real quick.

501
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,320
I love Iceland.

502
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,600
Have wanted to for a long time to return.

503
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,130
That's hilarious.

504
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,233
Is this recent?

505
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah.

506
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
That's awesome.

507
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,460
What?

508
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,293
Not what?

509
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,230
February.

510
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,711
Wow.

511
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:12,550
Really recent.

512
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,760
He's a nut bag.

513
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:14,131
Germany.

514
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,160
He walked off the stage.

515
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,590
I think it's Poland show
after being heckled by a fan.

516
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,191
Oh,

517
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,520
that's hilarious.

518
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,210
That's like a real still
claiming a sexuality.

519
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,040
Do you know why you care?

520
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,840
He's like,

521
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,340
I don't know if this guy
wants to fuck or not.

522
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,860
He might be saying yes.

523
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,720
The other dude's

524
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,533
trying to fuck her.

525
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,730
He's like so hung up on
the guy being asexual.

526
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,020
I just think he's lying

527
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,211
because of it.

528
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:41,341
Yeah,

529
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:45,430
I think he's sucking Dick.

530
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,030
What makes you say that though,

531
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,081
Marcy?

532
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,030
Unfortunately I am not a homosexual.

533
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,750
Wow.

534
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,200
You know what,

535
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,033
man?

536
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,120
This is what I think,

537
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:55,954
dude.

538
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,310
He's a human sexual.

539
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,240
Exactly.

540
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:58,900
Humus,

541
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,733
human sexual.

542
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,290
I think he just eats salary.

543
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,760
Your fucking Dick don't work no more.

544
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,594
I agree.

545
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,523
I got it.

546
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,143
I was like

547
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,980
fucking commentators were
commentating on biology.

548
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,814
I agree.

549
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,680
If you have too much
capital for the record,

550
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,070
my favorite singer of all time is crazy
gay and it makes no difference to me,

551
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,260
but no,

552
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,530
no need to talk about names.

553
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,940
The guys that have come
out like Rob Halford,

554
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,803
I love rob,

555
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,770
famous guy.

556
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,510
Rob Helfer is one of the
most famous singers ever.

557
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:35,111
He's awesome.

558
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:35,944
He's openly gay.

559
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,010
He came out,

560
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:37,843
he says,

561
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,130
I still listen to Judas priest.

562
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:39,671
I don't give a shit.

563
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,121
Oh guys,

564
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,410
I could give two shits.

565
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,640
Jedi makes no difference.

566
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,330
I've just,

567
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:43,601
you know,

568
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,434
just don't,

569
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,610
I would say if you want to
know if it has sex with this,

570
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:49,001
come out,

571
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:49,450
don't lie.

572
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:49,781
You know what?

573
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:50,111
I think,

574
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,381
man,

575
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,500
I think my blues fans,

576
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,970
the people that care about that,

577
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,330
there's less of them in less than them
every day and I think we just hang in

578
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,760
there and we just hang in
there as a civilization.

579
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,290
I think racism,

580
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,450
I think people that are homophobic,

581
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,590
transsexual,

582
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,360
phobic or transphobic or
whatever they call it,

583
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,010
people will give a fuck what anybody does.

584
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:07,131
Loan.

585
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:08,150
It doesn't hurt you or,

586
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,080
or other folks.

587
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,520
They're going to go away.

588
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,930
They're not going to be around anymore.

589
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,321
I think.

590
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:12,620
Yeah,

591
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,890
I think this is all just a blip
in our evolution and our learning.

592
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,370
How long,

593
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,031
how long do you think,

594
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,650
how many hundred years at least?

595
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,010
At least no,

596
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,190
no racism.

597
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,801
A hundred years,

598
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,710
no homophobia.

599
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,211
A hundred years.

600
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:23,541
All of it.

601
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,291
It'd be out the window.

602
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,200
There'll be like a little blips here
and there that'll shock the shit out of

603
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,830
people will find out that there's still
people that they're terrible at raising

604
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,550
children,

605
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,190
but I think 100 years is several
generations in the future.

606
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,121
That's two,

607
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:35,391
three,

608
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:35,691
four,

609
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:36,351
whatever the fuck it.

610
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,071
What's a generation?

611
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:38,630
What's the technical generation?

612
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,710
20 how many years?

613
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,491
Five years now,

614
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,890
but I don't think they
consider a generation 75 years.

615
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,310
I think it's like a 10 or 20
year period that they called you,

616
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,470
like how long it is before if you're born
where you can start fucking and having

617
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,730
kids like how long.

618
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,740
I think that's what they
think of as a generation.

619
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:52,820
I don't think it's a full life one.

620
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,940
Life's Mexico's 16 ah,

621
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,803
how dare you.

622
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,130
How dare you?

623
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,990
How long has the generation roughly

624
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,590
as the average period,

625
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,840
but 25 years in their offspring.

626
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,160
That's all it said.

627
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,510
20 it says right here in general,

628
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,330
we think of a generation as being 25
years from the birth of a parent to the

629
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,130
birth of a child.

630
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,380
Damn,

631
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,090
he's hookers or getting pregnant quick.

632
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,340
25 already having kids.

633
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,460
Give yourself a chance,

634
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,290
girl,

635
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,123
go get a life.

636
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,390
Go around.

637
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,020
See the world.

638
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,880
I'll watch that shit
on 16 pregnant though.

639
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,531
Do you?

640
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:27,350
You know when I watched the other day
that I got obsessed with is that Goddamn

641
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,041
addiction.

642
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,460
My strange addiction show.

643
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:31,640
Let's get you watched five
of those fuckers in a row.

644
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,530
The mattresses?

645
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,030
Yeah,

646
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,320
the bitch snacks on mattresses.

647
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,530
You see this now?

648
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,260
It's been five different ones though.

649
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,870
Then she ate her entire mattress,

650
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:43,790
then went to her moms.

651
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,160
Oh my God.

652
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,080
The mattress cookie monster.

653
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,313
This monster.

654
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,090
That was another eating
disorder one there too.

655
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,953
We're all eating.

656
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,081
Oh my God.

657
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,250
She's eating a mattress.

658
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,210
Shits.

659
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,790
Look at her house.

660
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,623
The calories.

661
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,543
The one above it.

662
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,590
A faithful mattress and what does
that chick drinking gasoline.

663
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:03,981
Yeah,

664
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,470
she's drinking.

665
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,350
Guess what about the girl
with a giant titties?

666
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,570
She's eating matches my addiction to teal.

667
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,550
What is she saying?

668
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,700
Women has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars on the surgery ones crazy too.

669
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,210
What does she done to herself,

670
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:18,044
Jamie?

671
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,973
We needed to know.

672
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,990
Obviously she hasn't gotten a boob job.

673
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,491
Oh,

674
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:27,020
I saw a girl the other day that
was into eating those dryer sheets.

675
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,471
Oh yeah.

676
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,300
I saw that bitch and they were too strong.

677
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,220
So what she would do is you're too strong.

678
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,900
She would wrap them and toilet paper,

679
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,120
fold them up and eat the dryer sheets.

680
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:35,931
Dude,

681
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,390
that one you skip by the fucking guy.

682
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,720
Uh,

683
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,980
his girlfriend is his car.

684
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,120
He makes love to his car

685
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,190
now.

686
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,030
They showed him that full,

687
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,610
it's like dry humping the
car and get a 98 Monte Carlo.

688
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:47,444
What do you expect?

689
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,860
You would fucking 98 Monte Carlo,

690
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,694
right?

691
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,480
This is fucking American
paper as a kid ball,

692
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,120
but every paper,

693
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,073
no.

694
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,511
Oh my God.

695
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:00,780
Look at her.

696
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,531
Ted's 38.

697
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,430
K.

698
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,430
K.

699
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,431
K.

700
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:02,820
She's uh,

701
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,750
she's Ku Klux Klan.

702
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,840
She just wanted to get to
k because it's a KKK thing.

703
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,010
That'd be fun for a night.

704
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:08,521
Then you wake up,

705
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,121
the next one be like,

706
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,560
this is fucking weird dude.

707
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,910
Or implants or 14 pounds.

708
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,780
That would not be fun.

709
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,210
I think you'd be surprised.

710
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,330
I think it'd be a hell of a time.

711
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,910
Well if you're scared,

712
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,270
if you're scared,

713
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,560
I 100% get it.

714
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,600
She couldn't complain about
you putting it in her ass.

715
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,530
That's true.

716
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,390
She's got 14 pound implants.

717
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,910
I mean she could take someone conference,

718
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,180
get a certain size.

719
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,050
It's a turnoff.

720
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:31,861
Really?

721
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,041
Yeah.

722
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,450
There's a number of two giant,

723
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:36,840
it's like raw crazy chick
digging in her ears.

724
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,390
Oh,

725
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,390
you're talking about like 12 hours a week
or scrapes or ear canal with scissors.

726
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,450
Oh my God.

727
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,230
Nail files and other sharp
objects until she bleeds.

728
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,850
Whoa.

729
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,640
There was a chickie weights.

730
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:50,474
So

731
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,240
Jesus Christ had staff.

732
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,710
Ooh,

733
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,543
they get in her ears.

734
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,543
Could you date?

735
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,420
Could you,

736
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,880
could you put up with it if a chick
was eaten mattress all the time.

737
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,590
But she's just a fucking smoke show.

738
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:01,921
You just what?

739
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:05,400
She's eating your matches when she comes
over and let her know that you can't do

740
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,234
that in front of me.

741
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,890
So she's like,

742
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,880
so you're watching TV shoot.

743
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,291
She goes,

744
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:10,940
I'll be right back.

745
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,200
He touch half of your monitors.

746
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,071
Dope mattress.

747
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:14,190
It smells like lavender.

748
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
Five ounces a day.

749
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,070
This guy was snow snort and baby powder.

750
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,180
That's he stay alive.

751
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,541
Well,

752
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,870
maybe that's like what everybody has
always been snorting everywhere when they

753
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:25,830
thought they were getting cocaine,

754
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,630
they weren't true and this
guy found a cheaper way.

755
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,300
The addiction began one day afterwards.

756
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,340
A woman after she spilled baby powder
and inhaled it by mistake over the last

757
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,521
decade,

758
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,360
it escalated.

759
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,470
She loves the sensation and now
instead of just sniffing the powder,

760
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,280
j shoves it up her
nostrils 12 times a day.

761
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,143
What?

762
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,100
I mean,

763
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,660
what's the side of her dude?

764
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:50,670
Five ounces is a lot of baby powder.

765
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:51,504
A lot.

766
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,100
A pound is 16 ounces.

767
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,353
Okay.

768
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,193
Jesus Christ.

769
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,420
This is Norton.

770
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,900
A third of a pound mean.

771
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,430
What if she's just doing this
to cover up a coke problem

772
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,460
that's got this problem
with the [inaudible]?

773
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,383
Just fucking,

774
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,700
she could always,

775
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,840
if she gets busted with coke,

776
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,171
it was,

777
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:13,411

778
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,880
it's baby pedago fuck you.

779
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,650
And then you just send her a link.

780
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,173
Click on that link.

781
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,170
Strange addiction.

782
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,490
It's some weird shit,

783
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:22,980
man.

784
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,030
Is that an ABC show?

785
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,710
Why is it on abc.com oh,

786
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,544
it's in the news.

787
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,920
What if like every fifth line it's coke.

788
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,520
He just,

789
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,370
she just mixes it.

790
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,890
Just like tricking people.

791
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,760
That girl,

792
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,530
she snorts mothballs.

793
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,360
Oh God.

794
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:36,840
There's so many.

795
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:36,991
Oh,

796
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,690
this one was,

797
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,940
see the one with the glasses,

798
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,080
the far left.

799
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,861
This is a crazy one.

800
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:41,730
I watched this one the other day.

801
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:42,564
Let me tell you something.

802
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,340
She's an adult baby.

803
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,600
She's transgender.

804
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,620
She was born a boy,

805
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,820
decided wanted to be a girl,

806
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,190
a wears diapers and pajamas.

807
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,060
Likes to be a baby.

808
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:53,200
Where's pigtails?

809
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,120
How old is she likes to pee her pants.

810
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,470
She loves to pee your pants.

811
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,730
That's not it.

812
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,220
That's not the one that was good.

813
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,580
She says,

814
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,830
biting into a fucking rock.

815
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,071
Oh,

816
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:06,904
your teeth.

817
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,621
He goes,

818
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:09,310
yeah,

819
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,290
she's eating raw,

820
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,360
but we all know in your life we've all
met someone who was so fucking crazy go.

821
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:16,900
You know,

822
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,860
I think it's real.

823
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,550
Widow eats her husband's
ash and I've seen that.

824
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,490
That's sad.

825
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,780
That one's super dark.

826
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,510
That's dark baby feeding adult babies.

827
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,871
Oh,

828
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,291
shed.

829
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:34,291
Click the the one of the gate and
rocks and look at her a baby pouches.

830
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,093
That's cold

831
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,390
baby powder.

832
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,223
My well,

833
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
he sent it to me.

834
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,000
This guy is really fucking his car.

835
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,970
It's just bad.

836
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,940
Is that a dude was in
love with real dolls.

837
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,441
Let's see that.

838
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,610
So can we click on that?

839
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,473
Can we click on it?

840
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,980
I want to see the real dolls.

841
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,993
Oh my God.

842
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,980
He has a couple too.

843
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,530
It was just a picture.

844
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:04,751
We'll,

845
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:08,890
we'll just guarantee you could find it
or a video somewhere or available online.

846
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,710
It's chugging gasoline.

847
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,190
How the fuck are you alive?

848
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,690
This girl's eating cat food.

849
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,220
Well that's just protein.

850
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,170
The cat food is the least impressive.

851
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,471
Yeah,

852
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,011
the cat food.

853
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,180
It's like eating a mattress.

854
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,200
Just next level shit.

855
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,650
Hatchery system matches to some
shit and she devoured that thing.

856
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,820
Ah,

857
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,700
there was another one that was a pro
body builder or a woman who's addicted to

858
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:28,391
bodybuilding.

859
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:28,670
Does she?

860
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,740
What does she addicted to?

861
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,590
What is she doing?

862
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,550
Looking sexy as fuck barf.

863
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,730
She's got a little cat turds coming out
of her mouth and she just dropped some

864
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,870
things between her titties,

865
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:38,230
man.

866
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,470
Yeah,

867
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,303
cat turds.

868
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,660
She's got a whole mouth full of them.

869
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,010
You're gonna stick your Dick in there.

870
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,650
This is the one the I'm
addicted to being an adult baby.

871
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,480
That might be the worst one.

872
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,940
You're a drinker.

873
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,350
Weird one man.

874
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,760
The baby one was really weird because
I saw her at point a lot of things.

875
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,020
She was talking about how good it
must feel to pee into the diaper.

876
00:22:59,290 --> 00:22:59,711
And I was like,

877
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,041
damn,

878
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,060
I bet that does feel good.

879
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,400
She was like the feeling of
release and then the warmth,

880
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:06,160
wetness of the diaper right away.

881
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,060
I can get that.

882
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,641
I can see that.

883
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:10,560
It can feel like you're talking to
people and just like embrace it.

884
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,560
Just spiking.

885
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,960
I take those gorilla piss though,

886
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:14,420
man.

887
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,370
That shit good.

888
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,091
It's dorm.

889
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:20,410
It's all of your balls for
about 10 seconds and then
you start smelling ammonia.

890
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,030
Here we go.

891
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,080
Oh,

892
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,020
okay.

893
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,080
And he still loves his real dog.

894
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,250
What does that mean still?

895
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,080
They got in a fight.

896
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,913
Well there's a whole,

897
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,620
you gotta be a weird fucking dude man.

898
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,840
We'll do Dube.

899
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,720
She has kind of hot though who she,

900
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,600
but he's like in full play mode.

901
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,430
Like he pretends that it's a real person.

902
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,570
She's out of his leg.

903
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,531
Can you though,

904
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:45,960
if you,

905
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,960
if a real woman was so far out of your
reach that this was the alternative.

906
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:51,950
You look behind that guy,

907
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,180
back that up a second.

908
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,710
Look behind that guy on the shelf.

909
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:55,041
What does that,

910
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,000
is that all porn?

911
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,410
That's exactly what that is.

912
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,190
Look at that.

913
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,831
That mother paused.

914
00:23:58,831 --> 00:23:59,560
That shit right there.

915
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,230
That's foreign.

916
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,240
I guess like their DVDs.

917
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,400
The fuck has DVDs.

918
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:03,830
True.

919
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,940
It's 2015 DVD collection link that
this fucking dude is jack in it.

920
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:09,560
Those are DVDs of porn.

921
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,330
That's the only thing that
sells and deviation day.

922
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,280
If it wasn't for porn DVDs,

923
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,210
it'd be off the market.

924
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:18,020
They wouldn't even have to be because
these bitches be eight tracks.

925
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,520
They just copy.

926
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,480
They want,

927
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,040
they want blue ray,

928
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,240
they want HD.

929
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,150
They want it to be able to pause the
remote and they don't want the government

930
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:27,170
to know that downloading it.

931
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,810
Wow.

932
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,570
You've given me,

933
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,020
they got a shitty Internet connection.

934
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,860
Okay.

935
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,290
Maybe they don't want their jack and
to be dependent upon their Internet

936
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:33,710
connection.

937
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,490
True.

938
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,990
You know it's on your phone.

939
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,190
That guy's whacking it for sure.

940
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:40,310
Well,

941
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,641
he's not,

942
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,630
he's puking his real doll.

943
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:43,940
Right?

944
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,860
He must've just got
turned down so many times.

945
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:46,101
He's like,

946
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,210
fuck this noise.

947
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,040
He might not have even made a swing.

948
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,670
He might not have even never stepped
to the plate and I can look it up.

949
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,410
It looks like he swung it at some dicks.

950
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,090
Let's be honest here.

951
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:59,780
Would that haircut like
that and better and better?

952
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,700
You know what's hilarious about the show
is this fucking counselor guy that has

953
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,280
to come in and talk to each
person has an addiction.

954
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,080
Whether it's a guy or a Gal.

955
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,800
If there's some,

956
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,240
there's different counselors all the time.

957
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,360
What does this guy singer,

958
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,243
what could he possibly,

959
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,881
you don't think he's like,

960
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:14,271
motherfucker.

961
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:14,930
You don't look at them.

962
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,140
Know.

963
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,700
I know this is fucking weird.

964
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:17,510
Look at the camera setup.

965
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,440
How low tech is this show?

966
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,360
They've got a GoPro behind
that dude's right shoulder.

967
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,210
I'm serious.

968
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:21,960
They're on TV.

969
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,930
Look at that Gopro.

970
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,450
That's,

971
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,620
that's the video we're watching.

972
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,390
We're watching GOPRO video.

973
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,283
Fuck,

974
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,533
look at this dude.

975
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,470
He's in love though,

976
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,660
but they get this counselor that
comes in and pretends he's got it.

977
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,290
She got a dog collar on it because a deck,

978
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,001
if he's happy,

979
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,440
the WHO gives a fuck.

980
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:42,500
Like you're bringing a counselor and
he looks at these put collars on her.

981
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:42,771
Yeah,

982
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:43,341
that is weird.

983
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,300
Owns those checks he has.

984
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,193
Good.

985
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,930
That's a good memory.

986
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,820
I think I saw a couple man just back that
up real quick and you see exactly what

987
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:53,210
it looks like.

988
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,020
He's fucking it.

989
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,853
Not right there.

990
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,400
Watch when you see a face to
face Rose McGowan a little bit,

991
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,720
but not real.

992
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,770
Watch this.

993
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,480
When you see him like
face to face with it.

994
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:02,781
Yeah.

995
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:03,614
We're at that phase of life.

996
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,600
That's the fuck face chewing gum.

997
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,800
Chewing Gum,

998
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,090
slinging Dick on her.

999
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:09,791
I'm not going to lie.

1000
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,530
It looks at you as a pizza
humped over like a letter c

1001
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,380
jumbo shrimp.

1002
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,510
What do you think the
average year as general

1003
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,310
in prison were you at 40 50 60 years
where I'll you suppress your sexuality so

1004
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,760
much that you start thinking about dudes.

1005
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,460
A couple hours a day I'll
give a damn and they're like,

1006
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:31,791
you know what,

1007
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,630
I'm just gonna start sucking.

1008
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,730
Did you see the picture of this?

1009
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,000
It's a controversial picture that's been
going around lately of these two guys

1010
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,900
that are standing up and they've got a
belt around this dude's knack and then

1011
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:44,310
dudes on his knees and he's got a black
eye and they're like making gang signs

1012
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,480
in front of the camera.

1013
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,170
It's pretty,

1014
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,003
it's awesome.

1015
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,100
It's pretty crazy man.

1016
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,140
See if he could put on Jamie,

1017
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,750
hold on,

1018
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,740
let me explain it to Jamie stories.

1019
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,550
Surgeon it,

1020
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,240
there's um,

1021
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,770
two dudes that are stand to,

1022
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,000
to young African American fellows that
are throwing up gang signs and in front

1023
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:04,290
of them is a dude who was on his knees
and he's got a belt around his neck and a

1024
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:09,291
black eye and the dude was doing eight
years I think for armed robbery or

1025
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:10,500
something along those lines.

1026
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,270
And um,

1027
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,260
apparently there is beating his ass and
making them their dog or whatever the

1028
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,220
fuck they want to do with them.

1029
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,121
Well this is a picture.

1030
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:18,954
They took him prison,

1031
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,430
prison,

1032
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,930
somebody like tweeted it or something.

1033
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:23,821
They do,

1034
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:24,150
man,

1035
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,983
they told me,

1036
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,770
Doug,

1037
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,491
they have phones,

1038
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:27,420
they get phones in there,

1039
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:28,650
they get all kinds of drugs in there.

1040
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,071
That's it.

1041
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:29,730
That's the picture.

1042
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,780
Look at this Georgia gang launch
attack on what does it say?

1043
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,541
God Damn.

1044
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:36,991
It's crazy.

1045
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:39,330
Is there a worst job in the
world like gimp in prison?

1046
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,021
Mom's furious.

1047
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:43,140
Teen men launch gang attack
on her son 18 to prison cell,

1048
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:46,680
then tie a leash around his neck and
pose for a Facebook photo despite being

1049
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,520
behind bars.

1050
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,660
Wow.

1051
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,080
Hunched down with a swollen eye in
front of two shirtless young man.

1052
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,250
One of them was holding the leash.

1053
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,180
Berries told family members that he was
jumped by 10 other inmates and guards

1054
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:59,610
couldn't check on him until
six hours after the incident.

1055
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,593
Well,

1056
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,640
investigating.

1057
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,180
Believe the incident was gang related.

1058
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,350
Oh my God.

1059
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:04,941
She wants to.

1060
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:07,770
Sure it's from the department that he
will be able to pay his debt to society

1061
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:08,730
without being killed.

1062
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,130
Look at that killed picture.

1063
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,800
Look at that picture.

1064
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,630
Be fucked up.

1065
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,160
Let me get a look at that picture.

1066
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:14,851
Holy Shit.

1067
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:15,684
That's scary.

1068
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,940
Imagine being that guy
and that's your life.

1069
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,811
Back that up.

1070
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:19,201
Jamie said,

1071
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,100
I don't mean to laugh,

1072
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:21,600
but there be a worse scenario.

1073
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:22,111
Look at that,

1074
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:22,944
man.

1075
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,940
That is crazy.

1076
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:26,400
That's as high as theirs.

1077
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,160
There's a Bersin picks it you
don't want on the Internet,

1078
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:30,020
but that's the worst.

1079
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,920
It's the worst picture of all time.

1080
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:32,754
If he that guy,

1081
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,430
how crazy is that to have a Dick pick up?

1082
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:34,800
Well,

1083
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,740
that's a good picture to deter
people from committing crimes.

1084
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,460
You're actually,

1085
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,540
it's a good picture to show that
people learn when you put them in jail.

1086
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,740
They really change.

1087
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,030
They change their ways.

1088
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,120
They don't continue.

1089
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,460
Bang.

1090
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,420
The guys pulling the
trigger at the camera.

1091
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,930
The other guy's throwing up a gang sign
and he's got a leash around a dude who's

1092
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,880
got a fucked up face.

1093
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,280
You don't know that's a gang sign.

1094
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,670
That could be Mork and Mindy
could be really like star Trek.

1095
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,780
Could we start track?

1096
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,690
You just live long and prosper science.

1097
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,800
Fuck God.

1098
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:05,910
That guy on the bottom it.

1099
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,744
He's just like,

1100
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,890
fuck.

1101
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,720
That's a crazy way to live.

1102
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,970
That's a crazy way to live,

1103
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:12,804
man.

1104
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,550
This poor guy has got to live like that
for six hours until the guards come and

1105
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,170
chase him and then what happens?

1106
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,790
Does he do they put him in solitary?

1107
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,321
Yeah,

1108
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:23,550
he's probably hoping.

1109
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,840
Yeah,

1110
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,580
that's best case scenario
would be if he does,

1111
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,350
he's going to have to do
his whole time in solitary.

1112
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,900
Andy defrain out of bad homeboys.

1113
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,820
Fucking he's in some shit.

1114
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,770
Any differing from Shawshank redemption.

1115
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,420
Fight off the lady boys.

1116
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,871
Wow.

1117
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:37,291
Powerful.

1118
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,280
Strange reference.

1119
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,560
Shush all I reference this movie.

1120
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,350
That's hilarious.

1121
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,450
How he,

1122
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,960
how do you have time to train,

1123
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,430
watch all these movies and then know
every God damn fight like an encyclopedia.

1124
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,870
You watch fights twice there.

1125
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,190
All you need to do is watch him once,

1126
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,941
uh,

1127
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:55,840
usually once,

1128
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,171
once.

1129
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:56,711
And you remember,

1130
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,251
you got to remember,

1131
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,470
I do those shows for fight pass EOC now.

1132
00:29:59,471 --> 00:29:59,820
So I,

1133
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,300
I research a lot of shit.

1134
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,730
Okay?

1135
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,563
Okay.

1136
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,563
There's a dude,

1137
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,410
there's another photo of him.

1138
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,460
One is I all fucked up.

1139
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,390
We get them on the left.

1140
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:07,931
Good Times.

1141
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,660
We get them in the right.

1142
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,330
[inaudible] your Dick in the,

1143
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,390
I choked him to sleep.

1144
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:12,910
It says,

1145
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,130
Oh,

1146
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,420
you do.

1147
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:13,931
Who knows?

1148
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,070
It says a gang related,

1149
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,480
aggravated battery robbery and theft of
a motor deficits jumped by 10 people.

1150
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,613
Fuck man.

1151
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,090
It's terrifying.

1152
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,140
Being in jail and,

1153
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:27,340
and knowing that you're in jail with a
bunch of other prisoners and that there's

1154
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:28,660
no one watching out for you,

1155
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,680
no one protecting you.

1156
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,930
That's the terrifying
thing about being in jail.

1157
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,850
Do you fight back or do you just like,

1158
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:34,181
you know what,

1159
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:34,570
fuck it.

1160
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,121
Tear this out.

1161
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:37,570
You have to decide whether
or not it's worth it.

1162
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,060
You could die and if you don't die,

1163
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:40,751
you know,

1164
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:44,200
you could be unbelievably injured to
the point where you're never the same

1165
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:44,950
person again.

1166
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,000
Or You could just deal with their shit
for eight years and succumb and then get

1167
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,410
out and never be the same person again.

1168
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,730
Cause you're always been,

1169
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:55,420
you've been diminished by a bunch of men
who have you down and you'll have PTSD.

1170
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,410
If there's 10 guys that your
fight 100% you're a fight.

1171
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,760
You know,

1172
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,610
who knows what happens in your mind if
you know you're never getting out of

1173
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,180
there.

1174
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,013
I agree.

1175
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,910
That's a different animal.

1176
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,631
You got to think like,

1177
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,770
this is my new world.

1178
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,620
I have to figure out how I handled
was told you up and you knew it was

1179
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,360
inevitable that they got you.

1180
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:15,610
They got your hog tied and they're
ready to go in the ass too.

1181
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,853
You want to use,

1182
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,520
you want to go dry syrup or
jelly or peanut butter or,

1183
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,100
or you're all in spit or your own spit.

1184
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,090
You could spit on there.

1185
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,133
His hands.

1186
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,710
Yes.

1187
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,281
What do you want?

1188
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:28,240
Dry Dry.

1189
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,580
Was there the Syrup Jelly,

1190
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,811
Jelly.

1191
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:32,310
All data,

1192
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,340
Jelly carry all day.

1193
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,420
Is it raspberry jelly,

1194
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,410
but it's going to be in your
asshole [inaudible] prison jelly.

1195
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,510
So it's going to be those
raspberry containers.

1196
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:40,931
You know what I mean?

1197
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:41,660
That little lip,

1198
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:41,830
you know?

1199
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,071
I know,

1200
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:44,380
but raspberry has those
little seeds that lubricate,

1201
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:44,671
you know,

1202
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:45,580
you're an asshole a little bit.

1203
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:49,960
I feel it's kind of fucked up that they
take people like in jail and they make

1204
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:54,220
them be around other people
that are also with no,

1205
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:57,490
everyone is at their
youngest most horniest crate,

1206
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:58,330
which I liked a lot.

1207
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:02,290
A lot of violent criminals between age
of 19 and 23 like there's been studies

1208
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:02,830
done.

1209
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,131
Brian,

1210
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,190
cal and I were talking about this on the
last podcast that we did from the car

1211
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,210
that if you,

1212
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,720
uh,

1213
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,720
if you removed all the 19 to 23 year old
males in our society of violent crime

1214
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,880
would drop by like 90% shit.

1215
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,920
Some crazy number who came up with that?

1216
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,920
They just did studies on the amount of
people that commit violent crimes and

1217
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:22,180
when they committed the crimes,

1218
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,430
the age for V for young males,

1219
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,151
it's very,

1220
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,170
very high.

1221
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,100
But they always say when in the
prison system you go in with whatever,

1222
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:34,990
you know your bachelors of crime and you
come out with your master's master's.

1223
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:35,230
Yeah.

1224
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,063
They always say that.

1225
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:36,930
Yes,

1226
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,100
you're around other criminals
who know their shit man.

1227
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,750
And it's not like you're going in
and you're learning positive shit.

1228
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,860
It's becomes your culture too.

1229
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,370
Yes.

1230
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,001
You get out.

1231
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,370
A lot of guys are habituated
where they get out in there,

1232
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:46,701
fuck,

1233
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:50,030
they don't know how to like hang
out and be afraid of the world.

1234
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,370
What a shitty system and the fact that
someone could do one of those and make

1235
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:59,480
money and then you find out there's guys
like that judge in Pennsylvania that

1236
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:03,560
was luck in young kids up and have
juvenile just to get the money.

1237
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,570
He was getting kickbacks from the prison.

1238
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:06,320
Fuck man.

1239
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,550
So he was taking kids in,

1240
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,970
railroading them and sending them down
river and making money off of a holy

1241
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:11,390
fuck.

1242
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,170
One kid committed suicide and his mother
was at the trial screaming at the guy.

1243
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,280
It was dark.

1244
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,690
I get put away forever.

1245
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,273
Forever.

1246
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,570
How did they bust some shit on?

1247
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:20,960
No,

1248
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,710
it's a good question.

1249
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,910
That is so fucked up.

1250
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,080
That story bothered me so much.

1251
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:25,160
I didn't even want to read into it.

1252
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,110
The idea that some guy had a lot though,

1253
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:28,940
isn't that the private
prisons and all that shit?

1254
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,540
Well that is a specific case when
they're talking about juvenile offenders.

1255
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,650
This guy was selling,

1256
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,070
selling,

1257
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,550
sending juveniles that were innocent
to like these detention camps.

1258
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:38,450
How much was he making?

1259
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,010
I don't know him that nothing.

1260
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:40,580
He did it.

1261
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,980
He made hundreds of thousands
of dollars over a period.

1262
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,823
Then he went to jail.

1263
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,660
Fuck yeah,

1264
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,230
they're gonna.

1265
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,260
They're gonna fuck him up.

1266
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,200
He's fucked.

1267
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,580
The idea that a judge put people in
jail for money and now he's in jail.

1268
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,380
They're gonna fuck that guy up.

1269
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,670
That guy might not ever,

1270
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,870
he might not make it.

1271
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:57,590
He shouldn't.

1272
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,220
He shouldn't.

1273
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,761
I agree.

1274
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,600
I mean that's Karma.

1275
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,673
That's justice.

1276
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,730
You ruined kids lives.

1277
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,330
You take them into your there and you
stuff them in with kids like those guys

1278
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,980
and they do something like that to them.

1279
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,940
And then you have guys like two
thousand ten thousand fucking dead.

1280
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh my God created fake this.

1281
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,640
This guy went to jail because he created
a fake humorous myspace page about her.

1282
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:24,641
Is Her school's vice principal 12 cursed
at a another student's mother 17 did

1283
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:27,800
nothing at all.

1284
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,550
It didn't matter,

1285
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,383
man.

1286
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,610
Kids for cash is a documentary.

1287
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,250
Oh my goodness.

1288
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,000
Called kids for cash.

1289
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,000
Your documentary on Netflix,

1290
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,541
I'm sure.

1291
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,374
I don't know.

1292
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,880
Oh my God.

1293
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,430
He made 2.2 million.

1294
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,663
Ooh.

1295
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,210
As a finder's fee for the
construction of a for profit facility,

1296
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,170
which houses so-called delinquents.

1297
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,390
Oh my God.

1298
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,380
He sentenced around 3000
children in a similar matter.

1299
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,730
Oh my God,

1300
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,220
I should go to prison just to
get ass raped every morning.

1301
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,371
Well,

1302
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:02,720
he's doing 28 years,

1303
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:04,790
which means he could probably
get out and less than that,

1304
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:06,080
but most likely you won't make it.

1305
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,071
God,

1306
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,340
no,

1307
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,240
that's fucked in there.

1308
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,890
My God.

1309
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:11,120
What a fucking piece of shit.

1310
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:14,600
That guy is the idea that a human
being could do that to a kid though.

1311
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:15,051
Crazy,

1312
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:15,620
Huh?

1313
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,730
It's just terrifying.

1314
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,780
It's just terrifying.

1315
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,800
It's just terrifying that that
someone would have that in there.

1316
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,900
Their DNA,

1317
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,600
they have that in their brain
where they can accept that.

1318
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,800
And then you have guys like,

1319
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,720
you see that documentary?

1320
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,030
The Jinx on Hbo Has Holy Shit.

1321
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,501
Robert Durst,

1322
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:33,571
who,

1323
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:34,850
who got away with murder,

1324
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,920
he chopped dude's limbs
off and his head off,

1325
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:37,951
he got busted.

1326
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:38,040
He

1327
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
admitted he killed the guy,

1328
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,051
but he says,

1329
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:40,201
Hey,

1330
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:40,890
I kill.

1331
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,110
I had to do that because
I accidentally killed him.

1332
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,480
I didn't think anybody
was going to believe me.

1333
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,350
So I thought,

1334
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,160
hmm,

1335
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,070
I better chop off all his limbs in
his head and throw him in the river.

1336
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,750
And he got off to the money because
he said it was self defense.

1337
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,540
It was caught up with him,

1338
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,630
but he didn't call the cops.

1339
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,430
He just as a side and nobody
was going to believe him.

1340
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:01,380
So he had to chop the dude
up and he got away with it.

1341
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,190
God damnit.

1342
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,023
So crazy.

1343
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,840
Totally get.

1344
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,980
And on top of that,

1345
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,270
when they first arrested him,

1346
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,441
did you saw it right?

1347
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:07,770
Yeah.

1348
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,030
When they first arrested him,

1349
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:09,900
uh,

1350
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,820
he posted bail and skip town.

1351
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,320
So he was a fugitive down.

1352
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,460
What the fuck?

1353
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,300
They finally catch him,

1354
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,830
catch him and shot him some money.

1355
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,290
They catch him shoplifting,

1356
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:19,471
he's said,

1357
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,304
and he's a millionaire.

1358
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,220
Murdered the guy and chopped him up.

1359
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:24,030
But he said he,

1360
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,850
he did it because he didn't think people
were going to believe him because his

1361
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,380
wife was missing and they think he did.

1362
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,214
It

1363
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,380
went missing.

1364
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,131
His wife went,

1365
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:35,320
Miss [inaudible] says wife went missing.

1366
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,750
He killed his best friend.

1367
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,410
His,

1368
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,640
his wife went missing.

1369
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,570
They never found the body.

1370
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:40,410
So for 10 years,

1371
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,140
her family suspected,

1372
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:45,390
and they knew he did it
because she was always saying,

1373
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:46,080
he's going to kill me.

1374
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,651
He's going to kill him.

1375
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:47,550
He's gonna fuck me up.

1376
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,384
He's going to kill me.

1377
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,180
And then one night she disappeared
and he had an alibi or you know,

1378
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,550
she never showed up or she came and I
dropped her off at the train and I don't

1379
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:54,384
know where she went.

1380
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,710
We were having a lot of trouble,

1381
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,420
so maybe she just left me,

1382
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:57,631
you know,

1383
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:58,381
people just leave,

1384
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:59,010
you know,

1385
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,791
and uh,

1386
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,080
so they never found the body,

1387
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,760
so they just let it go.

1388
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,390
And he's,

1389
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:08,250
he's an air of like a gazillionaire
own skyscrapers in New York.

1390
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,710
Yeah.

1391
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,810
He had a lot of power,

1392
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:10,644
a lot of money.

1393
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,820
And he got away with
making his wife disappear.

1394
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:13,890
They still haven't found the body.

1395
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:16,290
They think there's
another case too from the,

1396
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,390
I'm a health food store in Vermont.

1397
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,280
There was a girl who's
working in that town.

1398
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,570
A young girl disappeared.

1399
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,501
That's another one.

1400
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,334
They didn't talk about it,

1401
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,310
but it came out after there's a new one,

1402
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,450
they're connecting to him.

1403
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,463
Whoa.

1404
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,300
That might have been
the first one he killed.

1405
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,140
That was one of the greatest
documentaries I've done.

1406
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,360
Last one's insane.

1407
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:34,350
When he goes to the bathroom,

1408
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,960
he's a way to go like talking
to himself like an asshole.

1409
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,760
He got,

1410
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,590
I killed him.

1411
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,340
Of course they got me.

1412
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,700
Of course he's like talking,

1413
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,720
he doesn't realize that Mike is still
in the bath talking to himself confess

1414
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
because I busted him that
that's the evidence though.

1415
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:51,711
Like his,

1416
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:52,770
his uh,

1417
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,911
lawyers like,

1418
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:54,270
dude,

1419
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,550
if you think that's enough
evidence we can go try right now.

1420
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,020
I'm going to shit all over your story.

1421
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,200
Cause that what they're
saying and he's like,

1422
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,270
what about the letter that the killer
wrote to the police department?

1423
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:04,200
It's his writing too.

1424
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,070
That was great.

1425
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,850
Have you seen it?

1426
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,361
Do you see?

1427
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,194
You never see it.

1428
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,570
You never see a guy go like a,

1429
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,230
you know,

1430
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,960
in true romance and they
talked about Panama's.

1431
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,050
When people lie,

1432
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,380
if you,

1433
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,430
if you ask them a question,

1434
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:14,710
Dereck,

1435
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,300
and they lie,

1436
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,170
if they're lying,

1437
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,220
there's like things they do,

1438
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:20,520
they scratch their head or there's
like a tick when they answer,

1439
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,980
there's something girls
have like 13 things they do,

1440
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:23,701
guys have nine,

1441
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,534
something like that.

1442
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,440
And uh,

1443
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,210
and that's what people at like,

1444
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,063
uh,

1445
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,800
uh,

1446
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,371
detectives,

1447
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,061
that's what they look for.

1448
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,790
That's what they keep asking questions
and they just have a camera on your face.

1449
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,690
They review the camera.

1450
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,350
That's how they see if you're lying,

1451
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,393
you're twitches.

1452
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,930
And Man,

1453
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,591
when they said,

1454
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:39,630
is this your riding?

1455
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:40,464
He goes,

1456
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,781
yes,

1457
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:41,471
that's my writing.

1458
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:42,070
And it was boom,

1459
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,820
boom.

1460
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,260
It was blocking his face,

1461
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:44,471
goes,

1462
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:45,011
walked the talk.

1463
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:45,844
He goes like this.

1464
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:46,690
No,

1465
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,060
he started gagging cause
this you're writing.

1466
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:49,630
He goes,

1467
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,680
he knows Bourbon Yankees.

1468
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:51,940
Like,

1469
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,773
Oh God,

1470
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,260
no.

1471
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,480
Oh,

1472
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,313
does this too.

1473
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,090
This is the ultimate,

1474
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,940
this is usually what
they look for is like,

1475
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,080
what were you that last night?

1476
00:38:59,081 --> 00:38:59,230
Well,

1477
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,680
how was,

1478
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,041
how was,

1479
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:00,670
you know,

1480
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,503
and I was um,

1481
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,420
you know,

1482
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:02,861
and,

1483
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:03,090
uh,

1484
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,650
um,

1485
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,390
you know,

1486
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,280
I don't know what the fuck I will,

1487
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:06,571
you know,

1488
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:07,001
you know what I mean?

1489
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:07,834
You're doing all these things.

1490
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,561
He went like this,

1491
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,394
he went like this

1492
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,550
and then the Gulf and then the
burping and when he's in the bathroom,

1493
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,410
why did you burp the burden of pain?

1494
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:20,831
He's like,

1495
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:22,780
it's so obvious talking himself.

1496
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,521
Oh my God,

1497
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:24,400
it's so crazy.

1498
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,860
But he had the pressure
of gliding that long.

1499
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,090
Must be overwhelming,

1500
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,660
man.

1501
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,920
He must've been a smart dude.

1502
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:34,210
Cause so many investigators came after
me at the same story over and over.

1503
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,650
But the thing that fucked him is the
way spelled Beverly Beverly hills,

1504
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,540
he spelled it with an extra e.

1505
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,820
So the killer killed a
lady and sent the letter,

1506
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,220
said the cadavers here with,

1507
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:45,580
uh,

1508
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,580
the address and he spelt Beverly with
an extra e white killed the chick.

1509
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,590
Well,

1510
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:51,940
he,

1511
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,170
it was all about his wife.

1512
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,520
He made his wife disappear.

1513
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,350
So for 10 years he got away with it.

1514
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,131
But he had a really,

1515
00:39:57,131 --> 00:40:01,150
his best friend with some chick who
was the daughter of a big mob boss.

1516
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,920
So he was really connected with the mob.

1517
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,310
So that was the only chick who knew she
was his publicist during the 10 years

1518
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:07,180
when people were accusing him,

1519
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,530
they ended up dropping the case.

1520
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,580
They could never find a body.

1521
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,511
So she knew.

1522
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:12,340
She ended up moving to fucking la.

1523
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,420
She was a writer.

1524
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,190
They still kept in touch,

1525
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,500
but her,

1526
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,310
the wife who was missing her family
would always tell the investigators goal,

1527
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,361
interview,

1528
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:22,931
that chick,

1529
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:23,711
Sharon something,

1530
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:24,544
go interview that chick.

1531
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,050
That chick knows go question.

1532
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,350
And then when they were finally
going to do at 10 15 years later,

1533
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,200
they were going to reopen it
and go question that chick.

1534
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,030
He's in New York,

1535
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,440
she's dead.

1536
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:41,130
She gets blown away and it just so happens
he flew to California like that name,

1537
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,070
but he was a northern cal because I was
in northern California and they track

1538
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:46,480
them driving down cause he would,

1539
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,763
they track,

1540
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,000
you can't.

1541
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,510
He goes,

1542
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,680
I was in California.

1543
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:50,981
He goes,

1544
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:51,291
but you,

1545
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,480
you can't put me in La.

1546
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,300
Why is he have any kids?

1547
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,133
People all the time.

1548
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,470
Well,

1549
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,610
where are you doing in California
to California's a big state.

1550
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,133
Yes.

1551
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,500
Oh,

1552
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,640
but the thing is,

1553
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,980
it all stems from,

1554
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,390
I guess his dad was,

1555
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,560
he had like four or five brothers and
sisters and his mom committed suicide,

1556
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:11,140
jumped off the top of the
House with the dad goes,

1557
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:13,510
your mom's about to do
some only wakes him up,

1558
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,560
brings him to the window.

1559
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,450
Like look at your mom.

1560
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,450
The mom commit suicide,

1561
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,500
jumps off dark right in front of him.

1562
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:19,780
He said,

1563
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,980
your mom's about to do something,

1564
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,380
so you want us to watch that.

1565
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,920
He wakes up.

1566
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,250
He's the only kid he wakes up,

1567
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,780
grabs him and goes,

1568
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:26,980
check out your mom out there.

1569
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:27,821
And he's like,

1570
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,120
what?

1571
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,440
He's wanted his mom.

1572
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,890
You want to just send them
to see was what he said.

1573
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,210
But all his defense was always
about feel sorry for me.

1574
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:38,660
I,

1575
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,100
you know,

1576
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,130
for Siphon it was all,

1577
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:40,670
that's what,

1578
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,360
just kidding.

1579
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,110
That's what he said.

1580
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,020
He was real shit.

1581
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,190
It be create a monster.

1582
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,900
If his dad killed his mom in front
of them were really what it was.

1583
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,060
What it was is he got rid of his,

1584
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,930
his wife.

1585
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,320
So the only reason he murdered that
check was cause she was going to start

1586
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:55,670
talking 10 15 years later.

1587
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,510
So he had to kill it.

1588
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,191
What about the neighbors?

1589
00:41:57,191 --> 00:41:57,830
So he killed her,

1590
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:02,480
the neighbor because then he kills her
and then he disappears and dresses up

1591
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,231
like a chicken.

1592
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:08,231
Rents a house in Arizona or mute chick
in Texas so that no one talks to me.

1593
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:09,710
He's like an old lady.

1594
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,270
So after he kills her,

1595
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:15,650
he's in Texas hiding out and he had
this neighbor that eventually he started

1596
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:17,660
talking to after a while and then he,

1597
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,830
he ended up telling him who he was and
then he had to kill him too because he

1598
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,870
knew like it was just really obvious.

1599
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,700
He looks like shit because
he knew he was killing it.

1600
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,760
How's he getting away with this?

1601
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,590
He looks like a piece of shit.

1602
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:30,890
Yeah,

1603
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,340
he looks like Mr. Burns Bro.

1604
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,500
It's like Mr. Burns just
shooting and killing anybody.

1605
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,050
He's chopping bitches up
to and then check this out.

1606
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:39,884
That would be,

1607
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,930
that would take four.

1608
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,180
So the neighbor that he told every,

1609
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:43,830
he,

1610
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,110
his wife disappeared.

1611
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,400
Beautiful,

1612
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,720
great,

1613
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,470
great skin.

1614
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,830
And so he has to kill his neighbor
in Texas because he knows everything.

1615
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:52,750
So he chocked,

1616
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,481
he chops up,

1617
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:54,860
has he chops off his arms,

1618
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:55,694
his legs in his head.

1619
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,200
He puts them in plastic bags,

1620
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,130
he throws him in the leg.

1621
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,910
The next morning he comes to see if
they float it up and they floated up.

1622
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,980
So it's like fuck all these
body parts right there.

1623
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,611
So he says,

1624
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:05,090
fuck it.

1625
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,240
He grabs the head cause he shot him
in the head and disappeared with that.

1626
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,410
They never found the head.

1627
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,581
They found the body.

1628
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,840
Obviously they check the fingerprints.

1629
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:12,650
They went to the guys,

1630
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,790
they went to the guy's house,

1631
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,320
they started interviewing the,

1632
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:16,850
the landlord and the neighbor go,

1633
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:17,391
who lives here?

1634
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:17,601
They go,

1635
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:18,740
some mute old lady.

1636
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:19,574
Then they started,

1637
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,540
then they figured out,

1638
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,230
oh shit,

1639
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,670
this is the dude that fucking did it.

1640
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,660
He gets busted,

1641
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,560
he gets arrested,

1642
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,360
post bail disappears.

1643
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,570
They catch him shoplifting a
sandwich like a week later.

1644
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,460
So then he goes to trial,

1645
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,481
he goes to trial,

1646
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:36,770
but he was wanted for the murder for that
lady in California and still his wife.

1647
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:38,300
But Texas said he's
willing to try him here.

1648
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:39,740
We got them open and shut.

1649
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,603
He's done.

1650
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,750
He was done,

1651
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:42,200
dude.

1652
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,860
He,

1653
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,910
there was no way he was going to get.

1654
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:44,661
Don't say any more.

1655
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:45,830
I want to watch this fucking thing.

1656
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,990
No,

1657
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,560
but it's not.

1658
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
But they literally,

1659
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,320
but it isn't about that.

1660
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:52,200
It's not about that you,

1661
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,640
they tell you all that time,

1662
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,210
done this whole story on the
podcast several times though.

1663
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:57,310
We have ReGenX.

1664
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,580
Who was it that talked about it?

1665
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,073
Tom Score.

1666
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,490
Total whole story.

1667
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,810
All right.

1668
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,291
Not as,

1669
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:07,730
not as in within the
ASM as do you know what?

1670
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:08,540
Not Man,

1671
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,373
you're an entity.

1672
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,180
I feel like you've seen
him multiple times.

1673
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,014
I gotta be honest.

1674
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,710
I saw once,

1675
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,700
cause there's six parts,

1676
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,410
six hours,

1677
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,030
six hours straight is six hours here.

1678
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,380
Just go to the nuts dude.

1679
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,360
HPO fucking rules that HBO go.

1680
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,580
Hbo Go get the fuck you just called Pi.

1681
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,133
I,

1682
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,780
I'm not a big fan of old music at all.

1683
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,950
Frank Sinatra was like,

1684
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:29,380
I don't give a fuck about Frankston.

1685
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,263
I watched,

1686
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,530
did you watch that documentary?

1687
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:36,830
A big Frank Sinatra fan house war
fucking hat because his story,

1688
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,020
it's fucking God damn.

1689
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,500
He was huge.

1690
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,900
He got huge,

1691
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:45,540
really quick like in the
forties and was massive.

1692
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,980
Left his wife and two
kids married Ava Gardner,

1693
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:50,370
like the,

1694
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,740
like the Angela Angelina
Jolie at the time,

1695
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,610
as soon as he married her,

1696
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:55,140
his career went to shit.

1697
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,700
The labels dropped him.

1698
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,540
The movies he had no one wanted to
do movies with them cause he just,

1699
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,111
no,

1700
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:02,250
because it was just a new time.

1701
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:04,770
Elvis came in and it was
a new times are drunk too.

1702
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:05,670
He's fucking up.

1703
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,300
He was,

1704
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:06,631
he was,

1705
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:08,670
he was fucking everything.

1706
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,830
He was just a white self
sabotage a little bit.

1707
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:12,130
He was in the,

1708
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,580
in the early fifties he was washed up,

1709
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:14,821
dude,

1710
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:15,590
he was done.

1711
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,270
Ava Gardner is trying to
fucking get away from time.

1712
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,110
She's good.

1713
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,550
She's doing movies in Europe,

1714
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,300
trying to get away,

1715
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,060
and he's on plane
Stockinger and going after.

1716
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,020
And she,

1717
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,801
she loved him,

1718
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:26,910
but she was done with them.

1719
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,070
And so at the,

1720
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,660
he was rock bottom and he read
this script from here to eternity.

1721
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,630
I don't know how I got the script,

1722
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:34,090
but he,

1723
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,290
that was a part in from here to eternity
that he thought he could play a nail.

1724
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,790
And he begged the studio,

1725
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,140
please give me one more chance.

1726
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,003
I could do this.

1727
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,330
And then they didn't want to do it.

1728
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:43,600
So Ava Gardner calls it,

1729
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,820
puts the call in and says,

1730
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,990
just give him a shot.

1731
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:46,470
He put through,

1732
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,240
you know what he did for three grand?

1733
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:49,110
So he did it,

1734
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,620
dude.

1735
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,030
And while he was making the movie,

1736
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:53,410
everybody knew that the movie was
going to be big and then frank,

1737
00:45:53,411 --> 00:45:54,750
so I'm just going to make a big comeback.

1738
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,650
So with that heat,

1739
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,500
capitol records signed them
and gave them another chance.

1740
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,730
So the movie comes out,

1741
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:04,731
he went to the fucking Oscar and his
new album that came out fucking blew up.

1742
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,560
So now he's a hundred times
bigger than he's ever been.

1743
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,150
He's a monster.

1744
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,650
Start his own record company.

1745
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,180
Start his own movie company.

1746
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,830
Matt Hill saw anymore.

1747
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:16,810
I'll watch that story is just

1748
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,193
bravo.

1749
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,710
Do you see going clear watch ology Jesus.

1750
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,340
Yes.

1751
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:23,581
Yes.

1752
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:24,720
The science you see going clear.

1753
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,550
So I told you I read some of the book.

1754
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,200
That shit is insane.

1755
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,891
It's amazing.

1756
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,760
It's not talking about that.

1757
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:31,260
I don't want to get followed in shit.

1758
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:31,561
No,

1759
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:32,130
I'm sorry.

1760
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,311
No,

1761
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:37,311
I converted that and I
converted to Christianity is
way crazier than Scientology

1762
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,270
itself.

1763
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:43,270
Fucking girl on a bearded guy up in the
clouds or an alien that takes you out of

1764
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,480
a volcano.

1765
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,230
Yeah.

1766
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:46,770
What?

1767
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,220
It's,

1768
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,053
what's worse?

1769
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:53,010
What's worse is the guy who was obviously
mentally ill created this religion.

1770
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,040
Well obviously I think he was brilliant.

1771
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,483
There you go.

1772
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,040
You know he wrote more
books than anybody ever.

1773
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:02,963
Yeah.

1774
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,840
He would publish more books than
anybody knows how close they're so bad.

1775
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:08,040
You could write them in a day.

1776
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:08,880
That's why.

1777
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,290
Have you ever read battlefield earth?

1778
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:10,961
Absolutely.

1779
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,530
Another right shadow field
or and say that about LRA.

1780
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,543
Ooh,

1781
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,640
are you?

1782
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,920
If you look at the,

1783
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,000
if you watch the movie,

1784
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:18,690
it's,

1785
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,730
it's a fucking amazingly bad movie.

1786
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,730
It's a movie with John
Travolta and forest Whitaker.

1787
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:25,920
Forest Whitaker plays
giant alien John Travolta.

1788
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:26,640
It's,

1789
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:26,851
it's,

1790
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:27,330
so,

1791
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,260
it's the worst movie ever,

1792
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:29,050
right?

1793
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,070
It's not the story I've heard.

1794
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,330
It seems like a sketch and Saturday
night live like a parody of a really bad

1795
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,111
science fiction film.

1796
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:35,944
This is it.

1797
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,180
It's so bad.

1798
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,220
John Travolta defends it.

1799
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:40,060
How dare he,

1800
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,110
and this is all based on an
l Ron Hubbard book about,

1801
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,740
you know,

1802
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,760
alien invaders and do their saints from,

1803
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,980
she wants to get out,

1804
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,780
but they have too much dirt on them.

1805
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,650
Um,

1806
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,590
who says that this documentary,

1807
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,330
he can't get out now son.

1808
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,223
It's too late.

1809
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,850
You're too deep too,

1810
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,270
man.

1811
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,710
They scare me to convince.

1812
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,260
Confess all your shit and they record it.

1813
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:03,190
That's what they blackmail.

1814
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,390
That's how they get you Cruz's
balls deep in it allegedly.

1815
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,350
Yeah.

1816
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,370
It's also a gang.

1817
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,740
What Gang?

1818
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,360
They'll protect you.

1819
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,360
I had to pick a religion to be
totally 100% devoted to and be real.

1820
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,090
It would be Scientology.

1821
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,260
Fuck off.

1822
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,700
It would be.

1823
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,871
They,

1824
00:48:21,871 --> 00:48:22,041
well,

1825
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,680
they have a lot of the things you like
to know what they did this and killing

1826
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:25,060
people.

1827
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,141
No,

1828
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:25,310
no.

1829
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,050
But you know what?

1830
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,610
They real estate,

1831
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,720
the IRS make them after the IRS,

1832
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,990
all the Scientologists got together
because IRS was going to bury him for

1833
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:38,110
billions and billions of dollars
because of some back taxes.

1834
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:39,020
They weren't paying taxes.

1835
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:39,600
And they're saying,

1836
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,091
cause ever saying,

1837
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:40,211
hey,

1838
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:40,840
we're religion.

1839
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,381
Fuck you guys.

1840
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:41,831
Where religion,

1841
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:42,910
just like all your other religions.

1842
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,280
So the IRS said you will
not a fucking religion.

1843
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,860
This is not over that you
owe $5 billion in taxes.

1844
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,980
So what they decided to do is
they filed each one of them,

1845
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:51,940
all the Scientology.

1846
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,900
I'll filed lawsuits against the
IRS and went after different people

1847
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:56,650
individually.

1848
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,370
They all do.

1849
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,660
So they flooded them.

1850
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,350
So they're like,

1851
00:48:59,350 --> 00:48:59,951
oh shit,

1852
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:01,240
how do we make this shit go away?

1853
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,590
Just make us a religion,

1854
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,880
make a fucking year religion.

1855
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,590
And they need done some Worsley shit.

1856
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,430
That's,

1857
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,830
that's powerful and insane.

1858
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,970
But the guy that took over after he died,

1859
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,710
I forget his name is
Scott Bitch or something.

1860
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:12,790
It's like Tom Cruise.

1861
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,673
Ooh,

1862
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,740
that guy's intent and you see all this
shit that they wrote about all the people

1863
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:21,610
that were in going clear like
all the character assassinations.

1864
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,791
Oh,

1865
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:22,530
really?

1866
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,360
See CVC,

1867
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,250
Scientology response to going,

1868
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,450
oh,

1869
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,283
there's two.

1870
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:27,550
Sure.

1871
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,870
There's two sides to every story.

1872
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,370
I just want to make it really clear.

1873
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,840
If I had to pick a religion,

1874
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,790
I would pick Scientology and
that's all I'm going to say.

1875
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,343
You're crazy.

1876
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,940
You're fucking bad ass Tom
Cruise movie documentary though.

1877
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,590
Seems like it's a good one
to be in show business.

1878
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,460
Yes.

1879
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,270
Right.

1880
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,320
You get to hang out with Tom Cruise
and John Travolta dude from us 70 show.

1881
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,723
The guy with the frog.

1882
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,923
Jenna Elfman.

1883
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,890
Fuck yeah,

1884
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,723
there's a lot of cool.

1885
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,620
They party harm and Greg,

1886
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:54,783
they party hard.

1887
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,733
I thought I don't even drink.

1888
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,250
I thought that I don't drink.

1889
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:57,491
Ooh,

1890
00:49:57,491 --> 00:49:58,260
I didn't know that.

1891
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,600
Odd.

1892
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,433
Is that true?

1893
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:03,010
I heard they have savage
parties with sex parties.

1894
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,420
You know what?

1895
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:04,860
I don't.

1896
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,160
I know about Mormons.

1897
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,450
I might've made that up.

1898
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,440
I might be confused.

1899
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,550
Get my cults mixed up.

1900
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,360
I know.

1901
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,193
It's tough.

1902
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,350
They're all cult.

1903
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,993
I'm eating.

1904
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,410
Let's wrap this bitch up.

1905
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,040
Let's do it.

1906
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,850
Let's do it.

1907
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,530
We just did a four hour podcast.

1908
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:21,740
I'm Paul close to it.

1909
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,320
Right.

1910
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,800
I'm proud of you.

1911
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,540
Two guys showed awesome stamina down.

1912
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,530
We've got cardio to wrap this up.

1913
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,330
Mirko Cro cop is a bad motherfucker.

1914
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,403
Hell yeah.

1915
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,431
Mirko Cro,

1916
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,211
cop respect.

1917
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,980
That's one of the greatest
fights of all time right there.

1918
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:34,891
That was impressed.

1919
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:35,750
That's intense.

1920
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:36,410
Eddie.

1921
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,243
I was one of the greatest,

1922
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,740
come on come rematch.

1923
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,970
He's getting his ass kicked.

1924
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,780
We gave up on him.

1925
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,620
It was over.

1926
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,281
It was fucking,

1927
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:44,990
oh he mounted him.

1928
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,850
Why he's beaten.

1929
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,620
Mounted him twice.

1930
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,130
He cut them open in,

1931
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,410
in hindsight he should have went for
that arm more diligently and made,

1932
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:56,410
he should have finished
him for the amount of shit.

1933
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,990
You don't camp out on a mountain
and you finish the fight.

1934
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,030
The quickest way to finish the issues.

1935
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:02,301
Yeah.

1936
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:03,920
Cause that's what it happens a lot.

1937
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,840
It happens a lot more than you think.

1938
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,710
A guy amount of guy and then
the next round he gets knocked.

1939
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,740
What's next for Cro cop for?

1940
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:10,574
We had,

1941
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,090
um,

1942
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,811
I don't know man,

1943
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:13,720
but I think that's a good word.

1944
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:15,380
If he just goes on a revenge tour,

1945
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:15,861
he's like,

1946
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,120
I want to kill Brendan.

1947
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:18,860
Ooh.

1948
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,830
And he was going to go back to
the gym in here in two weeks.

1949
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,620
Yeah.

1950
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,160
He's fucked up.

1951
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,083
I don't know.

1952
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,660
Yeah,

1953
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,530
he did two weeks ago.

1954
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:28,480
I think it took some hits to the face.

1955
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,240
He decides to go out on that high note.

1956
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,340
I ain't going to hate him.

1957
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:34,850
Right.

1958
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:35,683
I hope he does.

1959
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,290
Right.

1960
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,360
Why not seem keep fighting until he loses.

1961
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,920
That's a great flight to go out of hell.

1962
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:40,754
Yeah.

1963
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,291
That's,

1964
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,560
that would be kind of a movie.

1965
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:43,400
That's a girl time.

1966
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,060
Great ending.

1967
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,570
Yeah.

1968
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,860
It's like a Clint Eastwood movie.

1969
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,580
Yup.

1970
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,091
And then boom,

1971
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:48,440
the credits were all right there.

1972
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,180
It's not going to happen that way.

1973
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:50,930
But yeah,

1974
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:51,763
I like it.

1975
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,000
The crazy thing is we didn't
totally given up on him.

1976
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:56,960
You know,

1977
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,850
when he was getting mounted
and he's getting beat up or it,

1978
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,230
Goddamn Gonzaga was just,

1979
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:01,430
his Jujitsu is too good.

1980
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,940
You know the name of your documentary?

1981
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,240
The name of the movie as good cop,

1982
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:05,601
Cro,

1983
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:06,434
cop.

1984
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,340
I'm not mad at that.

1985
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,423
All right.

1986
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,710
I'm just throwing that out there.

1987
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,640
Another documentary?

1988
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:12,703
No,

1989
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,190
come on.

1990
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,383
Give it up.

1991
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,021
How good.

1992
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:18,950
He's fucking pro bars.

1993
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:21,921
We don't even sell.

1994
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:22,754
All these songs

1995
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,010
are so fucking with him and I've
told people not to eat on camera.

1996
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,180
Wasn't he a policeman?

1997
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,440
He was a policeman.

1998
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:30,501
Oh,

1999
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:30,831
that's right.

2000
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:31,181
That's why it's,

2001
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:31,851
why call him Cro.

2002
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:32,684
Cop Cro.

2003
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,613
Cop.

2004
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:33,920
Well,

2005
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,960
he's anti,

2006
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:37,270
he's in the antiterrorist terrorism team.

2007
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:37,670
Yeah.

2008
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,510
And Croatia.

2009
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,550
And he's on government now.

2010
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,020
He's on the still pretty sure
that the fuck is he trained.

2011
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,440
I think you just kick shit nonstop.

2012
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,450
It's like iron sheik baby in a suit.

2013
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,480
Iron sheik documentaries.

2014
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,380
Amazing.

2015
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,720
Don't know that's on Netflix.

2016
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,300
So aren't,

2017
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:02,600
she'd done a documentary Jenks
the jinx on Hbo going clear.

2018
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,460
Hpl what was the other one lady?

2019
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:08,000
Valid frankly about Frank
Sinatra is a documentary.

2020
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:08,430
Yeah.

2021
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,263
What's that about?

2022
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,290
That's the navy seals.

2023
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:11,300
Seal turns.

2024
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,243
Lady vowel.

2025
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,260
You guys making documentaries out there?

2026
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:16,760
I fucking love documentaries.

2027
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:17,301
Joe Loves Him.

2028
00:53:17,301 --> 00:53:18,500
Everybody loves documentaries.

2029
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,940
You got the title.

2030
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:21,650
Has to tell you what the
documentary is about.

2031
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:24,620
Don't get all artsy cause
I don't have time to go.

2032
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,560
I'm just flipping through
documentaries man.

2033
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:26,971
And I'm like,

2034
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:27,721
that could be great.

2035
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:28,531
I don't know what it's about,

2036
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:29,370
but I don't have time.

2037
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:29,620
Right.

2038
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,211
That looks great.

2039
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,070
I don't have time to go to the info.

2040
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,260
It's got to tell you right
there what it's about.

2041
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,640
I mean Lady Val is pretty cut and dry.

2042
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,580
I went past that a couple times up

2043
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,610
the we documentaries.

2044
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,301
You know it's a,

2045
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:49,134
we document.

2046
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,010
Roger.

2047
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:50,843
Hi.

2048
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,570
Hi.

2049
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,800
Hi Business or what does that other one?

2050
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,830
Something business.

2051
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:56,500
I don't know.

2052
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,370
We'd business in those in those.

2053
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,150
Uh,

2054
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,680
for some reason the we documentaries,

2055
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:02,850
you know it's a weed though.

2056
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,753
There's just like a big,

2057
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,700
well the union union was a little weird.

2058
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:06,810
It had a big leaf though.

2059
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:07,381
Yeah.

2060
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:09,480
He can always tell the leaf
this gotta be something.

2061
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,180
Don't get all crazy with zero more
recognizable symbol that a company,

2062
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,370
a company didn't create.

2063
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:15,150
Then the leaf.

2064
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:15,700
Yeah,

2065
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,180
that'll pop.

2066
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:16,951
And he didn't cry.

2067
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:18,180
He didn't create the pot.

2068
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,620
Leaf is not like Coca Cola.

2069
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,970
Anybody could use the pile leaf,

2070
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,890
but is there a more
recognizable symbol that the,

2071
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,700
that of the government or
a company didn't create?

2072
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,580
How about that upside down pot leaf that,

2073
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:29,700
that's pretty good.

2074
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,330
Um,

2075
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:30,850
uh,

2076
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,060
tied McCormick cheeses.

2077
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,800
You notice that he does the leaf,

2078
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,591
the leaf one,

2079
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:35,101
the regular one.

2080
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:35,550
It's,

2081
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,650
he does it upside down like
that and it's pretty damn cool.

2082
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:38,071
It looks cool.

2083
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:38,904
UPS It out.

2084
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,863
Yeah.

2085
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,293
It's cool.

2086
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,570
It's still pot leaf.

2087
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,200
You can't,

2088
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,070
you can't mistake it.

2089
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:45,190
I can't think of anything more.

2090
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,120
Plenty of another iconic shape.

2091
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,653
I'm going to smoke weed.

2092
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,691
I don't smoke.

2093
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:52,830
I'm just worried about my lungs.

2094
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,340
Man.

2095
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,740
What have you found out that
it's good for your lungs?

2096
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,200
If you did,

2097
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,660
what if he did?

2098
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:57,990
What did it,

2099
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,880
what if there was some evidence
that you could read and said,

2100
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:00,601
Oh shit.

2101
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:01,650
And actually cleans your lungs.

2102
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,650
You just fucked up and went into a dark
hole of Eddie Bravo talking to you about

2103
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:05,070
pot.

2104
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:05,940
I'm just curious.

2105
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:07,800
You didn't even understand what
you're about to experience.

2106
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:07,951
Well,

2107
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:08,161
no,

2108
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,770
but I'll kill it right here
if the UFC sanctions it.

2109
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:11,400
Yeah,

2110
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:11,700
yeah.

2111
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:11,960
Oh,

2112
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,451
that's right.

2113
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:12,811
That's right.

2114
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:14,520
You're have one day

2115
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,330
going shit before the UFC.

2116
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,813
Really?

2117
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,850
It helps head trauma that
kind of fell smoking.

2118
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,350
Oh Damn.

2119
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,080
Because they see the benefits
from these concussed dudes.

2120
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:28,810
All right,

2121
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:29,643
