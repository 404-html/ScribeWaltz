1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,093
Yeah,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,873
yeah,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,033
yeah.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,893
Hey everybody.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,370
It's Joe Rogan and this is my podcast and
this is the new way I'm going to do my

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,450
commercial now because I can't keep
saying it the same fucking way,

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,140
but it turns into a regular way.

8
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:23,801
Halfway through it.

9
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:23,850
I,

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,600
somewhere along the line I give up.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,780
I always give up.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,970
Our podcast is sponsored by on it,

13
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,350
which is essentially a,

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,581
a,

15
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,690
a vitamin supplement and fitness company.

16
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,410
Uh,

17
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,310
it's a company that,

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,000
uh,

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,110
I am a part of.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,520
I own a part of the company.

21
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,810
The reason being that,

22
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:39,110
uh,

23
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,250
I got involved in it and I believe in
the ethics of the company and I believe

24
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,084
what they're selling,

25
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,490
we are selling the best quality nutrients.

26
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,310
Some of them are nootropics,

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,190
some of them are sports
exercise ones like shroom tech,

28
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:53,800
sport Alpha brain is the,

29
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:53,891
uh,

30
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:55,280
the famous nootropic one.

31
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,810
We also sell hemp protein
powder with Maca and raw cocoa.

32
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,820
It's fucking fantastic stuff.

33
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,070
Kettle bells and battle ropes.

34
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,310
It's all essentially fitness and like
lifestyle and health supplements and a,

35
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,260
it's all stuff that I believe in.

36
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,670
It's all stuff that I've
always been taking like long
before I ever got involved

37
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:17,504
in this company.

38
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,381
So,

39
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,130
um,

40
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,641
if you,

41
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:19,851
uh,

42
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:20,840
if you're interested in it,

43
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,280
if you're interested in nootropics,

44
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,570
a very controversial area.

45
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:23,841
Good.

46
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:24,410
I want you to go,

47
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,860
just go to Google and just Google
the word nootropics and Oh,

48
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,300
tro pic.

49
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,600
It's all about supplementation to
enhance your brain's ability to produce

50
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,690
neurotransmitters.

51
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,760
It's all very complicated stuff.

52
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:42,170
And fucking I need a retard like me
should not be really talking about it

53
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,790
because I don't really
know what I'm saying.

54
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,241
You know what I'm saying?

55
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm just like repeating
scientific shit that,

56
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,410
but I believe that if you believe in it,

57
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,700
I actually would take
that to heart because you,

58
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,360
you actually don't really,

59
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:53,571
I mean,

60
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:53,901
I don't know.

61
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:54,530
You're fine,

62
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,210
but you don't seem like
you need a lot of money.

63
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,170
You are on a network hosted in
network TV show for a lot of years.

64
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,540
You were a star talk radio,

65
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,770
news radio and everything.

66
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,610
I'm also an idiot.

67
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,660
I could've spent that money.

68
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,940
I could've right through that shit.

69
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,720
Yeah.

70
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,980
He's got Gold Buddhas.

71
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,550
I would never get involved with
anything that I don't believe in.

72
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,330
I just wouldn't,

73
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,163
I don't have,

74
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,970
I don't have another life to live.

75
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,090
Just I've got one and while
I'm already ahead and I'm,

76
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,810
you know,

77
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,381
I'm not,

78
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:23,830
uh,

79
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,470
I'm not worried about paying my
bills and everything's going well.

80
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,040
The last thing on overdue is get involved
in anything that I didn't really,

81
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,190
that's not true though because I did
do fear factor again for another term.

82
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,751
But you've got to really,

83
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:39,751
I really liked those guys and I worked
with does produce and I would be sick if

84
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,190
I saw somebody else doing it.

85
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,660
I really would have that even
though that show was retarded.

86
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:44,530
That was my baby.

87
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,900
I did 148 of those fucking things.

88
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,553
Um,

89
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,290
but uh,

90
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,360
there's no way I would be involved in a
compliment company unless I believed in

91
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:53,980
it and everything that we sell it on,

92
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:57,040
it was all stuff that I use in my daily
life that I've talked about long before

93
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,840
I got involved in this company especially,

94
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,900
which I feel are the,

95
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:01,870
the best,

96
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,773
uh,

97
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,480
as far as like strength and conditioning.

98
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,950
If I had to pick one exercise,

99
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,000
I think kettlebells is like the best
piece of exercise equipment that you can

100
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,480
have.

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,350
It's like a cannon ball
that's got a handle on it and
it's all about controlling

102
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,560
this fucking cannon ball and they
come in a bunch of different sizes.

103
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,080
I use sometimes as light is 35 pounds,

104
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,190
sometimes 50 pounds,

105
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:26,191
sometimes 70 pounds and they give you
amazing workouts to rectally apply to

106
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,640
Jujitsu for me,

107
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,890
but for any athletic endeavor where you
would have realized on explosiveness and

108
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:36,700
and and muscle power and it's all
exercises that make your body move as one

109
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:40,900
complete unit as opposed to like isolation
exercises was a lot of people do at

110
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,231
the gym.

111
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,250
When you see them lifting weights,

112
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,350
this is something where your entire body,

113
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,440
like there's things called Turkish
getups will you hold this weight up,

114
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:51,400
your mind and your back and
then you slowly and controlled
the stand all the way

115
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,070
up to your feet and then bring
it all the way back down.

116
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,200
It's a really odd thing you would think,

117
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:01,180
but it's really applicable for like
strength and fitness in real world.

118
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,970
A athletic pursuits and even
just for picking shit up,

119
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,070
and even if just for having a strong body,

120
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,610
it's better to have a strong body
than a weak ass bitch body there.

121
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,444
I said it

122
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,253
all right.

123
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,900
Unless you date like
girls are like bisexual,

124
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,280
they tend to like the bitch body.

125
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,114
Look,

126
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,180
Dave really liked that too.

127
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:19,040
For or bisexual.

128
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:19,560
They're like,

129
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
like a guy that's not guy like,

130
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,310
right.

131
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,310
That's too much of a gamble.

132
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,200
I secret.

133
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,381
Yeah.

134
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,350
G's going to gamble for a niche market.

135
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,771
I see.

136
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,510
You could probably get them
anyway if you bulked up,

137
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,693
Eh,

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,633
I don't know.

139
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,720
Anyway,

140
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,970
if supplements go to go to on a.com,

141
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:39,080
use the code name Brogan and you will
save 10% off any and all the supplements,

142
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,680
um,

143
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,030
the kettle bells in the battle ropes,

144
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,030
that shit does not work on.

145
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,700
We saw them as cheap as we can in there.

146
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,300
You know,

147
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,230
especially with the kettle bells,

148
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:46,011
it's very difficult.

149
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:47,900
It's like you're sending
cannon balls through the mail,

150
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,370
but there is durables.

151
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:49,701
Fuck.

152
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,660
And there'll be here forever.

153
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,021
All right.

154
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:51,350
That's it.

155
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,910
Mike Birbiglia is here.

156
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,450
Birbiglia excuse me,

157
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,811
Mike.

158
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:57,644
Birbiglia

159
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,493
fucking house.

160
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,843
Try my day.

161
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,040
Joe Rogan podcast.

162
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,903
My all,

163
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,450
sorry.

164
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,320
Commercials are brutal.

165
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
Okay.

166
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,741
Interesting.

167
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:13,220
To me though,

168
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,830
it's like something that I've not,

169
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,440
I've never investigated.

170
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,680
I've always just kept at arm's distance
that kind of neutral the nutrients and

171
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,340
the vitamins and things like that.

172
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,000
I've just had,

173
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,110
I don't understand it.

174
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,070
I'm not going to go near it.

175
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:31,070
But you and I've listened
and watched this podcast.

176
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,890
You seem to know a good bit about it.

177
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,461
Well,

178
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:34,791
um,

179
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,870
I know my,

180
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,070
from my personal experience,

181
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,350
it makes a big difference for me.

182
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,990
What I eat,

183
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,860
if I like,

184
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,560
if I really concentrated on
like the most important thing,

185
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,230
I think a is nutrients from food.

186
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,400
That's the most important thing.

187
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:50,480
You've got to eat healthy food and then
supplementation on top of that you have

188
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:51,440
to have the actual news.

189
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:52,790
So what'd you eat for lunch today?

190
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:53,720
Uh,

191
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,700
this morning I had a hemp protein shake.

192
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,020
I only ate once,

193
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,980
just had a hemp protein

194
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,100
shake with a banana,

195
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,930
banana,

196
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,250
coconut oil and I had two
cigarettes and coconut water.

197
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,181
Yeah,

198
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:05,451
no,

199
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:05,631
I,

200
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,380
I don't eat,

201
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,850
I don't need heavy in the mornings.

202
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,290
A really light in the morning and you
should use to just have a shake or have a

203
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,124
Kale shake.

204
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,500
That's my most common thing that I have.

205
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,071
I'm just,

206
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,630
if I'm lazy or if I'm
running out the door,

207
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,530
I don't have time to make it,

208
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,270
but it takes a few minutes to make.

209
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:20,511
It's,

210
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:24,920
I have to clean the Kale and clean celery
and cucumbers and then I take chunks

211
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:29,420
of ginger and raw garlic and
it was a thing called day fuck.

212
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,860
What was the name of the blender?

213
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,600
It's this bad ass blender,

214
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,210
but it's specifically
designed for this purpose.

215
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,730
It's got like a plunger and
you shove everything in there.

216
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,490
Vitamix.

217
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,171
But Vitamix.

218
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:39,740
Yes.

219
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,161
That is it.

220
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:40,850
Thank you.

221
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,470
And uh,

222
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:41,690
it,

223
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,770
it fucking whips it down to
like a drinkable consistency.

224
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,980
He put like pineapple in it
to make it taste good and uh,

225
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,420
it's fucking great man.

226
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,010
It doesn't taste that good.

227
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,720
But for your body it's great.

228
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,291
You know,

229
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,500
it gives you just like this
charge of like good stuff.

230
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,160
It's like your body knows it's got
all these nutrients to work with,

231
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,370
but isn't this inherent
contradiction with,

232
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,280
cause I know that you're,

233
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,871
you know,

234
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,720
you do the ultimate fighting,

235
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,440
uh,

236
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,100
stuff.

237
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,730
Yeah.

238
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,331
Is that what it is?

239
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,180
Ultimately it's called the
ultimate fighting championship,

240
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,390
but that seems to be people murdering
people like other people slamming all,

241
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:24,050
you're making it so that your
health is no longer a possibility.

242
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,200
You can look at it that way and
then that is certainly part of it,

243
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:27,830
but it would,

244
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,700
it also is,

245
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:33,260
is competition in the highest
and most dramatic form.

246
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,770
Sure.

247
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,380
That a human being can see other than war.

248
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,711
Right.

249
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,670
The way the Olympics is.

250
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:37,851
I mean,

251
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,580
it's not that healthiest thing
to be an Olympic gymnast.

252
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:40,881
Yeah.

253
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:41,390
Maybe.

254
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,990
But this is even worse because this
is another person dominating you.

255
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,770
You know,

256
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,400
the idea of losing and gymnastics is,

257
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,951
you know,

258
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm sure a cruel bitch after years and
years of practice and you slip when you

259
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:53,594
land,

260
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,430
but it's nothing like
getting your ass kicked.

261
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,880
Yeah.

262
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,600
There's nothing like getting just the
fuck beat out of you in front of the

263
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:00,230
world.

264
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,230
And there's the emotions that are involved
in of control to where the place to

265
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,910
look is to look at the very,

266
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:09,200
very best guys.

267
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,200
If you look at the very like
the guys like Anderson Silva,

268
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,590
you know,

269
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,340
he's this insanely good fighter.

270
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,420
It's insanely good,

271
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,370
but such a nice guy,

272
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,140
like a sweetheart of a guy,

273
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,420
always laughing and always joking.

274
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,580
He's just controlled all of his demons
and all of his bullshit with like the

275
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,010
most intense form of competition,

276
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,210
physically available.

277
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,660
This is a lot going on
that people don't see.

278
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,730
They see people just
kicking people's asses.

279
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,460
It's not just that there's,

280
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:44,000
there's a whole side to like the killer.

281
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:44,660
We are,

282
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm not even kidding.

283
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,300
I swear people will say I'm from,

284
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,390
you're from worse bags is,

285
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,650
I think there was a gig there.

286
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,060
I think that's why I'm remembering it.

287
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,260
I think it was one of
those Boston comedy gigs.

288
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,340
Did you ever work for Boston

289
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,150
comedy?

290
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,890
Oh yeah.

291
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,310
Yeah,

292
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,143
yeah,

293
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,560
yes.

294
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:01,921
Yeah.

295
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,550
Yeah.

296
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,120
I grew up driving by the [inaudible]
cuckoo where it would say comedy night and

297
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:06,781
yeah.

298
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,531
Was that a little,

299
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:08,364
how many stop?

300
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,213
Yeah.

301
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,810
Is it still in Nick's comedy star?

302
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,700
I don't know actually.

303
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,710
And then there's the
giggles out there and saw,

304
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,703
that's Mike Clark.

305
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,070
Great Pizza Place.

306
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,410
Oh yeah.

307
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,280
Pizza's great.

308
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,310
And it's right next door.

309
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,991
She sits pizzas.

310
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:22,824
Very underrated.

311
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,791
Very underrated.

312
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,630
It's Greek pizza.

313
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,680
It's good giggles.

314
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,730
Was a great gig.

315
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,470
Mike Clark is Linny Clark's brother.

316
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,323
Yeah.

317
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,450
Fucking great.

318
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,051
Nice guy.

319
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:31,410
Yeah,

320
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,250
he's the best.

321
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,630
But we had three in my town,

322
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,110
Shrewsbury.

323
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,220
Very small town.

324
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,083
We had,

325
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,550
I had four pizzerias within a half mile.

326
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,900
Shewsbury pizzeria,

327
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:40,391
village B,

328
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:40,531
three,

329
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:41,940
a dean park and white city.

330
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,470
I thought that Massachusetts piece,

331
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,540
it was really good until
I moved back to New York.

332
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,930
And then I had to realize there's
a few places like in Yonkers,

333
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,300
there's a place in White Plains,

334
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,190
Nicky's Nicky's pizzeria.

335
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,000
They have a white pizza
that it's so fucking good.

336
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,863
I got to check.

337
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,030
How come they can't
make this anywhere else?

338
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,770
Like why is this not in California?

339
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,731
There's a,

340
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:03,340
we have a,

341
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,173
in our,

342
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,850
in my movie sleepwalk with me,

343
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,661
the,

344
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:11,010
there's a pizza pillow is
a pillow made of pizza,

345
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,851
uh,

346
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:12,601
as a prop.

347
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,220
And it was done by Roberta's,

348
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,170
which is in Brooklyn and is fantastic.

349
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,240
Checkout Roberta's if you can.

350
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,421
Yeah,

351
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,580
there's some like legit old school,

352
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,960
New York pizzerias.

353
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:24,570
It just can't be fucked
with their artisans.

354
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,730
Arturo's on Houseton it's like that.

355
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,020
There's a lot of them,

356
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,210
a lot of them.

357
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,840
If there was a cause like that,

358
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,490
I just remember a place in Yonkers,

359
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,870
I don't even remember the name of it,

360
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:35,880
but my friend used to know like the,

361
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:36,714
it was like his,

362
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,390
his buddy's dad bran it for,

363
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:39,930
you know,

364
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,240
a hundred years and uh,

365
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,910
it just was ridiculously good.

366
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,720
Thin crust pizza or it's like
this is just some weird place.

367
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,920
Like you look on the outside,

368
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:50,730
this is right.

369
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,350
If everybody knew about this,

370
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,930
it'd be a fucking mile long line.

371
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:57,000
I mean you go to that pink's hot dogs.

372
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,380
Isn't that the craziest
thing you've ever seen?

373
00:10:59,381 --> 00:10:59,610
Yeah.

374
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,610
Cause they cook the hot dogs
at night or outside rather.

375
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,760
It's just this giant line of people
who are basically waiting to get,

376
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:07,410
I'm very mediocre hot dog.

377
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,273
Yeah.

378
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,293
But this pizza,

379
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,590
I love that phrase.

380
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,180
If everybody knew about it,

381
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,341
that's like,

382
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,040
that's like the thing that
they say in advertising rooms.

383
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,680
Like if we could just get
everyone to know about,

384
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,320
there's some shit like that
that just sneaks through.

385
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,380
Like we all know comics like
that that have just snow.

386
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:25,660
Yeah.

387
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,670
If everybody knew.

388
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,590
Yeah.

389
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,870
Yeah.

390
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,380
No for,

391
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,890
I mean,

392
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,840
who knows yours?

393
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,900
No,

394
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,280
Brian Holtzman for sure.

395
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,791
No doubt.

396
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,570
Brian holds right.

397
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,830
Holtzmann has made me laugh
harder saying inappropriate,

398
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,320
ridiculously inappropriate
shit than anyone.

399
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:40,471
Well,

400
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,221
that's how I feel.

401
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:44,940
I mean I'm talking about somebody talking
about Brody starting to get a little

402
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:45,774
famous though.

403
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,290
A lot of people know Brody now.

404
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,570
I'm talking about something pretty famous,

405
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,250
but,

406
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,230
but I feel like Stan hope it's like
that to that extent where it's like,

407
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:53,381
yeah,

408
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,070
he's very famous.

409
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,970
He has a big following,

410
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,670
but like if people saw live his,

411
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,560
his 90 minutes he puts on it,

412
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,493
people would be like,

413
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,740
oh,

414
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,390
that's the best comedian alive.

415
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,740
Yeah,

416
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,860
he's doing what I love
to watch as a comedian,

417
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,920
as a comedian.

418
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,550
He was like in me and I had
a conversation about it too.

419
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:13,050
It's like one of the things,

420
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,220
as you get older,

421
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:19,080
you really appreciate guys that are
still doing real fucking comedy.

422
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,840
There's still saying
what they really think.

423
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,674
Yeah.

424
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,150
So because somewhere along the line,

425
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:24,331
I mean,

426
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:24,481
we,

427
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:24,870
we're not,

428
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,890
we're not naming names,

429
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,953
but another one,

430
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,980
he's the one who told me to come here.

431
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,040
Anyway,

432
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,030
we're at the comedy cellar.

433
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:33,160
We were talking about
podcasts and he goes,

434
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,840
have you ever listened to Rogan's podcast?

435
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:35,111
And I go,

436
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:35,291
no.

437
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:35,830
He goes,

438
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,670
it's incredible.

439
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,091
You got to,

440
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:37,841
you got to go on.

441
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,674
It's incredible.

442
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,380
And so then I started listening to it
and then I just dropped you a note.

443
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:41,941
Oh,

444
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:42,631
that's awesome.

445
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:45,500
I Love Norton Norton and I
went to see dice in Vegas.

446
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,010
We went and sat in the audience,

447
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,860
Norton and I and Bobby
Kelly and Brian and uh,

448
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,491
Anthony Cool.

449
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:52,170
Mia and Sam Roberts.

450
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,004
We all went there,

451
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
drove a big fucking limo together.

452
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,131
We all had dinner.

453
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,600
It was like a gentleman's night is great.

454
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,240
It was fun.

455
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,170
We ate a steak house and
then we all went to a show.

456
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,660
That's fine.

457
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,070
Oh yeah.

458
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,180
Well,

459
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,340
yeah,

460
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,173
I did that with me.

461
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,691
Yeah,

462
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:04,380
I did that.

463
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,380
I'm going to counter that with a
much a Dorky or version of that,

464
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,081
which is,

465
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:10,440
uh,

466
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,640
my wife and I,

467
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,893
uh,

468
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,430
my wife and I and Ira Glass who
co wrote my film and his wife,

469
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,870
the four of us went to see Stan hope
at Caroline's comedy showing cause it's

470
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,060
cause Ira had never seen Stan hope.

471
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:24,441
And I was like,

472
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:25,590
he got to see this guy.

473
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,670
There's nothing like him.

474
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,151
Yeah.

475
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:27,780
I loved,

476
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,613
I loved dog.

477
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,880
And then of course Doug,

478
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,560
when he finds out IRA's there,

479
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,670
makes fun of IRA,

480
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:35,460
makes fun of public radio
for like 15 minutes.

481
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,150
And uh,

482
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,250
and I was like,

483
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:38,610
Ha,

484
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,443
you know,

485
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,360
becoming about me.

486
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,010
I just want to go see
a show or listen man,

487
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,350
if you're on national public radio,

488
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:46,131
it becomes about you,

489
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:48,380
you a few in your room
if you were in the room.

490
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:48,960
It's just,

491
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,300
that is a silly topic.

492
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,600
They do not have loved
to have any emotions.

493
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,540
Everything has to be
talking about it like this.

494
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,010
Completely unreasonable.

495
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,520
But Irish shows incredible.

496
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,331
It's very different.

497
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:01,860
Is it different this American life?

498
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,700
Have you ever listened to it?

499
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,390
Never.

500
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,810
Oh,

501
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,610
you'd love it.

502
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,750
Really is incredible.

503
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,584
It is.

504
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,740
Aye.

505
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,060
Aye.

506
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,720
It's funny,

507
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,780
I've never had to sell it to anybody
before because people will listen to it so

508
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:13,051
much,

509
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,340
but like it's like,

510
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:14,640
um,

511
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,130
I've seen it in the
radio [inaudible] radio.

512
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,270
It's a,

513
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,790
it's a weekly radio documentary.

514
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,670
Imagine your favorite film documentary
and take that to radio and it's,

515
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:26,940
it's incredible what they do.

516
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:28,320
It's like a fucking miracle.

517
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,270
It's a fucking miracle.

518
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:30,930
You wouldn't,

519
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,580
you personally would love it,

520
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:32,941
dude.

521
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,081
I'm,

522
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:33,914
I'm on it.

523
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm on it.

524
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,370
I'll get on it today.

525
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,050
[inaudible] dot com
you should go on there.

526
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,210
Did you go on their website?

527
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm saying look at like,

528
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,690
they have like a list of like
these are the legendary episodes,

529
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,540
the gateway drug gateway
drug of this American life.

530
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:46,900
Yeah.

531
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:46,990
Oh,

532
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,010
that's a good idea.

533
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,810
And say I like the episodes
that you guys should have that.

534
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,593
Yeah,

535
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,630
I'm lazy dude.

536
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,490
Where are you on that?

537
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,430
Where are you guys on that?

538
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,780
What's that?

539
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,730
We just put them up there,

540
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,560
but this is a lot of websites.

541
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:01,394
It's sort them out.

542
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,560
We can only do so much,

543
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,650
but you can only sit behind.

544
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,430
We're doing like three and
four of these a week sometimes.

545
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:08,661
Yeah.

546
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,710
Lately it's been for,

547
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,310
you know,

548
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,881
like we do,

549
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:11,714
like we did,

550
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,780
we're doing three together and I
did one yesterday with Brian Cowen,

551
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,560
just me and Brian and Paul
[inaudible] is another one,

552
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:19,340
by the way.

553
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,791
Comedian,

554
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,990
you might not know,

555
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,340
but it's fucking hilarious.

556
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:22,821
Hilarious.

557
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,654
Ridiculous.

558
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,141
Yeah.

559
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,690
He came over my house last night
and we had a little family barbecue.

560
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:27,370
It was fun.

561
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,203
Yeah,

562
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,180
he's nice.

563
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,830
He's just such a silly boy.

564
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,430
Yeah,

565
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,263
absolutely.

566
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,620
He's so fucking silly.

567
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,790
He's such a fun dude.

568
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,231
And Norton,

569
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:37,010
if people know,

570
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,940
I love that phrase.

571
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,010
If people knew about this,

572
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,380
Norton is a a guy,

573
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,200
even though everybody knows it
from the opie and Anthony Show,

574
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,900
and there's not enough people that know
how funny he has a standard stand up.

575
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,570
I saw him in Austin,

576
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,790
I was in town doing a UFC and I just,

577
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,050
I,

578
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,271
you know,

579
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:53,810
another thing,

580
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,940
I got a chance to just
sit down and watch a gig.

581
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,451
Oh yeah.

582
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:56,781
It was really,

583
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,520
it's really fun.

584
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,040
It's fun.

585
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,640
Yeah.

586
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,530
And especially if it's a guy like Norton.

587
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,570
He made me change my act a little bit.

588
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,070
Really?

589
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,370
Yeah.

590
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:03,650
Yeah.

591
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,170
Because I realized I was
doing a lot too long sets.

592
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,621
I like,

593
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:06,821
I did,

594
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:10,040
I wanted to do like these really long
sets because I didn't want anybody to feel

595
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,180
like they didn't get their money's worth.

596
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,450
But Norton did like an hour
and just fucking laid it down.

597
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,191
And I was like,

598
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:19,910
you know what I mean,

599
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,290
maybe that's a better thing.

600
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:21,710
Maybe.

601
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,240
So I cut my sets down from like an hour
and a half plus to like an hour and 10

602
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:30,320
minutes because I feel like nobody talk
for more than an hour and 10 minutes.

603
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:30,950
Man.

604
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,110
When I started working the door,

605
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,880
I started out working the
door at the DC improv.

606
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,350
And what does that,

607
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,670
that's his stupid clock.

608
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:41,781
Yeah,

609
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,060
he's going to fucking cat clock.

610
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,251
No,

611
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,300
that's not a distraction,

612
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,134
dude.

613
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,653
You're right.

614
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,210
Nobody has shown the door
at the DC Improv and it was,

615
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:52,730
and it was really like comedy
college cause I was opening for like,

616
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,210
you know,

617
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,680
every week you're like Jake Johansen,

618
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,550
Brian Regan,

619
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:55,691
right.

620
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:56,524
You know,

621
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,470
Mitch Hedberg,

622
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,400
Dave a towel,

623
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:58,761
you know,

624
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,594
and uh,

625
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,060
and Pablo Francisco.

626
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,380
Oh,

627
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,160
that's a lesson in comedy.

628
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,210
You watch him.

629
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:05,721
He's another,

630
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,800
if people knew about it.

631
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,131
Yeah.

632
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:10,910
What up alive Pablo Francisco
shows like he does back then,

633
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,360
at least the week I opened
farm did 45 minutes,

634
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,660
blew the doors off the room
in a way that I never seen.

635
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,670
Like I've never seen anything like that.

636
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,830
Pablo doesn't just do a comedy show.

637
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:26,810
It's like a multimedia presentation.

638
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,740
It's because he can make so many crazy
noises with his mouth and he has so many

639
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,080
nutty impressions of people.

640
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,680
It's like a multimedia
presentation sometimes.

641
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,810
He's somebody who if you,

642
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,530
if he really opened up and,

643
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,380
and did some personal stuff combined with
the talent that he has with the noises

644
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:45,960
and the sounds,

645
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,410
everything,

646
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,390
I don't think he can.

647
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,931
Oh Wow.

648
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,070
Would that be a good show?

649
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,411
Yeah.

650
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,130
It would be a very

651
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,760
good show.

652
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,593
Be something else.

653
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:51,721
Yeah.

654
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,950
He's a great guy too.

655
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,140
Probably my sisters.

656
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,660
That's one of the coolest things about
comedy is that a lot of people like

657
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,390
assume that every comic
has fucked up and that,

658
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,860
you know,

659
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,100
so many of them are antisocial and
depressed and I don't find that to be the

660
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:05,491
case.

661
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,450
I find to be the case.

662
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:06,640
It's like,

663
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,740
well,

664
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,370
there's a lot of funny guys like
Stan Hope they're fun to be around.

665
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,510
They're nice guys.

666
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,320
I love what Stan Hope said when there
was that whole comedy school debate

667
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:17,920
happening.

668
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,341
Oh yeah,

669
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:18,800
yeah.

670
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,790
I'll see something.

671
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,340
And just that he's going to have a
free one and in bids be their lives.

672
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,050
I just love that he's just like,

673
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:29,020
everybody's just show up
just to bring some drinks.

674
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,213
Like Stan hopes,

675
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,581
all things.

676
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,680
Just like you learn about comedy,

677
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,970
like offering the comedian you're
opening for drinks after the show.

678
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,230
Just asking questions.

679
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,700
That is a better way to learn.

680
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,840
I think that's how I learned.

681
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,510
I um,

682
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,260
I have a real problem with a comedy
classes that are taught by people or non

683
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:45,951
comedians.

684
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:47,600
I've seen that and I'm like,

685
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,770
that's just craziness.

686
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,420
That's like,

687
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,680
that doesn't even make sense.

688
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,620
That's like English speaking taught
by people who don't speak English,

689
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:54,771
like,

690
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:55,100
yeah,

691
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,851
if you don't,

692
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:58,200
if you haven't actually
done standup and you,

693
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,080
you have to do it for years,

694
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:00,471
he'd have to,

695
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:04,370
you have to get your dick kicked
into the dirt numerous occasions,

696
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:04,920
you know?

697
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,753
I mean,

698
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,720
don't you think that
made you as a comedian,

699
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,540
really tough sets in the beginning he
kind of realized what you got to do to

700
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,170
fix.

701
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:12,261
Yeah.

702
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,000
That's what my entire movie is about.

703
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,670
Just about just failure,

704
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,300
failure and failure and
then finding at the end,

705
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,134
the movie,

706
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,900
the character has just kind of want,

707
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,230
you see one sequence of,

708
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:24,441
oh,

709
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:26,480
this guy's going to figure it out.

710
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,003
Eventually.

711
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,880
I think we all like started off terrible.

712
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,390
I don't,

713
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,400
I've never met anybody
that started off good.

714
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,871
No,

715
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,470
I think it's a,

716
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,981
for me,

717
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:38,491
like I worked,

718
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,600
I always tell people I'll,

719
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,420
comedians or PR people
want to be Comedians,

720
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,360
get a job at a comedy club.

721
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,310
I worked at the DC Improv at the door
and then after I punched out from making

722
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:51,210
minimum wage,

723
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,510
I got to watch the show
for free and that's,

724
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,530
that's what you need.

725
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,940
You just need to see comedians over and
over and over again and go eventually

726
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:00,091
go,

727
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:00,451
okay,

728
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:00,810
I can,

729
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,220
I can do something like that.

730
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,660
It's a weird thing when you figure that
when you start to realize that it's a

731
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:07,650
craft,

732
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,120
but that yours is mine.

733
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,080
It seems like it's kind of
similar to other people's,

734
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,190
but it's not.

735
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:14,401
It's,

736
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:18,840
it's your weird take on shit and you
got to find out what the fuck that is.

737
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:23,610
You got to find the silly find the
preposterous Yassic so long man.

738
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,410
And you'd get conflicted and you
don't know if you're being foolish.

739
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:27,841
Shit,

740
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:28,900
am I being is,

741
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,410
is this an effected attitude
that I'm putting on?

742
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:32,244
Is it obvious?

743
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:32,541
Yeah.

744
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,321
When I was starting out,

745
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:34,770
I was totally putting on an athlete.

746
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,610
I hate that because it's so embarrassing.

747
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,940
It is embarrassing because
I looked back on those sets.

748
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,091
Well,

749
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:41,241
no,

750
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,021
cause I was in,

751
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:43,010
everybody does though.

752
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:43,281
I mean,

753
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:47,080
I even like Geraldo was one of my
favorite comedians of all time and was a

754
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,780
friend of mine and like he even said like,

755
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,070
he's like when I started
out like my first TV sets,

756
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:55,510
I sounded like Dave Attell.

757
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,400
I was on TV sounding like somebody else

758
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,150
before I figured out who I was.

759
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:00,901
And then he,

760
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:01,201
I mean,

761
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,420
I think Geraldo is one
of the great comics,

762
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,710
but like for me it was just,

763
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,030
I sounded like it sounded like Steven,

764
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,550
right.

765
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,383
Want to start out.

766
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,280
Then I sounded like Mitch Hedberg and
then eventually it sounded like myself.

767
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,201
Yeah,

768
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,430
it's hard to avoid,

769
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:13,760
man.

770
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,760
It's hard to avoid being like really
influenced by the guys that you know came

771
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:20,300
before you that were really good.

772
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,700
I caught myself sounding like
rich Jenny on stage ones.

773
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,370
Really just almost exactly.

774
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,180
It was like so,

775
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,050
such an obvious rip off the guy.

776
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,110
I was in the middle of a set like I did.

777
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,210
I kept going with the bit
and I finished my set,

778
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:34,790
like the audience didn't
even know to myself.

779
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,240
I was like,

780
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,540
Ooh,

781
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,670
you fraud.

782
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,150
Yeah.

783
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,621
I was like,

784
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:38,810
you fucking rich.

785
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:39,680
Jenny clone,

786
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:40,514
what are you doing?

787
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,680
Like a year ran or something like that,

788
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,100
you know,

789
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,370
but I'll never forget like how
embarrassing it was that if I like,

790
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,520
it was like if I was in the
room and I saw me on stage,

791
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:49,910
I be like,

792
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,390
Ooh,

793
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,650
who's this guy ripping off rich?

794
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,570
Cause he know this when you
know when guys will do that,

795
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:59,180
whether it's you're not
even ripping off material,

796
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:00,050
you just rip it off.

797
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:00,980
Being that guy.

798
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,853
Yeah.

799
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,833
People said that.

800
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,880
I had that with Steven,

801
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:05,211
right.

802
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:08,570
Mitch Hedberg and then inadvertently
Todd Barry people were like,

803
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:09,590
you sound like Todd Barry.

804
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:10,370
And I was like,

805
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm not even watching.

806
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,170
I mean I liked Highbury lot.

807
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:14,001
He's a great comic.

808
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,880
But it wasn't like I was watching
a ton of top area at that time.

809
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,780
Well I think you just have a similar
tone to your voice and it's only mildly

810
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:21,380
Sam,

811
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,730
but people are crazy.

812
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,870
They'll find connections.

813
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:24,110
Yeah.

814
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,980
Fucking anything.

815
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:30,110
I got off stage once in Kentucky and
some guy came up to me with a list of

816
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:30,531
people.

817
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:31,040
It's like,

818
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,431
he said,

819
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:31,671
you know,

820
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:32,800
Patton Oswald this.

821
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,081
I go,

822
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:33,890
what are you talking about?

823
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,221
He goes,

824
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:35,750
you sounded like these people.

825
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,891
And I was like,

826
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:37,580
listen man,

827
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,510
I don't know what to tell you.

828
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,410
Did you have a good time?

829
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,660
I don't know what to tell you.

830
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,563
You're looking at,

831
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,480
what are you saying?

832
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,830
You saying that I'm not me and then I've,

833
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:47,031
I've,

834
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:47,261
I'm,

835
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,250
I'm all of these people that's like,

836
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,084
what are you saying?

837
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,920
That's fine.

838
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,850
And there was a bunch of
[inaudible] to have a good time.

839
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,061
Yeah.

840
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:53,990
That's all I can say to him.

841
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,100
Listen,

842
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,750
I hope you had a good
time at the comedy show.

843
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,583
Crazy.

844
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,790
I to sit here and you're going to
analyze who my influences were and you're

845
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,490
angry at me for being
influenced by great comedians.

846
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:05,900
But I don't even think that's what it was.

847
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,980
I think it was like,

848
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,581
you know,

849
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:11,230
the people will try to find a
connection in anything they oh yeah.

850
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,901
You know,

851
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:14,960
when I listened to my recording
after the guy said that to me,

852
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:15,381
cause I was like,

853
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:16,490
what the fuck is this guy?

854
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,180
He like,

855
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,421
it was,

856
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:20,000
there was a couple of weeks
cure obscure ones in there too.

857
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,620
I don't remember who his references were,

858
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,723
but it was like,

859
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,430
like Richard Lewis was one
of them and I was like,

860
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:26,000
what do you,

861
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,950
what the fuck are you even saying?

862
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,170
And I went and listened to it
and I didn't hear any of it.

863
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,760
Somebody Wolf if they're looking and then
there's people that just are crazy and

864
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:38,330
their perceptions are just off and they'll
get a thought in their head and they

865
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:41,540
don't have the ability to discern
whether or not it's an objective thought,

866
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,100
whether or not it's a reasonable thought.

867
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,100
They just got that thought
and they fucking run with it.

868
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,730
And it with you.

869
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,710
They're like Todd Barry
sounds like Todd Barry.

870
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,460
Well it's funny

871
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,941
cause I,

872
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,190
I the person I listened to him the most,

873
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,390
it was woody Allen but no one ever
accuses me of sounding like Woody Allen

874
00:23:56,391 --> 00:24:01,391
because I'm like a suburban white kid
grown up and he's this short Jewish man

875
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:04,940
from New York City and we just don't
look like each other in any way,

876
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,530
shape or form.

877
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,770
I think people who don't
make that connection.

878
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,140
Sure.

879
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,200
So do you feel like you were
influenced and delivery wise?

880
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,073
Yeah.

881
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,420
Realize what a great comic he was.

882
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,141
He's incredible.

883
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,130
That one album,

884
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,211
that one album,

885
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:17,550
which is a compilation
of I think three records.

886
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,510
Um,

887
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,910
he's in crazy woody
Allen's standup comedian,

888
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:24,000
I think it's called and it's so good.

889
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,290
What a Weird Guy,

890
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:25,740
Huh?

891
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,900
I mean married his daughter
in front of the world.

892
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,260
God is intensely weird,

893
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,550
is hard.

894
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,730
That is intense.

895
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,420
Intensely and super hot.

896
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:37,254
Awesome.

897
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,750
Is she super hot and
it's kind of super hot.

898
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,290
Awesome.

899
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,280
Oh Man,

900
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,240
I don't,

901
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,073
I don't see it.

902
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,280
I can't get behind the super

903
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,410
crazy creepy man.

904
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,010
Yeah.

905
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,480
I mean how did they ever even
develop that kind of a relationship?

906
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,160
That doesn't make any sense to me.

907
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,940
It seems to me like that
should never be able to happen.

908
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,020
It shouldn't be on the table.

909
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,890
Yeah.

910
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,660
Not One of the options.

911
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,800
And I wonder what the blow back
was for him for Woody Allen,

912
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,180
this great director in his career.

913
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,750
It was a big blow back there.

914
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,721
There are people,

915
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,950
cause I'm such a big fan of his,

916
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,500
there are people who I
talked to to this day who go,

917
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,520
once that happened,

918
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:19,420
I will not see his movies.

919
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,350
Yeah.

920
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,370
There's a lot of people,

921
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,360
I've heard that from a,

922
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,500
especially from women,

923
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,490
from women particularly.

924
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,300
Yeah.

925
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,780
Well the,

926
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,613
you know,

927
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,470
it's almost like you can't
trust them around your kids.

928
00:25:29,471 --> 00:25:30,101
Like that's the,

929
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,390
that's the feeling that they get.

930
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:32,224
It's like he'll,

931
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,941
he's God,

932
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:33,660
he's just going to shoot,

933
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,000
he's not at the movie theater.

934
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,900
He's not at the movie theater
with you see the movies.

935
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:40,840
So you don't have to be
worried about their kids.

936
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,800
People that just won't,

937
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,480
they won't support you after,

938
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:43,951
like what,

939
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:46,450
what's the guy's name
that escaped to France?

940
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,561
Oh yeah.

941
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:48,281
Roman Polanski,

942
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,510
one of my favorite directors.

943
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,430
And he was,

944
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:51,731
yeah,

945
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:54,640
he was convicted of that horrible crime.

946
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,361
Yeah.

947
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:55,991
What did he do?

948
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:57,580
He wasn't convicted because he fled.

949
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:57,980
Right.

950
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,460
I'm,

951
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:58,800
it was,

952
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,310
he was,

953
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,010
he was drugged a teenage
girl and had sex with,

954
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:03,844
or something like that.

955
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,230
But then there's this whole,

956
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
there's this whole documentary
about that case called,

957
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:10,230
I think it's called wanted.

958
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,071
And,

959
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:11,820
um,

960
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,300
and it,

961
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,190
it shows the shades of gray.

962
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:14,911
In that case,

963
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:17,970
that case was really complex
and there was like a,

964
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,770
there was a judge who was really high
and mighty and kind of like got carried

965
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:27,771
away about his or her own ego
and how the judge him or herself,

966
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:29,190
I forget what it was,

967
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,970
was making headlines by saying certain
things in the cord and then it became

968
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:36,990
like a spectacular event where he might
have gotten like a year in jail or

969
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:37,560
something,

970
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,800
but then it got kind of
blown out of proportion.

971
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,680
It was going to be a big,

972
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:41,700
much bigger deal.

973
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,350
Yeah.

974
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,000
It's a really good movie actually.

975
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,230
I think it was on Hbo.

976
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,491
It's called,

977
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:48,324
wanted,

978
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,480
wanted.

979
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,620
It's like Roman Polanski
wanted or something like that.

980
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:52,261
In this case,

981
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:53,790
this is really disturbing man.

982
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,740
And then this is after his wife
had been murdered by the man.

983
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,100
So you got to realize like
this guy was a lot going on.

984
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,280
I mean what he did was
horrific for sure though.

985
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,421
But his,

986
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:06,691
I mean,

987
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:11,691
what has what a fucked up state of mind
he had to have been in after his wife

988
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,760
was murdered by the Manson
family while she was pregnant.

989
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,110
I,

990
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:21,110
I have to say like I being weird
shit happens in California.

991
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,340
Like I feel like the philanthropy stuff,

992
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:26,821
I'm just like,

993
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:27,601
when I watch it,

994
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:31,260
it feels so distant from
my existence in New York.

995
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:31,561
I'm like,

996
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:31,711
yeah,

997
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:34,260
that's some California shit
that I can't understand.

998
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,750
Do you like living in New York?

999
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,441
I love it.

1000
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:37,681
Yeah.

1001
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,514
I live in the city.

1002
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,910
My wife and I lived in the city for a
while and then we just moved to Brooklyn

1003
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,260
recently moved to Brooklyn,

1004
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,490
get some space,

1005
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,420
you know,

1006
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,230
just like we were sick of living
in this little cramped area.

1007
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,580
Oh see you have a bigger place.

1008
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,300
Yeah,

1009
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,133
we have like,

1010
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,441
yeah,

1011
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,120
we have a few bedrooms and it's,

1012
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,150
and we're able to and also just walk
around and have some trees around.

1013
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,670
We lived on the upper west
side in Manhattan and it
was like getting to a point

1014
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:03,810
where our favorite,

1015
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:05,880
like local restaurants were closing down.

1016
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,130
H and h bagels closed down.

1017
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,640
Nico's clothing,

1018
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:13,500
a Greek restaurant closed down like
a lot of places were closing down.

1019
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,460
Like to the point where like they closed
that this is a bad side of like when

1020
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,600
times are bad.

1021
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,290
We thought it was sad
when they closed down.

1022
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,460
Barnes and noble,

1023
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,871
like we were like,

1024
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,950
oh that's too bad.

1025
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:29,250
Our local bookstore got
shut down the circuit city.

1026
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:34,251
I felt like we lost a circuit city
to the last one in this common man.

1027
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,801
It's,

1028
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,540
I mean think about it in our lifetime,

1029
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:36,961
when,

1030
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:40,110
has there ever been a period of time
where more businesses closed down down to

1031
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:40,680
the,

1032
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,513
I don't know.

1033
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,130
In my lifetime I don't remember
anything like this profound but,

1034
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:45,631
but,

1035
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:49,620
but Brooklyn on the other hand is like
really burgeoning like oh really small

1036
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:50,211
restaurants,

1037
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,240
small bakeries,

1038
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,380
small like ice cream shops like are able
to open there because the real estate

1039
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:55,860
isn't bad.

1040
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,970
Expensive to rent.

1041
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,770
Commercial real estate isn't as expensive.

1042
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:02,040
So it's so you're
getting like better food,

1043
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,270
better like just baked goods.

1044
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:04,921
The ice cream,

1045
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:05,790
grocery stores,

1046
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,710
local grocery stores with local produce.

1047
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:08,310
Like it's,

1048
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,143
it's bad.

1049
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,661
I mean,

1050
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:10,980
I don't want to sell it too hard,

1051
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,420
but I think it's better.

1052
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:13,650
Like we're happier there.

1053
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,290
It seems like a little
bit of a compromise,

1054
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,650
a little bit better or compromised.

1055
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,300
Like your insights,

1056
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,751
what it is.

1057
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,520
You're in a suburban area,

1058
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:23,370
but it's a little subsidy and it's slower.

1059
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,810
We'll still be honest with you.

1060
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,730
The people are a little slower.

1061
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,593
You're kind of like,

1062
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,070
you're at the ice cream
store and you're like,

1063
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:29,310
ah,

1064
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,641
come on.

1065
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:29,911
Come on.

1066
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:30,744
What are we doing?

1067
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,323
What's going on?

1068
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,340
You're just,

1069
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,770
you're just,

1070
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,930
you're walking over there like
you could a little brisk step,

1071
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:37,141
you know,

1072
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,210
like bringing a little pep to it.

1073
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,140
Is it jazz music?

1074
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,180
So use the fucking being so,

1075
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,860
so crazy in New York.

1076
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,020
That hive is so nuts.

1077
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,550
It's so,

1078
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,140
it mimics insects.

1079
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:51,040
It's really crazy.

1080
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,530
So when you get them all
together in this big,

1081
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,191
you know,

1082
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:58,030
thing that they've created and they're
all swarming and this giant population

1083
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:58,630
center,

1084
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,170
I mean it's really not that much
different than a beehive or an ant hill.

1085
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,250
It's fucking crazy.

1086
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,020
So many people there.

1087
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,660
My wife and I went and this
was even more the case.

1088
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,820
My wife and I rented a house in western
Massachusetts this summer for a month so

1089
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:14,270
that we could just write in,

1090
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,340
relax and like dude,

1091
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,900
get away from like,

1092
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,200
like Amherst north,

1093
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,410
north of North Hampton.

1094
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
Beautiful out there.

1095
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,100
Gorgeous but so slow.

1096
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,533
Oh my God.

1097
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,070
Everything is like you go somewhere you
to order a cup of coffee or like we're

1098
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:31,270
going to be here for a little bit.

1099
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,080
Like,

1100
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,411
yeah,

1101
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:33,940
there's no law in the country.

1102
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,320
And it's really nice though.

1103
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:35,671
We,

1104
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:36,504
um,

1105
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,330
but it was funny because my wife has
been saying since we've been together,

1106
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:41,410
probably about eight years,

1107
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,520
got married four years ago.

1108
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,773
And uh,

1109
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,220
since we met,

1110
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:46,054
when she was like,

1111
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,370
I think that I belong in the country,

1112
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,340
I think that we should move to Jenny.

1113
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,401
And I was always like,

1114
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,150
I can't,

1115
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,301
like,

1116
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,134
I gotta work.

1117
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,440
This is work in the city cause
there's comedy clubs and,

1118
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,780
and this is where the
my one man shows are.

1119
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,591
And,

1120
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,280
uh,

1121
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,940
we finally took a month after being
together for eight years and went to the

1122
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:07,520
country and we brought
our cat Ivan and uh,

1123
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,040
and who had never been
anywhere but our apartment.

1124
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,980
And there were mice in
the house and they were,

1125
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,780
this is a really strange phenomenon.

1126
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:21,400
They were parasitic mice.

1127
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,960
It parasites in them,

1128
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:26,200
which means they are
unafraid of people or cats.

1129
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:26,471
Oh,

1130
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,760
that means they have toxoplasma.

1131
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,150
Yeah.

1132
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,170
That's exactly what they have.

1133
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,100
And,

1134
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,761
and uh,

1135
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,920
and so usually if you have a cat,

1136
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:37,921
you don't even see mice because they
smell cats and they don't even come out.

1137
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,701
In this case,

1138
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:40,750
we had mice,

1139
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,430
like they were like zombies.

1140
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:44,440
They were walking towards us.

1141
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:47,410
We were like batting them away
like a fucking video game.

1142
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,493
And that's sick.

1143
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,810
And those are the dangerous ones.

1144
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,250
Those are the ones that can affect you,

1145
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,940
is that right?

1146
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,271
Oh yeah.

1147
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:56,790
They have a massive impact on human
behavior that if they bite you is that if,

1148
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,570
if it gets into your skin,

1149
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,850
either through cat fecal matter,

1150
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,811
you get a,

1151
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:02,840
if the cat's infected,

1152
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,940
you can get it from the cat.

1153
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,970
You can get it from a livestock that a,

1154
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,760
it comes in contact with the ship.

1155
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,150
And so Ivan Eight,

1156
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,170
one of the mice.

1157
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,711
Oh No.

1158
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:13,210
See we took them again.

1159
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:15,790
So we instead of a month there,

1160
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,930
we were there for two weeks.

1161
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:19,060
Drove home after he ate the mouse,

1162
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:20,350
then we took him to the vet and he got,

1163
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,100
he took a,

1164
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,431
you know,

1165
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:24,910
whatever medicine to make
to knock that stuff out.

1166
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,800
I don't think they can stop that stuff.

1167
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,780
So brain parasites,

1168
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,330
I thought it is what it is.

1169
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,260
I think a whatever it was,

1170
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,770
we're,

1171
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,340
we've,

1172
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,390
it's checked out.

1173
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:37,811
I don't know.

1174
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:40,160
They gave him medicine a Zombie.

1175
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,430
Kat,

1176
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,430
I know you guys on the cat.

1177
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,790
Yeah.

1178
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,440
That's not good.

1179
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,981
He's old though.

1180
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:44,030
He's 16 years old,

1181
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:44,864
so time ago.

1182
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,570
He's in his golden years out of
there before he infects the house.

1183
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,890
It sounds crazy,

1184
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:53,660
but toxoplasma really is something
that people have to have an issue with

1185
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:56,750
because it does have an effect on
human behavior that makes people more

1186
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:57,310
aggressive.

1187
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,270
It slows your reaction time down.

1188
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,823
And um,

1189
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,720
a lot of the world has it.

1190
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
A huge popular.

1191
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:04,400
Really?

1192
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
Yeah.

1193
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,421
Yeah.

1194
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:06,171
In France,

1195
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:08,210
it's been as high in the,

1196
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:13,211
I believe it was the 1950s in 1960s it
got as high as 80% and 80% of the country

1197
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:13,940
had it.

1198
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,680
And now it's down to the 50s.

1199
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,660
This is all estimations of course.

1200
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,090
Not like really testing
the entire population.

1201
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,620
The estimate that America,

1202
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:25,820
it's somewhere around 50 to 60 million
people are affected by it or anyone for

1203
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:28,790
anyone getting their news
from Joe Rogan's podcast.

1204
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,541
Yeah,

1205
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,520
you're in trouble by the way,

1206
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:32,550
cause I'm backed up it,

1207
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,900
I've done no research challenge.

1208
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,660
You what I read.

1209
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,260
Yeah.

1210
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,830
But uh,

1211
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,290
it's the idea is that once you get it,

1212
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,100
you got it.

1213
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,440
That's it.

1214
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,070
Wow.

1215
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,540
Yeah.

1216
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,580
So it's brain parasites.

1217
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:44,810
Jesus makes the,

1218
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,690
the mice sexually attracted to cat piss.

1219
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,780
What a motherfucker like
what a crazy fucking disease.

1220
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,040
Dead.

1221
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,341
Well,

1222
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:55,000
we,

1223
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,530
my wife was on sitting on the couch
in the house and there was a mouse.

1224
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:00,281
She looked next to her.

1225
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:00,550
There's a

1226
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,550
mouse just sitting there staring at her.

1227
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:04,160
And Mom,

1228
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,350
usually you see a mice,

1229
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,931
a mouse in,

1230
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,510
it just runs away immediately.

1231
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,870
And in this case it was just staring
at her and she just ran away.

1232
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,540
And then I had to chase
the mouse out of the house.

1233
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,480
That something really
creepy about rodents.

1234
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,563
I know.

1235
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:20,800
Well,

1236
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
have you ever heard the rat gang concept?

1237
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:23,770
No,

1238
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,540
I just heard about it.

1239
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,380
That's recently,

1240
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,600
there's a apparently a book.

1241
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,780
Uh,

1242
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,390
I have a comedian friend named John
Hodgman who's a very knowledgeable man and

1243
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:34,170
uh,

1244
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:34,621
he,

1245
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:34,890
uh,

1246
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,610
he's written a lot of very
funny and great books and he,

1247
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:39,270
uh,

1248
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,060
he's in the daily show is of correspond
on the daily show sometimes he,

1249
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:42,601
he's on there.

1250
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:43,021
But anyway,

1251
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:43,301
he had,

1252
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:46,110
this is telling me there's this
book and I think it's called rats.

1253
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,930
It's all about the culture
of rats and that there's,

1254
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,360
there's this phenomenon
theoretically called the rat king,

1255
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,550
which is that certain rats are in such
an enclosed space that after a while

1256
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,800
their tails are intertwined.

1257
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,910
So their existing essentially
as one large rat unit.

1258
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,563
Wow.

1259
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,210
I don't know if I can substantiate this,

1260
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,070
but people should look up rat king.

1261
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,900
That sounds like some comic book Shit,

1262
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:11,200
man.

1263
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,033
Look,

1264
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,020
I need to look that up.

1265
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,980
Rat King.

1266
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,910
That doesn't seem like it.

1267
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,950
If it seems like something
you would know about,

1268
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,480
was he just joking?

1269
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:20,500
You wasn't joking.

1270
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,363
Really.

1271
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:21,990
No.

1272
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,380
Fair that there's this book called brick,

1273
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,820
I think rats and uh,

1274
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,240
and it sheds a lot of light on Yom
intimately looking at myself in this one,

1275
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,210
this camera and just gone.

1276
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,781
Oh Man.

1277
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:36,460
Have I put on weight on the road?

1278
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,400
It's so painful.

1279
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,140
The roads brutal road.

1280
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:40,974
It's brutal.

1281
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,720
It's hard to I what is this?

1282
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:45,330
A rat king and the scientific museum.

1283
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,620
Oh my God.

1284
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:47,460
So it is real,

1285
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:47,850
right?

1286
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,690
Oh my God.

1287
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:49,200
Brian,

1288
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,450
pull this up on Wikipedia because this
is going to freak you the fuck out.

1289
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,690
I see that as long as Bryan,

1290
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,261
oh,

1291
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:56,310
that son of a bitch.

1292
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,590
Yo Brian,

1293
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,620
how dare he,

1294
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,460
the,

1295
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,050
the loudness with which you shouted is
so inappropriate to what you're going to

1296
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:07,884
tell him.

1297
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,800
Yeah.

1298
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,730
It's not,

1299
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,251
no,

1300
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:10,310
no,

1301
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,143
no.

1302
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,470
You need to see this Wikipedia rat king.

1303
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,580
He needed to see this.

1304
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,040
It's this,

1305
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,020
this is incredible,

1306
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:16,854
man.

1307
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,551
This is,

1308
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,060
uh,

1309
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,520
this really is a real phenomenon.

1310
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,790
I thought your friend was
just fucking with you.

1311
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:23,940
No,

1312
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,241
no,

1313
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:24,391
no.

1314
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,570
We have a serious conversation about rats.

1315
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,110
Whoa.

1316
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,930
That seems like horrific.

1317
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,590
Yeah.

1318
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,820
If you go to it with folks,

1319
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,010
if you go to the folks listening to this,

1320
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:37,050
people would probably
tweet at you right now.

1321
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,850
Facts about the rat king.

1322
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:41,820
I bet some of your listeners and
viewers to know about the rat can't.

1323
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,001
Hey,

1324
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,410
we need you to pull something up man.

1325
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
We just something crazy.

1326
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,340
It's called a rat king.

1327
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,580
So Mike Birbiglia said this to me.

1328
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:51,414
I did not.

1329
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,040
I thought he was just fucking around.

1330
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,540
I thought it was friend
was just fucking around.

1331
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,810
But apparently there are clumps of rats
that get connected together by the tail

1332
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,800
and they grow together
while joined at the tails.

1333
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,160
So there's like a group of,

1334
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,140
like in this photo there's a group of,

1335
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:14,010
it looks like 30 or 40 of them
just on top of each other,

1336
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:15,810
connected by the tails.

1337
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,020
Rat King just pull up rat king on Wiki.

1338
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,670
It's the photo that connects to it.

1339
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,660
What can you imagine if you
ran into that somewhere?

1340
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,591
No,

1341
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:25,771
no.

1342
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:26,071
It's the,

1343
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,390
it's the stuff of nightmares.

1344
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,790
It's what one would,

1345
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,930
one should fear.

1346
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,600
Most rodents are fucking scary animals,

1347
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,434
man.

1348
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,390
This is so gross.

1349
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,480
Gross little fuckers.

1350
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,201
You got it.

1351
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,034
Rat King,

1352
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,480
the image of the top.

1353
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,021
Look at that.

1354
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:46,610
That click.

1355
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,700
Oh my God.

1356
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:48,420
I click on that.

1357
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,320
That's real.

1358
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,360
Is this live streaming the video?

1359
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,710
Oh my God.

1360
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,083
That thing.

1361
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,460
This isn't sane.

1362
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,660
Yeah.

1363
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,010
I mean it's insane.

1364
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,750
I just,

1365
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,770
all these rats intertwined.

1366
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,210
I came here today to blow
Joe Rogan's mind and I have,

1367
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:06,481
oh,

1368
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:07,314
you blew it.

1369
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,970
You blew it wide open.

1370
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:09,804
Cause I thought,

1371
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,190
I thought we were having fun.

1372
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,900
That's like your friend
is telling us a crazy.

1373
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,960
He could read your mind.

1374
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,450
No,

1375
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:19,801
really.

1376
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,290
A rat.

1377
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,330
King's a real thing.

1378
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,201
Fuck.

1379
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,670
What's folklore mean then?

1380
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,331
Well,

1381
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:24,841
you know,

1382
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:25,390
um,

1383
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:25,740
I,

1384
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,680
it doesn't necessarily
mean that it's not true.

1385
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,400
Uh,

1386
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,270
it means that,

1387
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:30,690
uh,

1388
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,590
it's probably been the
exaggerated and tossed down from,

1389
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,973
uh,

1390
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,230
superstitions,

1391
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,160
but this is,

1392
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,050
it's a rat big.

1393
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,953
Yeah.

1394
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,231
Well,

1395
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:41,771
I mean there was,

1396
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:42,131
there was,

1397
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:43,240
there was a bunch of shit,

1398
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:44,890
but it's obviously a real thing.

1399
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,970
It's a real phenomenon.

1400
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,271
There's,

1401
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,910
this is in the scientific
museum in Germany.

1402
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,531
I mean it really,

1403
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,640
it really does happen,

1404
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,270
but I think it's probably they don't,

1405
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,790
they probably just are tied up in knots.

1406
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,870
They're probably not like growing
together through the tales.

1407
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,570
I don't think their tails become one unit.

1408
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,540
I think they're just gross
and they just get tangled up.

1409
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,030
Ira Glass I regressed to,

1410
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,770
you mentioned earlier,

1411
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,480
you don't know show this American life,

1412
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,890
but he was saying the other day.

1413
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,510
It's sometimes he's
struck with when we're,

1414
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:18,940
you know,

1415
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,631
we live in New York,

1416
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:24,631
you live here in La with the degree to
which we are living like medieval lords

1417
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,400
like we have at our
beck and call any food,

1418
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,520
any type of food we want prepared
any way we want in a 25 minutes.

1419
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,710
Yeah.

1420
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,650
It's all a strange giant human construct.

1421
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,400
Yes.

1422
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,260
That doesn't resemble anything in nature.

1423
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah.

1424
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,000
Some nutty thing that they just
just goes up to the heavens.

1425
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,810
Yeah.

1426
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,680
Pops out of the ground.

1427
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,860
Everything else is missing and
occasionally you'll see a tree,

1428
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,590
one tree defiantly
looking for it's friends.

1429
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,850
It's my mind.

1430
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,270
That's why I loved the movie minority
report when it came out because I was just

1431
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:04,541
like,

1432
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,680
you watching a movie now you're like,

1433
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:05,831
yeah,

1434
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:08,200
about half of that
stuff is true right now.

1435
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,950
Yeah.

1436
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,000
It gives a futuristic,

1437
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,530
but it was futuristic
in a way that was like,

1438
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,810
you can just about see it coming.

1439
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,520
Like you walk into the mall and they go,

1440
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,540
Hello Joe Rogan.

1441
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,150
Would you like the Nike shoes
that you bought last year?

1442
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,500
Would you like another fresh pair?

1443
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,420
Certainly it's going to happen,

1444
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,020
right?

1445
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,750
For sure.

1446
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,960
Yeah.

1447
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,370
It's gonna be,

1448
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,730
they're gonna be able to
already exists on your phone.

1449
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,380
The Internet always are already on Amazon.

1450
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,920
You go on,

1451
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,161
they said,

1452
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:30,461
well you,

1453
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,570
you might like this.

1454
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,111
Yeah.

1455
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:35,560
I bought a tee shirt from cafe press
and I bought it through Amazon and went

1456
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:36,161
through Amazon.

1457
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:36,460
Yeah,

1458
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,091
there it goes.

1459
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,040
Do you want to go through Amazon?

1460
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,460
Like yo can see how that works?

1461
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,180
Sure.

1462
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,050
Cut through Amazon.

1463
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,010
Yeah,

1464
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,550
I love it.

1465
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,390
It's amazing.

1466
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,830
We live in a weird world.

1467
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,823
Strange.

1468
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,850
We're talking about one
click shopping on Amazon,

1469
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:51,670
but it's the easiest way to buy anything.

1470
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:52,210
And it's,

1471
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,150
when you start doing it,

1472
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,470
it becomes so God damn addictive
because it feels ridiculous.

1473
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,210
I know.

1474
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:57,880
You just get,

1475
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,850
you can get obscure billiard supplies.

1476
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:01,210
You can like weird shit.

1477
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:05,740
Like I need a corporate tip tapper
and you can find that on Amazon.

1478
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,380
And hardest,

1479
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,430
hardest to return though.

1480
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,030
I had so much shit that I just
won't return because it's like,

1481
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,410
yeah,

1482
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:11,890
you gotta,

1483
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,830
you gotta take the hit I saw.

1484
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,021
Yeah.

1485
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,470
I saw the movie day for night recently,

1486
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,320
a Truffaut film,

1487
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:18,100
which is great.

1488
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,760
Have you ever seen that?

1489
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:18,991
No.

1490
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:19,824
Day for night.

1491
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,770
Did you get it from Amazon?

1492
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,020
No,

1493
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,240
but it's about making a film.

1494
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:22,660
Yeah.

1495
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:22,841
No,

1496
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:23,441
I actually did.

1497
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:23,861
I got it,

1498
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:26,170
I think from Amazon and
then I was at the end of it,

1499
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,004
I was like,

1500
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,590
I'd like to have the
poster of this click on it.

1501
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:29,920
Okay.

1502
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,753
It's on the way.

1503
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,380
Boom.

1504
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,213
So crazy.

1505
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,960
I get these,

1506
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,770
uh,

1507
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,080
obscure Mexican hot sauces,

1508
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,040
Leu Kotecha.

1509
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,310
I can't find them in any like
white people grocery store.

1510
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,260
You have to go to the Mexican hood to get,

1511
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,650
you could Kotecha or you
just go to amazon.com boom.

1512
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,850
How do you resolve it?

1513
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,151
And I'm like,

1514
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:47,570
cause I,

1515
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:47,931
cause you,

1516
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,810
you were very knowledgeable about pizza.

1517
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,640
How do you fit that into the Diet?

1518
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,630
Because you have such a good diet.

1519
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,580
Just Kinda make sure you
don't eat it all the time.

1520
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,460
The most important
thing is that your base,

1521
00:41:58,461 --> 00:41:58,981
like you,

1522
00:41:58,981 --> 00:41:59,181
you,

1523
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,190
you never want to deprive
your body of nutrients,

1524
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,020
but you can have cheat days.

1525
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:03,610
Totally.

1526
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,030
Yeah.

1527
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,863
Nothing wrong with that,

1528
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,390
I think.

1529
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,120
I think a cheap meals cheat days,

1530
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,550
just as long as you're being reasonable,

1531
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:15,560
as long as like 80% of your food is
really good food and healthy and every now

1532
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:17,180
and then you have a burger
or something like that,

1533
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,253
you could do that.

1534
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,113
So we get away with it.

1535
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,450
Yeah.

1536
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,880
Oh yeah.

1537
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,713
Yeah,

1538
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,291
yeah.

1539
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,790
I've tried vegetarian before.

1540
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,430
I tried it when I was trying to
lose weight when I was a kid,

1541
00:42:25,431 --> 00:42:28,190
when I was fighting in different
weight classes and I didn't like it.

1542
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:29,024
I felt,

1543
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,930
I just felt shitty.

1544
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:30,500
I felt,

1545
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,670
I just didn't feel,

1546
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,650
I didn't feel like I was a very vibrant,

1547
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,600
I haven't tried it again as an adult,

1548
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,420
but I know I crave meat.

1549
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,443
I crave it.

1550
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,650
Like after a good workout I want to
fucking steak and I'll feel like my body

1551
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:45,620
wants red meat and people say let's,

1552
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:50,130
you know that's the only
evolved and lustful killing.

1553
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,150
Those cows are knocking the live forever.

1554
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:57,620
If you just let them walk around
and if people aren't killing cows,

1555
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,570
something's going to kill cows.

1556
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,600
Either cars cause you're going to hit
them with your cars cause they're going to

1557
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:03,434
be everywhere.

1558
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,610
Or you can have mountain lions running
around taking cows out in front of you

1559
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,453
everyday.

1560
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,830
That's a possibility too.

1561
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,600
I think it's inhumane aspect of keeping
them in crates slightly larger than

1562
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,081
their body.

1563
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:16,520
That I think frustrates people.

1564
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,330
Yeah.

1565
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,730
I haven't had veal on a long time.

1566
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,910
The veal was the first
one I tapped out on.

1567
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:23,720
It was just like,

1568
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,920
I can't do that.

1569
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,510
That's just too creepy.

1570
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,890
Taken a baby and not feeding it and
tying it in and not so can't move.

1571
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,143
No,

1572
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,780
no,

1573
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:32,991
no.

1574
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,824
Thanks.

1575
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,590
Yeah,

1576
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,680
it's so fucked up.

1577
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,141
I'm just like,

1578
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:36,441
Hey,

1579
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:37,460
I've got no time for that.

1580
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,470
Just so it's more tender.

1581
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,221
Really.

1582
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,810
What the fuck man?

1583
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,030
What's funny is I'm looking at your image.

1584
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,530
You're behind a computer,

1585
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:48,440
but I can see you're
here and you can see me.

1586
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,783
It's funny as it,

1587
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,773
if you,

1588
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,900
if your body and if you
have a really good physique,

1589
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:55,910
if you ended up having my body,

1590
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,130
you might go into a deep depression.

1591
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,700
I'm like,

1592
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:03,230
you'd be really upset if I had your body,

1593
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,540
my comedy career would go away because
all I do is just make fun of my own body

1594
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,290
and sour.

1595
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,350
But you can make fun of
anything and you know if he can,

1596
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,360
if you make fun of your own body,

1597
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,500
if you're a self deprecating,

1598
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:16,640
you can make fun of something else.

1599
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,120
You actually defy because you're,

1600
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:20,870
you're great.

1601
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,370
I was listening your albums this week.

1602
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,490
You defy vid Joe Piscopo rule,

1603
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,080
which is that if you're,

1604
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,300
if you get to fit,

1605
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,620
you're no longer funny.

1606
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,860
People are silly.

1607
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,330
There's no rules to comedy.

1608
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:33,821
Nobody should.

1609
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:34,654
We should.

1610
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,640
I think Pisco.

1611
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:36,390
Where's the,

1612
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:36,841
where the,

1613
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:37,200
uh,

1614
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,760
where's the line in the
sand where people are like,

1615
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:39,001
oh,

1616
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:39,361
okay.

1617
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,800
That's how it works.

1618
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,310
No,

1619
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,120
with Pisco,

1620
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,350
the problem was he just,

1621
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,410
you know,

1622
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,980
he had a few good things that he did
on Saturday night live if you're good

1623
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,660
sketches.

1624
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,430
But overall there wasn't that much there.

1625
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,710
He didn't put enough effort into it.

1626
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:53,010
He didn't.

1627
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:53,580
Yeah.

1628
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,890
It's no different than any other comic
like Michael Richards that you know,

1629
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,850
goes from being an actor to be in a
comic and just can't really pull it off.

1630
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,210
Yeah.

1631
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,080
There's not much difference.

1632
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:05,850
It's a hard road and no one has to tell
you that to become a standup comic is a

1633
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:06,421
long,

1634
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,530
hard fucking road.

1635
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,040
Yeah.

1636
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,900
And Eh,

1637
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,670
there's not a lot of us who stay on it.

1638
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,240
If you stop and think about like the
guys that you hung out with when you were

1639
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:16,680
an open miker totally different.

1640
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,071
Yeah.

1641
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:19,590
And look at the guys that you know
now how many of them made it me and

1642
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,270
Fitzsimmons you started out together.

1643
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,510
So like literally like
weeks apart from each other.

1644
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,880
So like he's like one of the only guys,

1645
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,330
like from my group of open Miker is that,

1646
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,530
that made it over the salmon net.

1647
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,870
No one from my open mics working.

1648
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:34,580
Yeah.

1649
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,700
It so that it will actually,

1650
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:35,851
no,

1651
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:36,684
I shouldn't say that.

1652
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,210
No one from my open mics is,

1653
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,710
I still run into anything to,

1654
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,580
Paulo was always a really funny guy
and he was always in really good shape.

1655
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:46,620
But he was a football player.

1656
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,310
You're right.

1657
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,950
Nick is much more handsome than me.

1658
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,151
Fantastic.

1659
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:51,840
Had a hair.

1660
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,621
I discovered this.

1661
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,060
I went to Guantanamo Bay,

1662
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:59,061
Cuba and the USO tour with a Depaulo
and Geraldo and Colin Quinn gaffing at a

1663
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:01,074
bunch of guys.

1664
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,913
And uh,

1665
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,110
Geraldo is in great shape too.

1666
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:05,160
And so it was DePaul cause we,

1667
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,750
cause we were waiting on
the beach should we went,

1668
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:07,620
we went swimming,

1669
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,200
pulled over cause we couldn't
get through one of the gates.

1670
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,711
We were like,

1671
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,930
well let's just go swimming
in that beach right there.

1672
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,980
And we all went swimming.

1673
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:14,440
There's fun.

1674
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:14,770
I did,

1675
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,870
we still have photos of it.

1676
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:16,160
And I'm like,

1677
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,340
ah,

1678
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,173
fuck.

1679
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,750
It's really embarrassing for me.

1680
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,170
Feels like a shame.

1681
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,111
Yeah,

1682
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:23,580
DePaul has always been good shape.

1683
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,121
He was,

1684
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:24,360
uh,

1685
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:24,751
one,

1686
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:28,590
one of the guys when I was in open miker
he was a a bit more established than

1687
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:28,711
me.

1688
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:31,860
He was ahead of me by at
least maybe like two years.

1689
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,190
Yeah.

1690
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,420
He was an established
professional Micah time.

1691
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,160
Yes.

1692
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,640
Yeah.

1693
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,680
Louis was also about
two years ahead of me.

1694
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,311
Those guys,

1695
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:40,170
when I first started doing open mics,

1696
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,800
they were just doing
professional gigs and a,

1697
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,980
I got to see a Depaulo
once on stage and I'm like,

1698
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:48,280
look at this handsome motherfucker,

1699
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,110
this football player looking dude.

1700
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,350
No.

1701
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,740
And he was hilarious and I,

1702
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,431
and I,

1703
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:55,780
that was a nice thing for me to see as a,

1704
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,130
uh,

1705
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:56,760
you know,

1706
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,160
a young guy who was involved
in athletics myself.

1707
00:46:59,161 --> 00:46:59,640
It was like,

1708
00:46:59,640 --> 00:46:59,941
okay,

1709
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:01,110
so there is no rule.

1710
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,350
Yeah.

1711
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,310
Like anything can,

1712
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:02,730
you know,

1713
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,980
and then when I remember when I,

1714
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,420
my first saw Kennison,

1715
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,200
that's when I realized there was no rules.

1716
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,240
That's when I first,

1717
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,640
I like,

1718
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:08,941
oh,

1719
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:10,170
anything can be comedy.

1720
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:11,670
And it's just whether or not,

1721
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:12,504
it's funny.

1722
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,500
That's comedy too.

1723
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:15,240
This is a different thing he's doing.

1724
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,750
That's right.

1725
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,890
Gwen Kinison was going,

1726
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,913
I love it.

1727
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,313
Look at this face.

1728
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,610
I was married

1729
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,330
that fucking because I,

1730
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,340
because we could get him,

1731
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,543
remember when he,

1732
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,010
uh,

1733
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,800
he was one of my earliest influences.

1734
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:30,760
Um,

1735
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,930
when he did that bit about,

1736
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:32,320
uh,

1737
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,250
about getting married,

1738
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:34,750
the devil has even tried to scare you.

1739
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:35,670
It's like,

1740
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,040
Oh,

1741
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,880
you've been married though.

1742
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,560
This is going to be like
fucking Club Med for you.

1743
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,070
Come on here and this is
where we torches souls,

1744
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,381
blah,

1745
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:41,681
blah,

1746
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,514
blah.

1747
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,401
You're married.

1748
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,234
How will be like

1749
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,213
he was,

1750
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,040
he was the first,

1751
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,551
to me,

1752
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,110
that like really cemented in my head
that anything could be comedy because I

1753
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:57,340
always loved comedy,

1754
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,670
but I was always like way too loud and
aggressive and stupid to connect myself

1755
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,660
to someone like Jerry Seinfeld.

1756
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:05,220
You know,

1757
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,650
like,

1758
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,161
I was like,

1759
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:06,640
that would,

1760
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,740
I would have to be a totally
different person to be.

1761
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:09,590
That kind of came back.

1762
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,843
I could never do that.

1763
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,340
Just,

1764
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,220
I don't think I could do that.

1765
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:12,700
Yeah.

1766
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,960
But then I saw Kennis and I was like,

1767
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,081
oh,

1768
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,100
there's no rules.

1769
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,020
You don't have to beat Jerry Seinfeld.

1770
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,430
You just have to be whatever.

1771
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,780
It's funny from you,

1772
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,890
whatever comes out of you

1773
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,060
podcast must be great
for you because you're,

1774
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:23,881
when you tore,

1775
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:26,720
now it's probably your audiences
who get your sense of humor.

1776
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:27,501
Yeah.

1777
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:28,580
As opposed to like fear,

1778
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,410
fear factor fans who were like,

1779
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,660
well let's see him do
the bugs in the mouth.

1780
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:32,990
Yeah.

1781
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,250
The fear fear factor was hard for,

1782
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,060
cause I heard that bid on
your album where you're like,

1783
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,070
that's just a show.

1784
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:40,641
I host it.

1785
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:41,210
I'm not,

1786
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,350
that's not me.

1787
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,760
That wasn't my idea.

1788
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:44,800
It's a lot of people though.

1789
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:49,480
It's such a big thing because it's on
television that it has to like define you

1790
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:49,960
friend.

1791
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,760
Then it has to be your thing.

1792
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,991
But I was always like,

1793
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,800
why?

1794
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,090
Like it's just,

1795
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,890
it's my Gig,

1796
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:56,870
but that's crazy.

1797
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,480
But the technology of these podcasts
right now is that you can't actually say,

1798
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:00,790
yeah,

1799
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,940
no,

1800
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,201
no,

1801
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:02,100
I'm this,

1802
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,750
I'm going to tell you what I am.

1803
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:05,690
It's this w you,

1804
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,230
you

1805
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:10,580
get an opportunity to express yourself
in a way deeper way than would ever be

1806
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,230
possible in a million tonight show.

1807
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,260
Oh,

1808
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,093
appearances.

1809
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,270
You'd never be able to
find out that across.

1810
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,560
That was always my goal.

1811
00:49:16,561 --> 00:49:17,161
Starting out.

1812
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:18,570
It's cause I would do these hell gigs.

1813
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:20,010
I drove like I do in the movie.

1814
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,150
It's like I drove,

1815
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,820
I drove my mom's station
wagon all over the country.

1816
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:25,170
I bought incidentally,

1817
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:25,831
it's like,

1818
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:25,980
oh,

1819
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,990
I only find out at this age now.

1820
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,760
It's like people's parents gave them
their car or like bought them a car.

1821
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,650
I bought my mom's station wagon for $2,200
I had a hundred thousand miles on it.

1822
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,120
Like she marked it up or my mom
marked up first still was really good.

1823
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:45,630
I drove it around the country and I and
I would perform at these gigs who'd be

1824
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:45,931
like,

1825
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:46,171
you know,

1826
00:49:46,171 --> 00:49:48,700
like every just so people
have a point of reference.

1827
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:49,501
Like when I was starting out,

1828
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:52,800
like whenever you're in
the middle of nowhere,

1829
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:54,010
you're in like you know,

1830
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,631
Cherry Hill,

1831
00:49:54,631 --> 00:49:55,141
Pennsylvania,

1832
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:55,650
Cherry Hill,

1833
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,790
New Jersey and you drive by like a
best western and it says comedy night,

1834
00:49:59,790 --> 00:49:59,970
Wednesday.

1835
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:00,810
That was my life.

1836
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,640
I was comedy night,

1837
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,474
Wednesday.

1838
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,840
I took a lot of those to let a
lot of those Barry Katz Gigs.

1839
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,081
Yeah.

1840
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:07,381
And so,

1841
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:09,870
so my goal when I was in that stage,

1842
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:11,160
cause I wouldn't do well,

1843
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,491
you know,

1844
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:12,720
the audiences wouldn't like me.

1845
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:15,960
They came to see something
different than what it was.

1846
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,670
I wasn't also that good.

1847
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,533
So it was like,

1848
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,560
it was the combination of what I would
become was like a soft spoken kind of

1849
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,394
storyteller.

1850
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,520
And then what they wanted
was like fast jokes,

1851
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,350
Lenny.

1852
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:27,561
Yeah,

1853
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:28,520
they won Lindy Clark.

1854
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:28,761
Yeah.

1855
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:29,541
Who's great comic.

1856
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:30,080
But yeah,

1857
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,560
he could kill it anywhere.

1858
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,320
And so what I was like,

1859
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:37,520
I want people eventually to
come to see my shows on purpose

1860
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,413
and that's why he's here.

1861
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,500
That's why I started,

1862
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,120
started to keeping a mailing list.

1863
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,560
And you also,

1864
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,040
uh,

1865
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,080
got very successful with your blogs.

1866
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,030
I remember you were the first guy.

1867
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,350
We were somewhere,

1868
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,270
I can't remember what city it was,

1869
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,770
but you were in a big place.

1870
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:52,610
You were in like this,

1871
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:53,690
this big theater.

1872
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,171
And I,

1873
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:54,681
and I go,

1874
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:55,041
damn,

1875
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:55,221
I go,

1876
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,300
Mike Birbiglia is playing.

1877
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:56,631
Here.

1878
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:56,841
I go,

1879
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:58,010
how the fuck is he doing that?

1880
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,020
And then I forget who I was with.

1881
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,620
Um,

1882
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,400
it was either Joey Diaz or Ari.

1883
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:03,234
Should fear.

1884
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,730
One of those guys was like,

1885
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,680
he's got this blog really,

1886
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,350
really popular.

1887
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,860
He's got this blog.

1888
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,401
And I was like,

1889
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,061
damn man,

1890
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:12,290
that's a big impact.

1891
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:15,440
Like this was years ago before
we ever even did the podcast.

1892
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,820
And I remember thinking like,

1893
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,350
that's a lot of impact from,

1894
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:18,890
you know,

1895
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,390
connecting with people on the Internet.

1896
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,530
Well part of it was like I,

1897
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,810
I wrote my blog,

1898
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,880
it was called my secret public
journal and I still do it.

1899
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,200
And uh,

1900
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,380
and then Bob,

1901
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,040
the Bob and Tom show out of it,

1902
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,470
you know,

1903
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,720
out of Indianapolis and
there syndicated was like,

1904
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,030
just read your secret
public journal on our show.

1905
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,650
So I would call in every week.

1906
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,270
And it was actually very similar,

1907
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:38,320
like cable guy,

1908
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:40,990
cable guy used to do
stuff like that radio,

1909
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,920
you know that cable guy used to do
like he used to do Collins every week.

1910
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,930
So like all over the place.

1911
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,160
He like,

1912
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,050
he would be doing like 20,

1913
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:52,090
25 phones a week.

1914
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:52,930
Wow.

1915
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:53,650
Yeah.

1916
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,411
Holy Shit.

1917
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,220
We thought about that.

1918
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,700
A really hard worker.

1919
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,031
Okay.

1920
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:58,211
I mean,

1921
00:51:58,211 --> 00:51:59,230
I don't know what he does now,

1922
00:51:59,231 --> 00:51:59,400
but,

1923
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,233
but he backed up.

1924
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,380
I've met him a long time ago in
Montreal when he was just starting out.

1925
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,330
Nobody knew about him was
like the early nineties.

1926
00:52:07,331 --> 00:52:09,490
And he was a nice fucking nice guy,

1927
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:10,790
had a great time family.

1928
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,870
I hung out with him one night and uh,

1929
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,131
we,

1930
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,600
we partied at the comedy
works in Montreal,

1931
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:17,583
got hammered out of there.

1932
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,940
It was a great dude,

1933
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:19,670
man.

1934
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,100
We had some fun and uh,

1935
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:24,070
he's got some great
potato chips and sent us,

1936
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:25,790
he listens to the podcast series,

1937
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,591
sent over,

1938
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:26,920
uh,

1939
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,150
his potato chips.

1940
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,220
He's guy was cheeseburger,

1941
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:31,960
potato chips get tastes.

1942
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:32,660
The pickles,

1943
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,040
you can,

1944
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,870
he has Cheezburger potatoes.

1945
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,470
It is probably the worst
thing on earth for you.

1946
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,221
Like,

1947
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:42,220
I don't know how the fuck they're
giving you all these different flavors,

1948
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,780
but it's like a joke.

1949
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:44,760
I mean like you eat,

1950
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,180
you eat a chip and you like,

1951
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,710
I'd taste the burger.

1952
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,910
There's the ketchup,

1953
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,871
there's a pickle.

1954
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:50,704
What the fuck?

1955
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:51,290
Yeah,

1956
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,030
last night and my hotel,

1957
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,810
because I had any,

1958
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,860
I hadn't eat,

1959
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:58,820
I'd eaten dinner at that in between
stage like 6:00 PM and then it's midnight

1960
00:52:59,160 --> 00:52:59,601
and you're going to,

1961
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:00,590
I got to eat something.

1962
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:03,200
So I went to the mini bar
and I had pirate's booty.

1963
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:04,790
That shit.

1964
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,840
I had pirate's booty in the flavor
was aged Cheddar and I was like,

1965
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:13,841
what the fuck is aged Cheddar in this
like manufactured chip that's from some

1966
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:16,430
factory somewhere.

1967
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:16,641
It's like,

1968
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:18,710
is that really aged Cheddar?

1969
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,900
What creates the taste of age?

1970
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,110
It's like strawberry.

1971
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,300
It doesn't taste anything
like strawberries.

1972
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:28,240
It's just what we,

1973
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,790
we agree to.

1974
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,320
Strawberry got like great gum.

1975
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,580
Grape gum doesn't taste
like fucking great.

1976
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,620
The last thing that should tastes great,

1977
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,160
it tastes like grape gum.

1978
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:38,551
Right?

1979
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:38,790
You know,

1980
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,970
and with that purple grape soda,

1981
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,270
they suddenly lit grapes.

1982
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,640
We get it in our head that
that's the great flavor.

1983
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,770
Yeah,

1984
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,890
it's grape soda.

1985
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,350
Even have grapes in it now.

1986
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:50,791
Right?

1987
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:52,800
It's just some fucking sugar water.

1988
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:57,801
But we know there's a fake grape tastes
that we accept and it's like the gum

1989
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:59,590
tastes that grape gum tastes.

1990
00:53:59,591 --> 00:54:00,151
It's fake.

1991
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:01,320
It's a fake grape.

1992
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,011
We just go,

1993
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:02,431
yeah,

1994
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:03,110
it's great.

1995
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,540
That doesn't mean anything like great,

1996
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,390
like what are you talking about?

1997
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:06,890
You know?

1998
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,720
It's like if I gave you a
cheeseburger and it tasted like feet,

1999
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,850
you know it's fast liquids on Amazon now,

2000
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,420
Larry the cable guy,

2001
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:18,590
she's very retainer chip package
one read three to hug a three damn

2002
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,580
cheeseburger,

2003
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:21,450
potato chips.

2004
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,501
That's another guy.

2005
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:22,981
By the way,

2006
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,030
it doesn't need the money.

2007
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:25,990
So he clearly believes in cheeseburger,

2008
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,871
potato chips.

2009
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:27,121
Look,

2010
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:28,230
they were very tasty,

2011
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,750
but I was feeling like with each chip,

2012
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:32,400
I was rolling the crazy dice.

2013
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:32,851
I was like,

2014
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:34,020
what's in this shit?

2015
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,540
Who knows what kind of it was
going to grow breasts on you?

2016
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,210
You know what it's like?

2017
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:37,471
It's like,

2018
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:37,780
it's like,

2019
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,613
it's like,

2020
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,470
it's like Willy Wonka and
the chocolate factory.

2021
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,780
When they take the things
like what does it tastes like?

2022
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:42,931
Oh,

2023
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:43,920
it tastes like a,

2024
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,491
you know,

2025
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:45,390
whatever the thing was.

2026
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,740
That's exactly what it's like.

2027
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,610
Dude,

2028
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,510
I didn't even think of that.

2029
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:49,500
I forgot about that.

2030
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,790
That's exactly what it's like.

2031
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:51,150
Yeah,

2032
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:51,391
Dude.

2033
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,840
It,

2034
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,370
I'm telling you that you remember.

2035
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,270
Do you guys remember?

2036
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:55,320
I forget what it was.

2037
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:55,561
It's like,

2038
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:56,490
does it taste like this?

2039
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:56,821
And he's like,

2040
00:54:56,821 --> 00:54:57,181
yeah,

2041
00:54:57,181 --> 00:54:58,020
it does.

2042
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,011
I don't remember.

2043
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:02,790
But I do remember was like a piece of
gum that basically tasted like an ex a

2044
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:03,870
food experience,

2045
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,640
right?

2046
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:04,890
Yeah.

2047
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,671
Well they're getting,

2048
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:06,504
they closing,

2049
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,423
they're closing in on,

2050
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,940
it's like ghost fleet.

2051
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,280
It's ghostly distinct.

2052
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,383
It's not like,

2053
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:12,630
you know,

2054
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,670
Habanero pepper distinct flavor.

2055
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:16,290
It's a ghostly like,

2056
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:16,501
oh,

2057
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:19,710
there's the mustard in that fucking thing.

2058
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,120
But it's really good.

2059
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,080
It's really good.

2060
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:22,710
But um,

2061
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,981
your,

2062
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:24,930
your role in the health dice,

2063
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,410
there's,

2064
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:26,671
you know,

2065
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:29,340
it'd be good with this potato
chips or like some kind of cheese,

2066
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,270
meaty cheese.

2067
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:31,021
Oh,

2068
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:31,854
Jesus.

2069
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,870
You're getting my dick hard

2070
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,553
meaty case.

2071
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,130
When you talk to Europeans,

2072
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:40,860
are they say that what's
killing us is the preservatives.

2073
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,700
Oh yeah.

2074
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,700
Because you're very overweight and they
eat cheese and wine and all this stuff

2075
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,060
on pasteurized cheese.

2076
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,310
They have a lot of
unpasteurized cheese in Europe.

2077
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,360
You can't even get it over here.

2078
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,660
It's like I had a friend from France
and he used to have to smuggle it in

2079
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,780
smuggling unpasteurized cheese in France.

2080
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,050
Yeah.

2081
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:58,883
It's so crazy.

2082
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,090
And by the way,

2083
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:04,260
there's a reason why your body
has a lactose intolerance.

2084
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:08,340
It's because you're drinking milk
that's been boiled down is dead.

2085
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,110
There's no enzymes in it.

2086
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,830
There's no like all this stuff that
makes your body naturally digest it.

2087
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:14,820
It doesn't exist.

2088
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:15,421
He goes,

2089
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:19,050
so the idea is that like we have
to protect people from bad milk.

2090
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,921
Yeah.

2091
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:20,371
But you know,

2092
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,330
what's a better idea?

2093
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,200
Fresh milk.

2094
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,980
We've got to figure out how to not

2095
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,350
have milk sitting in a
supermarket for three months.

2096
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,570
We got to have people
closer to their animals.

2097
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,540
We had the,

2098
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:29,840
um,

2099
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,381
growing up,

2100
00:56:30,381 --> 00:56:31,160
we had the,

2101
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,780
I don't know if you remember
this in Massachusetts,

2102
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,840
the lung grin and [inaudible]
like milk store it when it was,

2103
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,940
it was milk in glass bottles.

2104
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,510
They would deliver it to your house.

2105
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,650
Cops let him off.

2106
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,493
Amazing.

2107
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,070
And I don't think that
place exists anymore.

2108
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:49,320
Yeah.

2109
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,360
I don't know if that was
pasteurizer homogenized,

2110
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,961
but,

2111
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:52,111
uh,

2112
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:52,401
the,

2113
00:56:52,401 --> 00:56:53,730
the used to have it at whole foods.

2114
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:54,491
So now you've got to go to a,

2115
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,820
there's like little specialty
markets are California.

2116
00:56:56,821 --> 00:56:57,780
They have it in whole foods.

2117
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:58,010
No,

2118
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:58,191
no,

2119
00:56:58,191 --> 00:56:58,440
no,

2120
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:58,660
no,

2121
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,450
not anymore.

2122
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,610
Whole foods is like,

2123
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,970
they're so big that they,

2124
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:03,121
uh,

2125
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:05,010
there's certain shit they
don't take a risk with.

2126
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:10,011
Like there's a Kombucha that has
more than one half of 1% alcohol.

2127
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:11,640
And because of that,

2128
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,210
they carry it.

2129
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,150
But it's just,

2130
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,280
uh,

2131
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,611
it's,

2132
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:15,300
it was,

2133
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,991
it's nothing,

2134
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:17,760
it's not like a level
that can get you drunk,

2135
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,810
but it is,

2136
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,201
you know,

2137
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:21,780
it ferments and it's really
fucking good for you.

2138
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:24,330
And the one that ferments the most
is the really the best for you.

2139
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,210
And they don't carry it because it's,

2140
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:26,760
it's got,

2141
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,470
it gets a little risky with the alcohol.

2142
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:28,830
Right.

2143
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:29,663
Very risky.

2144
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,020
So that's why they don't,

2145
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:31,920
they don't have that,

2146
00:57:31,921 --> 00:57:33,420
they don't have raw milk there anymore.

2147
00:57:33,421 --> 00:57:33,661
It's like,

2148
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:34,494
it's too risky.

2149
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,190
But I don't know if that's a
corporate decision and what,

2150
00:57:38,191 --> 00:57:39,770
but it's unfortunate because raw milk,

2151
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:40,020
man,

2152
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,240
it doesn't give you any
like weird stomach shit.

2153
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,350
Tastes way better once you get
used to the fact what you drink.

2154
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,100
It's like rich and creamy.

2155
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:47,461
It's sick.

2156
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:48,480
It's really fucking good.

2157
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,490
Mine.

2158
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,100
Uh,

2159
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,150
I was finding California recently
and I was on a plane and I was,

2160
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,360
I had one of those mornings where you
show up at the airport and you just,

2161
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,930
you're so hungry that
you just grab anything.

2162
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:02,840
I was like Chibo or whatever
that place is called the JFK.

2163
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,070
Yeah.

2164
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:03,490
You're just like,

2165
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,480
I'll have any just in case,

2166
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,470
you know,

2167
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,520
I need something.

2168
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:08,310
I'll have a banana,

2169
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,143
have a sandwich,

2170
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:09,891
anything.

2171
00:58:09,891 --> 00:58:11,060
You have his bag of stuff.

2172
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:15,020
And I get on the plane and I'm just
scarfing down this chicken salad sandwich

2173
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,330
and the flight attendant
comes over to me and he goes,

2174
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,050
um,

2175
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,430
excuse me sir.

2176
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,280
I there nuts in that sandwich.

2177
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:22,551
I'm like,

2178
00:58:22,551 --> 00:58:23,690
scarfing down the sandwich.

2179
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:24,350
And I looked down,

2180
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,100
I'm like,

2181
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,590
I'm a film show.

2182
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:26,821
I it,

2183
00:58:26,821 --> 00:58:30,620
here's walnuts and I know that
this is going to go badly.

2184
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:31,400
And so I could,

2185
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,270
as I'm talking,

2186
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:33,800
I'm still eating the sandwich.

2187
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,410
I'm like,

2188
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,243
man.

2189
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:35,970
And he's like,

2190
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,290
um,

2191
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,180
the woman who's two seats down from you,

2192
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:42,440
she has a nut allergy so
you have to put that away.

2193
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,760
And I was just like,

2194
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,390
um,

2195
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,223
I won't,

2196
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,720
I won't like make her eat them,

2197
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,081
you know,

2198
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:50,990
like I won't rub them on her body.

2199
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:52,940
I'm just going to eat it right here.

2200
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:53,774
And he was like,

2201
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,041
it's actually,

2202
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:55,640
um,

2203
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,770
even if the nuts are in the air.

2204
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,180
And I looked over at the woman and I go,

2205
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:03,853
excuse me,

2206
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,270
I go,

2207
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,430
well you have a reaction,

2208
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:09,590
allergic reaction if there
are nuts in the hair.

2209
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:10,281
And she goes,

2210
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:11,114
yeah,

2211
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,500
I have an allergy and it's,

2212
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:13,250
I'll have a,

2213
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,490
I'll,

2214
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,250
I'll have a,

2215
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,610
an episode if there's nuts in the air.

2216
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,833
And uh,

2217
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,030
and I was just thinking like,

2218
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,631
I didn't say this,

2219
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:21,140
but I was like,

2220
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,670
shouldn't leave the house.

2221
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:23,020
Yeah.

2222
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:23,853
Right.

2223
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,930
Even real though,

2224
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,390
you can't go in the grocery store.

2225
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,260
So this is what happened.

2226
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:30,640
I go,

2227
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,250
oh no,

2228
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,130
I was in that incident.

2229
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,920
I was in that stage
where I was having like,

2230
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,240
like eating,

2231
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,520
like I was about to have eating blue
balls and where you're halfway through a

2232
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:39,490
sandwich and you're like,

2233
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,360
if I don't finish this sandwich,

2234
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:42,440
I'm going to flip out.

2235
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,610
So I said that the guy was like,

2236
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:46,250
is there anywhere I can eat this sandwich?

2237
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:46,851
And he said,

2238
00:59:46,851 --> 00:59:47,661
I'm not making this up.

2239
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:48,350
He goes,

2240
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,270
you can eat it in the bathroom.

2241
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:51,680
Wow.

2242
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,010
And so I w I mean,

2243
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:53,270
I,

2244
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:57,110
so I went to the bathroom and
I've finished my sandwich.

2245
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,790
Jesus Christ.

2246
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,520
But the nut allergy thing is strange.

2247
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:01,791
It's like,

2248
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:05,360
I really don't want people to die
because they have a nut allergy,

2249
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:06,530
but I'm also kind of like,

2250
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,410
well then I guess this is real you,

2251
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,580
the allergy thing.

2252
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:10,961
Yeah.

2253
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:11,794
This is Neil.

2254
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,010
Wow.

2255
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,060
That's crazy.

2256
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:15,181
Yeah.

2257
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:18,840
They should have breathing things that
they have to where they're going in

2258
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:19,600
public.

2259
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,120
It shouldn't go on the hundred and
50 passengers right in the flight.

2260
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:24,260
Yeah.

2261
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,100
That's where the person
with the nut allergy.

2262
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:28,170
Why can't you just have one
of those little Asian masks?

2263
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:28,411
You know,

2264
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:29,730
like the little white mass?

2265
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,713
Yeah.

2266
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,510
For starves.

2267
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:31,651
Yeah.

2268
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:32,340
It can be.

2269
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,090
Wow,

2270
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,230
this is really interesting.

2271
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,753
Hmm.

2272
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,640
That's doesn't seem right.

2273
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:40,840
And then I asked her,

2274
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:41,261
I go,

2275
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:41,831
is this,

2276
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:42,910
do you fly a lot?

2277
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:43,301
I mean,

2278
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:44,680
is this something you do?

2279
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,161
I mean,

2280
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:46,060
and she said,

2281
01:00:46,061 --> 01:00:46,360
uh,

2282
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:46,721
she said,

2283
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:46,931
yeah,

2284
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:48,650
and when I'm on southwest,

2285
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,970
I call an advance.

2286
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:50,804
When I call it advanced,

2287
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,950
they take all the nuts off the plane.

2288
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,510
Oh my God.

2289
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:55,961
She said,

2290
01:00:55,961 --> 01:00:59,950
there are no nuts on the plane when I fly.

2291
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,761
And I was just like,

2292
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:01,870
who is this girl

2293
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:04,121
power?

2294
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:05,230
Does she wheeled

2295
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:06,960
it is possible.

2296
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:07,651
Here's the thing,

2297
01:01:07,651 --> 01:01:08,011
they're saying,

2298
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:11,550
all those small amounts of peanut
protein can set off a severe reaction.

2299
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:15,480
It is rare that people get an allergic
reaction from just breathing and small

2300
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:16,920
particles of nuts or peanuts.

2301
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,510
That does mean it's possible.

2302
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,830
They said it's rare.

2303
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,873
Yeah,

2304
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,200
it's his most foods with peanuts in them
do not allow enough of the protein to

2305
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:28,860
escape into the air causing a
reaction and just cause the smell.

2306
01:01:28,861 --> 01:01:30,120
Foods containing peanuts,

2307
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:30,691
uh,

2308
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:33,870
won't produce reaction because the
scent does not contain the protein.

2309
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,720
So what w w she was just
freaking out at the possibility,

2310
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,830
but most likely since it was like a food,

2311
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:41,740
it wasn't just,

2312
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,520
it's a dust from the
crunching of the peanuts.

2313
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:47,730
Apparently that's enough apparently
to freak some people out.

2314
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,391
It's rare,

2315
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:49,770
but that's enough for some people,

2316
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,730
which is crazy.

2317
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:51,451
Yeah,

2318
01:01:51,451 --> 01:01:52,110
she should not.

2319
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,040
She should drive.

2320
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,130
We are weird thing.

2321
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:54,661
No Man.

2322
01:01:54,661 --> 01:01:57,780
To be allergic to a of of food so badly,

2323
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:00,660
like peanuts and not kill people.

2324
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:00,991
Man.

2325
01:02:00,991 --> 01:02:05,190
They're fucking poison and were like
peanut m and m's and fucking drama.

2326
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:05,461
Trump.

2327
01:02:05,461 --> 01:02:06,030
Trump.

2328
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,421
Imagine.

2329
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:09,600
How weird would it be grown
up where everybody's eating
poison everywhere around

2330
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:09,990
you.

2331
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,750
Everybody's eating some shit that
if you go to the supermarket,

2332
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,710
there's tubs of poison ivy.

2333
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,930
You go and get some peanut butter.

2334
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:16,800
That shit will kill.

2335
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:19,680
You always felt that
way about cell though.

2336
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:20,281
Oh really?

2337
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:22,380
From from from moment one.

2338
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,480
We're in cell phones started.

2339
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:24,540
You be ubiquitous.

2340
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,201
I was like,

2341
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:27,060
this is going to be the
cigarettes of our time.

2342
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,240
Well,

2343
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,073
that's ridiculous.

2344
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,050
That's really is bad as peanuts
to people allergic to peanuts.

2345
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,620
People that allergic to peanuts had
fucking kills you dead and it's everywhere

2346
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:36,900
in tubs of it and people are
eating it in front of you.

2347
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:37,441
CHOMP,

2348
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:37,710
chomp.

2349
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,540
It's like a common food for kids.

2350
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:40,383
Take the school,

2351
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,340
peanut butter and Jelly,

2352
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:42,540
but imagine if poison.

2353
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,120
Think about having this
to your head all the time.

2354
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,350
You get cancer from your cell phone.

2355
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:47,184
You're a pussy.

2356
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,113
That's what I say.

2357
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,440
I'm going to send some brain
cancer patients your way.

2358
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,310
It might be weird if
like in like 30 years.

2359
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,331
It might be weird though,

2360
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:55,230
and like 30 years.

2361
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,220
It's like the whole entire
state has cancer of the brain.

2362
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,750
We all die at the same time.

2363
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:04,470
Everybody's right thumb
rots off your texting.

2364
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:04,980
Thumb.

2365
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,813
Yeah.

2366
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,080
I don't,

2367
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,020
I don't think that it's
a that much of a concern.

2368
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:12,240
There's a lot of radiation
we just get from the sun.

2369
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:16,140
There's a lot of radiation we get from
just the environment every time you fly

2370
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:18,240
in a plane to get massive
amounts of radiation.

2371
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:18,840
Is that right?

2372
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,021
Yeah.

2373
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:20,460
Every time you get flying a plane,

2374
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:22,660
it's supposed to be worse than
going through those x ray machines.

2375
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:22,781
Oh,

2376
01:03:22,781 --> 01:03:23,460
Jesus.

2377
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:23,701
Yeah.

2378
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:25,470
You're up in the fucking high altitude.

2379
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:27,830
You're flying at 35,000 feet and yeah,

2380
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,250
my wife won't do the new one.

2381
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,113
The new x Ray.

2382
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:30,720
Oh really?

2383
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,740
She gets opted out.

2384
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,850
She opts out.

2385
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,460
She just is freaked out by it.

2386
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,240
She's Rod.

2387
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,830
Of radiation is right.

2388
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:38,370
Yeah.

2389
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:38,850
Yeah.

2390
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:43,740
I don't think they've adequately
researched the longterm effects of putting

2391
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,810
fucking weird particles
to people's bodies.

2392
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,160
And it might work on,

2393
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:47,611
you know,

2394
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:51,480
there's a thing about any sort of
exposure to things that you might be fine,

2395
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,410
I might be fine,

2396
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,400
but one person,

2397
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:55,230
just like the person
that's allergic to peanuts,

2398
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,730
people's bodies are weird,

2399
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:57,040
man.

2400
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,660
One person could have a totally different
reaction to that radiation and really

2401
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:01,680
get sick because of it.

2402
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,290
Everybody's built so different.

2403
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:05,251
You know,

2404
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:06,084
there's just,

2405
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:06,871
we have,

2406
01:04:06,871 --> 01:04:07,190
we,

2407
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:11,460
we have similar but varied bodies and
we have to take that into consideration

2408
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:11,781
when you,

2409
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:12,030
you know,

2410
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:12,631
find out what's,

2411
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:13,770
what's bad for people.

2412
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:15,720
For some people can't even have one drink.

2413
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,460
Does that mean we should take drinks away?

2414
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:18,360
That's ridiculous.

2415
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:19,200
Cause for most of us,

2416
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:20,070
drinks are great.

2417
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,410
Some people cannot have that one drink.

2418
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:24,240
So imagine living in a world,

2419
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:27,360
and I have friends that have done this
where they look at everybody drinking.

2420
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,194
Like you're just,

2421
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,580
this is everything you're doing.

2422
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:30,211
If I did,

2423
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:32,160
I would be dead in an alley in a week.

2424
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,950
I'd just fucking go on
a massive bender until,

2425
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:35,350
uh,

2426
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,690
I ran out of heartbeats.

2427
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:37,720
You know,

2428
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,553
and that's,

2429
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:39,690
it's around us everywhere.

2430
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:40,563
Yeah.

2431
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,060
We varied too much.

2432
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,070
We need to collectively,

2433
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:44,860
there's is,

2434
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,200
we've got a big spectrum

2435
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,780
of physical,

2436
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,580
psychological everything.

2437
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,960
Do you ever thinking
about running for office?

2438
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,610
Fuck that for

2439
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,730
running for offices.

2440
01:04:56,731 --> 01:05:00,210
Like it'd be like becoming a pro wrestler.

2441
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:00,940
It's a,

2442
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,773
it would be like,

2443
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:02,070
oh,

2444
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,270
this Zillow way.

2445
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:06,360
You could equate the two because you're
following like a script in a certain

2446
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:06,481
way.

2447
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:08,070
You're following a script in your ear.

2448
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,850
You're entering into some
artificial sort of a situation.

2449
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,660
This isn't,

2450
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,670
this isn't real like Paul Ryan,

2451
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,110
we don't know Paul Ryan.

2452
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,650
We don't know Mitt Romney.

2453
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,730
Mitt Romney doesn't even know.

2454
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:21,970
Mitt Romney was very uninspired
by the speeches last night.

2455
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,243
Sorry,

2456
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:24,283
I'm in a movie.

2457
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,340
I watched those speeches and I was really
actually really open minded to like,

2458
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:27,491
Hey,

2459
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:28,360
what do you guys God?

2460
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,250
And then I just came away just being like,

2461
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:30,640
oh,

2462
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:30,980
okay.

2463
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,370
Now it was all rhetoric.

2464
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,890
It was all get back the country.

2465
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,820
You,

2466
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,830
if you have a small business,

2467
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:40,420
you did build it.

2468
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,640
And it was all just bad,

2469
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:43,301
clunky,

2470
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:44,530
shitty speeches.

2471
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,130
Yeah.

2472
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:49,210
They played a Reagan speech from when
Reagan was running against Jimmy Carter

2473
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,141
and I was like,

2474
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:53,220
God Damn Reagan in the
campaign trail could fuck it.

2475
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:54,070
Throw it down.

2476
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:54,933
Oh yeah.

2477
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:55,421
He wasn't,

2478
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:55,721
yeah,

2479
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:57,340
being an actor in,

2480
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:57,671
you know,

2481
01:05:57,671 --> 01:06:01,000
even though he was getting on in his
days when he was running for president,

2482
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,360
the effects of the presidency,

2483
01:06:02,361 --> 01:06:04,900
he hadn't quite broken him down
like it did during his term.

2484
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:05,871
But he,

2485
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:10,871
he stomped Carter in this two minute
speech about what's the difference between

2486
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:16,180
a recession and a depression or recession
is when a neighbor's out of a job,

2487
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,630
a depression is when
you're out of a job and a,

2488
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:22,300
and the crowd was cheering and you know,

2489
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:23,134
and he's like,

2490
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,940
and to get rid of this depression,

2491
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:26,980
we need to put Jimmy Carter out of a job.

2492
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:27,460
And the,

2493
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,990
they went fucking ape shit.

2494
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:29,980
I was like,

2495
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,550
whoa.

2496
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,680
You imagine having that guy
breathing down your heels.

2497
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,060
Ronald Reagan,

2498
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:37,620
handsome ass actor now
talking a lot of sense.

2499
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,030
I'll wait till Clooney runs
for office and like 10 years,

2500
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,433
no kids.

2501
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,460
He's got no kids.

2502
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,070
People are never going to listen
to a man who doesn't have children.

2503
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,400
They're not going to listen to a man.

2504
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:47,090
It doesn't have children.

2505
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:47,740
Trust me,

2506
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,710
the people who have children will never
listened to a man who doesn't have

2507
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:54,250
children because they know that there's
a physiological change that happens in a

2508
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:57,820
person's body and your brain and your
consciousness and your understanding of

2509
01:06:57,821 --> 01:06:58,560
relationships.

2510
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:58,891
But when you,

2511
01:06:58,891 --> 01:06:59,950
when you have your own children,

2512
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:01,160
and he doesn't have his own children yet,

2513
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,410
but when he runs for president,

2514
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:03,244
he's going to have two,

2515
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,030
two year olds,

2516
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:04,720
twins,

2517
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,190
Donner's maybe we want to see your kids
get to be about 15 before you running.

2518
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:09,730
She,

2519
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,301
Matt Damon,

2520
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:11,134
he has kids.

2521
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:12,490
Matt Damon could run for office,

2522
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,900
but the real problem is that the whole
system is completely fucked sideways by

2523
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:17,734
corruption.

2524
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,990
There's no way you can
run for office to do what?

2525
01:07:19,991 --> 01:07:21,060
To be the bidding of the,

2526
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,590
you're going to be at the bidding of
these giant corporations are going to have

2527
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:24,424
bullets in your brain.

2528
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:25,211
Well,

2529
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:26,310
you know what the game is.

2530
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,070
It's true.

2531
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:27,521
This is,

2532
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:31,600
this thing's been bought and sold and
if it wasn't proved to us by Obama,

2533
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,620
I mean come on.

2534
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,690
A guy who was the parent or his,

2535
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,220
his parent is a single mom,

2536
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:36,910
right?

2537
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:39,730
He's raised in a interracial relationship,

2538
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,930
grows up poor lives in Hawaii for a while.

2539
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,621
I mean you,

2540
01:07:44,621 --> 01:07:44,830
you,

2541
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,260
you were talking about a
guy who's a total outsider,

2542
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,130
right?

2543
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,510
And look what happens when he gets in.

2544
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:53,890
He passes things like the National Defense
Authorization Act that just blindly

2545
01:07:53,891 --> 01:07:57,640
allows them to arrest people and they
have no recourse and allows them to use

2546
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:58,750
the military to,

2547
01:07:58,751 --> 01:07:59,170
to,

2548
01:07:59,170 --> 01:07:59,620
to,

2549
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,190
to block civil unrest and to stop
civil unrest in this country.

2550
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:06,280
All Shit that's supposed to be prevented
in the constitution and he's just

2551
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:07,660
allowing this stuff to go through.

2552
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,310
Why is he allowing this
stuff to go through?

2553
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:09,921
Is that what the,

2554
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:12,010
the child of a single
parent would really want?

2555
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,180
Not The fuck it is.

2556
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:14,920
He doesn't have a say.

2557
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,040
He's at the bidding.

2558
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,930
They're all at the bidding of money.

2559
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,820
And what is the best way to make money?

2560
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:22,460
The best way to make money is
let these motherfuckers loose,

2561
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,500
let them do what they want
to do and other countries,

2562
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:27,590
little sleeves and make this happen is
as you give them reasons why we've got to

2563
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:28,424
make this happen.

2564
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,760
And that money just
keeps fucking flying in.

2565
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:35,720
And these guys are in our vampire orgy
of blood money just dancing around and

2566
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:37,400
drinking in it and they
don't want it to stop.

2567
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,930
And so Obama,

2568
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:40,430
who says that he's going to stop wars,

2569
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:41,240
all the sudden he has to,

2570
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,540
he wins a Nobel peace prize and he
has to send 30,000 more troops to

2571
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,374
Afghanistan.

2572
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,730
What is that?

2573
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,260
Is that what do you really think?

2574
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:49,230
That's what he wants to do.

2575
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,110
Do you really think that's
what his big changes is?

2576
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,060
Big changes that,

2577
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:53,421
come on,

2578
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,170
man,

2579
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,003
it's all crazy.

2580
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,411
No one does.

2581
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:56,760
It's a,

2582
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,980
this is a broken system.

2583
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:58,941
You're watching these,

2584
01:08:58,941 --> 01:08:59,691
these candidates,

2585
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:00,524
you know like this is,

2586
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:05,590
this is the last death
throes of a dying situation,

2587
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:11,390
a dying configuration in the configuration
of Democrat versus Republican.

2588
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:11,971
You know,

2589
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:14,300
and what we're going to do is get a man,

2590
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,230
I got back to the small business,

2591
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,040
to the families.

2592
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,540
It's like eat.

2593
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:21,201
It's like you're,

2594
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:23,780
you're making those
close encounters noises,

2595
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:24,171
dude.

2596
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:24,501
Dude,

2597
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:25,130
dude,

2598
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,440
do you not even say anything?

2599
01:09:27,441 --> 01:09:29,930
He just making the noises
that the people want to hear.

2600
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:35,350
You're making the conservative noise
you use is sort of underlyingly racist.

2601
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,710
Look a little,

2602
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:36,980
you know,

2603
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,860
let's get it back away from this black
guy's Kinda fucked everything up.

2604
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,540
Look how white my wife is.

2605
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:41,710
He goes,

2606
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,890
there's a little of that going on.

2607
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,140
It's nod sands.

2608
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,770
And meanwhile the same companies will
be controlling things no matter who's in

2609
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,633
control.

2610
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,270
We get ramped up and shit like gay
marriage and immigration and all this

2611
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:55,940
different stuff that nobody really gives
a fuck about at the top of the heap.

2612
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,180
And they just keep sucking
money out of the system.

2613
01:09:59,181 --> 01:10:02,450
The whole time we're dancing around
worrying about whether dude should be

2614
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,390
labeled or write things down and say,

2615
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,410
I'm of this now,

2616
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,490
and you're of that now.

2617
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,031
And you know,

2618
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:09,180
and then it becomes legal that were,

2619
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,340
were dicking around about that.

2620
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,890
The same people are running shit
that I've always been running.

2621
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:13,580
Shit.

2622
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,241
It's hilarious.

2623
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:15,010
Really.

2624
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,110
It's when it becomes more
and more transparent,

2625
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,650
you realize like what an incredible job
they've done of just keeping everybody

2626
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,140
in the dark and just running
things from the background.

2627
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,003
Yeah.

2628
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,050
As far as like running the world,

2629
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:28,490
it's really the,

2630
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,860
the fucking banks have
done a fantastic job.

2631
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,260
I mean in,

2632
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:37,160
in despite of all the competition or
the access to information people have

2633
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:37,440
today,

2634
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,090
the fact they still run
it the way they run it,

2635
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:39,963
it's like amazing.

2636
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,180
I've done a great job.

2637
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,440
They're bad motherfuckers.

2638
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:43,683
Yeah,

2639
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:44,803
just depressing.

2640
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,793
It is depressing.

2641
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:46,540
It's,

2642
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:46,980
you know,

2643
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:47,690
who would want,

2644
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,111
you know,

2645
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:52,310
what person of our age group would
want war at this stage of life?

2646
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,680
What person would think
that that's the best option?

2647
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,620
Culture.

2648
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,453
Last night,

2649
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,770
like Mccain and his speech was saying,

2650
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,730
we should raise defense bending,

2651
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:04,990
raise defense spending.

2652
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,810
There are so crazy what
you guys are trying to say.

2653
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:08,060
We,

2654
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,850
we shouldn't spend so much money.

2655
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:11,740
I was very confused by what,

2656
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,090
what they were saying.

2657
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,100
Their message was.

2658
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,260
The word defense is a funny
word because it's not deep.

2659
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,520
It's over the country.

2660
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,880
So when you say raised defense spending,

2661
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,480
I'm down for strengthening
anything in America,

2662
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,260
but I think,

2663
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:25,590
um,

2664
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:29,820
I don't see any reason to send someone's
kids to some other fucking country to

2665
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:33,450
shoot some people they never met because
some assholes say that that's the thing

2666
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:35,790
that needs to be done that
don't make any sense to me.

2667
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,500
It's not that you know,

2668
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,560
you don't support the troops and it's not
that you don't think that it's good to

2669
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:43,080
have a strong army because
I absolutely do and do,

2670
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:44,130
but oh,

2671
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,870
this is just fucking Kate,

2672
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,823
praise Enos.

2673
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,850
This is chaos.

2674
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:49,440
And no one wants to admit it is.

2675
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,491
So you're just,

2676
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:53,190
you're dealing with these two guys
that are essentially going to,

2677
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,330
it's going to very,

2678
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:55,164
very little.

2679
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,990
Maybe there's going to be like some
social debate going on in here,

2680
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:58,861
maybe a,

2681
01:11:58,861 --> 01:11:59,400
you know,

2682
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,920
gay people have a harder time.

2683
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,370
It'll be harder to get medical pot.

2684
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:02,851
I mean,

2685
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:03,330
maybe.

2686
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:03,931
But other than that,

2687
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:05,100
what the fuck is going to change?

2688
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:06,503
Not that much.

2689
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:07,081
Not that much.

2690
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:07,320
It's good

2691
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,740
changes to 46.

2692
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:10,010
All right.

2693
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,290
Yeah,

2694
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,940
we're good with tight.

2695
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:12,561
You got to get out of here.

2696
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,980
So just did I think at three I
got to go over and be on Conan.

2697
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,280
I think at three they get three.

2698
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:21,140
What time do you actually
go on stage there?

2699
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,543
I don't know.

2700
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,100
Well I heard they're going to wait

2701
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:27,520
before you,

2702
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,080
I'm in a haze of um,

2703
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:34,990
kind of interviews and stuff like that
these days and come in here is just kind

2704
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:36,550
of like taking time off.

2705
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:38,973
I don't have to,

2706
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,473
it's like we don't,

2707
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,290
there's no hard interview questions.

2708
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,370
It's just kind of hanging out.

2709
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,320
It's hard when you're dealing with like,

2710
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,280
you have to try to be entertaining
all the time and you have to like,

2711
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:48,500
yeah.

2712
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,420
Well you answered the same
questions over and over

2713
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,293
and over again.

2714
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:51,891
He,

2715
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:52,400
uh,

2716
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,233
I did,

2717
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:57,200
I invited you to that WGA screening
the other night and it was,

2718
01:12:57,201 --> 01:12:58,034
um,

2719
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,660
it was crazy cause Tim Robbins
was there and Tom Hanks where,

2720
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,180
oh,

2721
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:02,731
that's awesome.

2722
01:13:02,731 --> 01:13:03,590
Really crazy.

2723
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:04,580
And that was crazy.

2724
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,833
They were saying,

2725
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,320
Tim Robbins was saying to me that he
was like what you're experiencing right

2726
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:10,070
now,

2727
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:12,230
this kind of haze of like
press junk and all that stuff.

2728
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:13,640
It's basically what

2729
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,000
they would do if they literally,

2730
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:19,430
if they wanted to make you insane,

2731
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:24,110
it's stick you in a room and ask you the
same question over and over again all

2732
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:24,180
day.

2733
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,690
Right until you crack and
that's what you're doing.

2734
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:29,440
That's your life right now and yeah,

2735
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,410
that's like if you were
like a guilty person,

2736
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,680
they would bring in a series
of investigators that would
ask you the exact same

2737
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:37,290
question and see if you
have the same answer.

2738
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:37,650
Yeah,

2739
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,060
that's actually a great idea,

2740
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,730
isn't that you're gonna have
like a hundred investigators
and they give you the

2741
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:44,400
same questions and you have
to give detailed stories.

2742
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,720
You would fuck that thing off.

2743
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:46,623
Yeah,

2744
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,790
so it's been like a hay is,

2745
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:49,743
wow.

2746
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:50,993
What did you move called?

2747
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,980
Sleepwalk with me.

2748
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:54,560
Sleep walkways meaning you
the screen or did send,

2749
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:55,190
did you get it?

2750
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:55,960
I don't really get it yet.

2751
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,793
I heard you want to watch the chair.

2752
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:57,703
Let's watch the trailer,

2753
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:58,600
throw it up,

2754
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,030
trying to get it.

2755
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,863
Here you go.

2756
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,551
It's true.

2757
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:05,880
I always had to tell people that because
inevitably someone will come up to me

2758
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:06,390
and they'll be like,

2759
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,660
good,

2760
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,493
true.

2761
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,101
I'll be like,

2762
01:14:08,101 --> 01:14:08,934
yeah,

2763
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,730
and be like,

2764
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:10,563
Whoa,

2765
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,540
I don't know how to respond to that.

2766
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,280
Like I guess I could say it louder,

2767
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:15,701
you know,

2768
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:15,911
like,

2769
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:16,750
yeah,

2770
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,261
they'd be like,

2771
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:18,190
it's probably true.

2772
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:18,990
So loud.

2773
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:19,823
Okay.

2774
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,340
Y'All ready to lip sync?

2775
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,200
I can't hear you.

2776
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,600
It's my lip sync joke.

2777
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,060
So here's what happened.

2778
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,860
My girlfriend Abby and I moved into,

2779
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,570
she's great and my sister Janet got
and get your next coming your way,

2780
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:43,600
but it'd be better on everyone
started talking about marriage

2781
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,920
and that night I started walking.

2782
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,783
My sleep

2783
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,630
is a sleep walking thing going on

2784
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:03,100
as things with my
girlfriend got more tense,

2785
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,990
my sleepwalking more did
it Mac the first place.

2786
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,430
This is the first time I remember
thinking maybe I should see a doctor,

2787
01:15:16,431 --> 01:15:18,980
and then I thought maybe I'll eat dinner

2788
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:24,170
alone with dinner

2789
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:29,640
and decided I'm not going to get married
until I'm sure that nothing else good

2790
01:15:29,641 --> 01:15:30,810
can happen in my life.

2791
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:32,610
You just say that on stage.

2792
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:33,990
One day I asked my girlfriend,

2793
01:15:33,991 --> 01:15:35,280
what do you fear most?

2794
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:35,820
And she said,

2795
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,850
I fear you'll meet someone
else and they'll leave me.

2796
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,701
I'll be all alone.

2797
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,151
And she said,

2798
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:39,820
what do you feel?

2799
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,120
Oh,

2800
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:40,953
and I said,

2801
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:41,873
bears

2802
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,450
as your girlfriend heard the checks.

2803
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:47,000
Now is,

2804
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,833
she probably mentioned it.

2805
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,510
You said you're going to
go see the doctor get,

2806
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,400
don't you say you want to be a comedian?

2807
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,510
You're a bartender.

2808
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:52,871
I mean,

2809
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:54,820
pick a damn plan and stick with it.

2810
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:55,901
He's getting,

2811
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:57,670
but he's not as funny as you.

2812
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:00,760
My parents have been together 40 years,

2813
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:01,330
which is,

2814
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:01,531
yeah,

2815
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:01,810
no,

2816
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,200
but it's,

2817
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,130
it's too long.

2818
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,720
If you're ever in a relationship that's
moving towards marriage and you're not

2819
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:11,400
ready to go to my sister Janet's wet

2820
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:18,370
tshirt loser.

2821
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,793
Sorry.

2822
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:21,131
No,

2823
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:21,964
I like it.

2824
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:25,290
Great,

2825
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:25,860
man.

2826
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,693
It looks great.

2827
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:29,460
It was a couple of really good
lines and he gave Mark Marin apart.

2828
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:31,520
So that's a,

2829
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,353
that's a big,

2830
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,560
like altruistic move he had.

2831
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:35,394
I had a,

2832
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,180
I don't know,

2833
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,500
first time I went on his podcast,

2834
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:38,040
we,

2835
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,120
we really threw down.

2836
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:40,140
He really hated me.

2837
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,920
He hated me for a long time and
he hated me for a long time.

2838
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,550
Yeah,

2839
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,230
he's crazy.

2840
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,063
He hates everybody.

2841
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,070
Hates himself.

2842
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:49,410
But then the family tries
to be nice guy though.

2843
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,080
He's been really nice to me in the last

2844
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,170
tactic that people do.

2845
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:55,520
Yeah.

2846
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,890
They create conflict and then somehow
know the conflict gets resolved.

2847
01:16:58,891 --> 01:17:01,650
And then there's like this emotional
connection because you have something at

2848
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:01,981
stake.

2849
01:17:01,981 --> 01:17:04,470
I think he's a little bit
addicted to conflict a little bit.

2850
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,530
What did he not like about you?

2851
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:08,281
Oh,

2852
01:17:08,281 --> 01:17:09,114
we didn't know each,

2853
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:09,850
he just said this,

2854
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:11,920
a distorted perception of me and this,

2855
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,090
and he has this issue with people selling
out and had this issue with me doing

2856
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:17,690
fear factor.

2857
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:18,523
I'm like,

2858
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:24,050
shut your fucking punk rock
nonsense selling out please.

2859
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,220
But he's great in the movie.

2860
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:25,940
And uh,

2861
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:26,091
yeah.

2862
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:29,660
Lauren Ambrose and Carol
Kane and Mark's a good guy.

2863
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:30,680
He's just crazy.

2864
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,810
Yeah.

2865
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:33,080
But that's why he's good at what he does.

2866
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:33,801
Get what he does.

2867
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:34,250
Yeah.

2868
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,570
He's very good at interviewing people.

2869
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,440
Yes.

2870
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,273
And he's not,

2871
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,550
uh,

2872
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:37,850
you know,

2873
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:38,680
some people,

2874
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,513
uh,

2875
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,960
just can't quite get,

2876
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,430
get the,

2877
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,730
the spark going,

2878
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:44,360
you know,

2879
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,990
it's awkward interviews like when
someone's acts asking like halfhearted

2880
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:49,910
questions or it doesn't
have the passion for it,

2881
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,810
it was very uncomfortable to listen to.

2882
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:53,840
That's most interviews.

2883
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,321
Yeah,

2884
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:54,651
isn't it?

2885
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:55,070
Yeah.

2886
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,790
Like that's why those press chunk,

2887
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:57,624
it has to be,

2888
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,860
especially for x stand up when you,

2889
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:01,101
you know,

2890
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:01,400
you,

2891
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:01,760
you know,

2892
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,690
so calm,

2893
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:04,900
like always aware of
people's attention span.

2894
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:08,720
You and I were talking the other day
about they want me to do all of these like

2895
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:08,750
morning,

2896
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,570
local morning TV shows and uh,

2897
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,430
and it's hard because they don't,

2898
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:16,280
when you say on those
local morning TV shows,

2899
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:17,540
when you say a joke,

2900
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,591
they'll say,

2901
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,090
I don't know what you mean.

2902
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,280
That's the worst.

2903
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,960
That's the opposite of laughter.

2904
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,480
The moment you have to
start explaining a joke,

2905
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:28,314
you're done.

2906
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:31,090
I was saying if you're,

2907
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,670
if you're on one of those shows,

2908
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:33,900
any comedian should do this.

2909
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:34,571
If you're unwell.

2910
01:18:34,571 --> 01:18:34,741
Oh,

2911
01:18:34,741 --> 01:18:35,390
shows,

2912
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:38,250
well you should do is just
immediately break into a Tracy Morgan.

2913
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,730
It's almost getting pregnant.

2914
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,060
He started rubbing your belly cause
that's like the funniest thing that's ever

2915
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:48,560
happened on one of those morning
shows is Tracy Borg rubbing his belly.

2916
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:51,780
This Mammane call and call.

2917
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,060
Some will get them pregnant.

2918
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,500
And when he did that,

2919
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:59,501
this poor fool and this silly show
was just flabbergasted age or race.

2920
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,290
He didn't know what to say.

2921
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:06,500
Stuck with a wild man on your show

2922
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:08,883
pregnant.

2923
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,040
He would still have his belly go.

2924
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:10,310
Does he?

2925
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,450
His mom wait and call.

2926
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,390
Did you,

2927
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,130
did you write a book first?

2928
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:16,450
Is that how this movie came out?

2929
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:17,283
One man show.

2930
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:19,210
It was a one man show
off Broadway in New York.

2931
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:19,961
Sleepwalk with me,

2932
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:20,950
the one man show and then,

2933
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,020
and then I adapted it into a film.

2934
01:19:23,021 --> 01:19:25,930
And then along the way I actually did,

2935
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,750
I wrote a book that was sleepwalk with me.

2936
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:29,950
It was a chapter in the book,

2937
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:31,630
sleepwalk with me and other
painfully true stories.

2938
01:19:31,631 --> 01:19:34,270
It was just comedic essays
about sort of painful.

2939
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,800
So the sleep walking part is true.

2940
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:36,551
Yeah.

2941
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:38,420
I jumped through a second
story window and my sleep.

2942
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,850
Oh my God.

2943
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,330
Yeah.

2944
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,800
Holy Shit Dude.

2945
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:42,663
Yeah.

2946
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,020
So you wake up when,

2947
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:47,680
when you hit the ground as I was running
on the front lawn in my underwear

2948
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:48,514
bleeding,

2949
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,360
I'm like,

2950
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,530
oh my God.

2951
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,370
Yeah.

2952
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,960
Second story window.

2953
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,510
Quinta Inn in Walla Walla,

2954
01:19:55,511 --> 01:19:56,344
Washington.

2955
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,910
Holy Shit was so you were on the road,

2956
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,321
the road?

2957
01:19:59,321 --> 01:19:59,890
Yeah.

2958
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:01,720
Oh my God.

2959
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,700
How crazy are you on a one to 10?

2960
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,573
What's going on here?

2961
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,190
What's going on is I was diagnosed
with what's called rem behavior

2962
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,023
disorder.

2963
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:09,720
Uh,

2964
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,370
but on a scale of one to 10,

2965
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,753
eight

2966
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:15,560
crazy,

2967
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,473
crazy.

2968
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,560
I Dunno.

2969
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,010
Damn.

2970
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:21,090
There's something up with comedians.

2971
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,610
So do you have like a tool now that
you travel with like a belt that's like

2972
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:24,861
smell,

2973
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:26,620
like hooked up to like a no joke.

2974
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,350
I sleep,

2975
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,750
uh,

2976
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:30,130
in every night and a
sleeping bag up to my neck.

2977
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:34,360
And for a while I would wear mittens so
I couldn't wear open the sleeping bag

2978
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,740
and I take medication,

2979
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:36,071
I take,

2980
01:20:36,071 --> 01:20:38,890
I take an anti anxiety
that the doctor prescribed.

2981
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,830
Wow.

2982
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,620
Yeah.

2983
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,490
That's so strange.

2984
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:42,090
Do you,

2985
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,320
is there a trigger?

2986
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,400
Is there something that

2987
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:45,201
anxiety,

2988
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:45,681
stress,

2989
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:46,880
sleep deprivation,

2990
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,100
like all this stuff
that's really not good.

2991
01:20:49,101 --> 01:20:49,934
Sleep hygiene.

2992
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:51,000
Wow.

2993
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,170
And it makes you just complete.

2994
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,013
Makes me not know.

2995
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:54,570
Dreams.

2996
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:59,070
It makes me act dreams and usually my
dreams have to do with me running away

2997
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:01,200
from some kind of demon or wild animal.

2998
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,431
Wow.

2999
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:05,900
What the fuck man?

3000
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,160
Holy Shit.

3001
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:08,180
That's got to be crazy.

3002
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,130
I told a story about,

3003
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:10,460
um,

3004
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:15,460
I've told us on stage before about being
in San Francisco during a fire and uh,

3005
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,580
there was uh,

3006
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,660
it was four 30 in the morning.

3007
01:21:17,661 --> 01:21:22,100
We all got evacuated from the hotel room
and a lot of people sleep with Ambien

3008
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:23,451
when they're,

3009
01:21:23,451 --> 01:21:24,950
when they're woken up like that,

3010
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,750
they don't know what the fuck is going on.

3011
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:31,070
And you could see it in their face and
they would wake up in the middle of like

3012
01:21:31,071 --> 01:21:32,210
walking down the stairs.

3013
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,420
So this guy was like in front of us
and he was in the middle and there's a

3014
01:21:35,421 --> 01:21:37,730
fucking whole line of people
trying to get out of this hotel.

3015
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:38,090
Right.

3016
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:40,250
Hundreds of people on
the stairs and it's a,

3017
01:21:40,251 --> 01:21:41,870
it's a really narrow staircase.

3018
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,890
One person case as well.

3019
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,950
Well people were waking up
like where are we doing?

3020
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:46,783
What are we doing?

3021
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:51,440
Like waking up in the middle of walking
down the stairs and the wife was like

3022
01:21:51,441 --> 01:21:52,274
yelling at the guy,

3023
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,980
just keep walking the hotel to hotel.

3024
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,873
What hotel?

3025
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,863
Where are we?

3026
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,370
We're in San Francisco.

3027
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:00,650
The hotel's on fire were on fire.

3028
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:03,770
Like literally didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

3029
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,570
Just whacked out on Ambien.

3030
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:09,800
Kevin James made a Turkey
when he was on Ambien.

3031
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:10,990
Really?

3032
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,823
I made a Turkey,

3033
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:13,970
made a fucking target,

3034
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,013
didn't know about it.

3035
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:15,951
Got Up in the morning.

3036
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:16,161
I was like,

3037
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:20,930
what the fuck is all this like didn't
know that he went and cooked some food.

3038
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:22,743
It's crazy.

3039
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:23,860
Sorry.

3040
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,520
My sister growing up when
she was like 11 or 12,

3041
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:29,610
my mom found her walking down the
street over our neighborhood naked.

3042
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:30,810
And I'm like thinking,

3043
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:31,051
oh,

3044
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:31,590
how,

3045
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:34,040
what are the odds that maybe
just some guy drove by himself.

3046
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,700
What a naked 11 year old.

3047
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:36,090
Hey,

3048
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:36,841
walking on the street,

3049
01:22:36,841 --> 01:22:37,674
my lucky day

3050
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:41,140
guy who was convicted of he,

3051
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,990
he murdered someone close to him,

3052
01:22:43,991 --> 01:22:44,560
like his,

3053
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:44,891
his,

3054
01:22:44,891 --> 01:22:45,310
uh,

3055
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:48,130
parents or his mother in
law or something like that,

3056
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,590
drove to their house in his sleep.

3057
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,670
Do you know this case?

3058
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,440
There's cases where it's
been used as an alibi this,

3059
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:55,540
but this guy got off.

3060
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:55,721
Yeah.

3061
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:56,230
No.

3062
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:58,750
People who have gotten off
kilter with it like a crowbar,

3063
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,250
I'm going to start sleepwalking,

3064
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:01,623
cry.

3065
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,300
Can't talk about it first on a podcast.

3066
01:23:04,301 --> 01:23:05,134
Dude,

3067
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:05,620
that's a,

3068
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:05,980
that's a

3069
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,240
paper trail right there.

3070
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:08,890
Fuck them.

3071
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:09,400
Yeah.

3072
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:09,851
How,

3073
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:10,330
um,

3074
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:12,040
how could you get away with that in the,

3075
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:12,300
um,

3076
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,240
a court of law,

3077
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:15,670
w w w w since you have it,

3078
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:16,630
what would they say?

3079
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:16,931
Like,

3080
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:17,510
what is a,

3081
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:18,490
if I killed somebody,

3082
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,110
anything you do like,

3083
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,390
well obviously when you
walked out that window,

3084
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:24,100
I think there's no question
that you were drinking.

3085
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:24,971
Yeah,

3086
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:28,230
I had a dream that there was a guided
missile headed towards my hotel rooms.

3087
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,380
And if there were all these,

3088
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:34,300
there were all these military personnel
in the room and they said the military

3089
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,260
personnel said to me,

3090
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,930
the missile coordinates are
set specifically on you.

3091
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:43,200
So I jumped out my window
so as to detonate outside
the window for the sake of

3092
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:43,990
the platoon.

3093
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,920
Wow.

3094
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,480
Oh my God.

3095
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:48,220
Yeah.

3096
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:48,401
Yeah.

3097
01:23:48,401 --> 01:23:53,401
This guy beat his mother-in-law to
death and choked his father in law into

3098
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:55,240
unconsciousness.

3099
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,540
She is US Christ.

3100
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:00,580
When was the last episode that you had?

3101
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,830
That was even just a slight prob.

3102
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:02,921
Well,

3103
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:07,921
you know what's crazy is that making a
film is actually not the healthiest thing

3104
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,370
for sleep,

3105
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,201
sleep disorders.

3106
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:14,830
So like I was having anxiety and sleep
deprived and I was sleep deprived and I

3107
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:16,900
was directing and I was directing myself,

3108
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,180
acting out things that
I'd done in my life.

3109
01:24:19,181 --> 01:24:20,014
So I was,

3110
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,910
I had an episode where
I was sleep walking.

3111
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:25,840
My wife came in and I was adjusting
lamps in the bedroom and she was like,

3112
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:26,441
what are you doing?

3113
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:26,831
And I'm just like,

3114
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:27,664
we're shooting.

3115
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:28,841
And she was like,

3116
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:29,111
no,

3117
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:30,100
we're not shooting.

3118
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:30,670
And I go,

3119
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:31,630
I'm sorry,

3120
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:32,850
but we are like,

3121
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,480
I was actually patronizing her,

3122
01:24:34,481 --> 01:24:37,780
which is the worst thing you can do
when you're sleep walking is just insult

3123
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,210
people for not understanding
of your reality.

3124
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:40,601
Like,

3125
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:40,721
Oh,

3126
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:41,950
you're so stupid,

3127
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,010
you don't get it.

3128
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,090
Don't get it.

3129
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,960
Oh my God,

3130
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:50,080
that's gotta be so weird as anybody
ever videotaped you doing it?

3131
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,263
No,

3132
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,060
but I have this,

3133
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,170
I would have been the great
wacking credits for your movie.

3134
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:55,004
You have this great,

3135
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:56,431
well no,

3136
01:24:56,431 --> 01:24:56,651
no.

3137
01:24:56,651 --> 01:25:01,510
In the credits of the movie are the
actual photographs of the window.

3138
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:03,910
I jumped through and me at the hospital,

3139
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:06,580
I took photos of all of it
because when it happened,

3140
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:09,790
I knew no one's going to believe this.

3141
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,380
This is too crazy.

3142
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,510
And so that's the credits of the movie,

3143
01:25:13,511 --> 01:25:14,980
but smashed the window and everything.

3144
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:15,401
Like he did it,

3145
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:16,870
like James Bond stuff
jumped through the window,

3146
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:17,704
like the hulk.

3147
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:18,131
Oh Mike.

3148
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:20,650
And I say that cause that's how I
described it at the emergency room.

3149
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:20,921
I was like,

3150
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:21,101
you know,

3151
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:21,581
the Hulk,

3152
01:25:21,581 --> 01:25:21,761
you know,

3153
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:23,650
he just kind of jumped
through windows and walls.

3154
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:24,430
That's like me.

3155
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,420
Holy Shit.

3156
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:26,230
And um,

3157
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:26,710
yeah,

3158
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:26,891
no,

3159
01:25:26,891 --> 01:25:27,970
I've never videoed myself,

3160
01:25:27,971 --> 01:25:32,971
but I have this great new video
technology called my wife who remembers

3161
01:25:33,581 --> 01:25:34,151
everything.

3162
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:36,670
I see whatever I do or say.

3163
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,370
So she's kind of explained
to me what it looks.

3164
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:40,360
She's your dictator.

3165
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,030
She dictates I,

3166
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:43,690
it's kind of a hacky male men,

3167
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:43,991
men,

3168
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:44,501
woman thing.

3169
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:47,740
But my wife remembers every thing,

3170
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,420
every thing.

3171
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,230
That's funny.

3172
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:50,680
You're right,

3173
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:50,930
uh,

3174
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:51,820
rights here by the way.

3175
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:52,121
Oh,

3176
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:52,470
is it?

3177
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,303
Yeah.

3178
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:53,971
Well Dude,

3179
01:25:53,971 --> 01:25:54,491
thank you very much.

3180
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:55,150
This is,

3181
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,670
this is a story that we were talking
about if anybody's interested in looking

3182
01:25:57,671 --> 01:25:58,190
up.

3183
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:58,740
Um,

3184
01:25:58,740 --> 01:25:59,040
there,

3185
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,520
there was a guy from Toronto,

3186
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,040
uh,

3187
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:01,450
in,

3188
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,283
he had a,

3189
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,190
he lost his due to embezzlement

3190
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,110
and he suffered from a gambling addiction.

3191
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,140
So he,

3192
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:08,240
the guy was in some serious,

3193
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:09,074
serious debt.

3194
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,711
So because of that,

3195
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:12,920
he had a high level of
slight of stress and sleep,

3196
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:13,880
induce insomnia.

3197
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,020
And he drove,

3198
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:16,010
he got up in his car,

3199
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:16,910
Rosemond his bed.

3200
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,580
He drove 14 miles of the
home of his wife's parents.

3201
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:21,590
Yeah.

3202
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,780
He removed a tire iron from the car,

3203
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:26,720
entered the house and he beat
the mother-in-law to death,

3204
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,370
choke the Father Law on consciousness.

3205
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,560
And then he used a knife from
the kitchen to stab them.

3206
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:31,010
I don't,

3207
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:31,970
I don't buy that.

3208
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:34,140
I don't buy that as an alibi.

3209
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:35,043
Seems like a it.

3210
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,013
Anyway.

3211
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:36,861
Yeah.

3212
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:37,461
And then he turned,

3213
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:39,380
turned himself into a police station.

3214
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:40,623
My that,

3215
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,690
cause I mean I,

3216
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:46,240
I have this disorder and I could not
imagine doing anything that like,

3217
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:50,410
basically the reason I wear a sleeping
bag is that if you undo the sleeping bag,

3218
01:26:50,411 --> 01:26:53,920
the moment you start doing something
that requires dexterity and focus and

3219
01:26:53,921 --> 01:26:54,790
concentration,

3220
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:55,990
that's what wakes you up.

3221
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:01,360
I would imagine like driving a car is
a very specific traditional college.

3222
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:04,080
Where am I in that?

3223
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:04,641
Yeah,

3224
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:06,290
because I think a,

3225
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:07,880
I'm pretty sure this guy got off.

3226
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,433
Yeah,

3227
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:10,700
I don't,

3228
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,061
yeah,

3229
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:12,500
I think he got acquitted man.

3230
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,980
And then if the jury acquitted parks of
murder and laid it later of attempted

3231
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:16,490
murder,

3232
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:19,490
all of the government appealed the
1992 in Supreme Court of Canada.

3233
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,810
It's Canada though.

3234
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:21,440
That's a problem.

3235
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,730
They're too nice up there American.

3236
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:24,180
Yeah,

3237
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:26,240
like what the fuck are you talking about?

3238
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:26,421
Oh,

3239
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:29,240
you're sleepwalking when you beat
someone to death with a tire iron.

3240
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:29,571
Yeah.

3241
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:30,950
Nothing wakes you up like metal.

3242
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:35,090
The bone crack over and
over again in your hands.

3243
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:36,230
Vibrating in your hands.

3244
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,560
You're mother-in-law's skull
really doesn't wake you up.

3245
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:40,640
The Fuck Outta here.

3246
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:41,361
You crazy ass.

3247
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:42,710
All right,

3248
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:45,800

movie looks fucking awesome

3249

It really looks cool.

3251
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:47,541
It really funny.

3252
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,140

3253
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:51,780

3309
01:29:02,461 --> 01:29:06,120
So after that he's going to come down
and do the shows to the ice house.

3310
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,440
So that's Friday and Saturday next
week on them and a Santa Barbara at the

3311
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:11,640
Lobero theater.

3312
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,320
I don't even know what that's like,

3313
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:16,710
but Santa Barbara is pretty bad ass so
I can't wait to all that shit's on my

3314
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:17,290
Twitter page.

3315
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:17,951
Go to my Twitter page.

3316
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:19,650
You go to barbecue plus Twitter page per

3317
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:24,651
bigly@goddammitafterbigbigsbigsandredbanisredbanontwitterandadesksquad.tv.

3318
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:29,790
If you want to buy the
new desk squad tee shirt,

3319
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,050
that is like a,

3320
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:34,410
it's like a rip off of a bunch of big
companies that probably going to wind up

3321
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:36,330
suing him left to take it down.

3322
01:29:36,331 --> 01:29:38,730
So get in on it now while
it's still a collector's item.

3323
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:39,564
That's right.

3324
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:39,991
All right,

3325
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:40,824
you freaks.

3326
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,090
We will see you Friday.

3327
01:29:42,091 --> 01:29:42,570
Um,

3328
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:43,410
thanks to everybody,

3329
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,240
we don't have any more
podcasts this week doing,

3330
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,100
she says Ice House Ice House.

3331
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:47,430
Right.

3332
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,060
Okay.

3333
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:48,990
So we'll see you guys.

3334
01:29:48,991 --> 01:29:49,440
Um,

3335
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,150
Friday on the ice house chronicles,

3336
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,660
and then a next week I got up,

3337
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,120

3338
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:55,260
A bunch of good shit's happening.

3339
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:55,460
I'll,

3340
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,370
I'll keep you guys in tune.

3341
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,930
Thank you everybody for all the positive
messages on Twitter and Facebook and

3342
01:30:00,931 --> 01:30:04,320
all that good shit and all the cool people
that come out to the comic stores and

3343
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:05,001
comedy stores.

3344
01:30:05,001 --> 01:30:08,370
I'm shows places I should stop
talking at a certain point in time.

3345
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,121
I've said,

3346
01:30:09,121 --> 01:30:10,230
too many words are meaningless now.

3347
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:11,490
It's all just noise out of my mouth.

3348
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,200
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about people.

3349
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:13,861
We love you guys.

3350
01:30:13,861 --> 01:30:14,660
Thank you very much.

3351
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,090
See you soon.

3352
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:15,923
Bye Bye.
