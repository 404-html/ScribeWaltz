1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:03,821
Oh,

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,080
hello freaks.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,250
Yes,

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,420
we are back again.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,650
Did you miss us now?

6
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:09,490
You couldn't have missed us.

7
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,870
We've been doing this shit all week.

8
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,763
This is ridiculous.

9
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,210
He's the longest run a podcast ever from
me with his four of them in the top 10

10
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:16,790
right now.

11
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,020
Yeah.

12
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,853
Four out of this.

13
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,910
That's crazy.

14
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,020
We have four podcasts.

15
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,430
That sounds like bragging.

16
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,493
A lot of pressure for me.

17
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,330
No cause no pressure.

18
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,070
Dr. Patrick,

19
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,053
we're not.

20
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,590
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by stamps.com do you

21
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:35,920
remember back in the days of black
and white TVs and phones with wires,

22
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,640
the only way of business could avoid
the post office was to least a postage

23
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:40,150
meter.

24
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,110
That's annoying,

25
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,290
but today technology has made it so
that anyone can have that possibility at

26
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:47,260
your home.

27
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,540
All you need is stamps.com

28
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,700
that's coffee with stamps.com you can
print official us postage from your home

29
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,530
or office computer right from your desk.

30
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,490
Just Bang.

31
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,170
Just measure it out.

32
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,970
Print it out with a free digital scale
that they provide and you print out

33
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:08,260
official US postage.

34
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,363
Mailman comes,

35
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,150
takes it.

36
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,150
You avoid all the lines of the post
office official US postage for any letter,

37
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,600
any package using your
computer and printer,

38
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,180
no extra hardware to buy or lease.

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,710
And unlike a meter,

40
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,890

plus a stamps.com you can track packages,

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,190

Patrick is here.

59
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,280
We're going to find this
some shit out about health.

60
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,060
The Joe Rogan experience.

61
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,320
Try my day.

62
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,820
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:35,740
low.

64
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,550
Rhonda.

65
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,383
Hello Joe.

66
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,390
You're the only person that's ever
come in and sat down and said,

67
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,691
oh,

68
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:41,231
this is good.

69
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:42,580
I'm getting a cortisol rush.

70
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:43,791
She,

71
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,170
he said you're getting a
cortisol rush from the,

72
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,960
the feeling of about to do a pilot.

73
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,820
Actually,

74
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,590
I could have gone a little more detail,

75
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:51,131
but I was like,

76
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:51,960
please do.

77
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,510
Yeah.

78
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,230
You know,

79
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,570
so that feeling of anxiety,

80
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:55,901
you know,

81
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:58,240
that like you get before you got on stage,

82
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:58,421
I mean,

83
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:59,110
you're a comedian.

84
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,410
Sure.

85
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,550
You're really familiar with that.

86
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,970
You actually are expressing a
chemical called dynorphins and uh,

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,210
this,

88
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,790
this is an endogenous chemical in your
brain and it binds to something called

89
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,930
the Kappa opioid receptor.

90
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,260
It's kind of like the
counter of the endorphin,

91
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,260
which binds to the Mu opioid receptor.

92
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,460
So the endorphins are the field.

93
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,220
Good.

94
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,671
Well,

95
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,770
it's nemesis is the diner fin,

96
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,760
which is that anxiety,

97
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,840
like feeling.

98
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,561
So,

99
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,760
but here's the interesting part,

100
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,500
that anxiety,

101
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,420
like feeling that you feel before you're,

102
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,010
you know,

103
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,210
going to do something like you're really,

104
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,470
that you care about or that's
kind of anxiety provoking for me.

105
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,370
Public speaking does it,

106
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,410
I get it right before I'm going to do it,

107
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,040
you know,

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,280
give a talk or something or
do a podcast in front of,

109
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:42,550
you know,

110
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,450
500,000 people.

111
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,290
Um,

112
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,040
so that dynorphins binding
to the kappa opioid receptor,

113
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,850
what it does is it up regulates
the mule opioid receptor.

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,490
So that after you get
that anxiety feeling,

115
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,600
you have a better endorphin rush
because you upregulate the new opioid

116
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,380
receptors,

117
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,580
which bind to the endorphins,

118
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,420
the feel good ones,

119
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,310
and you actually become
sensitized to them.

120
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,520
So there's a biological mechanism by which
having that anxiety actually does you

121
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,000
good.

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,650
So it's,

123
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,790
it's kind of like a stress at first,

124
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,350
but then later on you're,

125
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:14,800
you get,

126
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,360
you feel better and you're more relaxed.

127
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,321
That's what you know.

128
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:22,321
That's interesting because one of the
best feelings ever is after you compete.

129
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,280
Like when you fight,

130
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,340
one of the things that
people get addicted to is um,

131
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,310
you get addicted to the rush for sure.

132
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,380
The adrenaline rush and
you get addicted to the,

133
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:32,910
just the,

134
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,840
the challenge of competition being life
magnified on such an incredible scale

135
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,120
that everything else seems
kind of Pale in comparison.

136
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,010
But the big addiction I think is the
feeling that you get after you compete,

137
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,360
especially if you win.

138
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,290
There's just amazing feeling
like life is incredible.

139
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,430
He just like the ground
feels better under your feet,

140
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,980
the colors in the trees look better,

141
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,410
everything looks better
for a couple of days.

142
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,820
I totally know what you're talking about.

143
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,060
And there's a biological mechanism for
that and it's interesting because it's

144
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:08,530
also the same mechanism that occurs
when you are working out really hard.

145
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,940
I mean it's painful while you're doing it,

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,340
but the more pain you experience,

147
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:15,190
the better the rush that it's the
endorphin high people talk about.

148
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,660
It's actually that that
mechanism is anxiety inducing.

149
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:23,170
Stress inducing is an important factor
in that because of this mechanism I

150
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,080
talked about where you up regulate those
receptors that bind to the endorphins

151
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,320
and you become in your sensitizing them
so they become more sensitized to them.

152
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,870
So it's a heat does the same thing.

153
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,250
Heat stress.

154
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,420
So you know,

155
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,021
exercise,

156
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:35,711
capsaicin.

157
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,880
So eating spicy food,

158
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,410
it's painful while you're eating it.

159
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,720
But what happens is
there's your upregulating,

160
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:41,110
those,

161
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,280
those Mu opioid receptors,

162
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,960
and you're sensitizing
them to the endorphins,

163
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,970
which is why you feel really
good after eating spicy food.

164
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,211
Oh,

165
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,470
that's what that is.

166
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,270
I never knew what that was.

167
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,150
That's interesting because I
always thought it just tasted good,

168
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,200
like a kind of a weird,

169
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,800
cool,

170
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
good spicy taste.

171
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,980
I'm sure there's dopamine
responses and all that stuff

172
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
involved.

173
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,110
Um,

174
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,601
I mean there's,

175
00:05:59,601 --> 00:05:59,811
you know,

176
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,090
complex mechanisms and things
going on in your brain,

177
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,730
but when you're eating
or when you pleasure,

178
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,440
when you enjoy a certain taste of a food,

179
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:11,420
but this particular mechanism where
you've got this dynorphins and Endorphin,

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,080
you know,

181
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,913
connection.

182
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,460
Um,

183
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,450
it's really interesting and I think
it's something I discussed on a recent

184
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,850
article that I wrote about the sauna.

185
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,040
So,

186
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,280
uh,

187
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,810
I hope people find it interesting
cause I think it's interesting,

188
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,080
isn't it,

189
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,913
what it is to know about it.

190
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,470
It is,

191
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,720
it's gotten some really
good responses to I've a,

192
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,990
I've read it and I've read a lot of the
responses that people find it pretty

193
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,060
fascinating when you were
talking about it in the podcast,

194
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:37,530
but it's kind of almost like the Yin
and Yang of life is what you're talking

195
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:37,951
about here.

196
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:42,060
It's like you need to have some negative
in order to feel some extra positive,

197
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,870
right?

198
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,231
No,

199
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:43,531
the,

200
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:43,770
uh,

201
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,350
are you familiar with [inaudible]?

202
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:45,840
Okay.

203
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,171
Um,

204
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,380
I know I've heard the term but I
couldn't describe it if somebody asks me

205
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,841
like,

206
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:50,591
so what it means,

207
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:50,980
you mean?

208
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,370
Yes.

209
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:51,641
Okay.

210
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:56,641
So [inaudible] what it really refers
to is having a little bit of stress,

211
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,170
something that's a little toxic for you,

212
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:00,910
something that's a little
stressful on your body.

213
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:01,151
I mean,

214
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:06,151
exercise for sure is that he is a little
stressful things in some of the foods

215
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:06,581
we eat.

216
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:07,251
Like the Eeg,

217
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:12,070
cgs and green tea are polyphenols and
some of the fruits and also in red wine.

218
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,280
These things are actually a
little bit toxic to our body.

219
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,970
And what happens is that this induces,

220
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,730
um,

221
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,830
stress response mechanisms in our body.

222
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,350
The activation of a whole host of jeans,

223
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,310
like you know,

224
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,690
antioxidant genes,

225
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,490
glutathione peroxidase,

226
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,324
things like,

227
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:28,670
um,

228
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,060
you know,

229
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,660
he'd shocked factors which do
a variety of different things.

230
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:36,520
So a little bit of stress activates this
whole stress response mechanism in our

231
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:36,941
body.

232
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:39,400
And then what happens is now
we can deal with stress better.

233
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,380
So it's,

234
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,540
it's kind of like interesting to think
about adding a little bit of something

235
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,190
that's toxic to,

236
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:45,911
you know,

237
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:46,500
get

238
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,300
a better response.

239
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,131
So that's fascinating.

240
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:51,760
You were talking about that last time we
were here about mycotoxins that in fact

241
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:54,520
Michael Toxins in a small dose
might induce that sort of,

242
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,230
yeah.

243
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,700
I mean I totally made,

244
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,110
I was wet hand waving.

245
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,250
I haven't read anything.

246
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,130
Get you allowed to do that
when your hand waving.

247
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:02,551
I'm like,

248
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:07,551
well actually maybe it makes
sense that in a small dose,

249
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:07,831
I mean,

250
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:11,790
obviously you don't want something
that's like very toxic and I'm gonna kill

251
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,080
your brain cells or anything like that.

252
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:13,860
But uh,

253
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,880
things in small doses.

254
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:19,440
And I was assuming that maybe mycotoxins
could possibly have a little slight

255
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,610
hormetic effect.

256
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,773
Um,

257
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,260
you know,

258
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,741
like I said,

259
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:24,780
I that was just me theorizing.

260
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,010
Uh,

261
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,341
you know,

262
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:26,840
so,

263
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,340
but

264
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,190
fascinating though that that
is sort of the way like,

265
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:34,180
especially when it comes to exercise
that you need to experience this like

266
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:39,181
intense hardship in order to get this
wonderful feeling of accomplishment,

267
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:40,450
this endorphin rush.

268
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:40,990
And this,

269
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,730
I feel so good after I work out.

270
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,270
Like I,

271
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,930
I make all my best decisions after I
have a really good workout and it's just

272
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,400
like my body has a perspective.

273
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,250
I have a better perspective if I haven't
worked out in a couple of days and I'm

274
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:52,084
stressed and,

275
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,560
and then I have to make a decision.

276
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,000
Oftentimes I don't trust my,

277
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,851
Oh yeah.

278
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:56,030
I'm

279
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,863
the same way.

280
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,900
I'm absolutely addicted to the feeling
and the physiological changes that occur

281
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,074
with exercise.

282
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,550
And there are a lot of
them that are occurring,

283
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,121
um,

284
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:05,300
you know,

285
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,911
in the brain and,

286
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:06,744
and elsewhere.

287
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,100
Uh,

288
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,851
but it's the same,

289
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:08,140
you know,

290
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,940
it's what's really kind
of fascinating recently,

291
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:11,091
you know,

292
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:11,420
we,

293
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,200
you know about inducing neurogenesis when
you work out that's kind of well known

294
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:18,170
where exercise induces the
growth of new brain cells.

295
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,490
BDNF is one way.

296
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:20,330
Igf One,

297
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,351
these things can,

298
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:21,591
you know,

299
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:22,580
you grow new brain cells.

300
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:26,170
And so growing new brain cells has
always been associated with um,

301
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,420
uh,

302
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,350
learning and memory.

303
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:27,650
It's like,

304
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,771
oh,

305
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:28,071
you're grown.

306
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,240
You grow new brain cells.

307
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:32,780
And they've shown that that neurogenesis
in adults at least as associated with

308
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,741
new learning,

309
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:34,574
a new memory.

310
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,740
But what they found recently,

311
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,300
and I found this really interesting,

312
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,600
um,

313
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,700
because it kind of changed
the way I think of it,

314
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,250
uh,

315
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,190
is that when you grow
those new brain cells,

316
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,390
like when you're exercising,

317
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,630
um,

318
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,040
heat stress does the same thing actually.

319
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,880
So getting in the sauna,

320
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,950
when you're exercising your
heat stress in your body,

321
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,221
I mean,

322
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,020
your core body temperature is elevated.

323
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,370
It's in a very similar,

324
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,270
um,

325
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,270
so what happens is you grow new brain
cells and these new brain cells have to

326
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,320
make new connections with other neurons.

327
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:04,130
And so what ends up happening is that
other connections that you made with

328
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:04,310
north,

329
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,780
so the connections you
make between neurons,

330
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:08,150
the synapses that your form memories,

331
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:09,230
it's things that you can remember,

332
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:09,531
right?

333
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:13,320
I mean you make you form these synopses
and that's like a piece of information

334
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:13,911
remembered.

335
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:15,090
Or in some cases it's uh,

336
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,160
an experience that you had that you
remember well you actually change those

337
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,050
synopses and some of them go away.

338
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:25,310
So you kind of forget to make room
for a new neuron to make a new.

339
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:25,730
So it,

340
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,390
it,

341
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,630
it really is interesting how
also you have this connection,

342
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,050
but it's,

343
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,200
it's a balance where you're
forgetting a things that you're,

344
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,520
you're totally disconnecting
some connections between
old neurons that you had

345
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:39,980
previously made for whatever
thing you had learned or,

346
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,300
and you're making room for this new
neuron that just was born to make a new

347
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,070
connection and make learn something new.

348
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,121
So,

349
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:47,540
uh,

350
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,860
do you have that balance again?

351
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:49,460
It's just,

352
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,240
you know,

353
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,590
it's,

354
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,801
it's,

355
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,360
it seems like a very important
biological mechanism.

356
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:53,661
This,

357
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:55,310
this mean and Yang
where it's like there's,

358
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,900
there's stress and then there's the,

359
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,980
the response to the stress,

360
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:58,551
which is good.

361
00:10:58,551 --> 00:10:59,241
And you know,

362
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,074
there's things like,

363
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,500
you know,

364
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,720
forgetting things but so that
you can learn new things.

365
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:03,950
I mean it's kind of an important,

366
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:06,440
can you imagine if you
remembered everything you've ever

367
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,130
go insane.

368
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:08,520
Yeah,

369
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,110
I have a real problem with that.

370
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,130
I have a real problem with having too
much information in my head and then

371
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,740
forgetting things at other
people remember and they'll,

372
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,110
they'll remember it like it was this
big important thing and I'm like,

373
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,760
what did we really do that?

374
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,863
I don't remember that.

375
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,450
And it's just because I've
had too many experiences.

376
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,620
Like there's too much stuff.

377
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,720
Or if you go back to talk to someone,

378
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,970
you went to high school with
people that don't leave,

379
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,520
that are stuck in that
town and they can remember,

380
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:35,590
remember when we were 17
and we did that crazy thing.

381
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:35,791
You're like,

382
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:35,971
no,

383
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,020
I don't fucking remember that.

384
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,381
Like,

385
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:38,430
how do you remember that?

386
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:38,731
Like him,

387
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,840
you got to get out of this town,

388
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:39,961
man,

389
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,570
you're to make some new
connections in your brain,

390
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,080
son.

391
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,321
Yeah,

392
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,280
I know that that's a,

393
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:44,970
you're right

394
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,610
into what's called episodic memory,

395
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:47,261
which is the,

396
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:49,820
the type of memory that's
associated with experiences.

397
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,403
And that's,

398
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,340
there's a lot of different
things that can regulate that.

399
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:54,700
One.

400
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,090
One would be like a very
strong emotional response.

401
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,010
Like you're Mcdilla is activated.

402
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,700
So if something you'll probably remember
things that are fear inducing or

403
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,620
something that's really exciting,

404
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,161
really,

405
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,060
really exciting to you.

406
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,751
You know,

407
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:12,010
that those sorts of things can
solidify those types of connections.

408
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,873
So,

409
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,430
uh,

410
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,160
also have serotonin plays a role in that,

411
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,493
whether it was a really,

412
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,110
yeah,

413
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,401
I,

414
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,890
I've been doing this other
paper that I've been working on.

415
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,550
Um,

416
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,870
I've been looking at the role of Serotonin
in brain function and dysfunction and

417
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,830
also behavior,

418
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,490
but,

419
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:27,640
uh,

420
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,760
it seems like serotonin plays a role in
executive function and specifically an

421
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:31,630
episodic memory.

422
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,730
So,

423
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,211
so,

424
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:33,570
um,

425
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,770
any episodic memory that
has a big rush of Serotonin,

426
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,360
would it be because what would,

427
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:39,690
what,

428
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,210
what would cause that specifically?

429
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:44,010
Like what would make a
serotonin rush and a memory.

430
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,071
Yeah.

431
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:45,371
I think,

432
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,710
I mean there's a lot of different
things that are at serotonin release is

433
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,710
happens to a variety of different factors,

434
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:51,250
but one,

435
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,810
one could actually be a very potent,

436
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,810
something that's very potent
that you're experiencing.

437
00:12:59,470 --> 00:12:59,801
Do you know,

438
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:00,551
does that make sense?

439
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:01,384
Where it's like,

440
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,230
it's not just your everyday
stuff that you kind of block out,

441
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,280
like it's just routine,

442
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:07,930
but it's something just novel.

443
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,490
And would that be like

444
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,940
the day you find out that Kennedy got
shot or the day nine 11 happened or the

445
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,100
daily extreme events,

446
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,380
what response would that be?

447
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,443
I think that would

448
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,610
the Amygdala response.

449
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,091
Yeah.

450
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,590
Where your Amygdala gets activated.

451
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,460
Um,

452
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,310
but I think for the Serotonin it's,

453
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,060
it's,

454
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,020
it's more of a,

455
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:31,600
they've done a lot of studies
where they've looked at
kind of like the pleading

456
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,550
it and what happens?

457
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:33,780
What happens when you don't have,

458
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,890
when you can't make it,

459
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,790
you just,

460
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,620
you're episodic memories bad.

461
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,371
Well,

462
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:39,030
that's the thing with

463
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,380
people who do a Mtma with people
who party too much and do ecstasy.

464
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:43,731
Is the,

465
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:45,360
the crush afterwards,

466
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,490
is there serotonin being depleted?

467
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:47,790
Right.

468
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,730
That's a big part of it.

469
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,660
What's the mechanism of action of MDA?

470
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,940
I our MD m I always forget,

471
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,173
we could pull it up.

472
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,780
Um,

473
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,141
well,

474
00:13:55,141 --> 00:14:00,141
MDM may supposedly has some function
with a rushing serotonin into your system

475
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:05,310
and it gives you this gigantic,

476
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,720
let's see if it gives you a,

477
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,410
uh,

478
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,000
uh,

479
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,180
induce euphoria,

480
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,100
sense of intimacy with others.

481
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,420
Diminished anxiety,

482
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,960
mild psychedelia
Psychedelia is a weird word.

483
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:16,980
Doesn't seem like it should be real,

484
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,814
but it is.

485
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,940
And he studies particularly in the fields
of psychology and cognitive therapy,

486
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,620
so they use it a lot.

487
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:23,161
Lately.

488
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,230
It's been used a lot for PTSD,

489
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,760
which is interesting because,

490
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:27,120
um,

491
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,780
I,

492
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,130
I've only taken it once.

493
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,630
I took it once a long time ago.

494
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,270
I never took it again and never
had the desire to take it again.

495
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,840
Although I had a very positive
experience with it because the,

496
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,740
the downside,

497
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:39,810
but the next day was just brutal.

498
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,700
Like I couldn't read.

499
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,151
I was,

500
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:45,360
I remember I was in a coffee shop and
I was trying to read a magazine and I

501
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,030
couldn't focus enough to read a paragraph.

502
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,290
He couldn't focus.

503
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,640
There was nothing going on.

504
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,710
And my brain was just like,

505
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:51,930
uh,

506
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,250
I,

507
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,170
my brain felt like a dry sponge.

508
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,110
Just some,

509
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,170
some things that happen when
you release a lot of Serotonin,

510
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,681
you know,

511
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:02,990
into your synopsis is that your body,

512
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:03,590
because there's,

513
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,371
it's too much.

514
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,360
There's more than,

515
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,170
you know,

516
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,220
it's supposed to have,

517
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,370
you'll start to downregulate other
receptors and there seems to,

518
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:11,570
there's like a negative feedback.

519
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:15,650
So what would happen then is the next
day you're not going to be as responsive

520
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:16,610
to that Serotonin.

521
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,510
Um,

522
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:17,960
and that's,

523
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,590
that's something that's a big problem
with some Ssri drugs and things like that

524
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,730
where you know,

525
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:23,210
you're,

526
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,810
you're basically preventing the serotonin
from being Metabo re metabolized,

527
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,763
taken back up.

528
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,670
And so it sits around and these synapse
for a lot longer than it's supposed to

529
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,930
and they've shown that the consequence
to that is you actually downregulate

530
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:36,800
serotonin receptors,

531
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,490
which is what,

532
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,290
you know,

533
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,730
serotonin receptor response to the
Serotonin that you're releasing.

534
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,500
So you can't respond to it then,

535
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,101
you know,

536
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:43,701
what's the point?

537
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,760
So there's a lot of these
feedback mechanisms that occur.

538
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,540
Um,

539
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,871
you know,

540
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:48,980
and I don't even know all of them.

541
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,280
I just,

542
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,460
it's,

543
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,600
it's very complex.

544
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,830
It's listed in Wiki onto the
longterm effects that it causes.

545
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:58,250
A down regulation of Serotonin
reuptake transporters in the brain,

546
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,530
the rate at which the brain recovers
from serotonergic searching.

547
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,540
So it's an urgent changes is unclear.

548
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,330
Once that demonstrated a lasting
serotonergic changes to nurture,

549
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,370
to nurture in some
animals exposed to Mtma,

550
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:16,820
other studies have suggested that
brain may recover from the damage.

551
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,900
But um,

552
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,100
a lot of people that do it,

553
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:22,800
they take five HTP to try
to juice up their serotonin.

554
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:26,090
They ticket while they're doing MTMA
and then they take it afterwards.

555
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:26,670
Yeah,

556
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,430
I have to be really careful when you're
combining multiple drugs that are

557
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,200
affecting like Serotonin for example,

558
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,110
or that pathway because then you
can end up getting something called,

559
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,270
I think they call it Serotonin Syndrome,

560
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,161
where it's like,

561
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:42,110
like people that are taking ssrs have to
be really careful and not take a bunch

562
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:42,944
of trip defenders.

563
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,371
You know,

564
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:46,400
because then you can
induce like I toxicity.

565
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,120
That's,

566
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,050
that's pretty dangerous.

567
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,460
And I forget what all the,

568
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,733
you know,

569
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,560
you decide,

570
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,351
you know what all of the,

571
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:54,170
the actual effects of
Serotonin Syndrome are,

572
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:54,721
but they're,

573
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:55,554
they're not good.

574
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,911
Yeah.

575
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,631
Not good at all.

576
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:59,690
That's an issue with people
also that are taking five HTP.

577
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,940
If they're on a Serotonin,

578
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,130
a SSRI,

579
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:03,470
right.

580
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,720
And they take a five HTP,

581
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,490
you can get this serotonin syndrome.

582
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,391
You know,

583
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,190
the other thing about Serotonin,

584
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:10,401
I mean,

585
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,340
we always think about it as being a brain.

586
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,090
You know,

587
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,750
neurochemical,

588
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,260
right?

589
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,520
A neurotransmitter in the brain,

590
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,170
but actually the majority of the Serotonin
in your bodies is not in your brain.

591
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,010
It's made in your gut.

592
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,031
Really.

593
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:23,600
Yeah.

594
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,060
So actually just published a paper.

595
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,760
It was published the last
time I was on this podcast.

596
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:29,061
Actually,

597
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:29,810
my paper,

598
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,950
I didn't know it was,

599
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,970
it just came out in press the
day that I was on this podcast.

600
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,870
But so,

601
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,530
um,

602
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,310
there's two different genes that they're,

603
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,670
that,

604
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,460
that convert tryptofan into five HTP.

605
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,031
Okay.

606
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:47,060
That's the rate limiting step where
you convert trip to fan into five

607
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,230
hydroxytryptophan and they're called,

608
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,070
that's called Tryptophan

609
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,903
hydroxylase.

610
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,211
Okay.

611
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,550
And there's one enzyme called
Tryptophan hydroxylase,

612
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:54,990
one that's local.

613
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,710
It's local,

614
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,401
localized,

615
00:17:56,401 --> 00:18:01,020
are located outside of the blood brain
barrier and it's predominantly found in

616
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:01,854
the gut,

617
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,690
but it's also found in the pineal gland,

618
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,390
which is actually separated
by the blood brain barrier.

619
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,800
It's not,

620
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,010
it's close to the brain,

621
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,030
but it's actually separated.

622
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,200
And it's also found in a seminar
t cells and placenta tissue.

623
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:14,160
But um,

624
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,120
and then there's Tryptophan
hydroxylase to which is the brain form.

625
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,590
And that's found in the
Dorsal raphe a part,

626
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,080
the mid part of your brain.

627
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,363
And um,

628
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,790
there's,

629
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,190
there's also some expressions.

630
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,240
So your gut has neurons in it as well.

631
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,230
And Terrick neurons,

632
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,490
that enzyme,

633
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,990
that's the neuron one.

634
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,520
There's some of that also in your gut,

635
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:34,950
but mostly it's the other enzymes.

636
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,380
So there's Tryptophan hydroxylase
one Tryptophan hydroxylase too.

637
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,580
They both make serotonin.

638
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,680
So serotonin made in your gut,

639
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,243
um,

640
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,320
actually causes GI inflammation
and they've shown this in,

641
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,830
in like mouse models because what
happens is serotonin made in the gut,

642
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,860
activates t cells and t cells have a
receptor to it on their cell surface.

643
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,670
And when they respond to Serotonin,

644
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,800
they proliferate and grow more.

645
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,480
And so if you're making,

646
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,700
if you have a bunch of
Serotonin in your gut,

647
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,590
you can get GI inflammation.

648
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,371
And you know,

649
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:05,820
this is,

650
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,060
I think this has also been documented
with people that take too much five HTP,

651
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,660
um,

652
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,530
as well as,

653
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,610
uh,

654
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,200
people with colitis and such.

655
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:15,950
They've done mouse models where they
knock out that enzyme church of a

656
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:16,411
hydroxylase,

657
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:20,670
one that makes serotonin in the gut
and it completely ameliorates that the

658
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,320
inflammatory like,

659
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,280
um,

660
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,880
you know,

661
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,050
symptoms in those,

662
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:26,040
in those mouse models.

663
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,910
So,

664
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,630
um,

665
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,760
the other enzyme in your brain.

666
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:32,610
So this is where my paper
comes in and sort of,

667
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,360
uh,

668
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,560
it's a theoretical paper,

669
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,730
but I found a mechanism.

670
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,420
So with theoretical paper means I didn't
actually do any experiments on mice.

671
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,800
I didn't actually do a clinical trial.

672
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,431
I just,

673
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:46,431
I found an underlying mechanism and I
explained it all and found all this stuff

674
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,570
that was buried in the literature
and put it all together.

675
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,440
It's actually my first theoretical paper
that I've ever written in publishers.

676
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:51,901
Yeah,

677
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:52,500
thanks.

678
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,250
So what I found was that these two enzymes
for Tryptophan hydroxylase both have

679
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:58,260
what's called a vitamin
D response element in it,

680
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:00,810
which is a telltale
sequence that vitamin D,

681
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,450
when vitamin D binds to
a vitamin D receptor,

682
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,750
it recognizes that and it can turn
on a gene or it turns off a gene.

683
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,830
And when it turns on gene gene does what
it's supposed to do and turns it off,

684
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,090
it's almost like it's not there.

685
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,950
What I found with it is that that,

686
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,490
so the sequence itself of
this vitamin D element,

687
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,420
uh,

688
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,700
can determine whether or not
it's going to turn it on or off.

689
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:24,570
And I found these two different
enzymes of Tryptophan hydroxylase had a

690
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,010
different response elements.

691
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:29,070
One wasn't on sick signal
and one was an off signal.

692
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,630
The one in the brain was an on signal
and the one in the gut wasn't off signal

693
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,520
suggesting that vitamin D was regulating
the production of Serotonin in opposite

694
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,810
directions in different tissues.

695
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,430
So you needed it to make it in your brain,

696
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,010
but if you had enough vitamin D,

697
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,300
it would shut off the gut one,

698
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,291
not completely,

699
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,100
but turns it so that you're
not making as much serotonin.

700
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,650
You don't have as much Gi inflammation.

701
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,300
And then I related this to autism
because I know I'm getting way out there,

702
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:55,641
but uh,

703
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:55,921
it's,

704
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,711
it's pretty cool.

705
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:57,460
So,

706
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,671
uh,

707
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:59,800
autism has been on the rise.

708
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,581
Like right now.

709
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:05,110
The most recent CDC report that came
out said that one in 68 children have

710
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,003
autism.

711
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:06,461
I mean,

712
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:06,851
it's been,

713
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,500
it's risen like 600% since the 1970s.

714
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,380
It's astronomical.

715
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,460
Like how much it's risen.

716
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,100
So they can't really,

717
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,420
they have an identified a genetic,

718
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:21,421
cause like 70 over 70% of autism cases
have not been linked to a genetic

719
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,354
mutation,

720
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,400
which means to me,

721
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,530
something in the environment
seems to be going on.

722
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,393
There's something,

723
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,420
something that is,

724
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,080
you know,

725
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,080
interacting with possible
genetic mechanisms that's
causing this autism rise.

726
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,020
And,

727
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,830
um,

728
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,041
you know,

729
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,800
vitamin D is one thing that's
been people getting adequate.

730
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:42,640
Vitamin D has been on the decrease the
same time that autism rises autism's been

731
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:43,474
rising.

732
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,050
And,

733
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,351
um,

734
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:46,620
so I came up with this,

735
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,070
this theory that low
vitamin D during pregnancy,

736
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,880
um,

737
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,660
and also during the neonate when you're
a young child can lead to serotonin

738
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,680
deficiency in the brain.

739
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,380
And what happens is during the brain,

740
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:00,970
during fetal brain development,

741
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:04,240
Saratonin is critical to,

742
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,990
um,

743
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,100
guide neurons to where they're supposed
to go to make them proliferate.

744
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,670
Uh,

745
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:09,971
you know,

746
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:13,630
it's an important differentiation factor
to help them make the kind of neurons

747
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:14,171
they're supposed to make.

748
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:14,981
It plays a very,

749
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:19,660
very important role in regulating
brain structure and morphology.

750
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,970
What,

751
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,730
what vitamin D in particular?

752
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:25,120
Because vitamin D three was the
one that you were on last time.

753
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,290
Vitamin D three.

754
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,790
So vitamin D three,

755
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,330
the way it works is you can
make vitamin D in your skin.

756
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,400
You can see,

757
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,610
you can convert it into d three.

758
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:33,791
Yeah.

759
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,590
So UVB radiation,

760
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:39,130
you need UVB light and
it converts something.

761
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:43,570
And your skin called 70 hydro
cholesterol into vitamin D three.

762
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,210
And then this gets released
into the bloodstream,

763
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,470
goes to your liver where then it's
converted to 25 hydroxy vitamin D,

764
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:51,460
which is what people,

765
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:51,771
uh,

766
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,220
it's a major circulating
form of Vitamin D.

767
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:55,690
And that's what you get
measured when you go,

768
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,380
you know,

769
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,110
get your vitamin D levels measured and
then it goes into your kidneys and gets

770
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,060
activated to inactive steroid hormone.

771
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,190
And it's called one 25.

772
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,090
Hydroxyvitamin d.

773
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,640
So vitamin D gets converted
into an active steroid hormone.

774
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,200
And once it's converted into
that act as to ride home and,

775
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,034
and your kidneys,

776
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,100
what then it does is it binds to a
vitamin D receptor in different tissues in

777
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:15,790
your body,

778
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,630
including your brain.

779
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,960
And it does this thing where it turns on
or turns off over a thousand different

780
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:22,900
genes in your,

781
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,734
in your body.

782
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,780
So it's regulating a lot of,

783
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,650
you know,

784
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,580
different processes.

785
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,230
One of them just to Serotonin.

786
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,060
So I basically came up with this,

787
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,630
this,

788
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,560
this theory that,

789
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,773
you know,

790
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,250
Pete,

791
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,540
you know,

792
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,320
women were not getting enough vitamin D
and the child's brain was then becoming

793
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,190
serotonin deficiency.

794
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:42,010
It was changing the structure of
the way the brain was developing.

795
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,790
And,

796
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,001
um,

797
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:43,300
they've,

798
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,670
they've seen now that autism actually it
seems be occurring in Utero and they're

799
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:48,950
finding now they've been doing these
studies where they're finding now that it

800
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:50,300
seems to be a good,

801
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,120
strong environmental component and
they haven't figured out what it is.

802
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,780
Um,

803
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,460
so I'm hoping that people will start,

804
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,730
I'm not an autism researcher
and I'm not a neuroscientist.

805
00:23:58,731 --> 00:23:58,911
I mean,

806
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:00,020
I know a little bit about it.

807
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,650
Um,

808
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,980
but what I did was I kind of just took a
step back and started putting all these

809
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,590
things together and came
up with this hypothesis.

810
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:10,850
And I also found things like estrogen
can activate that same gene in Tryptophan

811
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:11,451
hydroxylase.

812
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,580
So estrogen can protect you.

813
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,110
If you have low vitamin D,

814
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,640
You can still make that,

815
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,720
that serotonin from tryptophan because
estrogen activates that same gene also.

816
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,943
So,

817
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,950
and then the whole gut inflammation
thing autistics have this.

818
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:25,850
And I think that they're,

819
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,690
you know,

820
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,050
they have high gut inflammation
cause they have too much.

821
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,130
They have too much serotonin
going on in the gut.

822
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,690
That's why the common thing
with common with autistic.

823
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,500
Wow,

824
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,480
that's fascinating.

825
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:35,951
So it's,

826
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:37,010
it's pretty interesting.

827
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,150
Um,

828
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,340
I totally forgot why I got
on this I totally tangent.

829
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,360
When we were talking about
Serotonin five HTP five,

830
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,690
right?

831
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,400
So that,

832
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,480
that's another thing
where it's like five HTP.

833
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,710
The first thing it does is it hits the
gut and you've got that enzyme in there

834
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,544
that can,

835
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,030
uh,

836
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,410
well in the gut.

837
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,380
So Ti five HTP actually bypasses
a Tryptophan hydroxylase part.

838
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,790
It,

839
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,440
it's now the next step,

840
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,290
which is to be decarboxylated
into serotonin.

841
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,700
So you can actually convert it.

842
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,870
If you take too much of it,

843
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,740
you'll convert it into serotonin in
your gut before it gets to your brain.

844
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,470
So it's something to keep
him at five [inaudible].

845
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,780
Serotonin does not cross
the blood brain barrier.

846
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,100
Um,

847
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,240
five HTP does.

848
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,380
Wow.

849
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,720
So if you're,

850
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,090
if you're converting this
serotonin immediately in your gut,

851
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,220
then it's not going to get to your brain.

852
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,780
So there,

853
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,300
there's complex mechanisms.

854
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,730
Just tryptophan cross the blood brain
barrier Tryptofan does get transported

855
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,451
into the brain.

856
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:32,661
Yeah.

857
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,840
And we talked about this a little bit
last time where it competes with branch

858
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:38,750
chain amino acids to get
transported into the brain.

859
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,960
So what happens is,

860
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,590
you know,

861
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,550
Lucy ice solution,

862
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,980
these things actually when they both,

863
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,290
because at the same time they're
going through the same transporter.

864
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,650
Tryptofan is a very rare amino acid in,

865
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,441
in proteins.

866
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,590
It's much less abundant than branch
chain amino acids like leucine.

867
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:54,900
And I said,

868
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,150
listen,

869
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,931
this is it a myth,

870
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:58,140
the trip to Fan Turkey thing,

871
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,150
the correlation between eating
Turkey and getting tired after you.

872
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,600
I don't think that getting
tired after eating it is a myth.

873
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:10,601
I think it's a myth that it's two
to trip defend because actually,

874
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,683
um,

875
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,550
Ma to the penny oil gland.

876
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,060
So the penny old clan converts
Serotonin into Melatonin.

877
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:17,870
Okay.

878
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,580
And the pineal gland is not,

879
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,470
it's not a part of the,

880
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,030
it's separated by the blood brain barrier.

881
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,670
So that competition,

882
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,330
you know,

883
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,260
for the branching amino acids getting
into the pineal gland is we're talking

884
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:31,130
about something different.

885
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,950
So you know,

886
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,043
it,

887
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,910
you probably are getting a little
bit of trip to fan being converted to

888
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:38,700
Melatonin,

889
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,850
Serotonin and Melatonin
when you're eating Turkey.

890
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,953
But Turkey,

891
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,370
Turkey has a lot of branch
chain amino acids as well.

892
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,470
So

893
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,060
it's most likely just a fat fuck.

894
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,960
It's most likely a,

895
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:48,171
yeah,

896
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,004
exactly.

897
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,180
You know,

898
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,781
but you said it,

899
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:53,930
not me stuffing and all the other
stuff that goes along with it.

900
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,730
Um,

901
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,900
the other thing you,

902
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,790
the t cells and want to get back to
that real quick because you were talking

903
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,250
about the elevated t cell count right now.

904
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,460
Is that something that would
help people that have HIV,

905
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,440
um,

906
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,960
would,

907
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,390
uh,

908
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,390
a lot like a high dose of five HTP help
people who have HIV that have low t cell

909
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:12,891
counts.

910
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:13,611
Does that make sense?

911
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:14,600
Is it the same thing?

912
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:15,720
I've never

913
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,780
thought about that.

914
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,703
Um,

915
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,603
I mean,

916
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,301
that's an issue,

917
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:19,601
right?

918
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:20,200
With,

919
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,390
with AIDS patients.

920
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:21,911
I mean,

921
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:22,061
well,

922
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,050
there's a lot of issues.

923
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,680
Um,

924
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,221
but yeah,

925
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:24,790
they're,

926
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,800
they definitely do have low t cell.

927
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:26,951
I,

928
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:27,280
you know,

929
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,641
I don't know.

930
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:28,630
That's a really good question,

931
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:28,811
Joe.

932
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:29,141
Actually,

933
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:31,040
I'm pretty impressed that,

934
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,913
that's interesting.

935
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,883
It's possible.

936
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,350
But it seems like five HTP,

937
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,100
you know,

938
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,930
being converted to Serotonin,

939
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,960
the serotonin having an effect on t
cell counts only gut level serotonin.

940
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:43,870
Um,

941
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,081
no,

942
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:44,480
it hasn't no

943
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,310
effect on peripheral blood t cell counts.

944
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,150
Yeah,

945
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,430
that's why it's actually a
pretty fascinating question.

946
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,200
I,

947
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,350
I don't know the answer to,

948
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,590
but certainly something that I think
I'll probably look into after this.

949
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:54,911
Yeah,

950
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,380
that seems like we have some,

951
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:59,690
we have a supplement that we sell
that is a hold on up grab it.

952
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,610
It's in this box right here.

953
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:04,390
That's five HTP l trip to fan
and a couple other things.

954
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,350
It's called new mood.

955
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:05,651
Yeah.

956
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,320
So basically,

957
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,391
oh,

958
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:07,150
you got one right here?

959
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:07,983
Yeah,

960
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,353
that's um,

961
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,840
as an f five HTP supplement
that was originally created.

962
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,300
It was originally when
we first came up with it.

963
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,163
Uh,

964
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,970
allegedly my friend and partner
allegedly likes to do ecstasy,

965
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:22,810
allegedly.

966
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,250
And he came up with this,

967
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,580
uh,

968
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,380
they called it roll off.

969
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,040
And the idea would be
when you came off of,

970
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,731
you know,

971
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:35,380
when people do Mtma they call it
rolling and when you're off the Mtma,

972
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:35,561
you know,

973
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:35,890
you're like,

974
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,890
oh well that was the nutritional boost
that you needed to get your brain to

975
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:44,520
produce more five HTP or to
produce more serotonin rather.

976
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,620
Actually what's really interesting as I
look at this is that you have vitamin D

977
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,310
three in it.

978
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,730
Yes.

979
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,110
Which really surprises me because
whoever made this connection,

980
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,040
but for putting the vitamin D and with
the El Tryptofan I'm pretty impressed

981
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:02,270
because that until my paper
was published in February,

982
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,970
no one had known that vitamin D can Reg.

983
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,690
I mean I'm sure.

984
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,300
I don't know whoever made that connection.

985
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,560
That's an interesting,

986
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,700
that's interesting that you were
able to figure out to put vitamins,

987
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:15,470
Ia with Alitrip defend cause I haven't
seen any supplement on the market that's

988
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,040
done that.

989
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,340
I mean,

990
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,173
I don't know if you,

991
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,440
whoever did this knew,

992
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,820
but um,

993
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,070
because because tryptofan you know,

994
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,130
you need vitamin D to convert
Tryptophan into serotonin.

995
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,190
So that's actually pretty,

996
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:26,810
yeah.

997
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,280
Interesting.

998
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,470
Well,

999
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,041
my partner,

1000
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:28,490
Aubrey,

1001
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,710
who's also my good friend is very,

1002
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,593
uh,

1003
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,940
he's very diligent when it comes to
the research involved in any of these

1004
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:35,541
supplements.

1005
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:39,830
And he's also been a freak about vitamins
and nutrients like his entire life.

1006
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,950
His mother's a maniac when
it comes to that stuff.

1007
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,750
He learned a lot of it from her.

1008
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,100
And then extensive research.

1009
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:45,851
But yeah,

1010
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,031
we,

1011
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:46,301
I mean,

1012
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,160
we made sure that we were
putting something like that out.

1013
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,050
We wanted to make sure that
we had all the bases covered.

1014
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,390
Now that's kind of cool that
the vitamin D's in there,

1015
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,850
I wouldn't have expected that the,

1016
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,910
the pineal gland is a fascinating gland
that the fact that that is what creates

1017
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:05,140
so many different elements that
regulate mood and that also,

1018
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:05,880
now,

1019
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't know if you're familiar with this,

1020
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,661
there's this,

1021
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:08,470
um,

1022
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,600
there's always been this thing
about dimethyltryptamine,

1023
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,240
which is the psychedelic drug
that's produced by the brain.

1024
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,700
It's also produced by the liver
and the lungs while they've,

1025
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,680
they've found recently,

1026
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,270
like within the last year,

1027
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:19,540
uh,

1028
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,490
evidence that it's produced
by the pineal gland.

1029
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,470
It's always been like this big,

1030
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,333
um,

1031
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,271
sort of,

1032
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:25,810
uh,

1033
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,410
there was,

1034
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,790
there was anecdotal evidence,

1035
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,800
but there was never real
hard evidence until they,

1036
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,290
they actually showed that in live mice,

1037
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,530
the pineal gland is producing
dimethyltryptamine and
that's the third eye.

1038
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,910
I mean the pineal gland,

1039
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,210
you know,

1040
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:40,990
in reptiles.

1041
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,580
So it's producing it when you sleep or
well it's producing it during different

1042
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,850
periods of stress during rem sleep.

1043
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,690
Um,

1044
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,111
but they,

1045
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:50,351
you know,

1046
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,640
it's hard to get a brain,

1047
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,690
um,

1048
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,070
hard to get a mouse to sleep or you got
to fucking big saw mark on its brain or

1049
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:57,270
a,

1050
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,530
an opening in his brain and your testing.

1051
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:00,400
It's pineal gland.

1052
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,700
So the amount of evidence
they have about humans,

1053
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,310
but when and where is a,

1054
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,630
is kind of limited.

1055
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,710
But now they're making these,

1056
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:09,550
correlating,

1057
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,080
they,

1058
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,410
they're,

1059
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:10,660
they're,

1060
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,600
they're making a correlation
based on the Mammo,

1061
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:14,680
based on them and the mice,

1062
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:18,340
but they're trying to do
more studies on human beings,

1063
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,780
more accurate studies and trying to
come up with a more accurate ways of

1064
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:23,440
testing,

1065
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,120
especially during different stages.

1066
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,120
Because the hypothesis is,

1067
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:28,301
uh,

1068
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,890
the theories that when,

1069
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,130
uh,

1070
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,230
during heavy rem sleep and,

1071
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,740
um,

1072
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,460
during periods of extreme stress when
your body believes that it's going to die,

1073
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,130
like if you're under
extreme physical trauma,

1074
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,350
like people that have had
extreme physical trauma,

1075
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:41,621
you know,

1076
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,360
and they have that go to the light moment.

1077
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,430
The,

1078
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:49,030
the idea is that that's a
dimethyltryptamine rush and
that the reason why they

1079
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,340
have these intense after life experiences.

1080
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:51,730
And they came,

1081
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,130
I came back and it was amazing.

1082
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:57,760
I got to see my mother and I went
to this place and God was there.

1083
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,290
You can get there.

1084
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,770
If you take psychedelic drugs,

1085
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,590
you can get there right now as a healthy
person can have almost the exact same

1086
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,320
type of experience with
a psychedelic drugs.

1087
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:10,480
And it's just a crazy psychedelic drug.

1088
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,530
Cause your own brain
makes dimethyltryptamine,

1089
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,140
um,

1090
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,290
that you produced in the pineal gland
crosses over the blood brain barrier and

1091
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,810
starts affecting things
like in your brain.

1092
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:20,080
Does it,

1093
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,770
is it binding to different
receptors and stuff in your brain?

1094
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,000
It wouldn't be a question for
someone far smarter than me,

1095
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:25,834
but,

1096
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,760
but the,

1097
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,790
the drug,

1098
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,421
uh,

1099
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,280
Iowasca I'm sure you've heard of that.

1100
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,320
I've heard of dimethyltryptamine as well
and I just am not a well versed in the

1101
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,330
whole field.

1102
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,631
Well,

1103
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:41,480
it's just a crazy drug because it's the
most potent psychedelic drug known to

1104
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,610
man and it's the one
produced by your own brain.

1105
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,171
So it's,

1106
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,140
it's really weird.

1107
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,320
Is it pretty loose?

1108
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:47,800
Like is,

1109
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
is it like from Melatonin or
is it completely different?

1110
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,381
Completely different.

1111
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,440
But it's very similar to Melatonin
in its chemical structure.

1112
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:54,601
It's,

1113
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:55,434
it's related.

1114
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,960
Like they're close.

1115
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,453
It's weird.

1116
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,821
I mean,

1117
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:03,230
because Melatonin regulates the sleep
wake cycle and the circadian rhythm.

1118
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,843
So,

1119
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,361
you know,

1120
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:05,661
I'm just,

1121
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm wondering if it's very
similar in structure to Melatonin.

1122
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,490
Would it have any role in that as well,

1123
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,993
Katie and rhythm?

1124
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,610
I think they're all connected.

1125
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,170
I mean they tried to like,

1126
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:15,501
okay,

1127
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:16,041
this is,

1128
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:16,874
um,

1129
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,193
the,

1130
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,310
when you look at,

1131
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,144
um,

1132
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,380
any of the,

1133
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,690
any of the studies that they've done on a,

1134
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,520
on the human mind and,

1135
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:25,701
uh,

1136
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:30,200
the studies that they've done
connecting various hormones and,

1137
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:30,801
and,

1138
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:31,310
uh,

1139
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,911
things like,

1140
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:32,720
uh,

1141
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,080
well,

1142
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,050
whether it's a diamond field trip
to mean or Melatonin or Tryptofan,

1143
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,930
I think it's probably pretty
safe to say that it's kind of,

1144
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,221
I mean,

1145
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:43,580
we know a lot about that stuff or
they know a lot about that stuff,

1146
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,760
but they're not entirely certain about
all the different effects that these

1147
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,850
regulating hormones have on the brain.

1148
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,890
Is that safe to say?

1149
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,581
Oh yeah,

1150
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,331
for sure.

1151
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,590
It's very complex.

1152
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I think they're probably the most ignorant
about dimethyltryptamine because if,

1153
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,920
because it's,

1154
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,201
you know,

1155
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:01,490
a lot,

1156
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,730
it's been thought of as a recreational
drug for a long time so people aren't

1157
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:06,380
studying as much probably,

1158
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,000
well the only guy that I know that's had
grants to study it and has been allowed

1159
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,380
to study it by the,

1160
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,071
what was it,

1161
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,080
the food and drug
administration or who regulates,

1162
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:15,530
uh,

1163
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,250
who,

1164
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,290
I guess it would be the FDA
that would regulate that.

1165
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,880
Now in terms of like
the recreational drugs,

1166
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:23,480
I,

1167
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:23,721
you know,

1168
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:24,554
I don't know.

1169
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,040
I think it's the FDA because it diamond
field trip to me is a really weird one

1170
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,780
because although it's illegal,

1171
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,120
it's in so many different things,

1172
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:36,170
it's impossible to get the sources illegal
because dimethyltryptamine is in like

1173
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:38,840
a thousand different
plants and it's in grass.

1174
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,711
I mean,

1175
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,544
you could get graph,

1176
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,000
you could literally get flares grasp.

1177
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,240
Um,

1178
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,440
you just go mow a lawn,

1179
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,030
the flares grass lawn,

1180
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,440
take the bag of that shit,

1181
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,040
bring it to a lab somewhere and you got
DMT and you have a schedule one drug and

1182
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,830
it's just kind of Anna's cat.

1183
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,360
Well,

1184
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,310
she passed away recently.

1185
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,144
She was,

1186
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,050
he liked to go out side and
Tewa she heard some grass like,

1187
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,913
I mean it was like,

1188
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,813
and she would,

1189
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,590
she would get real crazy about it too.

1190
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:04,730
It was like a,

1191
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,151
you know,

1192
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:06,540
like you want to see
something really crazy.

1193
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,000
You want to see a Jaguar trip out,

1194
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,210
pull that video of a Jaguar tripping
out on DMT Jaguars in the Amazon.

1195
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,320
Find these DMT rich plants and the chew
them and eat them and have psychedelic

1196
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,154
experiences.

1197
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,380
And they have a different,

1198
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:25,880
apparently they have a different way of
processing things in their stomachs than

1199
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:30,800
we do because they're primarily
carnivores so they don't have the same gut

1200
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:31,790
enzymes and things like,

1201
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:32,210
here's the,

1202
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,330
here's the Jaguar up little place for you.

1203
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,260
Then we'll discuss it.

1204
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,170
But it's so crazy because this
Jaguar like they do it actively.

1205
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,950
It's like something they do on a regular
basis and they've observed that many

1206
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:47,341
times.

1207
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:50,250
They'll eat these grasses
and these plants rather.

1208
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,510
And then they just tripped it balls up.

1209
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,010
Raw Lodge cards.

1210
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:58,970
Jackie was,

1211
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,590
he leaves when regurgitated,

1212
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,470
they cleanse the digestive system.

1213
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,100
Uh,

1214
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:18,320
like cat nip some plants
in juice that effects,

1215
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:24,340
uh huh.

1216
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,540
This Jaguar is,

1217
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,350
first of all,

1218
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,720
that's one of the communist
rain forest vines.

1219
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,260
It seems to cause playful
kittenish behavior.

1220
00:36:33,261 --> 00:36:34,094
Yeah.

1221
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,670
But could something deeper be happening

1222
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,960
that cat is seeing all
kinds of shit right now.

1223
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,270
They're the king of the jungle.

1224
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,600
I mean the Jaguars in the real jungles.

1225
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,800
People in a hallucinogenic ritual.

1226
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:50,921
Yeah.

1227
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:52,090
The brain's fascinating.

1228
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:52,924
I mean it's,

1229
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,850
biology itself is pretty,

1230
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,050
pretty complicated.

1231
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:57,780
And you'll look at this Jaguar,

1232
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,020
his eyes are dilated.

1233
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,930
This is the same exact
plant that people use,

1234
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,100
an Iowaska rituals.

1235
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,310
So this jaguars eating it
and he's lying on his back.

1236
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,260
The Jaguar also like an
eight senses when he taught.

1237
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,010
It's pretty fascinating stuff.

1238
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,260
Like so much of weird nature.

1239
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,180
There is still so much to know.

1240
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,071
The,

1241
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:21,460
um,

1242
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:21,731
the,

1243
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:24,400
the human gut produces monoamine oxidase,

1244
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:26,390
which makes dimethyltryptamine uh,

1245
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,980
it doesn't,

1246
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,980
it kills it in the gut so that if
you consume grass that has DMT in it,

1247
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,381
you're,

1248
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:33,670
you don't have a psychedelic trip.

1249
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,820
But I don't know if a cat
has the same gut enzyme.

1250
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,440
Yeah.

1251
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,711
I don't,

1252
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,490
I'm not sure.

1253
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:38,880
Yeah,

1254
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,031
yeah.

1255
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:39,151
No,

1256
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:39,540
your gut,

1257
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,470
your gut has a lot.

1258
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:43,380
I mean it's making
neurotransmitters or you know it's,

1259
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,011
there's,

1260
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,560
there's neurons down there doing stuff
and there's a connection between the

1261
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:47,670
brain and the gut as well.

1262
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,640
But this is so far,

1263
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,380
the whole thing about the human mind is
so fascinating where someone like you

1264
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:56,700
who is just sort of putting together all
these different things that you found

1265
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:56,851
in,

1266
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:58,070
in different books and,

1267
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,861
and you go,

1268
00:37:58,861 --> 00:37:59,551
well hey look,

1269
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:03,360
this combination of things is
going on in the vitamin D and d,

1270
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,190
vitamin D depletion and then here we have
this issue with autism and autism has

1271
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,230
to do with inflammation.

1272
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,870
The Gut.

1273
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,703
Yeah.

1274
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,960
I put together a lot of stuff and I
explained the male dominance and all this

1275
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:15,860
and a really,

1276
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,850
my goal was,

1277
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,540
look,

1278
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,040
maybe I'm right on,

1279
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:19,400
you know,

1280
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,810
maybe I'm wrong on some of these things,

1281
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:21,290
but you know,

1282
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,640
I'm definitely right about some,

1283
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:24,230
some of these things here.

1284
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:25,190
I'm interjecting it,

1285
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,590
interjecting it into the,

1286
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,050
you know,

1287
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,680
the world,

1288
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,120
the scientific world for all you people
that actually do research on autism and

1289
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:33,920
do research on Serotonin and all this.

1290
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:34,790
Because I don't,

1291
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,460
I mean,

1292
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,310
that's not what I do.

1293
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,000
Um,

1294
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,560
and,

1295
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,680
and I think that that's,

1296
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,820
it's,

1297
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,910
it's good to have theoretical papers like
that sometimes where it's like you get

1298
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:45,940
someone who can make all these connections
where there's tons of stuff buried in

1299
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:46,774
the literature.

1300
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,800
And I had a mechanism,

1301
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:50,890
I had a specific mechanism
that explained it and,

1302
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:51,100
uh,

1303
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,870
you kind of just say
here now if you think,

1304
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:54,370
if you think it's an
interesting followup on it.

1305
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,420
And actually we started collaborating
with a group that does do research on one

1306
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:58,780
of these,

1307
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,330
you know,

1308
00:38:59,330 --> 00:38:59,620
uh,

1309
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,110
looks at Serotonin and
does vitamin D research.

1310
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,190
And they were just jumping
out of their chairs there,

1311
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:04,811
were so excited.

1312
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:09,130
And so now they're doing experiments and
if I have already found positive data,

1313
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,720
which is really nice and reinforcing,

1314
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,260
but,

1315
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,093
so that's,

1316
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,611
you know,

1317
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:13,030
that was,

1318
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,670
that was my goal is chuck kind
of just make these connections,

1319
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,533
big picture,

1320
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,111
you know,

1321
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,150
find a mechanism,

1322
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,900
finding a mechanism by which vitamin
deregulated Saratonin was amazing.

1323
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,201
And,

1324
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:23,410
uh,

1325
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,310
putting it out in literature,

1326
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,000
I mean,

1327
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,760
but the whole vitamin D thing,

1328
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:30,400
vitamin D three is important.

1329
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,640
And I think it's something
that most people are,

1330
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,100
70% of the population is
not getting an adequate,

1331
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,700
you know,

1332
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,080
70% 70.

1333
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:38,411
Yeah.

1334
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:38,951
Actually,

1335
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,640
um,

1336
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,900
we have someone reach out
to me on Twitter after,

1337
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:46,420
after the last podcast and
artist and he was like,

1338
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:46,661
look,

1339
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:48,490
I really like what you're
doing and you know,

1340
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:53,260
I've been wanting to make a cool
infographic just basically summarizing

1341
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,210
everything I ever talk
about with vitamin D.

1342
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:59,230
It's like all in one graphic and he did
it for me and if you want to pull it up,

1343
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:03,520
it's on found my fitness.com
forward slash vitamin D.

1344
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,180
Hi.

1345
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:09,030
No Vitamin Hyphen d and it's a fricking
awesome infographic where this guy,

1346
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,873
this guy's name,

1347
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,271
oh,

1348
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:10,931
his name's Jason,

1349
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:11,764
right?

1350
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,260
Jason.

1351
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,560
Jason,

1352
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:13,930
right?

1353
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,351
Yeah.

1354
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:15,280
So uh,

1355
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,260
he made this infographic where it's like,

1356
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:21,310
basically I talk about how
vitamin D regulates a thousand
different genes in the

1357
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:22,144
body.

1358
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:22,421
Yeah.

1359
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,200
Here it is.

1360
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,460
So it starts off here.

1361
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,150
It's got this guy with all these like
chromosomes and in with Tila mirrors

1362
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:30,310
because vitamin D is
important for telomere length.

1363
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,630
Who I want to talk about that too.

1364
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,050
Oh,

1365
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,883
totally.

1366
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,450
And then if you scroll down,

1367
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:34,781
it's like,

1368
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:35,051
look,

1369
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:35,560
he's showing,

1370
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:35,771
oh,

1371
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:39,280
70% of the US population does
not have adequate levels.

1372
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,290
I thought that was really cool.

1373
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,130
The graph to see 10 people.

1374
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,561
Yeah,

1375
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:43,394
exactly.

1376
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,643
Right.

1377
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,520
Right.

1378
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,400
And then it goes on it.

1379
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:50,590
And this is like you're a tag cloud where
it's like all the things that go wrong

1380
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:51,730
when you don't have enough vitamin D.

1381
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:52,564
He's incredible.

1382
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,673
Awesome.

1383
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,281
So,

1384
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:55,900
and it's like learning impairments,

1385
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,231
you know,

1386
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,390
reduce Saratonin,

1387
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,360
increase cancer risk,

1388
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:01,120
all I mean by nine over a thousand
different genes in the body.

1389
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:01,691
It's a need.

1390
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:02,231
Scroll down more.

1391
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,480
And it shows a teal and rare
because it actually DNA,

1392
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,540
DNA repair enzymes are
regulated by vitamin D as well.

1393
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,220
So if you're not getting enough vitamin D,

1394
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:10,054
You're going to have,

1395
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,620
you can see that break in your DNA.

1396
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,030
You're going to get damage to DNA.

1397
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,680
And then as you keep going,

1398
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,250
it shows you,

1399
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:15,461
oh,

1400
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,860
all the factors that
regulate your vitamin D,

1401
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:20,260
like how sunscreen blocks UVB.

1402
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,640
So you can't make it with Sunscreen,

1403
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,541
a Melanin,

1404
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:26,890
which is an adaptation to
prevent UVB rays from burning.

1405
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:31,690
You actually also blocks your ability
to make vitamin D and body fat regulates

1406
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:31,960
it.

1407
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,530
So all these different body fat regulation
regulates the bioavailability of it.

1408
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,230
So it has to be released into the
bloodstream to get converted into active

1409
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:40,370
hormone age.

1410
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,450
Age regulates it.

1411
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,310
A 70 year old makes,

1412
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,880
um,

1413
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,950
four times less vitamin D from their skin.

1414
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:47,540
Then there are former 20 year old self,

1415
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,380
all these things living in the northern
latitudes and other thing people at live

1416
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,130
in like,

1417
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,130
I think it says a above 37 degrees
north with the exception of the summer.

1418
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,020
They cannot make any
vitamin D from the sun.

1419
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:00,980
Wow.

1420
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,910
So the solution is vitamin
D supplement and uh,

1421
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,121
we,

1422
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:05,790
you know,

1423
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,290
this is just a really awesome way
to put all this great information.

1424
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,071
Uh,

1425
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:10,431
you know,

1426
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:12,410
show it with graphics,

1427
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:13,101
people like that.

1428
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:13,671
And it's hard,

1429
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,050
easier for people to understand and it,

1430
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:15,861
and I go into,

1431
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:16,251
you know,

1432
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,990
what your level should be and all that,

1433
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:20,040
but I was really stoked because I,

1434
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:23,300
I've been wanting to do this for a
really long time and I have no artistic

1435
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,440
capabilities.

1436
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,430
So,

1437
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,580
no,

1438
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,340
that's so cool.

1439
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,790
Someone just reaching out to me and,

1440
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,540
and wanting to help was like,

1441
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,150
err,

1442
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,471
you know,

1443
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:31,220
it was really cool.

1444
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,521
So,

1445
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,060
um,

1446
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,220
where is it on your website
if you're looking for it?

1447
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,820
I think if you sign up for my newsletter,

1448
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:38,654
I think it's,

1449
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,351
yeah.

1450
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:39,651
Yeah.

1451
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,131
I think that's,

1452
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:43,820
that's how your website's
getting crushed right now.

1453
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:47,930
It's really hard to even get to is
it took me five chances to get to it.

1454
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:48,610
Wow.

1455
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:48,830
Yeah.

1456
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,390
It's not so,

1457
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:50,871
so yeah,

1458
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:51,151
that,

1459
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:51,621
that's the,

1460
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:51,921
uh,

1461
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:52,700
the cool,

1462
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,630
the vitamin D.

1463
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,523
That's very cool.

1464
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:54,921
Yeah,

1465
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:55,520
totally.

1466
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,490
The telomere mere length

1467
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:56,820
thing.

1468
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,110
The reason why I wanted to get to that
is because I had emailed you about this

1469
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:03,090
supplement that I had
read about called t a 65.

1470
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:05,790
And I had read about it
because my friend Bobby,

1471
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,020
uh,

1472
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,230
uh,

1473
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:07,531
he,

1474
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:07,860
uh,

1475
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,300
emailed me about it and,

1476
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:09,451
uh,

1477
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:10,680
his dad was taken.

1478
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,191
That's bad.

1479
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:13,020
Bobby for folks on the message board,

1480
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,310
B A,

1481
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:14,790
D,

1482
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,121
B,

1483
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:15,241
O,

1484
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:15,361
B,

1485
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:15,511
B,

1486
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:16,200
y.

1487
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,033
Um,

1488
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:17,521
he,

1489
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:18,000
uh,

1490
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,080
his damn is taking in.

1491
00:43:19,081 --> 00:43:20,640
His Dad started experiencing,

1492
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,330
um,

1493
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,520
vision improvement and I was like,

1494
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:23,760
that,

1495
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,770
that's fucking crazy.

1496
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,970
And so like what does this ta 65 stuff.

1497
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:31,350
So I go on to Google and I Google
ta 65 and there's a whole knees,

1498
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,641
well,

1499
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:36,120
crazy claims and Ilana people
are selling it and you know,

1500
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:40,740
there's a lawsuit against it because
there was a guy who was working for the

1501
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:41,191
company,

1502
00:43:41,191 --> 00:43:43,500
a former executive who uh,

1503
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,060
who is suing them because he says that
it might have caused him to it to get

1504
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:48,810
cancer.

1505
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,190
And I mean,

1506
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,380
the idea is what they're saying.

1507
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,613
This is a,

1508
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,380
you know,

1509
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,350
the company that sells it.

1510
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:56,700
Um,

1511
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,240
this is the correlation between cellular
aging and telomere length is rooted in

1512
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,074
solid research.

1513
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,220
Telomeres become shorter every time a
cell divides and when they are lost,

1514
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:09,600
cells can no longer reproduce the
enzyme telomeres tell him arrays.

1515
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,081
How'd he say it?

1516
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:10,621
Telomerase.

1517
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:11,340
Telomerase,

1518
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,340
telomerase can lengthen telomeres
possibly slowing or reversing degenerative

1519
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:17,071
diseases.

1520
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:17,970
In one study,

1521
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:22,200
mice genetically engineered to lack
functional telemere rays tell marines

1522
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,063
telomerase

1523
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Dulac functional to telomerase showed
brain degeneration and shrunk and testes.

1524
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,010
But those effects

1525
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,570
were reversed when the
enzyme was reactivated in
such findings have sparked a

1526
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:40,980
lot of hype and encourage a
cottage industry of companies
that assess a person's

1527
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,980
biological age on the basis
of their telomere length.

1528
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,010
But ta sciences has taken the buzz
further and they sell a pill called ta 65,

1529
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,780
which it says can shorten,

1530
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,190
couldn't lengthen,

1531
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,910
excuse me.

1532
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,260
Short telomeres.

1533
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,050
Yes.

1534
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:56,430
All right.

1535
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,510
No tilimeers yes,

1536
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:58,344
but let me,

1537
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,130
let me explain.

1538
00:44:59,130 --> 00:44:59,963
This is

1539
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,460
so complicated,

1540
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:03,330
but I think I can,

1541
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,620
I think I can shed some light.

1542
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,523
Okay,

1543
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,900
so this is all right.

1544
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:07,111
You know,

1545
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:07,944
Tila Mirrors,

1546
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,610
she,

1547
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:08,880
you know,

1548
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,480
every cell in your body has 46
chromosomes with the exception of your,

1549
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,110
you know,

1550
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:13,651
Gametes,

1551
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:14,490
which I have 23.

1552
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,020
But um,

1553
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,730
these chromosomes have your DNA,

1554
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,061
okay?

1555
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,940
They're wound up with these histone
proteins and that's where your DNA is.

1556
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,630
And at the end of these
chromosomes are your telomeres.

1557
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,350
The problem is is that these tilimeers
have a funny structure where their DNA,

1558
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,150
they have,

1559
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:29,431
it's a,

1560
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:31,710
it's a repeat of t,

1561
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,140
t a,

1562
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,381
g,

1563
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:32,551
G,

1564
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:37,320
G and there's like this structural defect
in your and the DNA of the teal where

1565
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,220
there's a big overhang and like one of
your strands of DNA is longer than the

1566
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:42,000
other one.

1567
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,740
And so when your cell,

1568
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,050
when the cell divides and it's got,

1569
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,781
it's got a copy,

1570
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:50,010
its entire genome with all
those 46 chromosomes to make
a new cell with all that

1571
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:50,844
same DNA,

1572
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:51,991
there's a,

1573
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:54,090
there's a little gap there
at the end cause it's like,

1574
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,451
oh my God,

1575
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,290
I don't have anything here.

1576
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:55,711
What do I,

1577
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,970
how do I make the new DNA?

1578
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,370
And so what happens is the next cell
then has a little bit shorter telomere

1579
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,220
because there was that little
gap that didn't get filled.

1580
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,020
And this is happening so successfully
over multiple generations year after year,

1581
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:08,010
after year after year.

1582
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,300
Each time it gets a little shorter.

1583
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:12,900
Each time he gets a little shorter and
that becomes a problem because these

1584
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:16,710
telomeres are actually
protecting your DNA from damage.

1585
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:16,980
You know,

1586
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,090
oxidative damage from,

1587
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,370
from unwinding and also from your chrome,

1588
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,151
your chromosomes.

1589
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:23,800
When your cell divides a year,

1590
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,120
they protect our chromosomes from fusing
together and like getting all these

1591
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:29,670
funny abnormal translocations,

1592
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:32,670
which lead to cancer and other problems.

1593
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,680
So you don't want that to happen.

1594
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,720
And the problem is,

1595
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,220
is that you,

1596
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,270
most of ourselves,

1597
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:43,980
with the exception of our stem cells
and our lymphocytes don't express this

1598
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:45,360
enzyme called telomerase,

1599
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:48,480
which is able to actually
rebuild the telomeres.

1600
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,420
It's actually able to
rebuild the end where that,

1601
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,990
that telomere little gap
where we can't make it.

1602
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,610
So it's really cool.

1603
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,031
It's like,

1604
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:57,121
well,

1605
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:58,800
here's this great enzyme
that can rebuild it,

1606
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,640
but why is it only in our stem cells
and why isn't it an all of ourselves?

1607
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,270
Uh,

1608
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,570
the,

1609
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,440
the gene is there,

1610
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:05,730
but it's just not activated.

1611
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,210
It's,

1612
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,570
you know,

1613
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,403
silenced.

1614
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,060
And the,

1615
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:10,800
a answer for that as well.

1616
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:11,851
If you're,

1617
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:15,000
if you express too much telomerase
and all these other cells,

1618
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,480
um,

1619
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,280
what happens is you can make a cell and
mortal and cancer cells have actually

1620
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,120
developed.

1621
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,871
They're so smart.

1622
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,610
Cancer cells are like
the smartest thing ever.

1623
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,270
Um,

1624
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,310
they've developed this,

1625
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,440
this capability to reactivate
that enzyme to become immortal.

1626
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,100
Um,

1627
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,480
but the really ironic thing is,

1628
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,030
is that it's the critically short
telomeres when you're short,

1629
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,620
when your telomeres get to a really,

1630
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:35,921
really,

1631
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,000
really short stage,

1632
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,130
they go into this crisis where it's like,

1633
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,851
oh my God,

1634
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:40,211
what do I do?

1635
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:40,900
What do I do?

1636
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,291
You know?

1637
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,230
And they either die or they,

1638
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:44,460
you know,

1639
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,670
go into this senescence state where
they don't divide or they somehow can

1640
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,260
reactivate this telomerase.

1641
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,580
And at that point,

1642
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:52,870
if they reactivate this telomerase,

1643
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,320
you can,

1644
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:53,561
if you,

1645
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,530
if this is a damaged cell that
already has mutations and stuff,

1646
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,160
you're like,

1647
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,520
boom,

1648
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:57,851
okay,

1649
00:47:57,851 --> 00:47:58,330
we're going to,

1650
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,800
we're going to keep you going now.

1651
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,900
So it's kind of paradoxical that the
short telomere length is what actually can

1652
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,160
reactivate the telomerase to make,

1653
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,150
make it become immortal and make cancer.

1654
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:10,720
Yeah.

1655
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:10,991
Well,

1656
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,130
if you already have mutation,

1657
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,311
yeah.

1658
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:14,980
If it's already like an abnormal cell
because you've already gotten damaged and

1659
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:15,491
stuff to it.

1660
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:15,881
Yes,

1661
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:16,530
exactly.

1662
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,090
She can take a precancerous cell and say,

1663
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:19,391
here,

1664
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:20,140
keep going.

1665
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,973
Grow more.

1666
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:21,761
So,

1667
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:22,594
um,

1668
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,560
so this is a,

1669
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:27,160
the telomerase is in stem cells because
your stem cells aren't dividing that

1670
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:27,501
much.

1671
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:29,020
So usually just sitting around waiting to,

1672
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:32,500
they have to come out and divide and
make more of a certain cell type and then

1673
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:34,090
they go back into just waiting around.

1674
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,290
So they're not constantly,

1675
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:35,891
you know,

1676
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:40,891
dividing meaning they're not
constantly get at risk for more damage.

1677
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,610
And I can explain that later.

1678
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:43,071
But anyway,

1679
00:48:43,071 --> 00:48:44,490
so the,

1680
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,090
the telomerase and the mice,

1681
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:46,901
this is kind of cool.

1682
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:49,330
So you talked about these
telomerase deficient mice.

1683
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:49,630
Well,

1684
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,680
mice actually,

1685
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:51,610
it's really weird.

1686
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,220
They express telomerase
and all their cells,

1687
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,940
their team members don't get shorter
and yet they only lived two years on

1688
00:48:57,941 --> 00:48:58,630
average.

1689
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,630
And so in order to try to understand
the biological mechanisms by which,

1690
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,380
and telomere shortening what that,

1691
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,550
what those effects are,

1692
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:10,750
you have to genetically engineer
them to not express that telomerase.

1693
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,420
And what happens is over
multiple generations,

1694
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:15,280
it takes like three,

1695
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:15,910
three or four.

1696
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,380
When you get to generation for,

1697
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,933
you know,

1698
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,200
then you start to see progeria types
of effects where now these mice they're

1699
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:26,050
born to is a fourth generation
of not having this enzyme.

1700
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,890
It takes like that long to actually get
the telomeres to it really short level

1701
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:32,980
where it starts to have perjury effects
and they start to prematurely age their

1702
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:33,290
tissue,

1703
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,000
start to,

1704
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,420
you know,

1705
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,240
break down and they have all
these sorts of aging effects.

1706
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,283
Um,

1707
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,430
and so what they've shown is they can
reactivate telomerase at that point after

1708
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:45,880
four generations and it reverses
those biological effects.

1709
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,770
So the tissues become younger.

1710
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,790
This stem cells,

1711
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,421
you know,

1712
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:49,661
our,

1713
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:50,230
our,

1714
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,500
you know,

1715
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,430
active and making replenishing
populations like they're supposed to.

1716
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,870
So it's kind of cool.

1717
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:58,000
It's like here you have
this pro aging mouse,

1718
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:03,001
you reactivate the enzyme and it
literally reversed the aging in these mice

1719
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,990
would have a possible benefit
to children that have progeria.

1720
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,810
So,

1721
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:10,390
um,

1722
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:10,900
the,

1723
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,580
it depends on what type of progeria.

1724
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:12,851
There's,

1725
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:15,280
there's certain ones like
there's Werner Syndrome,

1726
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,660
which if you,

1727
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,523
um,

1728
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,100
pull out,

1729
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,170
if you just Google Warner
Syndrome and image it.

1730
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,960
W E r n e R.

1731
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,380
Warner.

1732
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,213
That's a,

1733
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,330
a disease that's,

1734
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:25,980
um,

1735
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,220
info involves,

1736
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:27,591
you know,

1737
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,440
short telomeres.

1738
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,031
So you're basically,

1739
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:29,480
you're,

1740
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,080
you're,

1741
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,830
you can't rebuild your telomeres and the,

1742
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,770
it's excessive to telomere shortening.

1743
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,180
And what happens is,

1744
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:35,451
yeah,

1745
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:36,284
if you click on the,

1746
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,300
the one with the two with
pictures of the women,

1747
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,703
um,

1748
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,300
by the time they reach puberty,

1749
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:42,200
like 15,

1750
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,281
uh,

1751
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:43,470
no,

1752
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,210
not that one.

1753
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:44,391
The,

1754
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:44,840
there was,

1755
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,590
if you go back,

1756
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,730
there's the,

1757
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,330
yeah,

1758
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:47,541
the,

1759
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,730
it's like Filipino woman
there I think left.

1760
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:49,911
Yeah.

1761
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:50,451
There we go.

1762
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:51,290
Left hand corner.

1763
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,333
Perfect.

1764
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,420
Yes.

1765
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,290
So like she ages normally up
until the age of about 15,

1766
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,060
and then after 15,

1767
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,770
she's 40 years old in that right,

1768
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,850
right hand picture.

1769
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:02,240
Wow.

1770
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,631
40.

1771
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:02,871
I mean,

1772
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:05,950
she looks like she's like right or 90.

1773
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:06,141
Yeah,

1774
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:07,070
she looks pretty old.

1775
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,143
So,

1776
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:08,991
um,

1777
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:09,471
in that,

1778
00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:10,161
in that case,

1779
00:51:10,161 --> 00:51:15,161
it'd be interesting to see
if having telomerase could
help rebuild the telomers.

1780
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:16,430
But like I said,

1781
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:21,431
because of the potential danger of
allowing a precancerous cell to become

1782
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:23,000
immortal,

1783
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,170
I think there's been a lot of,

1784
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,300
there's a lot of people
are careful about that.

1785
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:28,790
And that's why it's not like on the
market right now where you're just,

1786
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:30,440
people are selling it.

1787
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,850
This is the thing,

1788
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:35,420
this a ta 65 stuff and this is the,

1789
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:35,601
uh,

1790
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:39,440
the lawsuit is that this
guy who worked for them,

1791
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:40,260
uh,

1792
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,780
is saying that he got cancer.

1793
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,020
So the thing with reactivating
telomerase is if you are,

1794
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,680
if you generally are healthy,

1795
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,470
you don't have a lot of your
c reactive proteins low,

1796
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:51,740
you're not,

1797
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,300
you don't have a lot of inflammation,

1798
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,550
a lot of damaged cells,

1799
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,380
then a lot of precancer cells,

1800
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:58,740
your immune system is getting rid of them.

1801
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,683
You know,

1802
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,340
reactivating telomerase in a normal
cell is not really a bad thing.

1803
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:06,140
It's not going to make it a cancer cell.

1804
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,670
It's going to make it a mortal.

1805
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:11,060
It's going to help you know it not
have critically short Tila mirrors.

1806
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,740
The problem is Rianna debating it in a
cell that has a bunch of damage in it.

1807
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,470
And so to me,

1808
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,011
you know,

1809
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:19,461
measuring,

1810
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:19,970
looking,

1811
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,800
looking at how much damages in your cell.

1812
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,521
Like we can do that.

1813
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:24,140
I do that right now in people.

1814
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,690
I take the blood cells
and I look at DNA damage,

1815
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,040
check it out.

1816
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,550
Yeah.

1817
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,480
You have to come,

1818
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,141
you can't,

1819
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:30,974
uh,

1820
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,850
you'd have to come down to the bay and
the bay area and sign a consent form.

1821
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,983
That's it.

1822
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,780
Just like you signed a consent
form when you a do a podcast.

1823
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,770
Uh,

1824
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,603
yeah.

1825
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,510
Kind of,

1826
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,410
kind of like that,

1827
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,870
just to be in part of my trial.

1828
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:45,310
So,

1829
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,110
so like what,

1830
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:46,943
what do you do?

1831
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,030
So what I do is I,

1832
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,060
I take blood,

1833
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:52,910
well I get an MD to take it from for me.

1834
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,530
And so they draw the blood and then I
take the blood and I sent her a few shit

1835
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,210
through this gradient where I can
then isolate just the peripheral blood

1836
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,260
mononuclear cells,

1837
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,460
which are like mostly B and t
lymphocytes that's in some monocytes.

1838
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:11,030
So I don't have any red blood cells or
platelets or any of those neutrophils.

1839
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:11,391
I don't want,

1840
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,250
those are Mac macrophages
or things like that.

1841
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:13,431
So,

1842
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:14,264
and I take those,

1843
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,300
those peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and I look at the amount of double

1844
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:21,890
stranded breaks in the DNA.

1845
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,990
So I can actually measure that.

1846
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:24,920
I can quantify that.

1847
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,440
And I'm not only do I look at those
double stranded breaks in the DNA,

1848
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:30,360
so the double stranded breaks,

1849
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:30,741
um,

1850
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,730
I think we talked about
this a little bit last time.

1851
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:35,640
So just normal living,

1852
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:36,871
it's just,

1853
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:39,930
it's so it's a like here's
aging for you in a nutshell.

1854
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,670
Just normal age,

1855
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,920
living your metabolism,

1856
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,570
your mitochondria are generating,

1857
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
generating oxygen,

1858
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:47,880
rattled radicals,

1859
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,230
which you know,

1860
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,310
gets your DNA and you get
enough of these oxygen radicals.

1861
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:55,200
It caused the strand break and
then you get them in parallel.

1862
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:56,250
You have to strand breaks,

1863
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,500
UV radiation does the same thing,

1864
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,200
but let's just forget about
all the outside stuff.

1865
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,640
Like forget about carcinogens,

1866
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:03,390
UV,

1867
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,081
smoking,

1868
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:04,470
all that.

1869
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,340
Just normal.

1870
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,383
You know,

1871
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,510
living does this and this
happens every single day,

1872
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,500
you know,

1873
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,520
and so your,

1874
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,170
your body has to repair that damage.

1875
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:15,150
And I talked about those
enzymes that are magnesium,

1876
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,140
magnesium dependent and how magnesium
is important for DNA repair enzymes.

1877
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:21,810
And 45% of the population
doesn't have enough of that.

1878
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:22,440
Well,

1879
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,440
I'm looking at people that are obese
and those people usually don't have a

1880
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:31,770
really good diet and they're
most often magnesium deficient.

1881
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:32,340
Well,

1882
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,550
I don't want to say deficient cause it's
not like a clinical acute deficiency.

1883
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:36,720
It's like they're inadequate.

1884
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:36,971
Okay.

1885
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:38,640
If inadequate levels of magnesium,

1886
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,980
they're not taking enough magnesium,

1887
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,290
which is 400 or so milligrams today.

1888
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,580
They,

1889
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,590
so I look at their DNA,

1890
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,080
their strand breaks and then I have
this because I think that they're not

1891
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,100
getting enough magnesium.

1892
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:50,371
I don't,

1893
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:51,870
I'm not actually
measuring their magnesium.

1894
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,704
Someone else,

1895
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,100
um,

1896
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,210
that I work with can do that.

1897
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:54,930
But I haven't,

1898
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,320
we haven't,

1899
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,840
I haven't found it
necessary to do that yet.

1900
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:58,770
Um,

1901
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,030
then what I'm doing is I'm a Mac,

1902
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,950
I'm measuring the capacity of their,

1903
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:06,090
that their body has to repair a
known amount of damage that I induce.

1904
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,130
So I look at their
baseline damage sandwich,

1905
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,330
how much damage is there,

1906
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:11,400
and then I induced
damage with an radiator.

1907
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,590
And then I measure over time the ability
of their own enzymes to repair that

1908
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:17,424
damage.

1909
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,430
And what I'm finding is that if I look
at someone who's lean or obese based on

1910
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:23,304
BMI,

1911
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,440
then I'm seeing there's differences.

1912
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:29,910
I'm seeing that people with that
are obese have a BMI of 30 or so.

1913
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,780
They have a lot more of this
damage in their blood cells.

1914
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:35,760
And not only do they have
a lot more of this damage,

1915
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,810
their capacity to repair
this damage is impaired.

1916
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:40,771
So,

1917
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:41,730
and it makes sense to me.

1918
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,091
You know,

1919
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:42,301
you're,

1920
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:42,811
you're looking at,

1921
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:45,450
you're talking about people
that are eating poor diets.

1922
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,050
They're,

1923
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,750
they're eating very macro
nutrient rich diet diets.

1924
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:48,931
You know,

1925
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:52,770
they're eating a lot of processed foods
and junk food and they're not getting

1926
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:54,630
their micronutrients there.

1927
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,680
Essential vitamins,

1928
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:56,071
zinc,

1929
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:56,710
magnesium,

1930
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,180
these are,

1931
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,410
these are required for like 300
different enzymes to work in the body.

1932
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,780
And so I'm measuring one of those.

1933
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:04,950
And that's DNA repair,

1934
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:06,630
which is important to prevent cancer.

1935
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,093
Um,

1936
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,020
so anyways,

1937
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,860
what were we talking?

1938
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,693
We were talking.

1939
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,841
That's right.

1940
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:14,790
So I went on this whole,

1941
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,900
so that's agent,

1942
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,430
that's part of aging in a nutshell.

1943
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:19,380
And there's other points of it I can,

1944
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:21,270
we can get back to later
in the conversation.

1945
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:21,750
But,

1946
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,860
so ta 65 is,

1947
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,400
um,

1948
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,550
I was actually really impressed
because I read a couple of the studies.

1949
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,980
So ta 65 astragalus root,

1950
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,180
some Chinese herb or something or it,

1951
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:34,540
that's,

1952
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:34,931
that's what,

1953
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:35,110
uh,

1954
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,040
that's what it's from.

1955
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,330
I believe from,

1956
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:38,164
from what I read.

1957
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,213
And,

1958
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,820
uh,

1959
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,780
I think I'm saying it right,

1960
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:42,210
the stragglers route.

1961
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,150
So it has the capacity
to activate telomerase.

1962
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,560
Um,

1963
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,330
and there's,

1964
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:50,950
there's two different papers
that were pretty good.

1965
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:54,490
One paper was a clinical
paper where they looked,

1966
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:58,900
they gave people varying doses of ta 65
and I don't remember the exact doses,

1967
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,780
but they did a dose response and
they looked at a couple of things.

1968
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,051
A,

1969
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,780
they looked at the
activation of that enzyme,

1970
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,460
telomerase and B,

1971
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:08,170
they looked at telomere length.

1972
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,360
So they started the
trial baseline measure,

1973
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,350
telomere length and telomerase activity.

1974
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:19,840
And then they gave people these
ta 65 at various doses of it.

1975
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,910
And what they found is that
in a dose dependent manner,

1976
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,910
the ta 65 increased a telomerase activity.

1977
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:25,990
Um,

1978
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,800
and not only did it increase
tall telomerase activity
in the very high doses,

1979
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,160
in a,

1980
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,690
in a subset of people,

1981
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:37,140
it actually increased the length
of their telomere over baseline.

1982
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:39,280
I've never seen this before usually.

1983
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,170
So usually you're,

1984
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:44,260
when you're doing a lot of other things
affecting them or length vitamin DS,

1985
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:44,860
one,

1986
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,401
one of them,

1987
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:48,400
vitamin D the Way Vitamin D effects
telomere length is totally different than

1988
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,660
the way ta 65 to,

1989
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:52,690
because vitamin D is
preventing DNA damage,

1990
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:55,270
inflammation and things that
accelerate telomere shortening.

1991
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,010
Ta 65 is literally rebuilding
the end of your telomeres.

1992
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:04,600
So it's possible to actually start and
end up with a longer telomere as opposed

1993
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:05,120
to,

1994
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,350
you know,

1995
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:09,520
other nutritional factors that regulate
just delaying the attrition of it.

1996
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,530
Does that make sense?

1997
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:10,870
Yeah.

1998
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,740
So that over baseline they had like a 40%,

1999
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,220
I believe from reading
that paper awhile ago,

2000
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,110
a 40% increase in telomere length.

2001
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,573
That's incredible.

2002
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:22,361
It was incredible.

2003
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:23,194
It's incredible.

2004
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,410
So then I went and read the other study,

2005
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,530
which was the,

2006
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,810
the mouse study.

2007
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,380
Um,

2008
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,370
and actually the woman,

2009
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:31,300
the lead investigator on,

2010
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,380
I'm very familiar with her work.

2011
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:36,270
I was really close to doing a postdoc in
telomere and the two of them were lab.

2012
00:58:36,271 --> 00:58:36,600
Cause I've,

2013
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,400
I've been very interested in
tilimeers for quite some time.

2014
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,091
Um,

2015
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:43,090
so I had been familiar
with herder her papers,

2016
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:44,200
like her publications.

2017
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,071
And I was like,

2018
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:45,881
when I saw that she was,

2019
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:46,720
it was from her lab,

2020
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:47,081
I was like,

2021
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:47,591
oh it's,

2022
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:48,760
I know I'm familiar with her work.

2023
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:49,420
You know,

2024
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,350
she's pretty good.

2025
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,250
I'm pretty thorough.

2026
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:52,780
And so her paper,

2027
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:56,560
what she did was she took that same mouse
model that I was talking about where

2028
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:58,780
they over successive generations,

2029
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:02,230
they knock out that telomerase
enzyme and they over,

2030
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:02,530
you know,

2031
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,620
three or four or five generations and
they start to get these mice that have

2032
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,290
really short telomeres that are aging.

2033
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,940
Their tissues are aging quicker.

2034
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,900
And they gave those mice like
third or fourth generation mice,

2035
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,100
ta 65.

2036
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,820
And what they found was that giving those
minds to ta 65 was able to rejuvenate

2037
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,550
their tissue.

2038
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,140
You know,

2039
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,391
that she,

2040
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:26,960
she started to look younger are very
similar to telomerase reactivation,

2041
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:28,100
not as robust,

2042
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,150
which isn't surprising.

2043
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,301
I mean,

2044
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:32,720
you're talking about reactivating the
entire enzyme versus something that's

2045
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:32,991
just,

2046
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,201
you know,

2047
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:34,340
able to activate it.

2048
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,110
But they,

2049
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:37,400
the mice didn't get cancer.

2050
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:38,390
Um,

2051
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,640
they,

2052
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,010
they didn't get any types of cancer.

2053
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,083
So,

2054
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,560
but like I said,

2055
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,041
now,

2056
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:43,874
if you were to take,

2057
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,770
if you were to take a mouse model,

2058
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,510
knock out their telomerase enzyme,

2059
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,090
inoculate them with cancer cells,

2060
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:55,150
so give them cancer cells and then
react and then giving them the ta 65,

2061
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,330
it'd be,

2062
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,950
they're probably going
to do that experiment.

2063
00:59:57,951 --> 00:59:58,161
I mean,

2064
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:58,491
that's the,

2065
00:59:58,491 --> 00:59:59,990
that's the logical thing to do next,

2066
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:00,824
just to make sure,

2067
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:01,940
um,

2068
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,091
to,

2069
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:04,670
to really prove that it's,

2070
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,060
it's,

2071
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,020
it's pretty safe.

2072
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:06,770
Um,

2073
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,420
so bottom line is,

2074
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:10,400
I was impressed with ta 65.

2075
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,060
Um,

2076
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:11,391
actually,

2077
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,350
surprisingly so.

2078
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,071
I,

2079
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,630
and you know,

2080
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,471
personally,

2081
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:15,731
I,

2082
01:00:15,731 --> 01:00:15,980
I,

2083
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,311
you know,

2084
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:16,610
I,

2085
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,530
I think there's always that risk.

2086
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:18,771
It's like,

2087
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:18,921
well,

2088
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,720
if you have a lot of precancerous cells,

2089
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,220
there's no telling.

2090
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:22,491
I,

2091
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:22,910
you know,

2092
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,050
I obviously,

2093
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:24,290
if the,

2094
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,250
if it was a big issue,

2095
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,050
more people would be
coming down with cancer.

2096
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,430
I wonder how many people
are taking this stuff.

2097
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,390
I've only heard of a couple of
people that I know they're taking it.

2098
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,480
I've read some folks online and a
message board that I go to that say they

2099
01:00:36,481 --> 01:00:37,261
started taking it,

2100
01:00:37,261 --> 01:00:38,760
but I don't know enough of it

2101
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,050
about how many are,

2102
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,880
I don't know how many
people are taking it either.

2103
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,810
Um,

2104
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,700
that that would be my one concern though,

2105
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:47,370
is that having a bunch
of precancerous cells,

2106
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,560
reactivating telomerase in those cells,

2107
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:50,394
then pushing them,

2108
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53,670
giving them the fuel they need
to then make more cancer cells.

2109
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,780
That's a possibility.

2110
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:58,450
People that own the company
there with the guys,

2111
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,040
it's a whole thing is really,

2112
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,180
really odd.

2113
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:04,690
I don't know exactly what happened because
apparently there was like some sort

2114
01:01:04,691 --> 01:01:05,560
of a physical art,

2115
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:10,561
the altercation with the guy who was
suing them and they're suing him because

2116
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:16,120
they're saying that they lost $2 million
in sales because he said that he got

2117
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:16,954
cancer,

2118
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,030
which is,

2119
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,350
and they're also saying
that if he had cancer,

2120
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,730
he had it before he started taking ta 65

2121
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,790
how the fuck could you ever know that?

2122
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:26,180
Right.

2123
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:26,540
Well,

2124
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,410
but that's the thing,

2125
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,160
that's,

2126
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,150
that's the thing right.

2127
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,580
If you have cancer before taking it,

2128
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,180
right.

2129
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,650
I'm not saying this is going to happen.

2130
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,740
I'm saying theoretically reactivating
telomerase could push those cancer cells

2131
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,550
to full blown precancerous cells to full
blown blown cancer because now there's

2132
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,190
immortalizing them and letting them
survive and propagate and pull it right.

2133
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,790
That here's the question.

2134
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,020
Here's the big one.

2135
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,520
Is there

2136
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,560
a diet,

2137
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,880
a thing that you can do?

2138
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:55,090
The,

2139
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,500
the word is always,

2140
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:56,951
oh,

2141
01:01:56,951 --> 01:01:58,210
you need to have a,

2142
01:01:58,211 --> 01:01:58,661
you know,

2143
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:02,500
a cancer cells can't grow
in an alkaline environment,

2144
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:03,090
but I've,

2145
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:03,641
I've heard it,

2146
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:05,160
that's horseshit to that,

2147
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:09,700
this idea of alkalizing your blood and
having a diet that makes your blood or

2148
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:12,040
your body alkaline rich is horse shit.

2149
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,790
I'm totally not familiar with any of that.

2150
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:16,260
So never heard of that before.

2151
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,840
I've heard of people wanting
to alkaline their blood.

2152
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:19,830
I know why.

2153
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:20,160
I never

2154
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,520
really followed up on it and I
certainly haven't heard about the cancer

2155
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,540
connection to it.

2156
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,590
So that's new to me.

2157
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:26,220
Um,

2158
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,770
I've definitely heard of other
things people are trying to do.

2159
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,011
Well,

2160
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,660
you can go alkaline cancer.

2161
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:33,090
And one of the first things
that pops up is myth,

2162
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:36,930
the acid alkaline myth.

2163
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,190
Um,

2164
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,190
if what I've read the w
that's counteracting this
is that if you did alter the

2165
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:45,810
alkaline of your body,

2166
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,651
like the,

2167
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:49,380
the variables are so small that if you've,

2168
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,880
if you alter it in,

2169
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:51,151
in,

2170
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:52,890
in any sort of a shocking way,

2171
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,990
your body just is fucked.

2172
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:55,501
Like it's,

2173
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:56,640
it's not good.

2174
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:57,600
Right?

2175
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:57,931
No,

2176
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:58,440
it's true.

2177
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,010
I mean,

2178
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,210
I think with the exception of,

2179
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:00,830
of,

2180
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:03,390
of the gut where you're trying
to actually make a little more,

2181
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,583
you want,

2182
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:08,250
you want these different gut
bacteria to make more acidic,

2183
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:08,940
you know,

2184
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,290
to be more acidic and make more,

2185
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:10,711
you know,

2186
01:03:10,711 --> 01:03:13,380
acidic type of environment to
get rid of the bad bacteria,

2187
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:14,970
which can't grow in that
type of environment.

2188
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,080
Um,

2189
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,250
but all the other stuff,

2190
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:17,581
I think,

2191
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:17,791
yeah,

2192
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,121
there's,

2193
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:21,330
there's slight changes and Ph and I mean,

2194
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:21,720
you're,

2195
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,260
you're talking about activating the
immune systems sensitive to this sort of

2196
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:25,591
stuff.

2197
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:26,370
I mean,

2198
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,300
it's like all of a sudden you start
activating your neutrophils and you know,

2199
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,330
they don't know why they're activated,

2200
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:32,100
but when they're activated
it's just like fire,

2201
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:32,371
fire,

2202
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:32,671
fire,

2203
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:33,001
fire,

2204
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:37,470
fire on their fire for firing all kinds
of crap cytokines which are making,

2205
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,340
you know,

2206
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,850
reactive nitrogen species which are
damaging your DNA and your lipids and your

2207
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,141
proteins.

2208
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:42,631
So it's like,

2209
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:42,841
you know,

2210
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:43,470
there's,

2211
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,990
there's things like that going on.

2212
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,123
You don't,

2213
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,203
you know.

2214
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,050
Yeah.

2215
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:49,720
Anyways,

2216
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,011
this,

2217
01:03:50,011 --> 01:03:50,520
this,

2218
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:55,520
this critique of it was saying that foods
don't influence the blood Ph and they

2219
01:03:56,911 --> 01:03:57,271
were saying,

2220
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:57,660
this is,

2221
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,250
I'll just read what it says
here on this guy's website,

2222
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,830
proponents of the alkaline diet,

2223
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:05,730
I've put forth a few different theories
about how acidic diet harms our health.

2224
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:06,990
The most ridiculous claim,

2225
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,130
it more ridiculous claim is that we can
change the Ph of our blood by changing

2226
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:15,510
the foods we eat and that the acidic
blood causes disease while alkaline blood

2227
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:16,344
prevents it.

2228
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:17,460
This is not true.

2229
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:20,040
The body type is all reference to a,

2230
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,060
I'll give the guy's website.

2231
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,160
It's a Chris Kresser,

2232
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,340
C H R I S K r e s.

2233
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:28,170
S.

2234
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:28,170
E R.

2235
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:28,530
Dot Com.

2236
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:29,363
Um,

2237
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,683
um,

2238
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:30,901
uh,

2239
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:31,681
this is not true.

2240
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:36,681
The body tightly regulates the Ph of our
blood and extra cellular fluid and we

2241
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:41,010
cannot influence our blood ph by
changing our diet with references,

2242
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:45,810
a high doses of sodium bicarbonate
contemporarily increased blood ph,

2243
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:48,750
but not without causing
uncomfortable GI syndromes,

2244
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,310
symptoms rather.

2245
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,520
And there are certainly circumstances
in which blood is more acidic than it

2246
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:56,131
should be.

2247
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:58,080
And this does have serious
health consequences.

2248
01:04:58,081 --> 01:04:58,770
However,

2249
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:03,690
this state of acidosis is caused by
pathological conditions such as chronic

2250
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,820
renal in SIF insufficiency,

2251
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,880
not by whether or not you choose
to eat a salad or a burger.

2252
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,601
In other words,

2253
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:12,780
regardless of what you eat
or what your urine Ph is,

2254
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,350
you can be pretty confident that your
blood ph is hovering around a comfortable

2255
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,550
7.4.

2256
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:19,990
Yeah,

2257
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,823
I do all that.

2258
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:21,431
You know,

2259
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:25,180
all you need to make your body alkaline
in cancer can't exist in an alkaline

2260
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:26,014
environment.

2261
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:26,560
Horseshit,

2262
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,393
right?

2263
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:27,641
I,

2264
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:27,881
you know,

2265
01:05:27,881 --> 01:05:29,410
I just don't know enough about that,

2266
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:30,430
that stuff.

2267
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:30,970
Um,

2268
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,370
honestly to say definitively if it's,

2269
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,151
you know,

2270
01:05:34,151 --> 01:05:35,050
I really don't,

2271
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,270
I know that things in vitro,

2272
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:37,991
you know,

2273
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:39,190
when you're looking at cancer,

2274
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,250
if you're talking about growing cancer
cells in a dish and changing that,

2275
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,000
you know,

2276
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,833
environment,

2277
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:45,490
environment is one thing,

2278
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:47,290
but I don't know.

2279
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,070
Yeah.

2280
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:48,431
Yeah.

2281
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:49,264
I don't know either.

2282
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,253
That's the problem.

2283
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,250
God Damn it.

2284
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:51,821
Well,

2285
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:52,031
I mean,

2286
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:52,511
it's something,

2287
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:52,700
you know,

2288
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,050
if you're,

2289
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,250
if you want to email me,

2290
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,084
I'll look into it.

2291
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,391
Yeah,

2292
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:55,800
I will.

2293
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,100
Yeah.

2294
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:00,340
It's just a matter of me not having
dug into something like that.

2295
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:00,611
Yeah.

2296
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:01,270
But that's like,

2297
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:02,380
it's one of those things,

2298
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:04,900
it just gets repeated

2299
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,110
over and over again.

2300
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:06,711
And by the way,

2301
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:06,911
it's,

2302
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:08,350
this is apparently this,

2303
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:08,980
this,

2304
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:09,490
uh,

2305
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,900
mythbusting is,

2306
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,820
there's a bunch of different websites
that say that it's horse shit.

2307
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:14,501
So,

2308
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:18,520
and a bunch of different doctors
with references about the,

2309
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:19,363
um,

2310
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,531
this,

2311
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:22,120
this whole alkaline thing.

2312
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,680
Here's the cancer myth number one,

2313
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:25,540
that cancer doesn't feed on sugar.

2314
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,280
Almost every new patient.

2315
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:27,730
It says,

2316
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:28,750
ask me about this,

2317
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:28,811
uh,

2318
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:32,860
theories prevalent on the Internet that
sugar will influence blood sugar levels,

2319
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:33,730
feed cancer,

2320
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:34,660
and cause it to spread.

2321
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:38,230
The truth is you can't really
control blood sugar by what you eat.

2322
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:43,150
The body's complex system processes what
we eat and manages to keep blood sugar

2323
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:44,190
level stable.

2324
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:44,860
Whether that's,

2325
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:45,693
is that true?

2326
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,570
That doesn't make sense.

2327
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:46,721
Well,

2328
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:49,810
I mean you're obviously when you're
eating sugar or you're inducing an insulin

2329
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:50,351
response,

2330
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:52,500
which then you take the
sugar up into yourselves.

2331
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,280
So that regulates the blood sugar levels.

2332
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,293
Unless that doesn't,

2333
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:58,240
unless you're type two diabetic
or something that's not working,

2334
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,410
then you know,

2335
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:01,450
then you can't regulate your
blood sugar levels normally.

2336
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:02,650
And that's not good.

2337
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:03,430
It's saying

2338
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:06,700
ception to this of course is people
with diabetes who don't have the proper

2339
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,290
insulin regulating systems.

2340
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:12,070
But if you apply the theory that sugar
can affect your insulin levels and feed

2341
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:12,461
cancer,

2342
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:15,790
diabetics with cancer would
all be dying of their cancer.

2343
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,453
What,

2344
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,440
what?

2345
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:18,711
Yeah,

2346
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:19,544
exactly.

2347
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,180
What kind of fucking quotas that Dr Holen,

2348
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:27,110
who are you fucking Weirdo
that doesn't make any sense.

2349
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,630
He's an oncologist to [inaudible]

2350
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:35,780
specializes in gastrointestinal
and esophageal esophageal Sapa.

2351
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:39,450
Jayleeya esophageal cancers says at worst,

2352
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:39,961
a,

2353
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:43,740
these myths may lead vulnerable cancer
patients to try untested treatments or

2354
01:07:43,741 --> 01:07:44,574
procedures.

2355
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,953
Hmm.

2356
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:46,391
You know,

2357
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:46,961
the thing is,

2358
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:51,961
is that cancer cells do acquire this
capability to become glycolytic.

2359
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,733
Where there,

2360
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:59,040
instead of using glucose to convert into
pirate bay and go into the Mitochondria

2361
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:02,530
and use this whole
mitochondrial metabolism,

2362
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,600
oxidative phosphorylation
to generate energy,

2363
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,740
they become,

2364
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,980
they use this whole pathway
that's called glycolysis,

2365
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:09,850
which is a,

2366
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:12,100
it's a much shorter pathway and they,

2367
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,170
they're using it to,

2368
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,020
to generate,

2369
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,321
you know,

2370
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:16,040
that's how they're using
to generate the energy.

2371
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,420
So I think that probably plays a role
in people coming up with all these

2372
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:25,340
different theories and things that
manipulating the glucose and all that.

2373
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:25,521
What,

2374
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:26,181
what it can do.

2375
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:27,014
I know that,

2376
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,213
you know,

2377
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:33,080
I did a lot of work manipulating cancer
nutrients in cancer cells and Grad

2378
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,550
School and um,

2379
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:35,600
you know,

2380
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:35,991
getting,

2381
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:36,291
if I,

2382
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,520
if I had this is in vitro,

2383
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:38,031
first of all,

2384
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,170
if I do it in vitro,

2385
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:39,770
I take,

2386
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,980
if I take a cancer cell and
I take away their glucose,

2387
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:46,190
but they still have all these glutamine,

2388
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:46,640
they have,

2389
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:46,911
you know,

2390
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:50,270
these other amino acids
and that they were fine.

2391
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:50,931
They grow slower,

2392
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:53,870
but they wouldn't die if I
took away their glutamine,

2393
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,420
they would die within like 24 hours.

2394
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:57,703
And it's,

2395
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,101
you know,

2396
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,660
for me to think about cancer cells,

2397
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:01,340
well not only do they need energy,

2398
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,203
ATP,

2399
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,750
they need nitrogen source to
make new nucleotides for new DNA.

2400
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,280
And also new amino acids.

2401
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,880
They need molecules like to build
lipids for lipid or you know,

2402
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:11,810
your lipid membrane.

2403
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,690
So it,

2404
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,520
it,

2405
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,353
there's a lot of,

2406
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:14,841
you know,

2407
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:15,141
just,

2408
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:16,910
just taking away the glucose is one thing.

2409
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:18,410
But there's a lot of other,

2410
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,990
you know,

2411
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:23,990
macromolecules that are really required
for cancer proliferation that are also

2412
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,034
important.

2413
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:25,880
So I,

2414
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,181
you know,

2415
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:26,811
taking some,

2416
01:09:26,811 --> 01:09:29,270
it's taking some of the stuff that we're
learning in science and immediately

2417
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:33,110
applying it I think in some
cases can be a little dangerous.

2418
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:33,993
Um,

2419
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,850
you know,

2420
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:38,090
just because we don't exactly understand
how all these mechanisms are working

2421
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:38,924
together.

2422
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:43,930
So I'm a little cautious about taking
some something that we're learning in

2423
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,060
science and immediately
applying it to yourself,

2424
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:48,290
especially if you have cancer.

2425
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,430
It's so fascinating.

2426
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:49,911
I mean,

2427
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:51,410
if you think about like
the last time I was here,

2428
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:53,000
I was talking about the folic acid.

2429
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:53,480
Yeah.

2430
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:53,901
You know,

2431
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:54,610
and,

2432
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,370
and how that's,

2433
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:58,760
that's a perfect example
where folic acid is,

2434
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,270
is great for you if you don't have
cancer because you can build new DNA.

2435
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:03,140
But if you have cancer,

2436
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:06,650
taking a lot of it is not great for you
because you build new DNA and that's

2437
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:08,120
what cancer cells are doing
when they're dividing.

2438
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,343
So,

2439
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:09,961
you know,

2440
01:10:09,961 --> 01:10:10,310
that's,

2441
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,850
and there's another example of that
with another micronutrient by one of the

2442
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:14,684
vitamin E's.

2443
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:15,801
So,

2444
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:16,280
uh,

2445
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,180
actually this would be a transition into,

2446
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:23,510
to some of the office and stuff cause
he was talking about that specifically.

2447
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:24,631
Oh,

2448
01:10:24,631 --> 01:10:25,061
the uh,

2449
01:10:25,061 --> 01:10:25,741
the doctor,

2450
01:10:25,741 --> 01:10:26,930
that stuff that I sent you.

2451
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,510
Yeah,

2452
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,021
this is,

2453
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:28,710
um,

2454
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,251
so w,

2455
01:10:29,251 --> 01:10:29,491
w.

2456
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,190
W we definitely get into that
and I would love to in a moment,

2457
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,930
so just to let everybody know,

2458
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,221
it's,

2459
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:35,100
it seems,

2460
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,880
you know,

2461
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,980
if you're not interested in
doing any of the research,

2462
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:42,780
it seems that almost everyone who's
done any research on this alkaline diet

2463
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,610
thing says it's horseshit.

2464
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,480
But they do say that these foods that
they're suggesting that you eat to keep an

2465
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,850
alkaline rich diet are
very healthy for you.

2466
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,350
So in that sense,

2467
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,930
it's good for you because it's going
to provide your body with the nutrients

2468
01:10:57,931 --> 01:10:58,764
that it needs.

2469
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,160
A,

2470
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,630
especially if you're nutrient deficient,

2471
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,070
you're much more likely to be unhealthy.

2472
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,510
If you're much more
likely to be unhealthy,

2473
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:06,300
your immune system's going to have a
harder time dealing with any host of

2474
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:07,134
different diseases.

2475
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,230
But that this alkaline thing of your body,

2476
01:11:10,231 --> 01:11:15,231
your body basically hovers
between 7.3 and 7.45.

2477
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:18,870
Your stomach is very acidic
with a Ph of 3.5 or below.

2478
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:23,790
So it can break down food and your urine
changes depending on what you eat and

2479
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:26,010
that's how your body keeps the
level and your body steady.

2480
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:26,760
But that,

2481
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,760
this idea that you're going to regulate
the alkaline of your body with food and

2482
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:35,070
that you're gonna keep your
body in an alkaline state show.

2483
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:35,241
Well,

2484
01:11:35,241 --> 01:11:39,380
there's a lot of low sort
of like myths going on.

2485
01:11:39,381 --> 01:11:39,741
In fact,

2486
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:43,430
recently I think I saw on your
Twitter you posted something,

2487
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:43,761
I don't know,

2488
01:11:43,761 --> 01:11:46,500
a couple of days ago about Kale and uh,

2489
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:47,510
yeah,

2490
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,930
it's really,

2491
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,980
it's really kind of,

2492
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:49,860
it's,

2493
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,540
it's Kinda there,

2494
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,810
these people are doing more harm
in the sentence and in some cases,

2495
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:54,441
uh,

2496
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:55,274
so,

2497
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:55,671
you know,

2498
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:56,504
Kale,

2499
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,800
Kale and the cruciferous
family like Broccoli,

2500
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:01,580
cabbage,

2501
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,241
Brussel sprouts,

2502
01:12:02,241 --> 01:12:03,000
these things.

2503
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,351
Um,

2504
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:06,830
they have something in them
called Glu Glucose and Oles.

2505
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,491
Okay.

2506
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:10,340
And Glucose and all aids can get,

2507
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,130
could they get cleaved by
an enzyme called myrosinase,

2508
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:17,330
which is in the plant and it forms
something called isothiocyanates in

2509
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:20,300
isothiocyanates are very,

2510
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,810
um,

2511
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:24,020
they've been shown to be very
potent anticancer agents.

2512
01:12:24,021 --> 01:12:25,530
So they activate the,

2513
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:27,770
it's actually a part of that for
me since I was talking about,

2514
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:32,120
because these are generated in the
plant as a natural defense mechanisms.

2515
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,970
It's one of their natural
defense mechanism against bugs.

2516
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:37,280
It's like a natural
pesticide in innocence.

2517
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,170
They produce it to keep bugs away.

2518
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:43,220
Isothiocyanates are for us,

2519
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:47,180
activate our variety of different genes
that are involved in stress resistance,

2520
01:12:47,181 --> 01:12:48,740
including tumor suppressor genes,

2521
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:50,990
which actually kill tumor cells.

2522
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,123
And so,

2523
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:52,911
and they've shown this,

2524
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:53,630
they've shown this,

2525
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,880
you know quite a few times that if you,

2526
01:12:55,910 --> 01:13:00,910
if you give mice like you know my SAP
cancer isothiocyanates they will kill the

2527
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:06,281
cancer cells and the whole isothiocyanates
thing also compete competitively

2528
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,290
binds to,

2529
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,480
I had a the iodine
transporter in the thyroid.

2530
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:14,030
So here comes this whole,

2531
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:14,481
Oh my God,

2532
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:16,550
you can't eat kale because,

2533
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:21,580
or cruciferous because it will screw up
your thyroid and calls hyperthyroidism.

2534
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,360
Right.

2535
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,630
So the thing is though is these
isothiocyanates they could,

2536
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:31,340
they appear to competitively bind to
the same transporter that iodine does to

2537
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:32,174
get into the thyroid.

2538
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:32,571
Now,

2539
01:13:32,571 --> 01:13:36,710
I was looking for the paper where they
showed that and it's like 1948 because

2540
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,530
what I wanted to see was a dose
dependent manner of giving them,

2541
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:39,951
you know,

2542
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:43,580
these isothiocyanates or
Kale and show how much of it,

2543
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,001
you know,

2544
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,130
competes it with iodine.

2545
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,130
How much do you know doesn't,

2546
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,431
well,

2547
01:13:46,431 --> 01:13:47,660
I couldn't get access to that paper.

2548
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:51,470
But what I did find is that when you
give these mice isothiocyanates a lot of

2549
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:52,910
them that kills cancer cells,

2550
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:54,470
but it doesn't cause any thyroid problems,

2551
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,820
which leads me to believe is that
the Isis Ioc nights probably very,

2552
01:13:58,821 --> 01:13:59,121
very,

2553
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:04,121
very small degree of a competitive
inhibition of getting iodine into your

2554
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:05,240
thyroid,

2555
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,350
which if you don't,

2556
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:06,981
if you aren't low,

2557
01:14:06,981 --> 01:14:09,830
and I'd on wouldn't be a
problem because you're not,

2558
01:14:09,831 --> 01:14:10,220
you know.

2559
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:12,220
So if it's just very small amount of it,

2560
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:15,610
competing with it to get it to get iodine
into the thyroid is not going to be a

2561
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:16,660
problem unless you're really,

2562
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:20,440
really deficient in iodine and
then any small amount and you need,

2563
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:23,080
so in my opinion,

2564
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:24,400
and for me,

2565
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:25,050
uh,

2566
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:25,191
I,

2567
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:27,820
so I love getting isothiocyanates from,

2568
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,200
from these cruciferous.

2569
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:29,951
And by the way,

2570
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:34,340
the enzyme myrosinase that converts that
the glucose and all eights into isis

2571
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,860
thiocyanate is heat sensitive.

2572
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:36,461
Um,

2573
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:37,480
so if you heat it,

2574
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,660
it will generally inactivate
it and not completely,

2575
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,060
but it doesn't activate
it for the most part.

2576
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,460
And so you're not getting as
many of those isothiocyanates,

2577
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:47,380
which is probably why
people started to say,

2578
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:47,561
oh,

2579
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:48,394
boil your,

2580
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,450
boil your Kale.

2581
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:49,860
Or,

2582
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,290
um,

2583
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:55,290
I personally want the isothiocyanates
because the data is so strong showing that

2584
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:57,700
these things kill cancer cells.

2585
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:57,841
I mean,

2586
01:14:57,841 --> 01:14:57,991
it's a,

2587
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:00,740
it's a well known fact
that these things sold.

2588
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:05,750
This idea that raw kale
or any of these Rah Rah.

2589
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,593
There's another one,

2590
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:09,700
there's Brussel sprouts,

2591
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:10,930
but then there's another,

2592
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,150
so that's that story
about the height of that.

2593
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:14,340
Those are bad for you.

2594
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,700
Seems as bullshit.

2595
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:16,511
Well,

2596
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:16,661
yeah,

2597
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:17,231
that's what I'm just,

2598
01:15:17,231 --> 01:15:17,740
I mean,

2599
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,850
to me it,

2600
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,423
you know,

2601
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,300
hormesis okay.

2602
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,790
It depends on what you're defining as
bad for you are saying for me since it's

2603
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,850
activating a bunch of genes that are
tumor suppressor genes that kill cancer

2604
01:15:27,851 --> 01:15:28,540
cells.

2605
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,500
I mean it's good for you,

2606
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:30,580
these isothiocyanates or good,

2607
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:32,020
good for you if you don't,

2608
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:34,240
if you're not like completely
deficient in iodine,

2609
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,590
which most people aren't.

2610
01:15:35,591 --> 01:15:39,220
I mean I think that there's some problem
with women in their twenties or forties

2611
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:44,380
but supplemented iodine while you
were taking these ISO thiocyanate

2612
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,130
sinaits they're very,

2613
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,500
I've been talking about these for years.

2614
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:51,730
Like how awesome they,

2615
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:52,603
I want them.

2616
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,450
Like I want them in my bottom.

2617
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,870
I want my eyes to that.

2618
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:58,000
You're saying it so I'm telling you.

2619
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:58,541
I did.

2620
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,240
I did,

2621
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,073
but

2622
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:01,931
so,

2623
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:02,560
um,

2624
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,580
cause they're fucking awesome.

2625
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,370
I get,

2626
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,810
it kind of irks me because I'm like,

2627
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:09,100
I see all this stuff and it's like,

2628
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:10,243
no,

2629
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,320
don't not,

2630
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,020
you know,

2631
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,980
there's still not eat
your raw kale because you,

2632
01:16:13,981 --> 01:16:15,030
you want to get things like ice.

2633
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:15,863
Who thought he was saying there's,

2634
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,860
there's chemicals in
these plants that are,

2635
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:18,191
yes,

2636
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:18,730
they're,

2637
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,271
you know,

2638
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:20,800
they're slightly toxic,

2639
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:25,960
but they're inducing stress response
mechanisms in our body that are good for

2640
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:26,321
us.

2641
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:27,520
They're fighting off all that,

2642
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,560
all the bad stuff that
we're making in our body.

2643
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:29,920
Everything,

2644
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:30,191
you know,

2645
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:30,551
it's,

2646
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:31,450
it's a good thing.

2647
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,250
Precancerous cells are always happening.

2648
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,780
You want tumor suppressor genes are genes
that when there's something's wrong,

2649
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,800
like you have,

2650
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,090
you get that DNA damage.

2651
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:42,880
I was talking about something happens
where a mutation happens in a cell,

2652
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:44,403
it senses it,

2653
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:44,630
you know,

2654
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:48,070
and it activates this whole response
pathway where it's like dye and it kills

2655
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:48,904
the cell.

2656
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:52,030
So having something that activates
those pathways in your body,

2657
01:16:52,031 --> 01:16:54,280
like isothiocyanates is a good thing.

2658
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:54,910
It's,

2659
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:55,271
you know,

2660
01:16:55,271 --> 01:16:55,441
and,

2661
01:16:55,441 --> 01:16:57,290
and personally I want more of them.

2662
01:16:57,490 --> 01:17:02,490
So all this stuff about this
poorly researched bad conclusions.

2663
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:04,720
Um,

2664
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,150
so the thing is,

2665
01:17:06,151 --> 01:17:07,360
is when you look at the,

2666
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,680
when you look in the literature,

2667
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,733
um,

2668
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:10,910
the,

2669
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:11,170
the,

2670
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:11,600
the,

2671
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,510
if you're trying to look
at the effects of Isis,

2672
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,640
I sign it's on thyroid function.

2673
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,860
There's not a whole huge literature on it.

2674
01:17:18,861 --> 01:17:19,580
Like I said,

2675
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,160
I was looking for the
experiment to prove to me.

2676
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,830
I wanted to see how much
competitive inhibition there was.

2677
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,990
I think they're also called icy threes.

2678
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:30,470
I see threes on the iodine
transport and the thyroid.

2679
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,460
I couldn't find it.

2680
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,380
I'd say I'll review articles
where they referred to it.

2681
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:34,310
I looked to the reference,

2682
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,210
go to the reference.

2683
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:35,421
It's,

2684
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:35,781
you know,

2685
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:36,650
it's some other reviewer.

2686
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:37,490
It's just there's no,

2687
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:38,960
I want it to see the data.

2688
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:40,040
And I had to dig,

2689
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:45,050
dig until I got to 1948 where they
did this competitive binding essay.

2690
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:45,830
Um,

2691
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,590
and then I found other
papers talking about,

2692
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:48,831
oh,

2693
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:52,070
it's only an effect if
you have low iodine.

2694
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,000
Which made me think,

2695
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:53,720
well,

2696
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,770
I can't see the data.

2697
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,800
But what I think makes sense is that
only if it's such a low competitive

2698
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:01,214
binding,

2699
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,113
that's not,

2700
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:02,780
you know,

2701
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,250
it's not like if you eat this,

2702
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:05,330
you're gonna not get iodine.

2703
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:09,410
It's that if you already are at that
point where you don't have it any little

2704
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:09,591
bit,

2705
01:18:09,591 --> 01:18:10,230
you don't get,

2706
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:11,150
makes a difference.

2707
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:11,871
And I know,

2708
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:13,190
and I know this because the mice,

2709
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,920
the mouse models where they're not even
looking at thyroid function and they're

2710
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:18,890
looking at the effects of
isothiocyanates and killing cancer cells,

2711
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,880
those minds have no problems with becoming
hyperthyroid and they're giving them

2712
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:23,720
large doses.

2713
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,651
So to me I'm like,

2714
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:24,921
okay,

2715
01:18:24,921 --> 01:18:26,210
well that would have been a side effect.

2716
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:27,044
They would've noticed,

2717
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,213
you know,

2718
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,370
so this is just completely
theoretical and it doesn't work.

2719
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,510
It doesn't work in practice.

2720
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,620
What does this idea of
getting hypothyroidism from?

2721
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:38,060
I think if you have
normal levels of iodine,

2722
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:38,420
it's fine,

2723
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,020
you're fine.

2724
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:39,890
But if you're,

2725
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:43,010
if you're like one of those
people that is iodine deficient,

2726
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:43,941
it may,

2727
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:45,740
it may affect you because if it,

2728
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:45,891
if,

2729
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:46,121
if,

2730
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,730
if there's a small amount of it,

2731
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,640
it does seem to compete
with iodine transport,

2732
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:55,140
but I think it's a very
small competitive amount.

2733
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:55,950
It's not a,

2734
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,230
it's not like all the iodine,

2735
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,870
it's not like all or nothing like all
of it's getting in or not getting in.

2736
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,060
I think it's a very small
amount that doesn't get in.

2737
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,171
But if you're not,

2738
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:03,291
I,

2739
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,880
if you're getting your
iodine and you know,

2740
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:05,714
it doesn't,

2741
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,890
does that,

2742
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:07,723
are you following?

2743
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:08,821
Okay,

2744
01:19:08,821 --> 01:19:13,130
so that I hope people can
follow that because I really,

2745
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,380
there's so much of that horse these days.

2746
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:19,280
There's so much contrarianism to so
many people that want to debunk anything

2747
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:20,300
that comes to thing.

2748
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,430
And the other one is this oxalic acid.

2749
01:19:22,431 --> 01:19:24,690
I think you've kind of confuse the two.

2750
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:27,170
But that was the one that
Dave Asprey had talked about.

2751
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:27,321
This.

2752
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:29,630
Why does with Kale,

2753
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:30,590
that's why I brought that up.

2754
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:31,200
Kale.

2755
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,033
Oh,

2756
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:35,410
you had a boil Kale because of
oxalic acid and during the war.

2757
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,890
And let me tell you about that.

2758
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,000
Um,

2759
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,230
the oxalic acid,

2760
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,640
I think there's a little bit in Kale,

2761
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:42,380
but it's mostly in spinach,

2762
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,933
oxalic acids,

2763
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
and spent most the highest and the what
people are saying on the Internet from

2764
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:54,830
what I could see on this
whole echo chamber thing
that happens is that you need

2765
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:55,940
to boil your spinach.

2766
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,010
I guess it were in some
people they're saying Kale.

2767
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:58,700
Um,

2768
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,700
because then you're going to inactivate
this oxalic acid and now it's not going

2769
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,950
to bind up minerals like magnesium,

2770
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,883
calcium,

2771
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,620
and they're saying that this is
a problem if you don't do this,

2772
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:12,330
because then you're going
to get kidney stones.

2773
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:13,320
Right?

2774
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:18,320
So I was looking in the literature and
I found a really cool experiment done by

2775
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:21,630
this Japanese group
where they took spinach,

2776
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,650
raw spinach.

2777
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:24,000
They boiled it,

2778
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:24,960
they fried it,

2779
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:25,890
they frizzled it.

2780
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,461
I mean,

2781
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:27,001
so they did,

2782
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:27,240
you know,

2783
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,790
various different temperatures and they,

2784
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,331
you know,

2785
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:32,880
then you make it into a powder to
give to these mice that are magnesium

2786
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:33,380
deficient.

2787
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:36,810
They may put them on a magnesium deficient
diet and they fed them either the raw

2788
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:37,321
spinach,

2789
01:20:37,321 --> 01:20:37,891
the boil,

2790
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:39,060
the Frizzell fried,

2791
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,380
and they measured magnesium levels
in their blood and their bone.

2792
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:47,760
And they measured a calcium levels in
their blood and bone and also in their

2793
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:48,594
kidneys.

2794
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,600
And what they found was that there
was no difference in the magnesium and

2795
01:20:53,881 --> 01:20:55,530
calcium levels and the bone,

2796
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:57,820
and also in the serum it,

2797
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,480
whether or not you boiled Raul Fried,

2798
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:00,751
whatever.

2799
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:01,660
Frizzled uh,

2800
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,513
however,

2801
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:03,530
I'm sorry.

2802
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:03,640
No,

2803
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:04,051
it counts.

2804
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,190
The calcium levels there were,

2805
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,440
there was a difference from
frying it or frizzling it,

2806
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:09,060
but the raw and the boiling were the same.

2807
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,840
And basically the conclusions
were it doesn't effect absorption,

2808
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:13,681
boiling or raw.

2809
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:14,514
It's the same.

2810
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,680
You're going to absorb the
same amount of magnesium,

2811
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:17,340
calcium,

2812
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,880
there were magnesium and calcium in the
kidney that did have him in the kidney

2813
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:23,580
and it was a little bit higher
concentrated versus the control,

2814
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:26,830
but it wasn't causing,

2815
01:21:26,831 --> 01:21:27,090
you know,

2816
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,980
kidney stones and things like that.

2817
01:21:28,981 --> 01:21:30,630
And there was no difference
between boiling or not.

2818
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,910
So if you're going to make the claim that,

2819
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,391
you know,

2820
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:38,190
having oxalic acid causes kidney
stones and you need to boil it,

2821
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,620
well maybe just there may be,

2822
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:41,670
you need to say don't eat it,

2823
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:42,930
but I don't think that's the case.

2824
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:44,190
I don't think any of that's the case.

2825
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:46,340
So having a look soggy,

2826
01:21:46,341 --> 01:21:49,620
I assume your diet from
consuming it in raw form,

2827
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,250
not bad.

2828
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,570
I think it's it.

2829
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,750
You'd have to consume a massive,

2830
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,340
massive amount to cause something
that would be like kidney stones.

2831
01:21:59,520 --> 01:21:59,911
What do you mean?

2832
01:21:59,911 --> 01:22:01,980
Like eating it every day all day?

2833
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:02,400
No,

2834
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,380
I mean like eating like,

2835
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,840
like pounds,

2836
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:07,770
pounds of it a day.

2837
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:08,601
Yeah.

2838
01:22:08,601 --> 01:22:08,970
Every day.

2839
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:09,240
Yeah.

2840
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,073
Every day.

2841
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,750
So that's beautiful.

2842
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:12,960
No,

2843
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,860
I'm not here.

2844
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,723
Here's the violence.

2845
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:19,750
I have not convinced myself that I have
to boil any of my spinach or kale before

2846
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:21,120
I eat it raw.

2847
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,601
I actually,

2848
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:23,400
I actually put it in a
smoothie every morning.

2849
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,900
I make a smoothie with Kale,

2850
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:25,681
raw kale,

2851
01:22:25,681 --> 01:22:26,514
raw spinach,

2852
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,211
tomato,

2853
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:28,044
carrot,

2854
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,861
a avocado,

2855
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:29,221
banana,

2856
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:29,970
almond milk,

2857
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,631
some berries,

2858
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:32,700
and it's protein powder as well.

2859
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:33,890
Anyways,

2860
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:38,370
I haven't convinced myself that eating
raw spinach in my smoothies every day,

2861
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:38,971
you know,

2862
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:39,361
and I put it,

2863
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:39,601
you know,

2864
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:40,620
I put a nice amount of it.

2865
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,001
It's not pounds of it,

2866
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:42,834
but,

2867
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:43,723
um,

2868
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:46,980
I haven't convinced myself
that I'm doing any harm.

2869
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,010
And this is obviously not just
based on the way your body reacts,

2870
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:51,330
but based on the research
that you've done.

2871
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:52,660
This is based on the,

2872
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:52,890
the,

2873
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:55,050
the little bit of reading
that I've done on,

2874
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:55,610
on those,

2875
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:56,580
the isothiocyanates,

2876
01:22:56,581 --> 01:22:57,930
I'm definitely convinced that,

2877
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,351
you know,

2878
01:22:58,351 --> 01:22:58,581
the,

2879
01:22:58,581 --> 01:22:59,880
the oxalic acid,

2880
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:00,780
you know,

2881
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,310
because it does bind minerals.

2882
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,144
It's key later.

2883
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,163
Um,

2884
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:04,651
you know,

2885
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:07,300
there may some cases where kidney,

2886
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,601
you know,

2887
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:09,280
can accumulate in the kidney.

2888
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,810
But I think that from what,

2889
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:12,280
from my reading that's really,

2890
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:15,370
really large dose and I
haven't convinced myself yet.

2891
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:17,380
I'm not saying it's not possible,

2892
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,140
but I haven't convinced myself
that I need to worry about it.

2893
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:25,160
So the idea that you're getting some sort
of toxins from the vegetables because

2894
01:23:25,161 --> 01:23:27,230
the vegetables are trying
to prevent predation,

2895
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:27,770
right?

2896
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:28,603
Nonsense.

2897
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:29,570
No,

2898
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,490
you aren't getting taught,

2899
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:32,210
I mean nonsense that it's bad for you.

2900
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:33,220
It's,

2901
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:33,720
it's,

2902
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,553
there's the,

2903
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:36,050
they're activating for Musa,

2904
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:37,490
so it is kind of toxic for you.

2905
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:38,271
It kinda,

2906
01:23:38,271 --> 01:23:38,731
it's odd,

2907
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:42,710
but it's an intubating stress
response pathways that are ultimately,

2908
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:43,490
it's like,

2909
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:44,120
okay,

2910
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,480
a little bit of bad for you
activating a pathway really,

2911
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,740
really good for you because now you're,

2912
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:53,330
now you're turning on hundreds of
genes that are involved in DNA repair,

2913
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:55,550
that are involved in
glutathione peroxidase,

2914
01:23:55,551 --> 01:23:57,380
getting rid of oxidation
that are involved in,

2915
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:57,861
uh,

2916
01:23:57,861 --> 01:23:58,161
you know,

2917
01:23:58,161 --> 01:23:58,581
making,

2918
01:23:58,581 --> 01:23:59,414
I mean,

2919
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,520
making sure cancer cells die.

2920
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:02,930
So to me,

2921
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,950
you know,

2922
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:06,140
you are getting a little bit of
these toxins from these plants.

2923
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:06,860
Absolutely.

2924
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:09,650
But your body's counteracting
of these toxins,

2925
01:24:09,651 --> 01:24:10,930
body's incredibly beneficial.

2926
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:11,890
Your body is increased.

2927
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,081
Yeah,

2928
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:13,490
your body's pretty amazing.

2929
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,060
Um,

2930
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:15,440
and it is pretty beneficial,

2931
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,490
the reaction to,

2932
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,480
to some of these toxins.

2933
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:21,190
So the point being that the incorrect
correlation that people have made between

2934
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:23,440
the very low toxicity between these,

2935
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:24,274
these plants,

2936
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,031
Kale,

2937
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:25,810
Broccoli,

2938
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:26,590
whatever,

2939
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:30,340
and them being something that you should
avoid consuming once you boil them.

2940
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,600
That's just not,

2941
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:31,680
yeah,

2942
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,490
in mine,

2943
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,450
in my opinion,

2944
01:24:33,451 --> 01:24:34,440
it doesn't make sense.

2945
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,110
It doesn't make sense.

2946
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:36,150
It doesn't make sense to me either.

2947
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:41,160
So I think people can take something
little and it becomes this sensational and

2948
01:24:41,161 --> 01:24:41,550
they're like,

2949
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:41,791
oh,

2950
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:45,360
it's very sensational because
what's good for you is bad for you.

2951
01:24:45,361 --> 01:24:46,620
But if you do this little thing,

2952
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:48,120
it becomes good for you again.

2953
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:52,290
And I think that it's a good
marketing tactic in some respects.

2954
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:52,891
Do you know what I mean?

2955
01:24:52,891 --> 01:24:53,770
Where there is right is

2956
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:54,431
one case,

2957
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:55,660
there's a study,

2958
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:55,990
um,

2959
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:59,350
that you could find on a pub
med site about excelling.

2960
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,650
Yes.

2961
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:05,230
Oxalate Nefro Pathi due to juicing.

2962
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:06,071
And,

2963
01:25:06,071 --> 01:25:06,310
uh,

2964
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:11,310
this patient with a Oxley induced acute
renal failure that was attributable to a

2965
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:17,881
consumption of oxalate rich fruit and
vegetable juices obtained from juicing.

2966
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,121
Uh,

2967
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:23,140
we described the case and also review
the clinical presentation of 65 patients

2968
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:24,790
seen at the Mayo clinic in Rochester,

2969
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:29,791
Minnesota from 1985 through 2010 with
renal failure and biopsy proven renal

2970
01:25:31,061 --> 01:25:32,680
calcium oxalate crystals.

2971
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,170
The cause of Reno Auc.

2972
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:38,470
Solo sis was identified for all patients,

2973
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:43,530
a single cause for 36 patients and
at least two causes for 29 patients.

2974
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:44,831
Three patients,

2975
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:49,831
including our index patient had
presumed diet induced oxalate and nef.

2976
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,161
How do you say that word?

2977
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:52,540
Nephropathy.

2978
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:53,231
Nephropathy.

2979
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,064
Yeah.

2980
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,710
In the context of chronic kidney disease,

2981
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:57,281
uh,

2982
01:25:57,281 --> 01:26:02,281
identification of calcium oxalate crystals
in a kidney biopsy should prompt an

2983
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,220
evaluation for causes

2984
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,380
of renal oxaloacetate be blea.

2985
01:26:06,381 --> 01:26:07,790
Blea blea um,

2986
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:08,990
so what does that mean?

2987
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:10,071
I mean,

2988
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:11,690
it sounds like there are these people,

2989
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:12,710
how many of them were the,

2990
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:13,544
that had the,

2991
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:14,150
the,

2992
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,050
from the juicing,

2993
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:15,860
uh,

2994
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,670
let's see,

2995
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:21,670
65 patients from 1985 to 2010 this time.

2996
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,960
And to have 65 patients.

2997
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:29,110
And all of them actually single costs
for 36 patients and at least two causes

2998
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,930
for 29 patients too
because they were all so,

2999
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,011
yeah,

3000
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:36,980
the single cause for the 36
patients they believe was juicing

3001
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,431
is juicing.

3002
01:26:39,431 --> 01:26:39,860
Okay.

3003
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,281
And the other one,

3004
01:26:40,281 --> 01:26:41,190
there's two causes.

3005
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:41,561
Any of them,

3006
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:42,340
there's two causes.

3007
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,280
So about three.

3008
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,150
Yeah.

3009
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:46,310
So to me it sounds like,

3010
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:46,791
like I said,

3011
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:47,091
you know,

3012
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:47,924
you're,

3013
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,300
there's always going to
be cases where you can't,

3014
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,021
you can't,

3015
01:26:51,021 --> 01:26:56,021
you can probably caused that to happen
because it does bind and collate these

3016
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:57,230
ions,

3017
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:01,790
especially in juicing perhaps because
you're taking us such a large quantity of

3018
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:04,160
vegetables and breaking
them down to a juice.

3019
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,210
Would that make sense?

3020
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,620
Get more oxalate?

3021
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,513
Maybe so.

3022
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:08,391
Maybe.

3023
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:08,860
So.

3024
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:09,350
Um,

3025
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:10,520
cause like if you juice,

3026
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,061
like,

3027
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:14,630
think about like what are like
a 16 ounce glass of juice,

3028
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:19,631
how many vegetables have to go into
the juicer to liquefy it down to,

3029
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:23,600
I make smoothies for the most part,

3030
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:24,434
I don't juice.

3031
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:25,310
Um,

3032
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:25,710
uh,

3033
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:28,190
occasionally I buy a cold press juices,

3034
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:28,821
but,

3035
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:29,260
uh,

3036
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,380
I'm most of what I do,

3037
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:31,370
I'd just be like me,

3038
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,330
I don't use either.

3039
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:32,630
Um,

3040
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:34,820
I've actually have not ever juiced.

3041
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:36,020
I make smoothies as well.

3042
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:37,250
But you know,

3043
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:38,230
there I,

3044
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:41,270
it sounds to me like there can be
cases where you're getting a really

3045
01:27:41,271 --> 01:27:43,280
concentrated amount of this
and you're doing it everyday.

3046
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:47,180
Cause there's people out there that
go extreme and no matter what they do,

3047
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,550
they go like to the extreme.

3048
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:50,601
And you know,

3049
01:27:50,601 --> 01:27:51,800
because you can,

3050
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,371
you know,

3051
01:27:52,371 --> 01:27:52,971
the x,

3052
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,520
the axilla catheter XL,

3053
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:55,610
the anti and of it,

3054
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:57,230
the oxalate can bind,

3055
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,720
does bind to these metal
ions at key lates than men.

3056
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,530
You know,

3057
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,870
it absolutely could
accumulate in your kidney.

3058
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:03,530
So,

3059
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,363
but you would,

3060
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,110
so the real key is the thing that we've
always been taught to eat a balanced

3061
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:09,920
diet.

3062
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,200
I think most people are
not going to that extreme.

3063
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:12,860
Right.

3064
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:17,320
And I don't think most people have to
be under a fear that they can't eat raw

3065
01:28:17,321 --> 01:28:18,830
spent spot raw Spanish.

3066
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:19,491
That's the thing.

3067
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:22,340
I don't think there you need
to fear eating Ross badge.

3068
01:28:22,341 --> 01:28:25,130
I think maybe just don't
be a dumb ass and like,

3069
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,253
you know,

3070
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:26,931
go way,

3071
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:27,231
way,

3072
01:28:27,231 --> 01:28:28,190
way overboard.

3073
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:28,940
Right.

3074
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,390
So,

3075
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,050
you know,

3076
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:33,890
eating some raw juices is
probably really good for you.

3077
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,740
Eating nothing but raw juices all day,

3078
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:37,700
all your life.

3079
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:38,720
It's not so good for you.

3080
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:42,230
You need animal protein or
some other things and yeah.

3081
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,213
Yeah.

3082
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:44,300
Um,

3083
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,520
there was another guy I know of a guy who,

3084
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:46,940
uh,

3085
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:50,330
Brock Lesnar was actually
the UFC heavyweight champion
who eat nothing but meat.

3086
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:55,280
He was a fucking crazy person and he got
diverticulitis and he had to get a 12

3087
01:28:55,281 --> 01:28:56,690
inches of his colon removed.

3088
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,400
Pretty serious operation.

3089
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,130
It's really interesting that some,

3090
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,010
no,

3091
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,250
no,

3092
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,890
I don't know how much of a
degree this is dose dependent,

3093
01:29:04,891 --> 01:29:05,500
but,

3094
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:05,940
um,

3095
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,940
there's bacteria in your gut called
purification bacteria and they called that

3096
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:15,390
because of the bacteria that make
that really nasty smelling fart.

3097
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:16,710
It's like hydrogen sulfide.

3098
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:20,820
So I was like pure hydrogen
sulfide and those bacteria,

3099
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:22,320
the purification bacteria,

3100
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,240
they actually use,

3101
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:24,690
um,

3102
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:27,570
like sulfate and nitrate
as their source of energy.

3103
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:29,100
And they convert it into like,

3104
01:29:29,101 --> 01:29:29,461
for example,

3105
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:30,390
hydrogen sulfide,

3106
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,040
but they need,

3107
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:32,400
um,

3108
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:32,641
they,

3109
01:29:32,641 --> 01:29:33,141
so it's the,

3110
01:29:33,141 --> 01:29:34,740
it's basically what we do with oxygen.

3111
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,460
They do that with these sulfate and they,

3112
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:38,790
they make it into hydrogen sulfide.

3113
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,380
It's like us converting oxygen to water.

3114
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:41,430
That's how we make ATP.

3115
01:29:41,431 --> 01:29:45,390
They do this by converting
sulfate into hydrogen sulfide,

3116
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:46,111
announce their energy,

3117
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:47,640
this nutrification bacteria.

3118
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:48,001
Well,

3119
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:48,450
they need,

3120
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:49,283
they need these,

3121
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,293
um,

3122
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:53,070
I guess cofactors to do this.

3123
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,083
And that's heme.

3124
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,380
Heme is in red meat.

3125
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,360
And so some people that you really,

3126
01:29:57,361 --> 01:29:59,790
really large doses of red meat,

3127
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:04,850
like what happens is you're giving those
bacteria heme and they start to make

3128
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:05,940
hydrogen sulfide.

3129
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:07,260
And the thing with hydrogen sulfite,

3130
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:07,621
so y'all met,

3131
01:30:07,621 --> 01:30:07,951
first of all,

3132
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:09,660
you get future occasion of bacteria,

3133
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:12,870
so you'll have nasty smelling
farts like hydrogen sulfite farts.

3134
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:13,800
Um,

3135
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:18,800
and also hydrogen sulfide
combat competitively
competitively binds to enzymes in

3136
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,890
our guts cells that make energy.

3137
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:23,551
So they actually,

3138
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:24,600
so it goes,

3139
01:30:24,601 --> 01:30:26,490
hydrogen sulfide goes and binds to these,

3140
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,513
um,

3141
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:31,560
electron transport chain enzymes
that make ATP in our gut cells and

3142
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:36,590
competitively inhibits them from actually
being able to reduce oxygen to water

3143
01:30:36,841 --> 01:30:37,561
to make ATP.

3144
01:30:37,561 --> 01:30:38,221
So then your guts,

3145
01:30:38,221 --> 01:30:42,690
Dell start to like starve down there
and starts to break down the gut mucous

3146
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:43,643
barrier.

3147
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,401
Anyways,

3148
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:48,510
it's totally a tangent and I
don't know how I got on that.

3149
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:49,290
I guess the meat,

3150
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:49,641
the,

3151
01:30:49,641 --> 01:30:50,140
the,

3152
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,020
the high meat diet,

3153
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:51,391
right?

3154
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:54,720
So the diverticulitis that
people got from eating only meat.

3155
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:55,650
Yeah.

3156
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:56,461
So like I said,

3157
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:57,730
I think it's a dose,

3158
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:58,081
you know,

3159
01:30:58,081 --> 01:30:58,914
really just dependent

3160
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,450
cause eating a little bit of meat.

3161
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:02,381
It depends.

3162
01:31:02,381 --> 01:31:02,531
I mean,

3163
01:31:02,531 --> 01:31:02,741
you know,

3164
01:31:02,741 --> 01:31:03,311
your own body,

3165
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:05,800
if you're eating tons of meat and you
started smelling these hydrogen sulfide

3166
01:31:05,801 --> 01:31:06,634
smart farts,

3167
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,753
that's not good.

3168
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,110
Right.

3169
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:09,740
Probably not.

3170
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,430
Not Good.

3171
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:11,920
So if you smell a guy as far,

3172
01:31:11,921 --> 01:31:12,411
you might die.

3173
01:31:12,411 --> 01:31:12,980
You should talk to,

3174
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:13,460
but it's like,

3175
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:14,240
it's not,

3176
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,410
it's not the kind of Fart that,

3177
01:31:15,411 --> 01:31:15,651
you know,

3178
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:16,010
it's the,

3179
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,030
it's the pure,

3180
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,433
those ones that are like,

3181
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,430
oh good God.

3182
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:19,880
Yeah,

3183
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,421
it's that.

3184
01:31:20,421 --> 01:31:21,254
It's that one.

3185
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:23,121
Yeah.

3186
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:23,901
Stuff's going on.

3187
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:24,380
Yeah.

3188
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,700
Those are bodybuilding farts.

3189
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,240
If you're on and they
eat a lot of red meat.

3190
01:31:29,241 --> 01:31:29,580
Right.

3191
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,370
Do they just won't buy a lot of protein,

3192
01:31:31,371 --> 01:31:31,881
period.

3193
01:31:31,881 --> 01:31:32,290
You know?

3194
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:34,520
Does it affect all
other types of proteins?

3195
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:35,600
He,

3196
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:35,930
him his,

3197
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:37,730
and it's what gives
red meat the red color.

3198
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:38,720
Yeah.

3199
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:39,710
It's specific to red meat.

3200
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,450
So the more red meat,

3201
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,070
the more horrible forest,

3202
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:44,210
pretty much.

3203
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,110
It makes sense.

3204
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,220
It's like,

3205
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:46,361
well,

3206
01:31:46,361 --> 01:31:46,940
what do you,

3207
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,680
who do you think about
having the worst farts?

3208
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,080
It's always guys with big guts.

3209
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:51,621
You know,

3210
01:31:51,621 --> 01:31:53,180
like if someone farts on an airplane,

3211
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,100
you always look at the guy with the gut.

3212
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:58,280
It's very difficult to figure
out who's farting on an airplane.

3213
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:00,070
It's one of the reasons
people are so sneaky

3214
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,903
about it.

3215
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,990
Sneaky airplane,

3216
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:02,510
foreigners.

3217
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:03,343
He know who you are.

3218
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:05,140
But the guys with the big guts,

3219
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,520
they're usually the culprit.

3220
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:07,200
It's,

3221
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:07,380
I mean,

3222
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,170
it's,

3223
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:08,860
I mean that's,

3224
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:10,450
it's the beautification bacteria.

3225
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,590
Putrid vacation bacteria.

3226
01:32:11,591 --> 01:32:11,771
I mean,

3227
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:14,170
they're named for a reason and they're,

3228
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:15,450
it makes,

3229
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,283
just want to throw up.

3230
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,303
It does.

3231
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:19,990
Um,

3232
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:22,360
so often this is a,

3233
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:23,230
you know,

3234
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:24,730
my friend Brian Cowen,

3235
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:25,750
who I love dearly,

3236
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:27,760
but he's fucking ridiculous.

3237
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,920
And he's one of those guys that will
get on this tangent and listen to one

3238
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:37,921
person say something and then spout
it out as if it's fucking gospel.

3239
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,540
And he hit me with this Peter off it guy?

3240
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,520
Or is that the guy's name?

3241
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:43,390
Paul?

3242
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:44,910
Whatever the fuck doctor off it.

3243
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,090
We've fuck his name is.

3244
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:51,130
And he listened to this guy and
without debunking it online at all,

3245
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,200
and I did it real quick,

3246
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:57,130
I did a real quick debunking of it and
found a bunch of people called bullshit

3247
01:32:57,131 --> 01:32:58,300
on all of his claims.

3248
01:32:59,020 --> 01:32:59,380
Meanwhile,

3249
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:04,380
these studies were from 1942 and it's
just like so much of what this guy had

3250
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:06,220
said,

3251
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,230
what was horseshit?

3252
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:08,150
Um,

3253
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,120
one of them off it claim that a study,

3254
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:14,290
but this guy was basically saying
was that taking vitamins and taking

3255
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,960
antioxidants can actually cause cancer.

3256
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,010
And you know,

3257
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,840
calen of course never wants to be wrong.

3258
01:33:19,841 --> 01:33:20,790
So he's telling me no,

3259
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:20,880
no,

3260
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:20,991
no,

3261
01:33:20,991 --> 01:33:21,110
no,

3262
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:22,300
the all studies confirm this.

3263
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:24,070
I'm like the fuck they do man.

3264
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:25,620
And so I sent him all this,

3265
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:26,410
this,

3266
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:26,831
you know,

3267
01:33:26,831 --> 01:33:27,030
I,

3268
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:31,930
I've barraged him with all these
debunking sites and he backed off finally,

3269
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:36,460
but for fucking days his Twitter was
all about don't take Antioch's and he's,

3270
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:36,850
he,

3271
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:38,010
I'm really convinced,

3272
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:38,380
no,

3273
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,420
you fucking called me up.

3274
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:39,701
He's like,

3275
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:39,881
dude,

3276
01:33:39,881 --> 01:33:40,714
I'm really worried about you.

3277
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:41,950
You're taking into accidents,

3278
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:43,420
you taking vitamins and where
are you going to get cancer?

3279
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:43,720
I'm like,

3280
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,150
the fuck are you talking about?

3281
01:33:45,151 --> 01:33:45,760
God,

3282
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,300
we need it.

3283
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,530
We need to dive into this.

3284
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:47,771
I mean,

3285
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:50,230
to me it angers me.

3286
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,660
What was the name of the book he wrote?

3287
01:33:51,661 --> 01:33:52,870
It's do you believe it's called?

3288
01:33:52,871 --> 01:33:53,470
I'm a con.

3289
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,303
That's his book.

3290
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:56,670
I'm a cunt and I'm trying
to make money cause that.

3291
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,080
I think that's what's going on
with a lot of these fuckheads,

3292
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:01,930
these contrarians with these
people that make these articles.

3293
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:04,360
I don't know how many
of them are just idiots.

3294
01:34:04,361 --> 01:34:07,060
I don't know how many of them were like
Brian dunning where they just sort of,

3295
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:07,421
they're,

3296
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:08,500
they're mentally deficient.

3297
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:11,620
There's something wrong with the way
they're thinking worse and you know,

3298
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:15,460
and I discovered that in communicating
with Brian over three hours,

3299
01:34:15,461 --> 01:34:15,700
I'm like,

3300
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:15,820
oh,

3301
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,390
there's something wrong here and I don't
know what it is and I don't want to

3302
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:19,990
know what it is.

3303
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:21,610
But it's obvious you're not normal.

3304
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,510
You're not healthy.

3305
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:22,941
You're,

3306
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:24,640
your correlations are not healthy.

3307
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,760
Like just just discussing buildings.

3308
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:29,500
Falling is like his,

3309
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:31,480
his way of looking at things is unhealthy.

3310
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:31,930
It's not,

3311
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:32,763
it's not correct.

3312
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,750
I don't know if that's
what this guy's doing.

3313
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,060
I don't know if a lot of Nice
people who are doing things,

3314
01:34:37,061 --> 01:34:38,560
I think they're just
trying to get attention.

3315
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:39,390
They're just like,

3316
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:39,600
oh,

3317
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,600
Kale is going to kill you.

3318
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:41,740
Fucking kill is going to kill me.

3319
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:44,110
Everybody knows that people
are loving Kale these days.

3320
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:45,880
People are finding these
health benefits skills.

3321
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:50,881
I tuck talk freely and openly about
how I drink Kale Salads or Kale shakes

3322
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:54,160
rather regular basis and how
I feel great when I take him.

3323
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:54,911
So,

3324
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:55,271
and then,

3325
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:55,541
you know,

3326
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:56,231
people will sell him,

3327
01:34:56,231 --> 01:34:57,130
send me these fucking,

3328
01:34:57,370 --> 01:34:58,600
so I read tweets,

3329
01:34:58,601 --> 01:34:59,360
some of them,

3330
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,880
and then I'll find contradictory articles.

3331
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:02,840
I retweet those.

3332
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:07,280
So there's off it fucking thing just
drove me up a wall because I started

3333
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:10,700
reading all the people that call bullshit
on this guy and all these people that

3334
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:12,380
say that he's kind of dangerous,

3335
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:15,770
that the things he's saying are kind
of dangerous because they're easily

3336
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:17,780
refutable but he's trying to sell them.

3337
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:18,470
You selling them,

3338
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,340
selling them as fat.

3339
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:19,721
Yeah.

3340
01:35:19,721 --> 01:35:21,190
So let me,

3341
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,053
let me,

3342
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,890
let's dig in here because I really,

3343
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:24,310
um,

3344
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,700
I was,

3345
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:24,940
I,

3346
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:25,600
first of all,

3347
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,690
I wasn't familiar with the guy until
you brought them to my attention.

3348
01:35:28,691 --> 01:35:30,870
And actually my p my advisor,

3349
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:34,460
my postdoctoral advisories and 85 year
old like world renowned scientist,

3350
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,400
he knew who the guy was and he was like,

3351
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:37,900
you're going to crush him.

3352
01:35:37,901 --> 01:35:38,330
Like he,

3353
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,090
he really doesn't like this guy.

3354
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:40,241
I mean,

3355
01:35:40,241 --> 01:35:42,400
he's familiar with his
whole everything he's doing.

3356
01:35:42,401 --> 01:35:44,110
So that's why I was so angry at Cowen,

3357
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:45,340
because if you go online,

3358
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,820
there's just a fucking
slew of reputable paypal,

3359
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:49,210
right?

3360
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:49,800
I think this guy's,

3361
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,171
and no,

3362
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:51,040
I didn't read his book,

3363
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:55,930
but I listened to the podcast and I took
notes on what he said and I'm ready.

3364
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,350
Let's,

3365
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,990
let's go through some of this because
I think it's really important.

3366
01:35:58,991 --> 01:35:59,391
First of all,

3367
01:35:59,391 --> 01:35:59,500
he,

3368
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,650
this guy makes huge over generalizations,

3369
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:04,180
doesn't understand mechanism.

3370
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:05,013
It's clear to me.

3371
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,093
So the first thing,

3372
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,330
the first thing he says is,

3373
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,283
is that,

3374
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:09,041
you know,

3375
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:09,880
we should have,

3376
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:11,800
if we're going to look at
the effects of supplements,

3377
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:14,380
we need to do randomized
controlled trials.

3378
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:17,740
We need to hold all drugs
to the same standard.

3379
01:36:17,741 --> 01:36:19,130
We need to do randomized
controlled trials.

3380
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:20,100
So randomized controls,

3381
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:24,160
controlled trials are like the poster
child for pharmacological interventions,

3382
01:36:24,161 --> 01:36:27,390
drug interventions and what they are
is you basically you get a population,

3383
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:28,243
people,

3384
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,193
you split them into two groups,

3385
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:31,360
two groups and you're
going to have either your,

3386
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:35,890
your drug blah blah banal or
placebo and you're going to give,

3387
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:36,370
you know,

3388
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:38,110
whichever group one drug,

3389
01:36:38,111 --> 01:36:38,251
blah,

3390
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:39,290
Blah Blah and all the other groups per se.

3391
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:40,780
But Oh and you don't
know who's getting what.

3392
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:43,360
They don't know who's getting what and
men are going to look at some clinical

3393
01:36:43,361 --> 01:36:47,950
end point like heart attack or myocardial
infarct infarction or something like

3394
01:36:47,951 --> 01:36:48,670
that.

3395
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:51,250
And it's really a great design for that,

3396
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:51,971
that sort of thing.

3397
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:53,350
Because you know,

3398
01:36:53,351 --> 01:36:55,060
when you start off at baseline,

3399
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:58,030
everyone in the trial
has same levels of drug,

3400
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:59,020
Blah Blah and all in their blood.

3401
01:36:59,021 --> 01:36:59,441
Guess what,

3402
01:36:59,441 --> 01:37:01,030
zero because we don't make drugs,

3403
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,170
we don't eat drugs.

3404
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:02,501
You know,

3405
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:03,700
it's not something that we're,

3406
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,840
you know,

3407
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,030
eating on a daily basis.

3408
01:37:06,031 --> 01:37:09,220
This is at pharmacological drug that's
been designed with a certain mechanism,

3409
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,940
mechanism of action to act on a
certain thing to do a certain thing,

3410
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,450
right?

3411
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:15,190
Like you know stands for example.

3412
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,870
So you know,

3413
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:21,130
you can do that where you have
this randomized controlled
trial for a certain x

3414
01:37:21,131 --> 01:37:24,760
amount of time and you look at the effect
on heart attacks and you don't have to

3415
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:25,594
measure anything.

3416
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:26,913
You know,

3417
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:32,040
the problem is is that you can't apply
that same thinking for nutrition research

3418
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:37,060
because everyone has different levels
of vitamins and minerals in their body.

3419
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,680
People eat different diets.

3420
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:39,131
I mean,

3421
01:37:39,131 --> 01:37:40,290
you have people that are deaf,

3422
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:40,690
you know,

3423
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:43,090
have inadequate levels of things
are deficient in certain things,

3424
01:37:43,091 --> 01:37:45,550
have optimal levels of certain things.

3425
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,860
And so if you just take
this random group of people,

3426
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:51,760
put them into two groups and then give
them a vitamin supplement and then try to

3427
01:37:51,761 --> 01:37:53,890
look at some clinical end
point like heart attack.

3428
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,110
Well guess what?

3429
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:59,250
You're going to have people that have
were severely deficient and whatever you

3430
01:37:59,251 --> 01:37:59,731
gave them,

3431
01:37:59,731 --> 01:38:01,320
they're still severely deficient.

3432
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:04,620
Or you're going to have people
that are top total adequate levels.

3433
01:38:04,621 --> 01:38:05,040
And you're getting,

3434
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,970
giving them a vitamin.

3435
01:38:05,971 --> 01:38:08,850
They already have adequate levels up and
you're trying to look at some clinical

3436
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:09,540
end point.

3437
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:14,540
You can't do nutrition research with
the same mind frame where whereas we're

3438
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:18,090
looking at we're going to do the same
type of trial that we do for drugs.

3439
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:18,631
You know,

3440
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:18,991
that's just,

3441
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:20,340
you can't do that.

3442
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:21,151
You can't do that.

3443
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:24,600
You have to think about the way you
control and design a clinical trial.

3444
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:26,400
And when you're doing nutrition research,

3445
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:26,730
where you're,

3446
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,590
where you're looking at the
effects of vitamins and minerals,

3447
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:29,424
first of all,

3448
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,360
that there's two very different things
going on when you have a pharmacological

3449
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:34,194
drug,

3450
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,990
your giving it to someone because
they're already falling apart.

3451
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:37,891
Okay?

3452
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:41,190
They're already falling apart and you're
trying to help them not fall apart as

3453
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:43,650
fast by giving them something you know,

3454
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:47,180
that blocks x or y or z or like
cholesterol synthesis for one Stanton's,

3455
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,060
um,

3456
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,470
with vitamins and minerals.

3457
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,780
These are things that are important for,

3458
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,180
for,

3459
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:54,090
for preventing you from falling apart.

3460
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:57,120
These are things that we
require these enzymes we need,

3461
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:57,481
you know,

3462
01:38:57,481 --> 01:39:01,680
cofactors for enzymes that we need
to do like hundreds of different

3463
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,880
physiological functions,

3464
01:39:02,881 --> 01:39:04,800
thousands of different
physiological functions.

3465
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,310
You know,

3466
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,880
so we're talking about
a different start point,

3467
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:09,570
right?

3468
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:10,081
It's not,

3469
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:12,780
it's not like you give people
vitamins when they're falling apart.

3470
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:13,440
No,

3471
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,080
they know they need to be getting their
vitamins to make sure they don't fall

3472
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:16,800
apart,

3473
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,460
you know?

3474
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,130
And so the whole randomized
controlled trial using that,

3475
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:20,460
that's,

3476
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:20,640
that's,

3477
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:24,120
so he kept saying this like we need to
hold vitamins to the same standard as

3478
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:24,481
drugs.

3479
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:26,160
We need to have randomized
controlled trials.

3480
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:29,800
And that's how we determine whether
or not they're effective or their,

3481
01:39:29,801 --> 01:39:29,930
their,

3482
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,350
their efficacy rate basically.

3483
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:32,341
But like I said,

3484
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,091
you can't do that.

3485
01:39:33,091 --> 01:39:35,340
You have to measure people's
vitamin and mineral levels.

3486
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:35,760
Let's like,

3487
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,960
let's say you're looking at vitamin D at
baseline to see how efficient they are.

3488
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:40,351
For one,

3489
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:42,390
this is going to determine
the dose that you give them.

3490
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:42,991
You know,

3491
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:47,400
if someone's like 12 nanograms
per milliliter and you
give them 400 Ius a day,

3492
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,930
they've even shown in that annals of
internal medicine paper that doesn't work.

3493
01:39:51,931 --> 01:39:54,000
They're still going to be
deficient at the end of the trial.

3494
01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:55,080
You can because you know,

3495
01:39:55,081 --> 01:39:58,620
400 Ius a day raises your blood levels
by like five nanograms per milliliter.

3496
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:01,620
So you can't just not the way to do

3497
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:02,420
research,

3498
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:05,840
the difference being that given someone
something that's completely alien to the

3499
01:40:05,841 --> 01:40:10,550
body but could be beneficial like a
drug or giving them something that is

3500
01:40:10,551 --> 01:40:14,390
absolutely essential to the body that
is necessary and is a part of normal

3501
01:40:14,391 --> 01:40:18,890
everyday diet that you can't look at the
two of them the same way that the drug

3502
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:20,570
may help people,

3503
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:25,520
but the reality is you're introducing
something that's completely alien to the

3504
01:40:25,521 --> 01:40:27,650
person's system in order to benefit them.

3505
01:40:27,651 --> 01:40:32,651
Whereas with vitamins you
are just regulating or
measuring what is essential to

3506
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,610
the human body and and,

3507
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:34,851
and,

3508
01:40:34,851 --> 01:40:37,700
and pretty much has been
established that vitamin B,

3509
01:40:37,701 --> 01:40:38,451
Vitamin D,

3510
01:40:38,451 --> 01:40:39,201
vitamin C,

3511
01:40:39,201 --> 01:40:43,280
all of these different things is that
various aspects of nutrition are essential

3512
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,570
to human health.

3513
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:45,140
That's one,

3514
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,370
that's one aspect of it.

3515
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:48,650
You can't look at a drug the
same way you look at vital.

3516
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:49,201
Yeah.

3517
01:40:49,201 --> 01:40:49,771
And also,

3518
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:50,311
like I said,

3519
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:53,650
people already start off with
varying levels of these vitamins.

3520
01:40:53,651 --> 01:40:56,080
So when you're randomizing them
into two different populations,

3521
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:56,920
you don't know.

3522
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,750
Some of these people get
up could be very deficient.

3523
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:02,830
Some have plenty of vitaminK
or whatever you're looking at.

3524
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,050
So you need to measure them at baseline.

3525
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:07,090
So you'd get a deficient population.

3526
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:11,440
You need to get a population that's
low because the whole point of,

3527
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:11,711
you know,

3528
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:15,010
giving someone a vitamin supplement is
to bring them up to an adequate level.

3529
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:17,290
It's not to like have some effect on top.

3530
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,910
It's not like a drug where you're,

3531
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:19,450
you know,

3532
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,490
blocking some receptor
and having some response.

3533
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:22,060
No,

3534
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:25,000
you're taking vitamins and mineral
supplements because you're not getting

3535
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:27,700
everything you need from your food
and you want to get yourself up to an

3536
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:28,534
adequate level.

3537
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,560
And so what you need to do is start off,

3538
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,890
you need to measure
people's levels at baseline.

3539
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:34,810
Start off with a population
that's inadequate,

3540
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,950
give them a vitamin and mineral supplement
to get them to an adequate level.

3541
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:40,390
And then you can measure something.

3542
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,770
So it's really important,

3543
01:41:41,771 --> 01:41:43,150
and I think they even
talked about this last time,

3544
01:41:43,151 --> 01:41:44,200
is quantifying these levels.

3545
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:44,321
Well,

3546
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:46,210
this is the reason why you can't,

3547
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:46,410
you,

3548
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:46,631
you know,

3549
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:51,040
starting off with a population of people
that has enough vitamin D and You're

3550
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:54,220
trying to look at the effects of
vitamin D on cancer incidents.

3551
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:55,660
Well guess what?

3552
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:55,901
You know,

3553
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:58,810
they already have enough vitamin D
they're already in is adequate range.

3554
01:41:59,020 --> 01:41:59,920
Or conversely,

3555
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:00,791
if they're really,

3556
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:01,151
really,

3557
01:42:01,151 --> 01:42:04,210
really deficient and you're looking
at the effects of vitamin D and cancer

3558
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:05,020
incidents,

3559
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:07,690
and you give them a dose
that still makes them,

3560
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:08,740
they're still deficient.

3561
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:09,161
Well,

3562
01:42:09,161 --> 01:42:09,790
guess what?

3563
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,623
We don't know what,

3564
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:12,160
how vitamin D is affecting cancer.

3565
01:42:12,161 --> 01:42:13,330
And since from that one study,

3566
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:15,370
because they're still deficient
at the end of the trial,

3567
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:16,210
you know,

3568
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,140
so the conclusion is,

3569
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:17,381
oh,

3570
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:18,520
my dose was inefficient,

3571
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:22,360
was inadequate to bring them to
an adequate level of vitamin D.

3572
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:22,781
That's,

3573
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:23,770
that should be the conclusion,

3574
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:24,010
not,

3575
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,131
oh,

3576
01:42:24,131 --> 01:42:25,530
vitamin D doesn't affect cancer incidents.

3577
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:25,800
Right,

3578
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:25,990
right.

3579
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:27,940
Which is what people tend to do,

3580
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:29,170
Eh,

3581
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:29,591
you know,

3582
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:31,870
you have to sell your
story to get it published.

3583
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:32,321
You know,

3584
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:32,861
you do all,

3585
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:35,350
you need years and years
work of research and,

3586
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:35,740
uh,

3587
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,050
you find this negative data and it's like,

3588
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:38,141
well,

3589
01:42:38,141 --> 01:42:40,750
you gotta sell it somehow so you're
not going to sell it by saying,

3590
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:40,931
oh,

3591
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:43,930
well it didn't give them an
adequate dose and they're still not,

3592
01:42:43,931 --> 01:42:44,141
you know,

3593
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:44,980
up to adequate levels.

3594
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:45,814
So that's,

3595
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,811
that's really,

3596
01:42:46,811 --> 01:42:46,940
uh,

3597
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:50,830
the one first thing about
off it and so many others,

3598
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:54,520
including the people that wrote that
this whole and offers enough editorial.

3599
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:54,760
Yeah,

3600
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,361
there are the same,

3601
01:42:55,361 --> 01:42:57,280
they were looking at
randomized control trials.

3602
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:01,730
Most of the time they started off with
people didn't measure anything at all at

3603
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:02,800
start or throughout,

3604
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:03,101
you know,

3605
01:43:03,101 --> 01:43:03,391
the,

3606
01:43:03,391 --> 01:43:05,170
the followups and you know,

3607
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:05,471
it's like,

3608
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:05,880
well,

3609
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,850
well the enough is enough was even
worse because enough is enough.

3610
01:43:08,851 --> 01:43:09,690
Where they were studying.

3611
01:43:09,691 --> 01:43:10,950
Two of the things that we're studying,

3612
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:15,951
we're heart attacks and people over 65
and dementia did delaying the onset of

3613
01:43:17,251 --> 01:43:21,420
dementia in people who are over
65 like Jesus fucking Christ.

3614
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:22,860
You're talking about people who are dying,

3615
01:43:22,861 --> 01:43:23,280
right?

3616
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,900
And you're giving them
vitamins and saying,

3617
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:26,610
doc didn't stop them from dying.

3618
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:27,060
Right?

3619
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:31,680
You're dealing with compete completely
broken human beings that are like on

3620
01:43:31,681 --> 01:43:32,940
death's door.

3621
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:35,010
There's the forgetting shit.

3622
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,590
They don't know where they
are and their heart's failing.

3623
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:38,000
And you're like,

3624
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,250
God,

3625
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,150
vitamins don't work.

3626
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:39,871
So to say,

3627
01:43:39,871 --> 01:43:43,230
vitamins don't work in those
two circumstances is ridiculous.

3628
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:47,640
And there are other circumstance showed
a slight improvement with vitamins,

3629
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,170
and yet they still came to conclusion.

3630
01:43:49,171 --> 01:43:52,130
The vitamins don't work
because that's the most title,

3631
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:52,760
right?

3632
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:53,593
They,

3633
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:57,560
vitamins and minerals are
important to prevent disease.

3634
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:59,720
They are important to prevent disease.

3635
01:43:59,721 --> 01:43:59,991
You know,

3636
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:00,441
it's not,

3637
01:44:00,441 --> 01:44:04,160
it's not like if you're already falling
apart and you've already been deficient

3638
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,750
for years and years and
years and years and years,

3639
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,321
guess what?

3640
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:08,810
It's much harder to patch
things up much more difficult.

3641
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:10,850
You've already acquired so much damage.

3642
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:14,180
You've acquired so many different things
that are going wrong that trying to

3643
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:16,430
patch it up later is really difficult.

3644
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:18,310
And so you know,

3645
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,810
in those studies also they did things
where they were giving it to cancer

3646
01:44:20,811 --> 01:44:21,590
patients.

3647
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:22,340
And like I said,

3648
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,330
or if smokers,

3649
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:28,010
they were looking at the effects of
Beta carotene or vitamin A in smokers.

3650
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:33,220
And the thing is is that smokers
are a different breed because,

3651
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:36,920
I mean they're taking in poison every day.

3652
01:44:36,921 --> 01:44:38,540
And what happens is their lungs,

3653
01:44:38,541 --> 01:44:40,430
they have a very oxidative environment.

3654
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:43,190
So when they take vitamin Beta carotene,

3655
01:44:43,191 --> 01:44:44,750
which is part of the vitamin a family,

3656
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:49,040
this Beta carotene gets cleaved because
they have oxidative stress and stuff

3657
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:49,491
going on.

3658
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:53,360
It gets cleaved into some
of these cleavage products
which actually damaged DNA

3659
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:55,760
more and Co and can accelerate cancer.

3660
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:56,450
And,

3661
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:58,670
but the thing is is that
that's specific to smokers.

3662
01:44:58,671 --> 01:45:01,400
If you give the same dose of
Beta carotene to a nonsmoker,

3663
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:02,151
guess what?

3664
01:45:02,151 --> 01:45:02,984
That doesn't happen.

3665
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,440
They don't get those cleavage products
and it doesn't start damaged their DNA

3666
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:07,910
more and it doesn't accelerate cancer.

3667
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:08,751
So you know,

3668
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:09,531
you have to really,

3669
01:45:09,531 --> 01:45:11,540
the context is so important.

3670
01:45:11,541 --> 01:45:12,100
Like,

3671
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:12,260
you know,

3672
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:12,980
you can't just say,

3673
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,250
oh,

3674
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,660
vitamin A's bad for you.

3675
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:15,440
No.

3676
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:15,860
Well,

3677
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:16,970
if you're a smoker,

3678
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:17,480
it's a,

3679
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:17,781
you know,

3680
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:19,370
this is a certain context where,

3681
01:45:19,371 --> 01:45:19,790
you know,

3682
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:23,750
there can be problems with taking high
doses of Beta carotene for that reason

3683
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:24,351
where you're,

3684
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:24,651
you're,

3685
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:28,460
you've got all these oxidative
stress things going on.

3686
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:31,760
And so they cleave the Beta Beta carotene
into the certain cleavage products

3687
01:45:31,761 --> 01:45:33,110
that normal people don't get.

3688
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:33,861
You know,

3689
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:38,720
so context is very important and this is
something that so many people so often

3690
01:45:38,721 --> 01:45:39,201
ignore,

3691
01:45:39,201 --> 01:45:40,130
including off it.

3692
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:40,880
Um,

3693
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,090
you know,

3694
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:41,780
another,

3695
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:42,201
he,

3696
01:45:42,201 --> 01:45:43,850
he's basically states that,

3697
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:45,500
and he says clear.

3698
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:49,680
It's clear and consistent
that antioxidant antioxidants,

3699
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:53,030
supplements are bad for you
and can give you cancer.

3700
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:54,560
And he gives two examples.

3701
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:58,340
The one example he says is
the prostate cancer study.

3702
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:03,760
And the second example he says is because
you need oxidants around in your body

3703
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:06,350
to prevent cancer cells,

3704
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:07,400
it kills cancer cells.

3705
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:07,880
Right.

3706
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:08,121
Okay.

3707
01:46:08,121 --> 01:46:09,620
So it's kind of like,

3708
01:46:09,621 --> 01:46:14,390
well it's kind of a big overgeneralization
and it really shows me his lack of

3709
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:15,111
understanding,

3710
01:46:15,111 --> 01:46:19,490
his lack of understanding of mechanism
either because it's too much work to look

3711
01:46:19,491 --> 01:46:22,010
into it because it's a
lot of work or you know,

3712
01:46:22,011 --> 01:46:23,780
just because he doesn't care,

3713
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:24,440
it's,

3714
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,160
you know.

3715
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,461
Um,

3716
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:27,800
so let's start off with the first part.

3717
01:46:27,801 --> 01:46:28,101
He says,

3718
01:46:28,101 --> 01:46:28,934
you know,

3719
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:31,550
vitamin E can cause prostate cancer.

3720
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:32,660
This is,

3721
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:33,351
this is huge.

3722
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:33,801
This is actually,

3723
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:34,581
there was a huge,

3724
01:46:34,581 --> 01:46:36,650
huge study called the uh,

3725
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:38,970
select trial where they took the,

3726
01:46:38,971 --> 01:46:41,810
the selenium and vitamin
E cancer prevention trial.

3727
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,820
Selenium is also important.

3728
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:48,500
It's a cofactor for about
25 or so different proteins
that are one of them being

3729
01:46:48,501 --> 01:46:52,920
glued Oth I peroxidase and synthase and
all these different antioxidant genes.

3730
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:57,750
And it's been shown to selenium highest
Linnaean was correlated with low cancer

3731
01:46:57,751 --> 01:46:58,410
incidents,

3732
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:00,990
so they thought that would
play a role in prostate cancer.

3733
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:05,550
So they did this big trial where they got
like someone like 30,000 men is pretty

3734
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:10,551
big and they gave him supplements
that gave them either vitamin e.

3735
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:12,630
So vitamin E is actually,

3736
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:14,490
there's a whole family of vitamin E's.

3737
01:47:14,491 --> 01:47:15,990
It's not just one vitamin,

3738
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:17,880
there's actually eight
different forms of it.

3739
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:19,403
And uh,

3740
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:20,401
Alpha Beta,

3741
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:21,234
Gamma Delta,

3742
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:26,150
and there's the present is
either tocopherols or took
her adrenals tribunals,

3743
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,580
and the major forms are
Alpha and gamma tocopherol.

3744
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,480
Okay.

3745
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,380
And these two different
forms of vitamin E,

3746
01:47:32,381 --> 01:47:35,260
the Alpha and gamma tocopherol there,

3747
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,420
they're antioxidants,

3748
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:38,280
but they actually have separate functions.

3749
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,720
So the Alpha Tocopherol is
a very potent antioxidant,

3750
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,280
so it's very good at,

3751
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:45,060
you know,

3752
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,470
getting oxygen,

3753
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:50,040
reactive oxygen radicals that's
generated by like normal metabolism.

3754
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,690
These things damage your DNA,

3755
01:47:51,691 --> 01:47:53,190
but they also damage your lipid,

3756
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,200
like Byler of your membranes,

3757
01:47:55,201 --> 01:47:55,711
cell membranes.

3758
01:47:55,711 --> 01:47:58,290
What happens is vitamin D is fat soluble,

3759
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:01,430
so it gets him those lipid by
layers and it prevents the,

3760
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:03,810
that oxygen radical from damaging it.

3761
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:05,730
And what happens is if you
don't have that happening,

3762
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:08,400
your lip and membranes get
stiffer and stiffer over time.

3763
01:48:08,401 --> 01:48:10,020
And this is part of aging where you're,

3764
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:10,501
you're,

3765
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:13,710
they become rigid and it's hard to
transport metabolites into your cells.

3766
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:15,300
It's hard to transport
proteins in and out.

3767
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:15,720
It just,

3768
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,770
it screws up stuff.

3769
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:18,300
So it's important to have,

3770
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:18,811
you know,

3771
01:48:18,811 --> 01:48:21,900
something like five Alpha Tocopherol
preventing that from happening.

3772
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,200
It also prevents your
proteins from being oxidized,

3773
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:25,951
which causes problems.

3774
01:48:25,951 --> 01:48:28,530
So that's really important to have.

3775
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:28,771
You know,

3776
01:48:28,771 --> 01:48:30,210
and you actually need to
get it from your diet.

3777
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:32,610
The vitamin E's you have
to get from your diet,

3778
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:33,151
from plants.

3779
01:48:33,151 --> 01:48:34,230
We don't make it ourselves.

3780
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:38,100
The gamma form actually
is also an antioxidant,

3781
01:48:38,101 --> 01:48:40,470
but it's an anti nitration one.

3782
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:43,350
So nitration is formed
from your immune system.

3783
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:45,210
Just normal immune function,

3784
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:45,740
like,

3785
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:46,050
you know,

3786
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:49,710
fighting off things creates
reactive nitrogen species.

3787
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:53,610
So these nitrogen species also do
the same thing as oxygen species.

3788
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:54,660
They damage your DNA,

3789
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:55,141
the damage,

3790
01:48:55,141 --> 01:48:56,130
your lipid membranes,

3791
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:57,570
the damaged proteins in your body.

3792
01:48:58,110 --> 01:49:01,750
So having both Alpha Tocopherol
and the Gamma Tocopherol,

3793
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:05,880
they're doing two independent functions
is important because they're making sure

3794
01:49:05,881 --> 01:49:09,990
you're not getting those oxygen or
nitrogen reactive species damaging crap in

3795
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:10,890
your body basically.

3796
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:11,850
Okay.

3797
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:14,190
And that's important to prevent cancer,

3798
01:49:14,191 --> 01:49:15,024
to prevent,

3799
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:15,421
you know,

3800
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:17,640
a lot of diseases of aging.

3801
01:49:17,641 --> 01:49:18,910
So protein said begin,

3802
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:22,550
come or get nitrated aggregate
and they can form you know,

3803
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,000
things and plaques in your brain.

3804
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:25,440
They can cause neurodegenerative diseases.

3805
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,201
So it's,

3806
01:49:26,201 --> 01:49:27,510
it's important to have,

3807
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,051
you know,

3808
01:49:28,051 --> 01:49:31,800
these antioxidant mechanisms in place to
prevent that from happening as we age.

3809
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:32,693
Okay.

3810
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:34,650
So with that said,

3811
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,470
the Alpha Tocopherol and you
can see how complex this is.

3812
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:37,980
You know,

3813
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:42,330
the Alpha Tocopherol is the major form
in your tissues and in your bloodstream.

3814
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:46,020
But the problem is is that when
you take really high levels of it,

3815
01:49:46,021 --> 01:49:48,550
so the Rda is like 22.4 I use,

3816
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,030
when you take really high like
10 times at like 400 I use,

3817
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,020
what happens is it
depletes your gamma levels.

3818
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,370
Okay.

3819
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:00,310
And this has been well known
for like over a decade.

3820
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:01,780
Multiple labs have shown this,

3821
01:50:01,781 --> 01:50:04,510
including the lab I work in and they
showed it in many years ago before I even

3822
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:05,890
joined their lab.

3823
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:07,240
So you know,

3824
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,991
taking high,

3825
01:50:07,991 --> 01:50:12,130
high levels of Alpha can be bad because
it depletes the gamma and the gamma has

3826
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:13,630
a separate function from the alpha.

3827
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,070
It prevents that nitration.

3828
01:50:15,071 --> 01:50:16,880
It also is an antiinflammatory,

3829
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,910
inhibits Cox enzymes,

3830
01:50:18,911 --> 01:50:21,430
which are involved in
generating prostoglandins.

3831
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:26,730
So what they did was they gave men
either Alpha to cough or all 400 I'd use.

3832
01:50:27,381 --> 01:50:28,750
So 10 times the Rda,

3833
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:30,130
maybe even one in 10 times.

3834
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:32,230
And salinium.

3835
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:33,131
Okay.

3836
01:50:33,131 --> 01:50:37,750
So they give them either outfit to
cough or all salinium only or both Alpha

3837
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:38,221
Tocopherol insulin,

3838
01:50:38,221 --> 01:50:39,250
IOM or the placebo.

3839
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:40,750
And then they looked,

3840
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:41,643
they followed up,

3841
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:45,430
they did a couple of followups to
look at prostate cancer incidents.

3842
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:46,323
Okay.

3843
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,150
So the first study was about
five and a half year follow up.

3844
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:52,720
And this was published in like 2009
and what it found was there's no effect

3845
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,690
taking vitamin E had no
effect on cancer incidents.

3846
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:56,980
Taking selenium had no effect.

3847
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:58,150
But what they,

3848
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:01,900
what you can see if you look at the data
is they measured their alpha and gamma

3849
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:03,550
levels at baseline.

3850
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,290
And then at five and a half years,

3851
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:10,291
what happened was those men taking 400
I use depleted their gamma tocopherol by

3852
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:13,060
like 45% at the end of the followup,

3853
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:14,230
which is like crazy.

3854
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,213
That's not good.

3855
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:16,270
Um,

3856
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,350
and then the second followup,

3857
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:20,200
what it found is it's seven and a
half years later they found that,

3858
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:20,951
oh my goodness,

3859
01:51:20,951 --> 01:51:21,880
the men taking,

3860
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:22,721
you know,

3861
01:51:22,721 --> 01:51:27,721
400 I use of Alpha Alpha tocopherol had
a 17% increase risk of prostate cancer.

3862
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,310
And then they went on to say,

3863
01:51:30,311 --> 01:51:30,970
oh my goodness,

3864
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:31,390
you know,

3865
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:34,240
400 I use a vitamin e a day
can cause prostate cancer.

3866
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,200
However,

3867
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:38,050
the men taking the
selenium with the vitamin,

3868
01:51:38,051 --> 01:51:38,711
he didn't get it.

3869
01:51:38,711 --> 01:51:41,260
So the men taking that outfit
to cough for all by itself,

3870
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:44,860
but took once it took with the
selenium with it didn't get it.

3871
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:47,290
So that salinium protected
and they didn't know why.

3872
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,330
So another study then recently
came out from the sand.

3873
01:51:50,331 --> 01:51:54,820
This is all the same big cohort of
people found that only the men that were

3874
01:51:54,821 --> 01:51:59,800
severely deficient in selenium to start
the trial that took the Alpha Tocopherol

3875
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,990
or the ones that had the
increased cancer incidents.

3876
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,670
So I started thinking about this,

3877
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:03,791
well,

3878
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:07,720
why is that selenium
also is important is uh,

3879
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:08,441
like I said,

3880
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:10,600
it's important for pro
like 25 or so proteins.

3881
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:15,700
One of them is important for preventing
nitration reactive nitration products.

3882
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:16,811
So it was like,

3883
01:52:16,811 --> 01:52:17,171
wow,

3884
01:52:17,171 --> 01:52:17,981
well this makes sense.

3885
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,390
You're taking high levels of outfits,

3886
01:52:19,391 --> 01:52:19,790
coffer,

3887
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:21,580
all depleting your gamma levels,

3888
01:52:21,581 --> 01:52:24,250
which is important to get
rid of nitration damage,

3889
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:24,701
right?

3890
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:25,900
Which damages DNA,

3891
01:52:25,901 --> 01:52:26,830
causes cancer,

3892
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:27,843
things like that.

3893
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:31,390
And yet you can give someone
this salinium Irmaa if they're,

3894
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:32,860
if they're not deficient in selenium,

3895
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,060
that doesn't happen.

3896
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:36,580
And so one of the selenium
proteins also does that.

3897
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,230
So the bottom line is,

3898
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:39,791
does taking,

3899
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:40,450
you know,

3900
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:44,230
normal levels of Alpha
Tocopherol like 22 or 30,

3901
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:45,064
I use a day,

3902
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:46,460
deplete your gamma levels?

3903
01:52:46,461 --> 01:52:47,150
No.

3904
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:47,630
Is it,

3905
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:49,070
is it good for you?

3906
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:49,341
Like,

3907
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:50,920
is it going to prevent your op,

3908
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:51,200
you know,

3909
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,920
lipid membranes from oxidizing and
your DNA from getting oxidized yest uh,

3910
01:52:54,921 --> 01:52:55,341
you know,

3911
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:56,450
is it going to give you cancer?

3912
01:52:56,451 --> 01:52:57,284
No,

3913
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:58,850
it's actually the opposite.

3914
01:52:58,851 --> 01:53:00,650
Prevents cancer is taking high,

3915
01:53:00,651 --> 01:53:03,410
high levels of of Alpha
Tocopherol dangerous?

3916
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:04,041
Well it can be,

3917
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:04,401
yes,

3918
01:53:04,401 --> 01:53:05,660
because it depletes your gamma.

3919
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,771
So you know,

3920
01:53:06,771 --> 01:53:08,930
taking high levels of Alpha
to call for all is not a,

3921
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,180
is not a good thing because
it can deplete your gamma,

3922
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:13,550
but that's only if you're
also selenium deficient.

3923
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:14,421
It's very,

3924
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:15,650
very complicated.

3925
01:53:15,651 --> 01:53:19,820
It is not simple and it's not as simple
as taking vitamin E is going to give you

3926
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:20,540
cancer.

3927
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:20,991
No.

3928
01:53:20,991 --> 01:53:24,620
There's a whole host of complex
mechanisms that are at play here.

3929
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:25,100
And,

3930
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,060
and the reality is,

3931
01:53:26,061 --> 01:53:26,241
you know,

3932
01:53:26,241 --> 01:53:26,990
if you want to,

3933
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:30,260
60% of the population doesn't
have enough Alpha Tocopherol.

3934
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:30,591
Okay.

3935
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:31,424
60%.

3936
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:32,391
So if you,

3937
01:53:32,391 --> 01:53:34,490
if you want to supplement with it,

3938
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,570
just don't be dumb.

3939
01:53:35,571 --> 01:53:38,240
Take a take a lower level of
and supplement with the mix.

3940
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:40,790
You can buy a mixed tocopherols together.

3941
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:41,700
So they get the Alpha,

3942
01:53:41,701 --> 01:53:42,021
the GAM,

3943
01:53:42,021 --> 01:53:42,540
and the Beta.

3944
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:44,180
What does a good source of that?

3945
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:45,560
Um,

3946
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,450
so ABA,

3947
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:47,151
Cahtos,

3948
01:53:47,151 --> 01:53:47,811
Pecans,

3949
01:53:47,811 --> 01:53:48,261
walnuts,

3950
01:53:48,261 --> 01:53:49,340
plant plant sources.

3951
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,520
I like to get my,

3952
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,950
I almonds also.

3953
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:52,840
So I also,

3954
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:54,380
I get my vitamin E,

3955
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:54,550
uh,

3956
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:55,310
mostly from,

3957
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:56,750
from plant sources.

3958
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:58,640
And also I use almond milk,

3959
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,620
unsweetened almond milk in my smoothies.

3960
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,221
Like I said,

3961
01:54:01,221 --> 01:54:02,840
I make a really big
smoothie every morning,

3962
01:54:02,841 --> 01:54:04,490
which has all these
different micronutrients.

3963
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:05,280
Yeah.

3964
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,600
And Sweden is the key really.

3965
01:54:06,601 --> 01:54:06,960
Right.

3966
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:07,800
I have a friend who said,

3967
01:54:07,830 --> 01:54:08,101
oh,

3968
01:54:08,101 --> 01:54:08,311
I'm,

3969
01:54:08,311 --> 01:54:09,001
it looks amazing.

3970
01:54:09,001 --> 01:54:09,601
I'm not drinking milk.

3971
01:54:09,601 --> 01:54:09,831
And more,

3972
01:54:09,831 --> 01:54:10,664
I'd say so good.

3973
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:11,101
I go,

3974
01:54:11,101 --> 01:54:11,311
okay,

3975
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:11,670
okay.

3976
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:12,121
What is it?

3977
01:54:12,121 --> 01:54:13,020
What kind of flavor is it?

3978
01:54:13,021 --> 01:54:13,810
And he was at vanilla.

3979
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:15,230
Go look at the fucking label please.

3980
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:16,260
I go,

3981
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:18,300
what does it say as far as grams of sugar,

3982
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:18,630
right.

3983
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:21,480
19 grams of sugar per serving.

3984
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:21,791
Yeah.

3985
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:23,110
You have to get the unsweetened,

3986
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:24,430
you have to get the unsweetened,

3987
01:54:24,431 --> 01:54:25,140
but it has,

3988
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:27,490
it has a lot of magnesium in
it and about a lot of the,

3989
01:54:27,491 --> 01:54:27,790
uh,

3990
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:28,660
the mixed vitamin E,

3991
01:54:28,661 --> 01:54:29,494
so it's,

3992
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:30,610
it's a good source.

3993
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,340
So vitamin E

3994
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:34,210
limitation in your opinion,

3995
01:54:34,211 --> 01:54:38,190
you should probably just get it from
diet to make sure that your levels are a

3996
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:39,370
normal healthy levels.

3997
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:42,370
And then it's the balance of the
different types of vitamin A's.

3998
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:42,920
Yeah,

3999
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,240
I prefer getting it from Diet.

4000
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:44,600
You,

4001
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,680
there are mixed tocopherols
that you can buy that are low.

4002
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:51,590
It's not like a 10 times
the RDA and their mix.

4003
01:54:51,591 --> 01:54:53,720
So you're getting the
gamma with the alpha.

4004
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,370
So if you have a good source for that,

4005
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:56,563
um,

4006
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:59,390
I think there's Swanson
brand may have a good one.

4007
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:00,270
Uh,

4008
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,740
is that what you mean by a yeah,

4009
01:55:01,741 --> 01:55:02,660
like a brand company.

4010
01:55:02,661 --> 01:55:02,851
Yeah.

4011
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:05,210
And then you know that I
think that might be a one one,

4012
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:07,310
I can't recall off the top of my head,

4013
01:55:07,311 --> 01:55:08,930
but they are pretty reliable in general.

4014
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:09,973
Um,

4015
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:10,680
you know,

4016
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:12,780
in a sense he oversimplified things,

4017
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:17,781
but there is a danger of taking too many
vitamins when you're taking vitamins,

4018
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:21,330
like a vitamin E that could potentially,

4019
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:23,130
if you're taking one form of it,

4020
01:55:23,131 --> 01:55:25,200
that could potentially deplete your,

4021
01:55:25,201 --> 01:55:25,750
your,

4022
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:26,071
uh,

4023
01:55:26,071 --> 01:55:26,904
absorption of the other.

4024
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:27,451
Exactly.

4025
01:55:27,451 --> 01:55:28,560
If you're taking a really,

4026
01:55:28,561 --> 01:55:31,950
really high dose of vitamin
the Alpha Tocopherol,

4027
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,813
vitamin E,

4028
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:33,270
uh,

4029
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:36,510
there could be a potential danger
and it depleting the gamma form.

4030
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:37,270
And

4031
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:39,710
anyone know whether they're
taking alpha or gamma,

4032
01:55:39,711 --> 01:55:40,350
if it just have a,

4033
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,183
if you look,

4034
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:44,100
if you have a vitamin e container
and look on the back of it,

4035
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,203
it'll say,

4036
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,220
it'll say like Alpha Tocopherol,

4037
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:48,090
it'll say this sort,

4038
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:49,950
like it says Alpha or gamma.

4039
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:52,800
Most supplemental forms are Alpha.

4040
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:53,920
And,

4041
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,600
and that's because that's the predominant
species found in tissues and in

4042
01:55:57,601 --> 01:55:58,434
plasma.

4043
01:55:58,470 --> 01:55:58,950
So people,

4044
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:59,131
you know,

4045
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:00,140
we thought it was like the,

4046
01:56:00,141 --> 01:56:00,990
the most important,

4047
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:03,720
but we found that gamma
is also really important.

4048
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:04,230
Um,

4049
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:04,410
and,

4050
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:06,390
but you can buy mixed tocopherols,

4051
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:06,930
you know,

4052
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:08,130
you can buy mixed tocopherols.

4053
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:08,670
Okay.

4054
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:12,480
So that is just one thing that
he brought up that was incorrect.

4055
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:12,631
Well,

4056
01:56:12,631 --> 01:56:12,931
that,

4057
01:56:12,931 --> 01:56:13,141
yeah,

4058
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:14,340
so that was one he made.

4059
01:56:14,341 --> 01:56:16,620
He said the data is clear and consistent.

4060
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:19,500
And for one that's anything but clear.

4061
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:22,700
I mean there's lots of complex
things going on and he said that it,

4062
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:22,921
you know,

4063
01:56:22,921 --> 01:56:25,740
it's clear and consistent that
supplemental antioxidants cause cancer.

4064
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:26,520
Well,

4065
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,860
there's also other studies showing that,

4066
01:56:28,861 --> 01:56:29,131
you know,

4067
01:56:29,131 --> 01:56:29,964
these,

4068
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:30,770
uh,

4069
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:32,270
p profit of PR in,

4070
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:33,900
in the case of prostate cancer,

4071
01:56:33,901 --> 01:56:35,580
if you look at their
blood levels of Alpha,

4072
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:36,840
tocopherol and gamma,

4073
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:40,140
those with the highest levels of
Alpha and gamma have the least,

4074
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:40,501
you know,

4075
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:41,520
prostate cancer incidents.

4076
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:45,780
So there's inconsistency in terms of
what exactly is going on and we're still

4077
01:56:45,781 --> 01:56:47,050
really understanding all the muck,

4078
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:48,810
trying to understand all
the mechanisms at play.

4079
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:49,790
Um,

4080
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:50,623
but he also,

4081
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:55,710
he also made the overgeneralization and
that taking supplemental antioxidants is

4082
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:59,160
bad because you need pro
oxidants to kill cancer cells.

4083
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:03,540
And that was like the second part of his
why supplemental antioxidants are bad.

4084
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:05,100
And you know,

4085
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:07,440
this is another example of context.

4086
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:08,910
So you know,

4087
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:09,773
if you,

4088
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:14,100
if you don't have enough of
the Alpha Gamma Tocopherols,

4089
01:57:14,101 --> 01:57:16,410
then you're going to have
increased DNA damage.

4090
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:17,453
You're going to have,

4091
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:17,971
you know,

4092
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:21,860
things that caused
mutations and what happened.

4093
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:22,080
You know,

4094
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,960
what happens is you're going to,

4095
01:57:23,961 --> 01:57:24,180
you know,

4096
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:26,160
accumulate that over time and
that's going to lead to cancer.

4097
01:57:26,161 --> 01:57:28,890
So not having enough of
this vitamin D is not good.

4098
01:57:28,891 --> 01:57:29,310
And like I said,

4099
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:31,050
60% of the population doesn't have enough.

4100
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:31,830
Um,

4101
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:32,910
but the flip side is,

4102
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:34,770
is that if you already have cancer,

4103
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:37,680
then taking supplemental vitamin E,

4104
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:38,731
uh,

4105
01:57:38,731 --> 01:57:41,520
what happens is because it
prevents that oxidation,

4106
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,930
then you,

4107
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:43,440
uh,

4108
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,500
there's mechanisms in your
body that induce cell death.

4109
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:48,030
When you have oxidation,

4110
01:57:48,031 --> 01:57:48,771
when you have this damage,

4111
01:57:48,771 --> 01:57:52,710
sturdy DNA tumor suppressor genes
get activated and they kill the cell.

4112
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,870
So what they've shown is that in mice,

4113
01:57:54,871 --> 01:57:56,130
if you take mice that already,

4114
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:59,070
if you give him cancer and you'd
give them supplemental vitamin E,

4115
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:01,830
you can attenuate that whole pathway,

4116
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:03,570
that that activates the cell,

4117
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,250
the death of these cancer cells.

4118
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:05,880
Uh,

4119
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:06,690
but that's not the case.

4120
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:07,321
If you take a mouse,

4121
01:58:07,321 --> 01:58:08,940
it doesn't have cancer and
you give them vitamin E,

4122
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:10,470
it actually prevents the DNA damage.

4123
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:12,990
So this is a case where
you're looking at context.

4124
01:58:12,991 --> 01:58:14,580
So someone that doesn't have,

4125
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:15,870
you know,

4126
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:17,340
that is not,

4127
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,810
it doesn't have cancer on their body.

4128
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:21,930
You want to make sure the
not causing DNA damage,

4129
01:58:21,931 --> 01:58:22,770
which is happening,

4130
01:58:22,771 --> 01:58:23,130
you know,

4131
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:26,370
every second by making sure they
have enough of these antioxidants.

4132
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,600
But on the flip side of that,

4133
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:27,781
you know,

4134
01:58:27,781 --> 01:58:28,740
if you already have cancer,

4135
01:58:28,741 --> 01:58:33,050
taking a bunch of supplemental vitamin
E is not a good thing because you

4136
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,541
couldn't attend.

4137
01:58:33,541 --> 01:58:36,870
You wait that pathway that is
important to kill cancer cells.

4138
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:39,870
So it's another thing where it's
like context is so important.

4139
01:58:39,871 --> 01:58:41,890
You need to differentiate people that

4140
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,150
are normal,

4141
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:46,390
healthy and people that are trying to
prevent themselves from getting cancer by

4142
01:58:46,391 --> 01:58:48,580
preventing these things that cause cancer,

4143
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:52,330
which vitamin E can help prevent versus
talking about someone that already has

4144
01:58:52,331 --> 01:58:53,140
cancer.

4145
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:58,140
And so it was just incredibly
irresponsible to make
a simplified version of

4146
01:58:58,481 --> 01:59:02,290
these incredibly complex
processes that are going on.

4147
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:03,161
In my opinion.

4148
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:03,994
It's,

4149
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:04,520
it's,

4150
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:05,201
it's a big,

4151
01:59:05,201 --> 01:59:07,170
big overgeneralization and uh,

4152
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:12,180
it's probably because dive in deep into
this stuff is it takes time and it's

4153
01:59:14,081 --> 01:59:16,720
complex and you need to understand how
some of these things are interacting and

4154
01:59:16,721 --> 01:59:17,410
working,

4155
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:17,711
you know,

4156
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:19,720
so it's much easier to be like,

4157
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:20,141
oh,

4158
01:59:20,141 --> 01:59:20,680
you read,

4159
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:21,520
you read the study,

4160
01:59:21,521 --> 01:59:22,870
the conclusions and Oh yeah,

4161
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:23,733
that's it.

4162
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:27,000
That's the thing that people love to the
love when someone can break it down and

4163
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:27,880
the clear sentence.

4164
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:32,200
Antioxidants can cause cancer while let
me get on Twitter and let everybody know

4165
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:33,250
that they're being an idiot.

4166
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:33,860
Right.

4167
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:35,200
I mean people love doing that.

4168
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:37,390
They love saying things like that.

4169
01:59:37,391 --> 01:59:38,320
That like a nice,

4170
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:39,161
clear,

4171
01:59:39,161 --> 01:59:39,994
concise,

4172
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:41,290
easy to digest.

4173
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:41,900
You know,

4174
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:42,790
a low,

4175
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:45,910
high alkaline diet kills cancer.

4176
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:46,361
Oh,

4177
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:47,051
I didn't even know.

4178
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:48,040
I'm just going fucking me.

4179
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:52,630
I don't think there was any possible
way I could boil that down into like one

4180
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:54,280
sentence didn't seem like it could.

4181
01:59:54,610 --> 01:59:59,610
Biology is very complex and trying to
oversimplify it isn't necessarily a meat.

4182
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:05,140
It doesn't necessarily mean you have a
good understanding of the complexities.

4183
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:06,610
This is certainly going to be a podcast.

4184
02:00:06,611 --> 02:00:07,690
It requires a notepad.

4185
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:09,030
Yeah.

4186
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:10,300
I have to do a lot of googling.

4187
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:10,800
Yeah.

4188
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:11,633
It's,

4189
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:12,300
you know,

4190
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:12,600
the,

4191
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,580
the whole Alpha Tocopherol
and gamma tocopherol it's,

4192
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:18,190
it's something I think is
important for people to,

4193
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,330
to understand.

4194
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:20,200
Um,

4195
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:20,891
you know,

4196
02:00:20,891 --> 02:00:23,440
it is Alpha Tocopherol is
the major supplemental form.

4197
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:28,470
And the last study I show sauce said
something about like 11% of the population

4198
02:00:28,901 --> 02:00:31,920
takes high levels of Alpha Tocopherol.

4199
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:32,831
So you know,

4200
02:00:32,831 --> 02:00:36,940
you have a certain percent of the
population that's going overboard and they

4201
02:00:36,941 --> 02:00:40,150
probably don't know about the
effects that that's going on.

4202
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:40,421
You know,

4203
02:00:40,421 --> 02:00:40,611
the,

4204
02:00:40,611 --> 02:00:42,940
the depletion of their gamma
and how that can be bad.

4205
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:46,150
So I think it is important for
those people to realize that.

4206
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:47,800
But the flip side,

4207
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:47,981
you know,

4208
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:48,940
someone like off it,

4209
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:53,920
his solution to that is he wants
to have high dose vitamins,

4210
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:58,921
FDA regulated so that people like him
who happened MD can prescribe them.

4211
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:02,140
And so that's his solution to,

4212
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,153
you know,

4213
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:05,660
high dose vitamins and yeah,

4214
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,400
it's,

4215
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,233
if you think about it,

4216
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:08,913
first of all,

4217
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:11,310
you know who's going to
define what a high dose is.

4218
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,580
Is it the RDA?

4219
02:01:12,581 --> 02:01:14,710
Because if you look at
something like vitamin D,

4220
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:15,580
You know,

4221
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:20,580
but right now the RDA for vitamin D
is like 600 Ius a day and 70% of the

4222
02:01:21,071 --> 02:01:25,030
population doesn't have enough vitamin
D and taking 600 I use a day if you're

4223
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:26,110
deficient,

4224
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:28,000
isn't going to get you
to an adequate level.

4225
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:29,350
So that's not a good level.

4226
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,880
What is a good level of vitamin D?

4227
02:01:30,881 --> 02:01:33,850
If 600 is not an accurate level,

4228
02:01:33,851 --> 02:01:34,210
what's a,

4229
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:35,200
what's an accurate level?

4230
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:35,621
So,

4231
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:35,951
you know,

4232
02:01:35,951 --> 02:01:39,380
in a couple of studies that I've read
where people that were deficient in

4233
02:01:39,381 --> 02:01:40,214
vitamin D,

4234
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:40,700
uh,

4235
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:43,520
took 4,000 Ius a day for a year.

4236
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:48,260
That was enough to get them up
to 30 nanograms per milliliter,

4237
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:49,580
which was a year.

4238
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:50,473
It took a year.

4239
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:51,260
Holy Shit.

4240
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,300
And well,

4241
02:01:52,301 --> 02:01:53,120
it takes a long,

4242
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:53,600
they,

4243
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,291
well they did.

4244
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:55,490
They measured it after a year.

4245
02:01:55,491 --> 02:01:56,360
So it,

4246
02:01:56,510 --> 02:02:00,230
it's possible if they had done
some time points maybe in between,

4247
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:01,180
uh,

4248
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:02,010
that it,

4249
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:04,450
it could have raised their
levels higher than that,

4250
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:07,940
a slow absorption into
the body or something.

4251
02:02:07,941 --> 02:02:08,091
Like,

4252
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:09,680
why would it take so long to,

4253
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:10,670
to get the levels,

4254
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:12,680
I'm not saying it's going to take a year,

4255
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,840
it's just the way the study was designed.

4256
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:16,550
They measured it a year later.

4257
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:17,180
So,

4258
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:17,480
uh,

4259
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:18,313
it's,

4260
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:18,770
you know,

4261
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:21,110
it's possible that didn't take a year,

4262
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:25,300
but the study was that they looked at
it a year later after taking a year of a

4263
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:25,971
4,000,

4264
02:02:25,971 --> 02:02:26,880
nine years day.

4265
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,270
But that was enough.

4266
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:28,520
Um,

4267
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,810
I think generally speaking,

4268
02:02:29,811 --> 02:02:30,320
you know,

4269
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:35,320
people that are supplementing between
2000 and 4,000 I use generally tend to

4270
02:02:36,171 --> 02:02:38,600
have adequate levels if
they're not severely,

4271
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:40,130
severely deficient to start with.

4272
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:41,331
If you're severely,

4273
02:02:41,331 --> 02:02:41,991
severely division,

4274
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:45,440
it can take longer to get
up to an adequate status.

4275
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:46,400
What are the other things that,

4276
02:02:46,401 --> 02:02:48,970
off it said that you didn't think were,

4277
02:02:48,971 --> 02:02:49,490
uh,

4278
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:52,310
were accurate or were problematic?

4279
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:52,821
Yeah.

4280
02:02:52,821 --> 02:02:57,821
So he also said that the data is clear
and consistent that supplemental vitamins

4281
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:00,110
don't do anything.

4282
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:02,210
There's no positive benefit from them.

4283
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,051
That's what he said,

4284
02:03:03,051 --> 02:03:04,070
no positive benefit.

4285
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:05,510
And like I said,

4286
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:06,141
to his credit,

4287
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:07,040
I haven't read his book,

4288
02:03:07,041 --> 02:03:11,330
so maybe he goes into some
specifics that I'm not aware of.

4289
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,433
However,

4290
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:17,420
to say that supplemental vitamins
have no benefit is like really,

4291
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:18,111
you know,

4292
02:03:18,111 --> 02:03:18,944
I mean they've done,

4293
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:23,030
they've even done randomized controlled
trials showing that Omega three fatty

4294
02:03:23,031 --> 02:03:27,830
acid supplementation supplementation
lowers all cause mortality.

4295
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,660
So you know,

4296
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:33,290
supplementing and he actually refers
to omega three fatty acids as an

4297
02:03:33,291 --> 02:03:34,124
antioxidant,

4298
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,720
at least in that podcast he did.

4299
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,540
So you know that that's one thing.

4300
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:39,920
Vitamin D supplements,

4301
02:03:39,921 --> 02:03:44,600
people that are supplemented with
vitamin D two 1500 ius a day.

4302
02:03:45,070 --> 02:03:45,440
Um,

4303
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,050
I don't remember how long
they did that for it,

4304
02:03:47,051 --> 02:03:48,470
but they had a 17,

4305
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:53,500
it was many years that there was a 17%
decrease in cancer cancer risk and there

4306
02:03:54,561 --> 02:03:59,561
was a 30% decrease in cancer
mortality and like a 40% decrease in,

4307
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:00,380
in camp,

4308
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:00,740
uh,

4309
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:04,580
cancers of the digestive
system including colon cancer.

4310
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:07,730
So that's one for vitamin D.

4311
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:08,563
Alycia what's another one?

4312
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:11,600
There was another study where they
looked at a multivitamin that took

4313
02:04:11,601 --> 02:04:13,640
multivitamin and a,

4314
02:04:13,641 --> 02:04:14,960
but this was not a controlled trial.

4315
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:15,793
This was,

4316
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:19,550
they did questionnaire and
found out like how many,

4317
02:04:19,551 --> 02:04:22,070
how frequently women took
multivitamins and how,

4318
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:23,690
how many times a day or how,

4319
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,250
how many days a week they took them.

4320
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:29,900
And what they found is that the ones that
took vitamins on a daily basis had the

4321
02:04:29,901 --> 02:04:31,670
longest telomeres they
measured to them or length.

4322
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:33,350
So that's another one,

4323
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:34,940
a magnesium.

4324
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:36,110
So we're talking about,

4325
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:36,944
you know,

4326
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:41,970
taking supplemental vitamins helps you
fill some of those nutritional gaps that

4327
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,200
you're not getting from your diet.

4328
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:43,790
And,

4329
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:47,250
and the reality is is that we're not
getting a lot of those vitamins and

4330
02:04:47,251 --> 02:04:47,970
minerals from our diet.

4331
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:52,050
We talked about this a little bit when
it's possible to eat a completely healthy

4332
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:54,000
diet and get everything you need,

4333
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:55,860
or do you need to supplement?

4334
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:57,061
I mean,

4335
02:04:57,061 --> 02:04:58,020
is it possible?

4336
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:58,980
Good question.

4337
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:00,533
I don't know.

4338
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,520
I mean like things like vitamin D,

4339
02:05:02,521 --> 02:05:03,610
what would you have to demean?

4340
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:07,620
I know some milk you'd half
well supple yet for vitamin D,

4341
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:12,621
You'd have to really be living in a
place that was exposed to the UBB during

4342
02:05:12,871 --> 02:05:16,800
winter and summer and you'd have to
be out in the sun for 15 minutes,

4343
02:05:16,801 --> 02:05:17,011
you know,

4344
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:18,450
cause getting it from fish,

4345
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:20,640
well maybe fish has a a good,

4346
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:21,571
good bit of it,

4347
02:05:21,571 --> 02:05:25,860
but you'd have to eat fish every day and
also to get the Omega threes you'd have

4348
02:05:25,861 --> 02:05:27,040
to eat fish like everyday.

4349
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:27,421
They don't make it.

4350
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:30,900
Three fatty acids are another big one and
you'd have to eat quite a bit of fish,

4351
02:05:30,901 --> 02:05:31,141
right.

4352
02:05:31,141 --> 02:05:31,861
In certain fish,

4353
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:32,581
like salmon,

4354
02:05:32,581 --> 02:05:32,881
salmon,

4355
02:05:32,881 --> 02:05:33,571
like fatty fish.

4356
02:05:33,571 --> 02:05:33,871
Right,

4357
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:34,321
exactly.

4358
02:05:34,321 --> 02:05:35,700
You'd have to eat like fatty fish.

4359
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:39,690
So I think it would be really difficult.

4360
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:40,860
Like I personally,

4361
02:05:40,861 --> 02:05:42,270
I tr I agree with,

4362
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,310
with Offit and uh,

4363
02:05:44,311 --> 02:05:48,180
that goofball downing in some
instances where you know,

4364
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,043
you,

4365
02:05:49,770 --> 02:05:53,790
you should try to get all
your micronutrients much
as you can from your diet.

4366
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:55,133
I agree.

4367
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:55,561
You know,

4368
02:05:55,561 --> 02:05:56,251
and you know,

4369
02:05:56,251 --> 02:05:57,060
case and point my,

4370
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:57,990
I do my smoothie.

4371
02:05:57,991 --> 02:05:58,410
I,

4372
02:05:58,410 --> 02:05:58,651
you know,

4373
02:05:58,651 --> 02:05:58,871
I,

4374
02:05:58,871 --> 02:06:01,200
I definitely try to eat
my greens and healthy,

4375
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:02,610
healthy meats and fish.

4376
02:06:02,611 --> 02:06:03,510
I really like fish,

4377
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:04,980
but I do supplement,

4378
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:05,341
you know,

4379
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:06,990
I take omega three fatty acids,

4380
02:06:06,991 --> 02:06:08,040
I take vitamin D,

4381
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:09,240
I take a Multivitamin,

4382
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,411
which has my,

4383
02:06:10,411 --> 02:06:10,680
you know,

4384
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:12,630
selenium and some of my trace elements,

4385
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:15,030
my iodine and uh,

4386
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:16,760
what else do I take a,

4387
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:17,970
I also take a B complex,

4388
02:06:17,971 --> 02:06:19,140
even though most people aren't,

4389
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,930
they don't have low levels of,

4390
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:24,360
of the B vitamins due to
like fortification and stuff.

4391
02:06:24,361 --> 02:06:27,960
Now I actually take a B complex because,

4392
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:28,260
um,

4393
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:30,060
it's really kind of interesting,

4394
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:31,420
but we are,

4395
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:33,360
our lab has shown that,

4396
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:34,620
well,

4397
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,090
it's partly shown this,

4398
02:06:36,091 --> 02:06:37,990
that as we age I,

4399
02:06:37,991 --> 02:06:42,180
I talked about how your lipid
membranes get more rigid and a lot of,

4400
02:06:42,181 --> 02:06:44,100
so this includes your
mitochondrial membranes.

4401
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,260
They get more stiff and uh,

4402
02:06:46,270 --> 02:06:47,730
over time what happens is,

4403
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:48,633
uh,

4404
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:51,540
metabolites and stuff can't
get transported as easy.

4405
02:06:51,541 --> 02:06:54,330
And also what happens
is these proteins there,

4406
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:58,140
they bind co factors like B vitamins are
really important for a lot of proteins.

4407
02:06:58,141 --> 02:07:02,010
In the Mitochondria that are necessary
for metabolism to generate ATP.

4408
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:06,030
And these proteins required B vitamins
and a lot of them are embedded in the

4409
02:07:06,031 --> 02:07:06,511
membrane.

4410
02:07:06,511 --> 02:07:07,890
So when the membrane gets stiff,

4411
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:13,220
the protein binding constant changes to
that B vitamin and it's been shown that

4412
02:07:13,441 --> 02:07:14,570
you can overcome that,

4413
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:16,200
meaning you actually can overcome that,

4414
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:16,610
uh,

4415
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:19,860
it messing up that binding constant
because it screws up the structure of the

4416
02:07:19,861 --> 02:07:22,560
protein by increasing
the level of B vitamins.

4417
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:24,560
So what level to do recommend?

4418
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:25,240
Like what,

4419
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:25,770
uh,

4420
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:26,160
what's the,

4421
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:30,300
what's The u s the Rda and what do
you think should for B vitamins?

4422
02:07:30,301 --> 02:07:30,571
You know,

4423
02:07:30,571 --> 02:07:31,404
I don't,

4424
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,470
there's no telling what
it should be there.

4425
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,320
There's just no empirical data to show,

4426
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:36,060
uh,

4427
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:39,150
how much more you would
need to a much come back.

4428
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:43,810
I have a B complex and I just can't recall
off the top of my head what all the,

4429
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:44,950
cause there's so many of the,

4430
02:07:44,951 --> 02:07:46,030
of the B vitamins.

4431
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:49,900
Do you know what the name of your B
complexes that you take right now?

4432
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:53,050
Right now I have one from vitacost,

4433
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:58,051
but I've been switching over to Swanson
brand because I spelled out Swanson like

4434
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:00,850
w a n s o n.

4435
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:01,540
There.

4436
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:02,710
They're pretty reliable.

4437
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:05,170
They've been around
for a really long time.

4438
02:08:05,171 --> 02:08:05,381
Um,

4439
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:05,620
they,

4440
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:06,820
they generally have some,

4441
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:09,610
some reliables I
supplements for Omega Three.

4442
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:10,960
I like Nordic naturals.

4443
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:11,860
Um,

4444
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:13,660
they're really good in Nordic naturals.

4445
02:08:13,661 --> 02:08:14,020
Um,

4446
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:14,501
what is,

4447
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:14,830
uh,

4448
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:15,160
what,

4449
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:16,180
that's a fish bait.

4450
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:16,901
Fish oil.

4451
02:08:16,901 --> 02:08:18,490
So there's some oils.

4452
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:19,281
Here's the,

4453
02:08:19,281 --> 02:08:19,791
here's the,

4454
02:08:19,791 --> 02:08:20,780
I'm the Swanson.

4455
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:22,420
It has [inaudible],

4456
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,000
uh,

4457
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,110
25,

4458
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:24,973
uh,

4459
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:27,320
25 milligrams of Riboflavin,

4460
02:08:27,321 --> 02:08:31,300
which is 1471% of the U.

4461
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,910
S r d a thigh Amanu Simon,

4462
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:34,460
Simon,

4463
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:35,150
Simon,

4464
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:35,751
Simon,

4465
02:08:35,751 --> 02:08:36,860
which is B one.

4466
02:08:36,861 --> 02:08:38,150
It does 25 milligrams,

4467
02:08:38,151 --> 02:08:41,720
which is 1667% of the U.

4468
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,553
S r d a,

4469
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:43,610
vitamin C.

4470
02:08:43,611 --> 02:08:45,540
It hasn't been as well in the B complex.

4471
02:08:45,541 --> 02:08:46,221
So it was vitamin C,

4472
02:08:46,221 --> 02:08:46,890
which is interesting.

4473
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:47,450
As you're saying,

4474
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:51,410
833% of the US RDA and the other big one,

4475
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:57,040
vitamin B six is 1250% and vitamin B,

4476
02:08:57,801 --> 02:09:01,380
12 2080 3% of us RDA.

4477
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:02,413
That's interesting.

4478
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:03,560
I've always found that interesting.

4479
02:09:03,561 --> 02:09:04,790
When you look at some vitamins,

4480
02:09:04,791 --> 02:09:06,290
you look at multivitamins and you know,

4481
02:09:06,291 --> 02:09:10,400
you know what the RDA is and you see
their percentages fucking off the charts.

4482
02:09:10,401 --> 02:09:10,790
Yeah.

4483
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:14,060
They have 2000% of the U Rda has be 12.

4484
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:14,993
Yeah.

4485
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:15,500
You know,

4486
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:17,400
[inaudible] is a knucklehead.

4487
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:18,691
I mean that's what they're saying.

4488
02:09:18,691 --> 02:09:19,524
And their company,

4489
02:09:19,650 --> 02:09:20,483
well look,

4490
02:09:20,730 --> 02:09:21,490
fuck them.

4491
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:22,610
In the case of item a,

4492
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:23,580
the B vitamins,

4493
02:09:23,581 --> 02:09:23,821
you know,

4494
02:09:23,821 --> 02:09:24,271
like I said,

4495
02:09:24,271 --> 02:09:25,230
most people,

4496
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:26,250
um,

4497
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:27,030
aren't,

4498
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:28,180
aren't deficient and,

4499
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,940
and they haven't really shown any
toxicity of and taking too much of these B

4500
02:09:32,941 --> 02:09:34,590
vitamins and they are water soluble.

4501
02:09:34,591 --> 02:09:35,910
So you end up duping
your being and all that.

4502
02:09:36,330 --> 02:09:37,650
I personally,

4503
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:38,450
uh,

4504
02:09:38,450 --> 02:09:40,230
I'm taking them just because I've seen,

4505
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:40,561
you know,

4506
02:09:40,561 --> 02:09:44,130
some of this data where it shows that
some of these proteins that are when

4507
02:09:44,131 --> 02:09:47,580
you're a member let your lipid biolayer
is kind of more rigid and gets screwed

4508
02:09:47,581 --> 02:09:47,741
up,

4509
02:09:47,741 --> 02:09:48,540
but you know,

4510
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:52,320
over time and also when your oxidation
does that are eating rancid fat,

4511
02:09:52,321 --> 02:09:53,154
things like that.

4512
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:53,910
Um,

4513
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:56,670
change is some of the structure of
those membrane proteins that require B

4514
02:09:56,671 --> 02:09:57,211
vitamins.

4515
02:09:57,211 --> 02:09:58,080
And like I said,

4516
02:09:58,110 --> 02:10:00,090
I don't know how much more you need there.

4517
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:02,010
It'd be cool to do a
study to figure that out,

4518
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:04,740
but it's not a dangerous one
because they're water soluble.

4519
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:05,873
It's an it ha.

4520
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:07,910
I haven't seen any data that shows it to,

4521
02:10:07,911 --> 02:10:10,740
it's a dangerous one for one because
they are water soluble and you pee them

4522
02:10:10,741 --> 02:10:11,010
out.

4523
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:13,530
What are the fat soluble ones
that we should be careful about?

4524
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:15,810
Overdosing Alpha Tocopherol is one.

4525
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:16,950
Right?

4526
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:17,520
Right.

4527
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,181
Like I said,

4528
02:10:18,181 --> 02:10:21,090
the whole interplay between
the gamma and Alpha,

4529
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:21,511
you know,

4530
02:10:21,511 --> 02:10:22,060
is uh,

4531
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:22,681
so gamma,

4532
02:10:22,681 --> 02:10:23,311
Tocopherol,

4533
02:10:23,311 --> 02:10:24,180
Alpha Tocopherol,

4534
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:24,750
all,

4535
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:25,441
all the ease.

4536
02:10:25,441 --> 02:10:26,340
Those are fat soluble,

4537
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:26,770
right?

4538
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:29,030
He also should be careful.

4539
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:30,690
Vitamin D you can,

4540
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:31,591
you know,

4541
02:10:31,591 --> 02:10:32,700
you can't take too much.

4542
02:10:32,701 --> 02:10:32,791
I,

4543
02:10:32,791 --> 02:10:33,170
you,

4544
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:34,003
if you take

4545
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:36,200
the toxicity levels that,

4546
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:41,260
that I've seen have been shown that like
10,000 Ius a day for some time that,

4547
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:43,430
anything over that,

4548
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:46,190
and actually I think it even
is quite higher than that.

4549
02:10:46,191 --> 02:10:47,960
But that's the limit of toxicity.

4550
02:10:48,190 --> 02:10:53,190
What about a mega threes and Omega
threes in plant based form versus in fish

4551
02:10:54,371 --> 02:10:55,180
form?

4552
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:56,013
Great question.

4553
02:10:56,620 --> 02:10:58,630
So if you look at the,

4554
02:10:58,631 --> 02:10:58,900
uh,

4555
02:10:58,900 --> 02:10:59,870
so meg us,

4556
02:10:59,910 --> 02:11:00,670
there's three,

4557
02:11:00,670 --> 02:11:01,690
there's EPA,

4558
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:03,760
there's Dha and Ala.

4559
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:09,210
So the major plant form like flaxseed
oil or flax seed walnuts for example,

4560
02:11:11,590 --> 02:11:13,060
have Ala.

4561
02:11:13,630 --> 02:11:14,051
Okay.

4562
02:11:14,051 --> 02:11:14,830
And that's,

4563
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:17,230
they don't have EPA or Dha.

4564
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:22,680
Now you can convert a very small
percentage of a l a l a n to the EPA,

4565
02:11:23,591 --> 02:11:26,530
but it's like 5% of it.

4566
02:11:26,830 --> 02:11:28,840
It's very inefficient conversion.

4567
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:29,800
Um,

4568
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:32,800
and women may be able to do a
little bit better of a conversion.

4569
02:11:32,801 --> 02:11:34,480
I can't recall off the top of
my head what their number was.

4570
02:11:34,481 --> 02:11:36,430
But the point is is that um,

4571
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:42,280
if your only source of Omega
three is flax or you know,

4572
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:43,143
walnuts,

4573
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:45,070
you're not getting your Dha,

4574
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,180
you hear that vegans.

4575
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:46,750
Yeah,

4576
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:48,550
that's really I the vegans.

4577
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,050
If you're a Vegan,

4578
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:53,650
really I just micro algae oil.

4579
02:11:53,651 --> 02:11:55,780
I mean the phytoplankton are essentially,

4580
02:11:55,781 --> 02:11:57,430
or what making these
Omega three is to fish,

4581
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:01,420
eat the phytoplankton and gets
contract and fat micro algae oil.

4582
02:12:01,690 --> 02:12:03,670
I recommend for people
that are vegetarian,

4583
02:12:03,671 --> 02:12:04,180
Vegan,

4584
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,830
Michael algae oil and,

4585
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:10,950
but when you're eating micro algae oil
[inaudible] totally constitutes Vegan.

4586
02:12:11,291 --> 02:12:13,720
Is there any sort of animal
protein and micro algae oil?

4587
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:14,600
I guess your,

4588
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:15,170
you know,

4589
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:19,580
well they're phyto plankton so if you're
vegan based off of philosophy where you

4590
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:21,740
don't want to eat like
any type of creature.

4591
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,613
Yeah,

4592
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:24,110
phytoplankton is Fido creature.

4593
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:24,831
It is,

4594
02:12:24,831 --> 02:12:27,450
it's kind of a great teacher.

4595
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:29,060
But so that,

4596
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:30,320
I guess that could be a problem.

4597
02:12:30,321 --> 02:12:31,490
But if you are doing,

4598
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:36,500
if you're a vegetarian or Vegan for
health purposes and there's not like a

4599
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:39,120
philosophical component where you know,

4600
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,750
you have a problem with
eating the spider plankton,

4601
02:12:41,751 --> 02:12:42,260
then

4602
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:44,710
well shamine vegans shouldn't avoid.

4603
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:45,170
Uh,

4604
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:47,330
I mean there's certain
probiotics that are,

4605
02:12:47,331 --> 02:12:47,511
I mean,

4606
02:12:47,511 --> 02:12:48,490
that's a creature to

4607
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:50,383
true

4608
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,483
living life.

4609
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:53,630
Yeah,

4610
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:53,800
no,

4611
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:54,411
that's a good point.

4612
02:12:54,411 --> 02:12:54,910
I don't know.

4613
02:12:54,910 --> 02:12:55,700
But they move,

4614
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:56,181
I mean they're,

4615
02:12:56,181 --> 02:12:57,080
they're active,

4616
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:58,370
they're active.

4617
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:59,320
They are absolutely.

4618
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:00,620
Just because you can't see them.

4619
02:13:00,650 --> 02:13:01,011
I mean you're,

4620
02:13:01,011 --> 02:13:03,260
you're basically in little
tiny turtles or something,

4621
02:13:03,650 --> 02:13:04,483
you know,

4622
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:05,270
whatever.

4623
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:07,400
So the little moving thing,

4624
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:07,940
right.

4625
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:08,331
You know,

4626
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:10,340
I don't know what the philosophy,

4627
02:13:10,341 --> 02:13:13,940
because I don't have a lot
of Vegan friends and it's
really no cut those people

4628
02:13:13,941 --> 02:13:14,750
out of your life.

4629
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:15,583
It's very important.

4630
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:16,700
[inaudible] against them.

4631
02:13:16,701 --> 02:13:17,280
I just,

4632
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:17,500
you know,

4633
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,600
either by like fucking with them.

4634
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:20,360
So,

4635
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:21,111
but the Omega three,

4636
02:13:21,111 --> 02:13:23,720
Dha and EPA are really important.

4637
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:24,561
They're really,

4638
02:13:24,561 --> 02:13:25,281
really important.

4639
02:13:25,281 --> 02:13:26,120
And so you asked,

4640
02:13:26,121 --> 02:13:27,440
can you take too much?

4641
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:28,520
I mean for one,

4642
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:29,630
you know,

4643
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:30,830
EPA is a very,

4644
02:13:30,831 --> 02:13:31,830
it's got a very

4645
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,900
potent anti inflammatory effect,

4646
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,100
which is you know,

4647
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:37,260
important for a variety
of different mechanisms.

4648
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:37,561
You know,

4649
02:13:37,561 --> 02:13:38,430
inflammation,

4650
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:43,020
chronic inflammation over time can lead
to a lot of age related diseases and Dha

4651
02:13:43,021 --> 02:13:44,730
as we I think even discussed last time,

4652
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:48,420
it's a really important
component of your cell membranes,

4653
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,710
particularly in the brain,

4654
02:13:49,711 --> 02:13:50,730
like 40% of it.

4655
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:52,820
So I took a lot of,

4656
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:53,843
I take a lot,

4657
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:55,750
I speak a lot to how much she took a day.

4658
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,700
So well it depends.

4659
02:13:56,701 --> 02:13:57,534
So you have to look,

4660
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:58,110
okay,

4661
02:13:58,110 --> 02:14:02,940
you got your fish oil container and on
the front it says like 1000 milligrams or

4662
02:14:02,941 --> 02:14:05,160
of mine says 2,120 or something.

4663
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:08,220
And then you turn around in the
back and you look at the break,

4664
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:09,083
the breakdown.

4665
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:09,600
Okay,

4666
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:10,291
how much EPA,

4667
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:11,090
how much DPA,

4668
02:14:11,090 --> 02:14:11,731
a Dha.

4669
02:14:11,731 --> 02:14:13,470
And then there's other fish oils mixed.

4670
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:18,770
So on my container it says like
200 or 2,100 and something.

4671
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:19,890
And I turned on the back,

4672
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:24,000
it's got 800 milligrams of
EPA and 600 milligrams of Dha.

4673
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:24,931
So,

4674
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:26,100
and then all the rest is just fish oil,

4675
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:27,060
fish oil stuff.

4676
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:31,830
So I actually calculate how much
I take based on those components,

4677
02:14:31,831 --> 02:14:33,810
the EPA and Dha because that's important.

4678
02:14:33,930 --> 02:14:34,980
That's what's important to me.

4679
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:39,840
So I take about six pills of
those a day and a serving size,

4680
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,190
I guess a serving size is two.

4681
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:44,730
So a little bit more than that.

4682
02:14:44,731 --> 02:14:46,860
I took 10 10 pills.

4683
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:48,000
Okay.

4684
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,780
And you're,

4685
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:49,411
that's pretty cool.

4686
02:14:49,411 --> 02:14:49,891
I've done that.

4687
02:14:49,891 --> 02:14:52,290
I mean I've done that in the past.

4688
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:58,090
It has a big impact on joint
health has a big impact for uh,

4689
02:14:58,650 --> 02:14:59,580
for grapplers,

4690
02:14:59,581 --> 02:15:00,270
for Jujitsu,

4691
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:05,270
people are always getting sore knees
and elbows is a big issue and even sore

4692
02:15:05,911 --> 02:15:08,370
backs and it has a huge impact on that.

4693
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,320
The antiinflammatories absolutely,

4694
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:11,280
absolutely.

4695
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:12,690
What is the anti inflammatory,

4696
02:15:12,691 --> 02:15:13,950
what does the actual mechanism,

4697
02:15:13,951 --> 02:15:16,350
the anti inflammatory
mechanism involved in fish oil?

4698
02:15:16,351 --> 02:15:17,460
So the,

4699
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:20,160
the EPA is the major part.

4700
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:22,050
So you can actually by EPA,

4701
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:22,650
like just,

4702
02:15:22,650 --> 02:15:23,250
you know,

4703
02:15:23,250 --> 02:15:23,761
there's,

4704
02:15:23,761 --> 02:15:24,690
there's companies that will sell.

4705
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:28,260
If you're really just looking at the
anti inflammatory part of the fish oil,

4706
02:15:28,261 --> 02:15:29,280
you can buy EPA.

4707
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:30,720
It's a little more expensive.

4708
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:35,700
But what it does is it inhibits
that whole [inaudible] acid pathway,

4709
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:38,250
which produces prostoglandins.

4710
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,330
So it's like,

4711
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:40,690
it's like upstream where it's,

4712
02:15:40,691 --> 02:15:44,220
it's inhibiting the production
of [inaudible] acid and
then prostoglandins which

4713
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,231
activate Cox.

4714
02:15:45,231 --> 02:15:45,480
It like,

4715
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:45,601
Oh,

4716
02:15:45,601 --> 02:15:45,811
you know,

4717
02:15:45,811 --> 02:15:49,230
you've got this whole cascade
of inflammation going on.

4718
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:50,370
It plays a major role,

4719
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:50,970
not,

4720
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:54,180
and there's probably other
mechanisms I haven't even read about,

4721
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:55,140
you know,

4722
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:56,460
other things going on as well.

4723
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:57,463
Uh,

4724
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:57,901
that I,

4725
02:15:57,901 --> 02:15:58,920
I'm not even sure,

4726
02:15:58,980 --> 02:15:59,191
you know,

4727
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:00,080
feedback mechanisms,

4728
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:00,923
stuff like that.

4729
02:16:01,170 --> 02:16:03,480
But that's the major way that EPA does.

4730
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:08,600
And they've been shown that like taking
two grams of EPA a day can lower it can

4731
02:16:09,091 --> 02:16:11,430
like reduce your c
reactive protein levels.

4732
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:12,571
Oh Gosh.

4733
02:16:12,571 --> 02:16:15,750
I don't remember the exact
amount by how much it was,

4734
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:17,310
but it was pretty
significant where it's like,

4735
02:16:17,311 --> 02:16:17,941
it really,

4736
02:16:17,941 --> 02:16:18,541
you can measure,

4737
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:20,100
it lowers inflammation system,

4738
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:21,690
like systemic inflammation.

4739
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,490
How many thousand milligrams or a gram,

4740
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:25,290
you just said it.

4741
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:27,270
1000 milligrams are in one gram,

4742
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:28,760
2000 milligrams.

4743
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:29,613
Two grams.

4744
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:30,370
Yeah.

4745
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,370
Why don't they just call a gram?

4746
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:31,780
Well,

4747
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:33,140
they have to call it no room.

4748
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:35,090
I usually can get to a thousand.

4749
02:16:35,930 --> 02:16:36,761
It's much easier.

4750
02:16:36,761 --> 02:16:37,060
Yeah,

4751
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:38,100
it's quite confusing to me.

4752
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:43,570
Maybe because people aren't aware of
the whole metric system and stuff.

4753
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:45,430
So if they see two grams,

4754
02:16:45,431 --> 02:16:45,671
you're like,

4755
02:16:45,671 --> 02:16:45,801
oh,

4756
02:16:45,801 --> 02:16:46,634
well that's nothing.

4757
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:47,913
That's just too,

4758
02:16:47,970 --> 02:16:48,110
well,

4759
02:16:48,110 --> 02:16:48,420
we've,

4760
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:52,150
people get confused because we go ounces
all the time with so many different

4761
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:52,984
things.

4762
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:53,800
Why we,

4763
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:57,130
I don't understand why we use
the metric system in some cases.

4764
02:16:57,131 --> 02:17:00,220
In some cases we don't at all leaders.

4765
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:00,401
Oh,

4766
02:17:00,401 --> 02:17:01,001
it's a leader.

4767
02:17:01,001 --> 02:17:03,030
Well how many courses in their own fuck?

4768
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:03,873
I don't know.

4769
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:06,460
He could look Pfizer court in the leader.

4770
02:17:06,461 --> 02:17:07,690
What are you doing to me here?

4771
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:08,050
Well,

4772
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,100
in the lab we do everything.

4773
02:17:09,101 --> 02:17:10,020
Milliliter liter.

4774
02:17:10,021 --> 02:17:10,371
I mean,

4775
02:17:10,371 --> 02:17:11,230
so gallons.

4776
02:17:11,231 --> 02:17:12,220
When you go to the gas station,

4777
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,200
I don't even see that.

4778
02:17:14,380 --> 02:17:15,280
I always have to Google.

4779
02:17:15,281 --> 02:17:17,530
How many inches will try to fucking,

4780
02:17:17,531 --> 02:17:19,000
I'm night 90 centimeters.

4781
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:21,400
What the fuck is 96 how tall is that?

4782
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:23,080
I don't even know.

4783
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:23,801
You know what I mean?

4784
02:17:23,801 --> 02:17:26,560
If someone tried to get
someone's height in centimeters.

4785
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:28,870
So is your fish oil that you take,

4786
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:31,240
is it both EPA and Dha?

4787
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:32,380
That's a good question.

4788
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,430
I take this Carlson's Carlson,

4789
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:38,620
do you take the lemon flavored one in
the bottle or do you take them in pills?

4790
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:39,430
I take both.

4791
02:17:39,430 --> 02:17:40,510
I bring the pills with me.

4792
02:17:40,511 --> 02:17:41,291
When I go on the road,

4793
02:17:41,291 --> 02:17:42,700
I took the lemon and the bottle at home.

4794
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:43,540
Okay.

4795
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:43,721
Yeah.

4796
02:17:43,721 --> 02:17:43,990
There,

4797
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:47,920
there is something to be aware of with
the omega three fatty acids and that's

4798
02:17:47,921 --> 02:17:50,050
because they're poly
unsaturated fatty acids.

4799
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:51,880
They're very prone to oxidation.

4800
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:53,980
So keeping them at four degree,

4801
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:55,090
well keeping them in the fridge,

4802
02:17:55,091 --> 02:17:55,924
sorry,

4803
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:57,813
lowers that,

4804
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:01,000
that oxidation process
and also just smelling it,

4805
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:01,960
take,

4806
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,380
take a sniff of it and make sure it's
not rancid smelling when you're taking,

4807
02:18:05,410 --> 02:18:07,360
when you're taking it
because that's the one thing.

4808
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:08,530
Um,

4809
02:18:08,530 --> 02:18:10,000
with the omega three fatty acids.

4810
02:18:10,001 --> 02:18:10,510
And like I said,

4811
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:13,360
I take a lot of omega three fatty acids
and I think they're really important.

4812
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:16,690
But I think it's important to be
aware that they can go rancid and,

4813
02:18:16,870 --> 02:18:18,130
and if it go ranted,

4814
02:18:18,131 --> 02:18:20,590
consuming them can be not as good.

4815
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:23,230
And when you leave them in the frigerator,

4816
02:18:23,231 --> 02:18:25,450
how long is it good for when
you crack open that bottle?

4817
02:18:25,451 --> 02:18:27,400
I've always given it a two week window.

4818
02:18:27,970 --> 02:18:29,410
If I don't drink it in two weeks,

4819
02:18:29,411 --> 02:18:31,990
I throw it out is that
I don't use the bottle,

4820
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:32,570
uh,

4821
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:33,131
any more.

4822
02:18:33,131 --> 02:18:37,000
But the bottle is more pro
is more open to be oxygen.

4823
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:38,680
So that is one thing to be aware of with,

4824
02:18:38,770 --> 02:18:39,371
with the bottle.

4825
02:18:39,371 --> 02:18:40,450
And that was what the pills,

4826
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:43,720
that was something that I think that
was part of the reason why I switched to

4827
02:18:43,721 --> 02:18:43,871
it.

4828
02:18:43,871 --> 02:18:47,140
That and I think I got really
sick of that lemon flavor.

4829
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:47,951
It gets kind of fun.

4830
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:48,784
It's kind of much,

4831
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:49,091
yeah.

4832
02:18:49,091 --> 02:18:52,690
So it's easier to just not taste
anything and you swallow the pills,

4833
02:18:52,691 --> 02:18:54,520
but then you're dealing
with the gelatin as well.

4834
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:56,410
It's still too spot.

4835
02:18:56,710 --> 02:19:00,040
I haven't convinced myself
that it's doing my charm,

4836
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:00,701
but who knows.

4837
02:19:00,701 --> 02:19:00,910
Maybe I,

4838
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:02,080
maybe I haven't dug deep enough.

4839
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:03,160
What about Krill oil?

4840
02:19:03,161 --> 02:19:04,420
How do you feel about crude oil?

4841
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:05,140
Um,

4842
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:06,670
I haven't really done much,

4843
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:08,380
much reading on the Krill is that,

4844
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:11,170
that has vitamin A as
well or that's caught.

4845
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:12,880
I'm thinking I'm conflating cod.

4846
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:16,130
Cod liver oil was the one that they
always gave us when we're kids.

4847
02:19:16,131 --> 02:19:16,964
And everybody was like,

4848
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:19,240
get that away from tried it.

4849
02:19:19,241 --> 02:19:20,260
Like the taste.

4850
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:22,080
I think I've had a pill
and I couldn't really tell.

4851
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:23,740
I actually think I have crude oil here.

4852
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,130
Hold on.

4853
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:24,430
Sorry.

4854
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:25,263
Let me hold.

4855
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:28,641
Yeah.

4856
02:19:28,641 --> 02:19:28,930
But uh,

4857
02:19:28,930 --> 02:19:29,271
you know,

4858
02:19:29,271 --> 02:19:29,900
taking,

4859
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:32,900
taking the Omega three and just popping
it open every once in a while and

4860
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:35,000
smelling it is a good idea.

4861
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:38,090
I recommend doing that because you can
smell what rancid fats smells like.

4862
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:39,960
So that's what I like to do.

4863
02:19:39,961 --> 02:19:43,520
And every once in a while I'll just grab
my Omega three pill out of the fridge

4864
02:19:43,521 --> 02:19:44,960
and take some scissors,

4865
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:46,130
cut it open and smell it.

4866
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:46,610
And a,

4867
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:47,510
if it doesn't smell rancid,

4868
02:19:47,511 --> 02:19:48,230
that's still good.

4869
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:48,411
Yeah,

4870
02:19:48,411 --> 02:19:51,410
I've got some krill telling him about that

4871
02:19:53,350 --> 02:19:54,183
is um,

4872
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:57,410
well krill oil,

4873
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:00,750
I don't know what's supposed to be
the benefit of Krill oil over here.

4874
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:05,090
Fish oils have a lot of Dha or EPA on it.

4875
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:06,103
No,

4876
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:11,110
I mean it says 75 milligrams of Dha and
130 milligrams of EPA and that's too

4877
02:20:12,801 --> 02:20:13,820
soft gel servings.

4878
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:17,660
So you think that fish oil
is probably a better choice.

4879
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:19,090
Thanks oil.

4880
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:19,810
Okay.

4881
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:20,643
Well,

4882
02:20:21,010 --> 02:20:21,910
I don't know if there's,

4883
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:23,500
there's also one gram of Krill oil,

4884
02:20:23,501 --> 02:20:24,970
so it says one gram of Krill oil.

4885
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:27,670
Maybe there's something in there
I'm not aware of because I really,

4886
02:20:27,671 --> 02:20:29,660
I just haven't done a lot of research on,

4887
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:32,320
but I'm looking at the
Dha and EPA specifically.

4888
02:20:32,321 --> 02:20:35,590
If you're taking this to get Dha and EPA,

4889
02:20:35,980 --> 02:20:39,640
I would say this is
not a very high amount.

4890
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:44,000
So you think that if there is
something good about Krill oil,

4891
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:45,830
you should probably,

4892
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:46,540
what lessons?

4893
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:49,910
Why is it this thing's Krill oil
radically better than fish oil.

4894
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:51,813
Hmm.

4895
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:53,770
Blood sugar regulator.

4896
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:55,060
I don't know anything about it,

4897
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:55,781
unfortunately.

4898
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:57,180
There's some other reasons.

4899
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:58,350
Maybe there's something else.

4900
02:20:58,351 --> 02:20:58,561
Yeah.

4901
02:20:58,561 --> 02:20:59,221
Like I said,

4902
02:20:59,221 --> 02:20:59,541
I'm,

4903
02:20:59,541 --> 02:21:00,530
I'm completely ignorant on

4904
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:01,521
here.

4905
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:02,091
On this website.

4906
02:21:02,091 --> 02:21:06,740
Krill oil actually influences your
metabolism and a jeans to improve.

4907
02:21:06,741 --> 02:21:11,150
The reference study found that although
both fish oil and Krill oil contain

4908
02:21:11,151 --> 02:21:12,110
Omega threes,

4909
02:21:12,111 --> 02:21:15,200
they differ greatly in
how they affected genes.

4910
02:21:15,201 --> 02:21:16,640
Controlling your metabolism,

4911
02:21:16,641 --> 02:21:19,400
Krill oil enhances glucose
metabolism in your liver,

4912
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:21,080
whereas fish oil does not.

4913
02:21:21,490 --> 02:21:25,550
A krill oil promotes lipid
metabolism or as fish oil does.

4914
02:21:25,551 --> 02:21:26,000
Dot.

4915
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,480
Krill oil helps regulate the
mitochondrial respiratory chain,

4916
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:30,500
whereas fish oil does.

4917
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,790
So Dha does do those things.

4918
02:21:32,791 --> 02:21:34,080
So when they're saying fish oil,

4919
02:21:34,930 --> 02:21:35,491
what are they talking?

4920
02:21:35,491 --> 02:21:36,300
They're talking shit.

4921
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:36,601
Well,

4922
02:21:36,601 --> 02:21:37,230
I'm not sure.

4923
02:21:37,230 --> 02:21:38,063
I'm not sure.

4924
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:40,110
I'm not sure I'm following.

4925
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:45,200
I'm not either because Dha does regulate
lipid lipid metabolism and also,

4926
02:21:47,131 --> 02:21:47,810
so let's,

4927
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:51,510
so Dha and EPA in addition to to,

4928
02:21:51,511 --> 02:21:52,150
um,

4929
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,470
the,

4930
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:55,130
the anti inflammatory effects
of EPA and in addition to the,

4931
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:55,801
the lip,

4932
02:21:55,801 --> 02:21:57,060
a lipid membrane,

4933
02:21:57,061 --> 02:21:57,894
part of the Dha,

4934
02:21:58,170 --> 02:22:02,400
these fatty acid molecules are signaling
molecules that actually bind to

4935
02:22:02,401 --> 02:22:02,920
different,

4936
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:03,753
uh,

4937
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:07,770
DNA regions in your
gene and activate them.

4938
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:09,600
A much like vitamin D does.

4939
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:12,090
And Dha and EPA do this.

4940
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:13,900
So Dha can,

4941
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:15,000
can activate genes.

4942
02:22:15,001 --> 02:22:15,834
So you know,

4943
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:16,861
if they're talking about,

4944
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:19,740
and they've been shown to activate
mitochondrial metabolism genes.

4945
02:22:20,010 --> 02:22:23,280
So when they say Krill
oil and fish oil does not,

4946
02:22:23,281 --> 02:22:23,670
they're just,

4947
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:24,840
it doesn't make any sense to me.

4948
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:25,920
You have to be specific.

4949
02:22:25,921 --> 02:22:26,671
What is it you're talking,

4950
02:22:26,671 --> 02:22:28,440
are you talking about
Dha because they're in,

4951
02:22:28,441 --> 02:22:30,780
but you know what else is there?

4952
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:31,241
Yeah.

4953
02:22:31,241 --> 02:22:32,620
This is an article from Mercola.

4954
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:34,540
Is that a good website?

4955
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:35,530
You know,

4956
02:22:35,530 --> 02:22:38,260
Mercola is a hit or miss.

4957
02:22:38,261 --> 02:22:39,550
I think he does have a lot of good.

4958
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:41,560
Every once in a while there's something,

4959
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:42,910
you know,

4960
02:22:42,910 --> 02:22:43,870
it's both.

4961
02:22:44,090 --> 02:22:47,290
I haven't spend a lot of
time reading his stuff.

4962
02:22:47,740 --> 02:22:48,573
Um,

4963
02:22:49,060 --> 02:22:50,440
but I do think he does.

4964
02:22:50,441 --> 02:22:51,940
He does have some good information,

4965
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:53,223
but

4966
02:22:53,470 --> 02:22:55,070
doesn't sound like Krill oils bath.

4967
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:59,470
But it does seem like fish oil is
probably more beneficial or pro.

4968
02:22:59,770 --> 02:22:59,921
Well,

4969
02:22:59,921 --> 02:23:00,754
there's other things in here.

4970
02:23:00,770 --> 02:23:01,603
What's in it?

4971
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:02,000
Yeah,

4972
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,460
so the point is you have to be specific.

4973
02:23:04,461 --> 02:23:05,780
If you're saying just krill oil,

4974
02:23:05,781 --> 02:23:06,350
well,

4975
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:09,920
you talking about other things in the
Krill oil because if we're talking about

4976
02:23:09,921 --> 02:23:11,990
gene activation to DPA and Dha,

4977
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:13,280
Dha is doing that.

4978
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,100
Dee Dee Dha is activating genes.

4979
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:16,581
You know,

4980
02:23:16,581 --> 02:23:16,850
it's,

4981
02:23:16,850 --> 02:23:17,150
that's,

4982
02:23:17,150 --> 02:23:20,200
that's what it's doing in addition to
what it's doing for your [inaudible].

4983
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:20,491
Yeah.

4984
02:23:20,491 --> 02:23:22,830
This is so confusing after
reading what you said,

4985
02:23:22,831 --> 02:23:24,990
because it's saying some studies
have shown the Krill oil,

4986
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:28,080
Krill oil may be 48 times
more potent than fish oil.

4987
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:33,150
It means you will need far less of it
than fish oil is confirmed by a 2011 study

4988
02:23:33,151 --> 02:23:33,510
for it.

4989
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:34,740
48 times more potent.

4990
02:23:34,741 --> 02:23:35,574
In what sense?

4991
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,250
Yeah.

4992
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:38,140
What are we talking
about in the Krill oil?

4993
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:39,400
I just don't understand.

4994
02:23:40,990 --> 02:23:42,100
That's the problem.

4995
02:23:42,101 --> 02:23:43,600
And people have mortgages,

4996
02:23:43,601 --> 02:23:44,770
they have jobs,

4997
02:23:44,771 --> 02:23:45,670
they have children,

4998
02:23:45,671 --> 02:23:46,870
they have dogs to feed,

4999
02:23:46,871 --> 02:23:48,070
they have a plant water.

5000
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:50,530
They don't fuck and time
to get into all this stuff.

5001
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:52,181
You know,

5002
02:23:52,181 --> 02:23:52,630
it's,

5003
02:23:52,630 --> 02:23:53,710
I feel bad for people.

5004
02:23:53,711 --> 02:23:55,090
I mean it's hard enough for me.

5005
02:23:55,091 --> 02:23:56,770
You're a person who is talking about,

5006
02:23:56,890 --> 02:23:57,291
I mean,

5007
02:23:57,291 --> 02:23:57,491
no,

5008
02:23:57,491 --> 02:23:59,440
it's cause it's craziness.

5009
02:23:59,470 --> 02:24:00,370
It's craziness.

5010
02:24:00,371 --> 02:24:02,800
And the reality is
understanding mechanism.

5011
02:24:02,801 --> 02:24:03,401
Like what I'm saying,

5012
02:24:03,401 --> 02:24:06,340
mechanism I'm talking
about Dha can activate,

5013
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:07,203
you know,

5014
02:24:07,390 --> 02:24:09,140
promoters and certain genes to,

5015
02:24:09,141 --> 02:24:12,610
to increase the expression
of mitochondrial metabolism
genes that's been shown.

5016
02:24:12,970 --> 02:24:13,930
And uh,

5017
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:16,050
so when you say Krill oil is better,

5018
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:16,930
can do that in fish oil.

5019
02:24:16,931 --> 02:24:17,201
Can't,

5020
02:24:17,201 --> 02:24:18,310
that makes no sense to me.

5021
02:24:18,610 --> 02:24:21,940
You need to tell me what specifically
is and the Krill oil that's not in fish

5022
02:24:21,941 --> 02:24:23,350
oil out because you know,

5023
02:24:23,351 --> 02:24:25,210
Dha and EPA are in fish oil.

5024
02:24:25,390 --> 02:24:25,900
Right?

5025
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:28,420
Are we talking about a
concentration dependent thing?

5026
02:24:28,421 --> 02:24:28,721
I mean,

5027
02:24:28,721 --> 02:24:31,000
is there a more Dha and EPA in Krill oil?

5028
02:24:31,001 --> 02:24:32,350
I don't know actually.

5029
02:24:33,820 --> 02:24:34,181
Yeah,

5030
02:24:34,181 --> 02:24:34,900
I don't,

5031
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:35,640
yeah,

5032
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:39,160
I think this is something that's
going to have to be really studied in,

5033
02:24:39,161 --> 02:24:41,020
in length and a,

5034
02:24:41,060 --> 02:24:42,580
I would love to see you,

5035
02:24:42,590 --> 02:24:42,950
uh,

5036
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:44,890
dive into all these claims,

5037
02:24:44,891 --> 02:24:48,700
but there's quite a few claims online
about the benefits of crow oil over fish

5038
02:24:48,701 --> 02:24:49,510
oil,

5039
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:50,250
but it doesn't,

5040
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:50,870
it the,

5041
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:52,060
one of the things that st quote,

5042
02:24:52,061 --> 02:24:55,210
cool oil contains asset tax.

5043
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:55,690
Ooh,

5044
02:24:55,690 --> 02:24:56,380
boy.

5045
02:24:56,380 --> 02:24:58,510

02:25:09,071 --> 02:25:09,401
that's,

5070
02:25:09,401 --> 02:25:09,671
that's,

5071
02:25:09,671 --> 02:25:10,504
that's a mouthful.

5072
02:25:11,150 --> 02:25:11,983
Tax.

5073
02:25:12,830 --> 02:25:13,310
The,

5074
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:18,310
a unique marine sourced flavonoid that
creates a special bond with the EPA and

5075
02:25:19,031 --> 02:25:19,601
Dha,

5076
02:25:19,601 --> 02:25:22,630
which allows direct metabolism
of the antioxidants,

5077
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:24,850
make them more bioavailable.

5078
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:25,713
Does that make sense?

5079
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:27,123
No.

5080
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:28,360
Does that sound like Malarkey?

5081
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:31,091
Possibly.

5082
02:25:31,091 --> 02:25:31,930
It doesn't make sense.

5083
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:33,900
Yeah,

5084
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:34,733
they did that.

5085
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:35,770
It really is the issue,

5086
02:25:35,771 --> 02:25:36,131
isn't it?

5087
02:25:36,131 --> 02:25:39,100
There's just so much
to try to sift through,

5088
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:43,810
find out how to separate the wheat
from the chaff I was at where it's,

5089
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:44,680
yeah.

5090
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,071
With,

5091
02:25:45,071 --> 02:25:46,930
with the Dha and EPA,

5092
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:51,490
some really important thing
in my opinion is getting it,

5093
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,443
getting it up a bit,

5094
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:53,051
like getting,

5095
02:25:53,051 --> 02:25:53,261
you know,

5096
02:25:53,261 --> 02:25:54,094
taking,

5097
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,090
taking the good bed of,

5098
02:25:55,091 --> 02:25:58,720
of Dha and EPA because most people aren't
getting any of it and all this other

5099
02:25:58,721 --> 02:25:59,310
stuff.

5100
02:25:59,310 --> 02:26:00,180
Um,

5101
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:03,730
I'm just not sure how significant it is.

5102
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:07,120
Maybe it does increase
bioavailability of a little bit.

5103
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:07,870
I don't,

5104
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:09,790
I don't know if it really
makes a big difference.

5105
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:11,103
Uh,

5106
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:12,070
so,

5107
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:16,240
so for the folks that are taking the gear
or they're getting their omega threes

5108
02:26:16,470 --> 02:26:19,570
s just completely from a plant source,

5109
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:21,340
what can they do,

5110
02:26:21,341 --> 02:26:23,530
if anything to try to,

5111
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:25,720
I really think the micro
algae oil is the best.

5112
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:26,380
I mean,

5113
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:26,890
I would,

5114
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:28,870
I would recommend taking the fish oil,

5115
02:26:28,871 --> 02:26:30,280
but I guess they won't do that.

5116
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:32,320
Some cases vegetarians won't do that.

5117
02:26:32,730 --> 02:26:33,280
Um,

5118
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:37,000
so the micro algae oil is the
next best thing in my opinion.

5119
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:38,343
Um,

5120
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:39,881
and like I said,

5121
02:26:39,881 --> 02:26:41,830
I don't really know much
about about the Krill oil,

5122
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:43,810
but I do know that these Dha,

5123
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:46,050
Dha is very important as is EPA.

5124
02:26:46,670 --> 02:26:47,560
So you know,

5125
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:49,270
a variety of different reasons.

5126
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:49,721
Well,

5127
02:26:49,721 --> 02:26:53,040
I'm going to send you
some of these studies on,

5128
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:54,520
on the Krill oil to see if you,

5129
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:58,060
unless you get bored reading
it and you can't do it.

5130
02:26:58,210 --> 02:26:59,043
It's,

5131
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:00,041
there's just,

5132
02:27:00,041 --> 02:27:03,040
it seems like it's just such a boy,

5133
02:27:03,041 --> 02:27:03,850
it's such a mess.

5134
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:04,280
It's such a,

5135
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:09,280
there's so many different supplements
then just going into all the contradictory

5136
02:27:09,430 --> 02:27:10,031
arguments,

5137
02:27:10,031 --> 02:27:12,490
the back and forth about
all these different ones.

5138
02:27:12,491 --> 02:27:14,080
It can be incredibly taxing.

5139
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:15,040
What's the,

5140
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,290
I mean your website is a
great resource or this,

5141
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:18,000
um,

5142
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:18,260
if,

5143
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:22,960
if people want to go to found my
fitness.com and try to figure out what,

5144
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:26,320
what you've already sort of
described and your verde explained,

5145
02:27:26,321 --> 02:27:28,030
but how does a person start?

5146
02:27:28,170 --> 02:27:33,170
I think a really good resource that I
like is the Linus Pauling Institute.

5147
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:36,970
So if you got the Linus Pauling Institute,

5148
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,940
they are pretty good about writing a very,

5149
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:45,010
it's a scientific research institute
that's associated with Oregon Health

5150
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:47,890
University or Oregon State and
health university isn't like that,

5151
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:48,790
but um,

5152
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:49,623
they,

5153
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:50,441
they,

5154
02:27:50,441 --> 02:27:50,681
uh,

5155
02:27:50,681 --> 02:27:55,490
do a very balanced review on a variety
of different supplemental vitamins and

5156
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:58,760
vitamins and minerals and
essential fatty acids and uh,

5157
02:27:59,200 --> 02:27:59,491
that,

5158
02:27:59,491 --> 02:28:00,970
that they give you both sides.

5159
02:28:00,971 --> 02:28:02,560
And now if they go into the Krill,

5160
02:28:02,561 --> 02:28:04,360
they sometimes they'll
go into things like that.

5161
02:28:04,361 --> 02:28:04,600
And um,

5162
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:06,520
but generally speaking,

5163
02:28:06,550 --> 02:28:09,130
I really like Alliance Pauling Institute.

5164
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,110
It's good.

5165
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:12,100
It's a good resource.

5166
02:28:12,330 --> 02:28:16,510
If are there places where
someone can go where they can,

5167
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:16,811
you know,

5168
02:28:16,811 --> 02:28:18,340
like say like you're just,

5169
02:28:18,341 --> 02:28:20,020
you're not sure what you need.

5170
02:28:20,021 --> 02:28:22,010
Like we were talking about various

5171
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:25,170
levels of vitamins and
getting them tested.

5172
02:28:25,171 --> 02:28:25,281
It,

5173
02:28:25,281 --> 02:28:27,570
is there like a standard
place where you could go?

5174
02:28:27,571 --> 02:28:27,990
We could,

5175
02:28:27,990 --> 02:28:28,311
you know,

5176
02:28:28,311 --> 02:28:32,780
like someone who lives in the middle of
nowhere can find a place and get their

5177
02:28:32,781 --> 02:28:33,614
blood tested.

5178
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:36,660
I think one of the companies
that I am familiar with,

5179
02:28:36,690 --> 02:28:37,320
um,

5180
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:38,490
as wellness FX,

5181
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:43,230
and I have no association with them
other than I did a couple of guest blog

5182
02:28:43,231 --> 02:28:48,231
posts for them where I for free wrote
about Vitamin D and magnesium and uh,

5183
02:28:48,931 --> 02:28:49,590
they,

5184
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:50,251
they actually,

5185
02:28:50,251 --> 02:28:54,150
I think they're are pretty much in almost
every state now where you can go onto

5186
02:28:54,151 --> 02:28:56,820
their website and they have
a variety of different acids.

5187
02:28:56,821 --> 02:28:57,091
They'll do,

5188
02:28:57,091 --> 02:28:57,211
well,

5189
02:28:57,211 --> 02:29:01,410
they're measured different vitamins and
minerals and omega three fatty acids.

5190
02:29:01,411 --> 02:29:02,161
They'll measure different things.

5191
02:29:02,161 --> 02:29:04,340
We'll see reactive protein and that,

5192
02:29:04,341 --> 02:29:05,490
and you can go to any,

5193
02:29:05,670 --> 02:29:06,503
uh,

5194
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:10,680
enter your address and go to like a lab
corp around nearest by whatever and get

5195
02:29:10,681 --> 02:29:11,514
your blood drawn.

5196
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:14,640
And then they'll give you the
data within a couple of days.

5197
02:29:14,670 --> 02:29:15,660
They'll help you interpret it.

5198
02:29:15,661 --> 02:29:20,640
They have a variety of different positions
and nutritional people that can help

5199
02:29:20,641 --> 02:29:22,650
you interpret what your
blood results mean.

5200
02:29:22,890 --> 02:29:23,671
So I'm like,

5201
02:29:23,671 --> 02:29:24,600
I used it myself.

5202
02:29:24,601 --> 02:29:27,900
We also got a test for my mother in law
to use and she lives in Mississippi.

5203
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:29,010
So,

5204
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:29,281
you know,

5205
02:29:29,281 --> 02:29:29,731
and it's,

5206
02:29:29,731 --> 02:29:30,564
it's pretty much,

5207
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,670
I think it's pretty much everywhere now.

5208
02:29:33,180 --> 02:29:34,320
So I really like them.

5209
02:29:34,350 --> 02:29:36,690
And obviously you can go to your
physician and your health care,

5210
02:29:36,691 --> 02:29:38,010
your primary health care provider,

5211
02:29:38,011 --> 02:29:38,520
but they might not,

5212
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,890
may not measure everything that you want,

5213
02:29:40,891 --> 02:29:41,724
like a three.

5214
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:44,870
And they also might give you some of
that mall you'll need to do was eat a

5215
02:29:44,871 --> 02:29:45,980
balanced diet.

5216
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:47,053
Right?

5217
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:49,520
How many times have I heard
that from a physician?

5218
02:29:49,521 --> 02:29:50,480
It looked like shit,

5219
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:51,261
you know,

5220
02:29:51,261 --> 02:29:52,910
like overweight position.

5221
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:53,773
I mean,

5222
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:54,501
sloppy,

5223
02:29:54,501 --> 02:29:55,700
loose skin all around.

5224
02:29:55,701 --> 02:29:56,030
It's free.

5225
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:56,331
It's like,

5226
02:29:56,331 --> 02:29:56,511
dude,

5227
02:29:56,511 --> 02:29:57,230
you're melting,

5228
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:57,710
right?

5229
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:58,670
Well tell me what to do.

5230
02:29:58,840 --> 02:29:59,480
Yeah,

5231
02:29:59,480 --> 02:29:59,751
yeah.

5232
02:29:59,751 --> 02:30:00,584
So it,

5233
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:03,260
but the wellness effects is pretty cool.

5234
02:30:03,430 --> 02:30:03,740
You know,

5235
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:04,760
I really liked them.

5236
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:06,140
But the nutrition thing,

5237
02:30:06,141 --> 02:30:08,330
I think it's making its way into medicine.

5238
02:30:08,331 --> 02:30:10,550
And that's part of the
reason why people like Offit,

5239
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:11,470
who is an MD,

5240
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:12,021
you know,

5241
02:30:12,021 --> 02:30:12,800
these people,

5242
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:14,580
they've been trained um,

5243
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:15,770
very differently.

5244
02:30:15,771 --> 02:30:18,560
They haven't been trained in
understanding preventative medicine,

5245
02:30:18,561 --> 02:30:22,460
understanding how these
complex micronutrients are
interacting with different,

5246
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:23,060
you know,

5247
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:26,270
proteins in our body and how that's
important to prevent different diseases.

5248
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:26,960
You know,

5249
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:27,210
they,

5250
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:28,370
they're have so they're not,

5251
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,710
they're not thinking about it
from the same frame of mind.

5252
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:31,540
You know,

5253
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:32,300
as,

5254
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:33,133
um,

5255
02:30:33,710 --> 02:30:35,960
as people like me that
are phd researchers,

5256
02:30:35,961 --> 02:30:37,760
our nutritionist and
there's a variety of other,

5257
02:30:38,050 --> 02:30:38,480
uh,

5258
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:40,160
I guess natural pathic doctors may be,

5259
02:30:40,161 --> 02:30:40,994
have more,

5260
02:30:41,130 --> 02:30:44,240
there's a whole variety of
different naturopathic yeah.

5261
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:47,240
Gets lumped into homeopathics
sometimes accent different.

5262
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:47,750
Yeah,

5263
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:48,620
completely different.

5264
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:50,750
I've been guilty of it myself.

5265
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:50,930
Yeah.

5266
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:51,763
I think I have as well.

5267
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,980
I confused them in a way where the,

5268
02:30:53,981 --> 02:30:54,814
it just,

5269
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:57,260
anything homeopathic I
think of is horse shit

5270
02:30:58,400 --> 02:30:59,231
homeopathic,

5271
02:30:59,231 --> 02:31:04,231
like that crazy thing where they like
dilute things to like crazy amounts where

5272
02:31:05,061 --> 02:31:05,751
you can't even,

5273
02:31:05,751 --> 02:31:08,240
there's like no act of compound if you,

5274
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:13,290
if you'd Google it or look at the
Wikipedia of what is decently Hormel,

5275
02:31:13,310 --> 02:31:13,700
uh,

5276
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:14,150
sorry,

5277
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:15,140
homeopathic.

5278
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:17,750
They had to have their
own measuring system too.

5279
02:31:17,751 --> 02:31:18,231
I think.

5280
02:31:18,231 --> 02:31:23,231
It's like they'll take a compound and
they'll dilute it like a million fold and

5281
02:31:24,631 --> 02:31:28,080
it's like to the point where there's
like no biological activity and they give

5282
02:31:28,081 --> 02:31:28,914
it to people.

5283
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:31,560
I'm pretty sure that's the homeopathy.

5284
02:31:31,561 --> 02:31:33,000
I didn't realize that until recently.

5285
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:33,461
Yeah.

5286
02:31:33,461 --> 02:31:38,260
Repeatedly diluting a chosen substance
in alcohol or distilled water,

5287
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:41,680
followed by forceful
striking on an elastic body.

5288
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:45,910
What dilution usually contains a
continues well past the point where no

5289
02:31:45,911 --> 02:31:46,520
molecules,

5290
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:48,010
the original substance remain.

5291
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:49,110
Is that,

5292
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:49,590
okay?

5293
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:50,423
Let me tell the story.

5294
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:56,140
So I recently had my wisdom teeth removed
and my oral surgeon gave me this case

5295
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:01,110
of pills that was Arnica.

5296
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:01,740
He's like,

5297
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:01,951
yeah,

5298
02:32:01,951 --> 02:32:02,784
nonsense.

5299
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:03,421
Well,

5300
02:32:03,421 --> 02:32:03,960
I thought,

5301
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:04,231
well no,

5302
02:32:04,231 --> 02:32:05,490
it was homeopathic,

5303
02:32:05,491 --> 02:32:07,050
which really makes it nonsense.

5304
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:09,540
There is some anti microbial
activity and things like that,

5305
02:32:09,541 --> 02:32:10,374
and Arnica,

5306
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:12,960
the real Arnica homeopathic going,

5307
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:13,830
it goes to like sugar.

5308
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:15,060
It's water,

5309
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:16,230
it's water.

5310
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:16,771
Literally like,

5311
02:32:16,771 --> 02:32:18,690
but I didn't know his
homeopathic at first.

5312
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:19,081
I just thought,

5313
02:32:19,081 --> 02:32:19,441
oh yeah,

5314
02:32:19,441 --> 02:32:20,221
it's just Arnica.

5315
02:32:20,221 --> 02:32:20,790
And,

5316
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:23,730
and it wasn't until like my
husband looked at it and he's like,

5317
02:32:23,731 --> 02:32:25,440
do you realize this is homeopathic?

5318
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:26,460
I was like,

5319
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:27,031
what's that?

5320
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:27,730
I didn't really,

5321
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:29,540
I knew homeopathic was
kind of crazy and I looked,

5322
02:32:29,541 --> 02:32:32,070
we looked it up and it
was like mind blowing.

5323
02:32:32,071 --> 02:32:34,650
I couldn't believe that they were giving,

5324
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:35,700
I don't even think he knows.

5325
02:32:35,701 --> 02:32:38,790
I think he probably made the same mistake
I did where I just thought it was just

5326
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:39,300
Arnica.

5327
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:41,490
This is for anybody defending homeopathy,

5328
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:42,420
homeopathy,

5329
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:43,530
this is on Wikipedia.

5330
02:32:43,531 --> 02:32:44,040
Lax,

5331
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:45,360
this is all with references,

5332
02:32:45,361 --> 02:32:47,990
lacks biological
plausibility and the axioms.

5333
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:49,230
Homeopathy had been,

5334
02:32:49,710 --> 02:32:51,180
had been refuted for some time.

5335
02:32:51,181 --> 02:32:54,720
The postulated mechanisms of action
of homeopathic remedies are both

5336
02:32:54,721 --> 02:32:58,230
scientifically implausible
and not physically possible,

5337
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:03,000
although some the clinical
trials produce positive results.

5338
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:07,800
Systematic reviews reveal that this is
because of chance flawed research methods

5339
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:09,180
and reporting bias,

5340
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:09,860
which is

5341
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:10,640
pretty common.

5342
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:11,870
So there you have it.

5343
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:12,541
Homeopathy,

5344
02:33:12,541 --> 02:33:12,831
you really,

5345
02:33:12,831 --> 02:33:13,630
yeah,

5346
02:33:13,630 --> 02:33:14,041
I mean,

5347
02:33:14,041 --> 02:33:15,510
anytime someone says homeopathy,

5348
02:33:15,511 --> 02:33:17,070
they usually are wearing crystal.

5349
02:33:18,030 --> 02:33:19,820
They know someone who's a channel or,

5350
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:20,380
right,

5351
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:21,213
right.

5352
02:33:21,580 --> 02:33:21,911
So,

5353
02:33:21,911 --> 02:33:22,080
uh,

5354
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:22,241
you know,

5355
02:33:22,241 --> 02:33:24,970
getting back to my wisdom teeth
or it's a kind of a cool topic.

5356
02:33:24,990 --> 02:33:25,720
Um,

5357
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:29,590
I had to get them removed because they
were like impacted and causing problems

5358
02:33:29,591 --> 02:33:30,430
and pain and such.

5359
02:33:30,730 --> 02:33:31,241
So,

5360
02:33:31,241 --> 02:33:31,630
um,

5361
02:33:31,630 --> 02:33:32,770
I did some research.

5362
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:33,291
I was like,

5363
02:33:33,291 --> 02:33:33,430
God,

5364
02:33:33,430 --> 02:33:33,911
if I have a kid,

5365
02:33:33,911 --> 02:33:34,510
my teeth removed,

5366
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:35,980
there gotta be some
kind of benefit from it.

5367
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:40,450
And I found that that our wisdom teeth
have something called dental pulp stem

5368
02:33:40,451 --> 02:33:43,120
cells in them and these
dental pulp stem cells.

5369
02:33:43,121 --> 02:33:45,280
So this stem cell
research is like a whole,

5370
02:33:45,281 --> 02:33:49,120
I'm really excited about the stem cell
research field and where we're going with

5371
02:33:49,121 --> 02:33:49,690
that.

5372
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:50,523
But anyways,

5373
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:55,360
are our wisdom teeth have dental pulp
stem cells in them that can actually form

5374
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:56,200
um,

5375
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:58,150
other tissues in our body,

5376
02:33:58,151 --> 02:33:59,530
like bone cartilage.

5377
02:33:59,770 --> 02:34:01,480
And they even showed recently they've,

5378
02:34:01,540 --> 02:34:05,380
they've taken dental pulp stem cells
from people with impacted wisdom teeth,

5379
02:34:05,530 --> 02:34:06,241
taken them out and,

5380
02:34:06,241 --> 02:34:09,970
and transplant them into mice that had
damaged motor neurons and it was able to

5381
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,710
differentiate into damage mode,

5382
02:34:11,770 --> 02:34:13,090
like neurons,

5383
02:34:13,270 --> 02:34:15,850
neuronal type cells and help replace that.

5384
02:34:16,060 --> 02:34:20,950
So I went and looked online to see if
anyone was banking them cause they do cord

5385
02:34:20,951 --> 02:34:23,320
blood banking where you
can bank your core blood.

5386
02:34:23,321 --> 02:34:24,154
And indeed,

5387
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:25,270
there was a company that,

5388
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:25,630
uh,

5389
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:28,450
it's a couple of companies that are
both associated with cord blood banks as

5390
02:34:28,451 --> 02:34:28,601
well,

5391
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:29,070
but they're,

5392
02:34:29,070 --> 02:34:31,690
they bank the dental pulp
stem cells that you can,

5393
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:33,190
when you have your teeth removed,

5394
02:34:33,490 --> 02:34:36,310
they send you a kit with likes
buffered saline solution.

5395
02:34:36,311 --> 02:34:39,430
Your oral surgeon will stick the teeth
in them and then they ship it off back to

5396
02:34:39,431 --> 02:34:42,130
the company and they preserve
it in liquid nitrogen.

5397
02:34:42,390 --> 02:34:42,670
Um,

5398
02:34:42,670 --> 02:34:44,410
they kind of do very minimal processing.

5399
02:34:44,411 --> 02:34:46,870
They don't actually remove the stem
cells that keep it in the tissue,

5400
02:34:46,930 --> 02:34:47,770
the dental pulp tissue,

5401
02:34:47,771 --> 02:34:52,771
and they freeze it in liquid nitrogen
so that you can later use it if you need

5402
02:34:53,231 --> 02:34:53,730
it.

5403
02:34:53,730 --> 02:34:54,200
Uh,

5404
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:58,420
so it's actually really cool because
you can use this if you have damaged

5405
02:34:58,421 --> 02:34:59,410
cartilage bone,

5406
02:34:59,411 --> 02:35:03,730
possibly Parkinson's disease where you
need to replace damaged motor neurons.

5407
02:35:04,180 --> 02:35:05,013
Um,

5408
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:07,260
so I thought that was pretty,

5409
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:07,931
pretty cool.

5410
02:35:07,931 --> 02:35:11,020
It's like a benefit for it because getting
your wisdom teeth removed is not fun

5411
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:11,450
at all.

5412
02:35:11,450 --> 02:35:12,670
It is fascinating though,

5413
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:14,950
t primary teeth from children also.

5414
02:35:14,951 --> 02:35:16,540
So in the children's teeth,

5415
02:35:16,630 --> 02:35:16,811
you know,

5416
02:35:16,811 --> 02:35:19,090
they're losing their primary teeth
and you just throw the teeth away.

5417
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:19,960
Um,

5418
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:21,160
they are really,

5419
02:35:21,161 --> 02:35:23,500
they have a really rich source
of dental pulp stem cells.

5420
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:24,611
So you can,

5421
02:35:24,611 --> 02:35:24,810
they,

5422
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:25,480
you know,

5423
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:28,060
your child is their tooth
and you can bank it,

5424
02:35:28,490 --> 02:35:28,990
uh,

5425
02:35:28,990 --> 02:35:30,070
where you freeze it.

5426
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:34,600
It's like $625 for the whole
processing and then to store it,

5427
02:35:34,601 --> 02:35:36,130
it's like $125 a year.

5428
02:35:36,310 --> 02:35:40,510
I personally think it's a great
investment if you have kids and they,

5429
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:40,900
you know,

5430
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:41,770
losing their teeth are also,

5431
02:35:41,771 --> 02:35:42,480
if you're,

5432
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:42,760
uh,

5433
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:44,680
if you have your wisdom teeth
and you have to get them removed,

5434
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:45,910
why not?

5435
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:47,880
My daughter is about to
lose her first tooth.

5436
02:35:48,730 --> 02:35:49,121
Perfect.

5437
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:49,721
Yeah.

5438
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:50,080
I'll,

5439
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,820
the company that I went went with,

5440
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:52,270
um,

5441
02:35:52,270 --> 02:35:52,690
I can,

5442
02:35:52,690 --> 02:35:53,450
I can give it to you.

5443
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:55,540
I actually talked to
their cell biologists.

5444
02:35:55,541 --> 02:35:59,020
I was on the phone cause I read through
all the procedures in these scientific

5445
02:35:59,021 --> 02:36:02,560
papers to see exactly how you process it
in the optimal way and the best way to

5446
02:36:02,561 --> 02:36:04,360
have the best viability
after you thought them.

5447
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:06,880
And so I was like getting on the phone.

5448
02:36:06,881 --> 02:36:07,061
I'm like,

5449
02:36:07,061 --> 02:36:07,271
okay,

5450
02:36:07,271 --> 02:36:07,811
do you do this,

5451
02:36:07,811 --> 02:36:08,231
do this.

5452
02:36:08,231 --> 02:36:10,620
And so I went with this company
because I spoke with uh,

5453
02:36:10,690 --> 02:36:13,690
one of their cell biologist and they had
done the things that I thought were the

5454
02:36:13,691 --> 02:36:14,200
best.

5455
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:15,033
Um,

5456
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:16,150
so anyways,

5457
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,253
that whole stem cell phone,

5458
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:17,741
that's cool.

5459
02:36:17,741 --> 02:36:17,961
Yeah,

5460
02:36:17,961 --> 02:36:18,241
it's,

5461
02:36:18,241 --> 02:36:18,880
it's,

5462
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:19,181
you know,

5463
02:36:19,181 --> 02:36:23,650
what's really cool is that they can
take fiberblast cells from your skin,

5464
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:26,590
like skin cells that we
slopped off like every day.

5465
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:30,820
And they can add four different
transcription factors,

5466
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:35,850
like four different genes that they can
add by like a viral ad virus to them.

5467
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:41,430
And they can reprogram them to become
these pluripotent stem cells in your body.

5468
02:36:42,821 --> 02:36:45,040
Meaning they can form any
type of cell in your body.

5469
02:36:45,041 --> 02:36:47,260
So you can take a skin
cell and you can make it,

5470
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:47,750
you know,

5471
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:49,030
into a brain cell,

5472
02:36:49,031 --> 02:36:50,080
a liver cell hearts out.

5473
02:36:50,081 --> 02:36:51,670
I mean this has huge,

5474
02:36:51,671 --> 02:36:54,820
huge implications for
regenerative medicine.

5475
02:36:54,821 --> 02:36:58,030
But I think also just
for extending lifespan,

5476
02:36:58,350 --> 02:37:02,730
what did you think about this latest study
where they took mice and did you read

5477
02:37:02,731 --> 02:37:03,181
about this?

5478
02:37:03,181 --> 02:37:04,260
Where they took young,

5479
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:04,580
the,

5480
02:37:04,580 --> 02:37:08,280
the blood of young mice and they
reintroduced it to old mice.

5481
02:37:08,490 --> 02:37:08,851
Yeah.

5482
02:37:08,851 --> 02:37:09,211
So,

5483
02:37:09,211 --> 02:37:09,810
um,

5484
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:10,590
that,

5485
02:37:10,590 --> 02:37:12,000
was that a recent study or was that,

5486
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:13,030
um,

5487
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:13,451
it was,

5488
02:37:13,451 --> 02:37:16,010
it was the recent findings because I've

5489
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:18,260
seen other studies that
were not super recent,

5490
02:37:18,261 --> 02:37:21,680
but what they did was they took like
bone marrow cells that had a bone marrow

5491
02:37:21,681 --> 02:37:22,600
transplant and took,

5492
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:25,760
which obviously bone marrow forms
or blood cells from young mice and

5493
02:37:25,761 --> 02:37:27,290
transplanted them to old mice and the,

5494
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:28,550
and the mouse,

5495
02:37:28,610 --> 02:37:30,230
the mice like lived longer.

5496
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:31,051
Yeah.

5497
02:37:31,051 --> 02:37:31,500
This is,

5498
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:32,370
this is recent.

5499
02:37:32,430 --> 02:37:32,731
It's,

5500
02:37:32,731 --> 02:37:33,110
um,

5501
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,311
they,

5502
02:37:33,311 --> 02:37:33,510
they,

5503
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:35,280
it's from March six or may six,

5504
02:37:35,281 --> 02:37:35,950
rather.

5505
02:37:35,950 --> 02:37:39,450
They actually took an
injection of young blood,

5506
02:37:39,630 --> 02:37:41,430
so they took the blood of,

5507
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:43,283
excuse me,

5508
02:37:43,350 --> 02:37:45,420
they took the blood of a young mice,

5509
02:37:45,660 --> 02:37:50,660
they injected it into old mice and they
had a tremendous benefits including

5510
02:37:51,691 --> 02:37:52,590
regenerating,

5511
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:53,430
uh,

5512
02:37:53,430 --> 02:37:54,001
different,

5513
02:37:54,001 --> 02:37:54,630
uh,

5514
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:55,710
different cells,

5515
02:37:55,770 --> 02:37:56,491
brain cells,

5516
02:37:56,491 --> 02:37:57,420
tissue cells.

5517
02:37:57,810 --> 02:37:58,021
Oh,

5518
02:37:58,021 --> 02:37:58,321
really?

5519
02:37:58,321 --> 02:37:59,370
Brain cells as well.

5520
02:37:59,420 --> 02:37:59,880
Yeah.

5521
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:00,181
I mean,

5522
02:38:00,181 --> 02:38:03,540
it makes sense that you'd regenerate
different blood populations because you

5523
02:38:03,541 --> 02:38:04,290
have,

5524
02:38:04,290 --> 02:38:04,561
you know,

5525
02:38:04,561 --> 02:38:05,520
stem cells,

5526
02:38:06,390 --> 02:38:08,420
stem cells in the blood and stuff better.

5527
02:38:08,850 --> 02:38:09,460
It improves

5528
02:38:09,460 --> 02:38:13,480
the performance of elderly mice
in memory and learning tasks.

5529
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:15,600
Wow.

5530
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:16,171
That's pretty cool.

5531
02:38:16,171 --> 02:38:18,390
Crazy structural and molecular.

5532
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:20,160
Please give me that paper.

5533
02:38:20,190 --> 02:38:20,371
Yeah,

5534
02:38:20,371 --> 02:38:21,204
absolutely.

5535
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:21,601
Yeah,

5536
02:38:21,601 --> 02:38:22,434
that's awesome.

5537
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:22,831
Yeah,

5538
02:38:22,831 --> 02:38:23,521
I mean this is,

5539
02:38:23,521 --> 02:38:23,970
this is,

5540
02:38:23,970 --> 02:38:26,100
this is the stuff I'm really
excited about now is this,

5541
02:38:26,101 --> 02:38:26,760
you know,

5542
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:28,920
the stem cell research and reprogramming,

5543
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:29,821
you know,

5544
02:38:29,821 --> 02:38:30,390
we're,

5545
02:38:30,390 --> 02:38:34,200
the epigenetics is a really cool part
where you can reprogram yourself,

5546
02:38:34,450 --> 02:38:34,880
uh,

5547
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:35,230
to,

5548
02:38:35,230 --> 02:38:36,270
to basically be younger.

5549
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:37,290
Um,

5550
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:37,531
you know,

5551
02:38:37,531 --> 02:38:37,740
they're,

5552
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:39,750
they're finding now that that,

5553
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:41,010
so epigenetics,

5554
02:38:41,011 --> 02:38:44,850
I think we've talked about this a bit
last time refers to changes in gene

5555
02:38:44,851 --> 02:38:47,310
expression and you know,

5556
02:38:47,311 --> 02:38:50,220
things like methyl groups and acetylation
groups will sit on top of your DNA and

5557
02:38:50,221 --> 02:38:51,480
turn them on turn genes on and off.

5558
02:38:51,481 --> 02:38:55,350
But now what they're finding is
they're trying to look at patterns of

5559
02:38:55,351 --> 02:38:56,190
methylation,

5560
02:38:56,191 --> 02:38:57,390
like in your DNA.

5561
02:38:57,391 --> 02:38:57,780
So they've,

5562
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:59,660
they've already solved the
human genome project where they,

5563
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:02,340
and they know jeans and now
they're trying to look at the,

5564
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,870
that the methylome,

5565
02:39:03,930 --> 02:39:04,860
the human methylome.

5566
02:39:05,430 --> 02:39:07,200
And they've been able to over the past,

5567
02:39:07,201 --> 02:39:07,441
you know,

5568
02:39:07,441 --> 02:39:08,274
few years,

5569
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:12,660
they've been able to identify that there's
patterns of methylation in your genes

5570
02:39:12,990 --> 02:39:14,970
that happen with age.

5571
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:20,010
And they've even been able to like
systematically identify they've,

5572
02:39:20,011 --> 02:39:21,960
so they've taken blood from people,

5573
02:39:22,050 --> 02:39:22,681
various ages,

5574
02:39:22,681 --> 02:39:27,681
like from 19 to 101 and they'd been
able to identify the age of the person,

5575
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:32,220
the chronological age of the person
based on their methylation patterns,

5576
02:39:32,221 --> 02:39:34,020
like with 96% accuracy.

5577
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:37,020
And they've been able to do
this like within four years.

5578
02:39:37,021 --> 02:39:38,640
I think they'll some before years off,

5579
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:39,060
you know,

5580
02:39:39,060 --> 02:39:40,200
plus or minus four years.

5581
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:41,970
So they can take someone's blood cells,

5582
02:39:41,971 --> 02:39:46,971
look at their methylation pattern and
say your 50 years old and the person will

5583
02:39:47,221 --> 02:39:47,401
be,

5584
02:39:47,401 --> 02:39:47,611
you know,

5585
02:39:47,611 --> 02:39:50,790
50 between 50 and 54
or 46 and 50 you know,

5586
02:39:50,791 --> 02:39:55,170
so I think that's pretty brick
and amazing that they're so,

5587
02:39:55,171 --> 02:39:56,610
and the thing that's really cool,

5588
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:57,790
this is,

5589
02:39:57,790 --> 02:39:58,140
I mean,

5590
02:39:58,140 --> 02:39:58,891
I'm on this kick,

5591
02:39:58,891 --> 02:40:03,750
this epigenetics kick where they've
been able to now also look at,

5592
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:04,733
uh,

5593
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:06,300
the cancer cells,

5594
02:40:06,301 --> 02:40:08,520
like in a personal take a
tissue or a tumor sample.

5595
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:10,590
And then a tissue from the same person,

5596
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:11,280
another,

5597
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:11,650
you know,

5598
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:12,720
non tumor tissue,

5599
02:40:12,721 --> 02:40:14,040
and they'll at the methylation pattern,

5600
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:19,050
they'll see that the cancer or the tumor
tissue ages by like 40% based on the

5601
02:40:19,051 --> 02:40:19,884
methylation pattern.

5602
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:20,490
Wow.

5603
02:40:20,490 --> 02:40:21,390
And yeah,

5604
02:40:21,391 --> 02:40:23,460
so it's like the cancer
cells aging rapidly.

5605
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:27,360
So what's really interesting is
now they're looking at what genes,

5606
02:40:27,361 --> 02:40:28,500
these are genes,

5607
02:40:28,501 --> 02:40:31,090
these methylation patterns are happening
around and they're finding it to like

5608
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:32,280
DNA repair,

5609
02:40:32,281 --> 02:40:33,600
mitochondrial metabolism,

5610
02:40:33,630 --> 02:40:34,650
antioxidant genes,

5611
02:40:34,651 --> 02:40:37,830
like everything we've been talking about
and this whole podcast things that,

5612
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:38,070
you know,

5613
02:40:38,070 --> 02:40:39,720
affecting the damage and metabolism.

5614
02:40:39,721 --> 02:40:40,530
All of these things,

5615
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:43,410
methylation patterns are
happening clustered around these,

5616
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:44,400
around these genes.

5617
02:40:44,890 --> 02:40:45,321
Um,

5618
02:40:45,321 --> 02:40:48,420
and the cool thing about it to me
is that if we're figuring this out,

5619
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:53,340
then we can figure out how to reprogram
ourselves to be young and extend

5620
02:40:53,341 --> 02:40:53,820
lifespan.

5621
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:56,160
And I really think that we're
getting close to doing this.

5622
02:40:56,580 --> 02:40:57,091
So I mean,

5623
02:40:57,091 --> 02:40:57,924
if you think about,

5624
02:40:58,560 --> 02:40:59,371
I'll give you an example.

5625
02:40:59,371 --> 02:41:00,270
Like stem cells.

5626
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:05,430
Stem cells also have methylation patterns
that are very distinct to stem cells.

5627
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:09,180
And there's certain genes that are
when when a gene is methylated,

5628
02:41:09,181 --> 02:41:10,500
it's not being expressed.

5629
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,650
There are certain genes that are not
expressed in stem cells for a reason

5630
02:41:13,651 --> 02:41:14,910
because when they get expressed,

5631
02:41:15,210 --> 02:41:17,700
they cause the cell to stop dividing.

5632
02:41:17,730 --> 02:41:20,100
And you don't want your stem cells to
stop dividing because stem cells are

5633
02:41:20,101 --> 02:41:22,110
what's repopulating the tissue.

5634
02:41:22,350 --> 02:41:23,183
Okay.

5635
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:26,970
And they found that like a certain
gene is methylated and young people,

5636
02:41:26,971 --> 02:41:27,870
so when we're young,

5637
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:28,800
our stem cells have,

5638
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:29,401
you know,

5639
02:41:29,401 --> 02:41:30,480
this gene is methylated,

5640
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:31,830
but as we get older,

5641
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:33,000
the gene,

5642
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,350
the methylation goes away.

5643
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:36,560
So there's enzymes that
actually are called demethylase.

5644
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:39,960
Does it take off the methyl groups and
this gene becomes active and then the

5645
02:41:39,961 --> 02:41:41,970
stem cell like stops dividing.

5646
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:42,931
It's like you lose,

5647
02:41:42,931 --> 02:41:46,380
you're basically losing your stem cell
and then you know more stem cells,

5648
02:41:46,381 --> 02:41:47,880
you lose the worse off you are.

5649
02:41:47,881 --> 02:41:49,980
You can't replenish your
damaged tissue and all that.

5650
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:53,850
But what they found was that the thing
that activates that thing that takes off

5651
02:41:53,851 --> 02:41:56,400
the methyl group is
something called NF Kappa B,

5652
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:57,770
which is an inflammatory,

5653
02:41:58,010 --> 02:42:00,330
that that thing is
activated by inflammation.

5654
02:42:00,331 --> 02:42:03,810
And I've copied be inflammation activates
NF Kappa B and then it activates this

5655
02:42:03,811 --> 02:42:05,940
whole pathway of demethylase,

5656
02:42:05,941 --> 02:42:07,110
that takeoff methyl groups.

5657
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:10,920
So what I'm thinking is that
inflammation is a chronic signal.

5658
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:11,360
It's,

5659
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:15,510
it's a way that I've been
able to link environment and,

5660
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:16,320
and the way,

5661
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:18,240
when I say environment
I just mean like damage,

5662
02:42:18,241 --> 02:42:20,280
constant accumulation of tissue damage,

5663
02:42:20,281 --> 02:42:21,031
the DNA damage.

5664
02:42:21,031 --> 02:42:24,090
I was talking about
environment to epigenetics.

5665
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:26,910
So it's like you have a
chronic signal of inflammation.

5666
02:42:26,911 --> 02:42:31,140
It's activating these
demethylase is they're taking
methyl groups off of DNA and

5667
02:42:31,141 --> 02:42:33,890
now you're expressing genes that
are usually not expressed when a,

5668
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:37,290
or young in stem cells that stops the
sentence stem cells from dividing.

5669
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,660
So it's like a really cool link between,

5670
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:40,793
you know,

5671
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,210
environment and,

5672
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:43,920
and epigenetics that,

5673
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:44,340
you know,

5674
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:45,450
as it relates to aging,

5675
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:48,990
which we know that environment
regulates epigenetics.

5676
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:52,680
So to me it's kind of cool cause as
we're figuring out these programs,

5677
02:42:52,681 --> 02:42:57,120
what that means is I think that we'll
be able to reprogram our ourselves to

5678
02:42:57,150 --> 02:42:57,870
become young.

5679
02:42:57,870 --> 02:42:58,621
That's incredible.

5680
02:42:58,621 --> 02:43:00,660
How long do you think it was
going to be before that happens?

5681
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:02,370
I think that we're,

5682
02:43:02,700 --> 02:43:04,050
we're getting really close with,

5683
02:43:04,051 --> 02:43:04,681
I mean if you look at,

5684
02:43:04,681 --> 02:43:08,070
like I said with the stem cell
research that we're doing now,

5685
02:43:08,071 --> 02:43:08,904
where we can take,

5686
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:13,690
we can even take a renal epithelial cells
that we excrete in our urine and make

5687
02:43:13,691 --> 02:43:15,420
it into a pluripotent stem cell.

5688
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:16,450
We can make it become,

5689
02:43:16,730 --> 02:43:17,563
uh,

5690
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:18,610
you selling our liver.

5691
02:43:18,970 --> 02:43:19,630
Um,

5692
02:43:19,630 --> 02:43:20,620
so I think with,

5693
02:43:20,670 --> 02:43:20,890
you know,

5694
02:43:20,890 --> 02:43:22,360
the advances we're making with that,

5695
02:43:22,770 --> 02:43:23,603
uh,

5696
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:25,690
in combination with this learning,

5697
02:43:25,691 --> 02:43:26,230
the looking,

5698
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:26,850
looking at fight,

5699
02:43:26,850 --> 02:43:29,100
figuring out the human
epigenetics Epi genome,

5700
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:29,201
we're,

5701
02:43:29,201 --> 02:43:32,230
we're looking at methylation patterns
and figuring out what's happening with

5702
02:43:32,231 --> 02:43:33,064
age.

5703
02:43:33,090 --> 02:43:33,460
Um,

5704
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:33,761
you know,

5705
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:36,610
I think we're going to make
huge strides in the next decade.

5706
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:37,510
I mean,

5707
02:43:37,510 --> 02:43:40,330
hopefully if research a
funding doesn't go down,

5708
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:40,900
you know,

5709
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:42,490
it's been going down the drain,

5710
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,740
but Eisenman Yeah.

5711
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:45,460
Oh yeah.

5712
02:43:45,460 --> 02:43:47,320
I mean funding is hard.

5713
02:43:47,321 --> 02:43:48,880
It's really hard getting,

5714
02:43:48,881 --> 02:43:50,900
getting funding in
science because why is it

5715
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:52,670
with something like anti aging,

5716
02:43:52,671 --> 02:43:53,360
it would sound like,

5717
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:53,571
boy,

5718
02:43:53,571 --> 02:43:56,090
if there's something to be made
where there's money to be made,

5719
02:43:56,091 --> 02:43:59,570
it's funding anti aging
research seems like God,

5720
02:43:59,571 --> 02:44:00,440
that's the way to go.

5721
02:44:00,570 --> 02:44:00,781
Well,

5722
02:44:00,781 --> 02:44:03,360
there is the Nance National
Institute of Aging,

5723
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:04,170
uh,

5724
02:44:04,170 --> 02:44:04,651
funds,

5725
02:44:04,651 --> 02:44:05,211
a lot of the,

5726
02:44:05,211 --> 02:44:07,980
the aging research and there's also some
private foundations that are funding

5727
02:44:07,981 --> 02:44:08,550
it.

5728
02:44:08,550 --> 02:44:09,040
But,

5729
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:09,360
uh,

5730
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:10,200
the reality is,

5731
02:44:10,201 --> 02:44:10,501
is that,

5732
02:44:10,501 --> 02:44:10,771
you know,

5733
02:44:10,771 --> 02:44:13,830
these were funding it
with taxpayer dollars,

5734
02:44:13,831 --> 02:44:14,250
right?

5735
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:14,790
I mean,

5736
02:44:14,790 --> 02:44:15,120
it's,

5737
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:15,630
it's,

5738
02:44:15,630 --> 02:44:19,110
there's not a lot of money
for research in general,

5739
02:44:19,111 --> 02:44:19,471
period.

5740
02:44:19,471 --> 02:44:19,651
I mean,

5741
02:44:19,651 --> 02:44:21,090
you'd think that cancer
one would be another,

5742
02:44:21,091 --> 02:44:21,361
right?

5743
02:44:21,361 --> 02:44:21,900
I mean,

5744
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:22,710
the Nass,

5745
02:44:22,710 --> 02:44:23,370
the,

5746
02:44:23,370 --> 02:44:26,040
the NCI is funding a
lot of cancer research,

5747
02:44:26,370 --> 02:44:27,350
but the problem is,

5748
02:44:27,351 --> 02:44:30,930
is that it's hard to get funding
and the things that are funded,

5749
02:44:30,931 --> 02:44:31,231
here's,

5750
02:44:31,231 --> 02:44:32,550
here's what I see is a big problem.

5751
02:44:32,551 --> 02:44:36,780
The things that are funded by these big
institutes are typically things that

5752
02:44:36,781 --> 02:44:37,614
are,

5753
02:44:37,890 --> 02:44:38,723
uh,

5754
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:40,410
already been proven.

5755
02:44:40,410 --> 02:44:43,180
They're not as creative in a,

5756
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:44,023
you know,

5757
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:46,830
they're the things that
people feel are already solid.

5758
02:44:46,890 --> 02:44:47,340
So it's like,

5759
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:47,461
oh,

5760
02:44:47,461 --> 02:44:48,510
you already published on this.

5761
02:44:48,511 --> 02:44:48,721
Yes,

5762
02:44:48,721 --> 02:44:49,770
we're going to fund you on that.

5763
02:44:50,090 --> 02:44:50,340
You know,

5764
02:44:50,340 --> 02:44:52,590
as opposed to someone that
has this very creative idea,

5765
02:44:52,591 --> 02:44:53,610
it's very risky.

5766
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:54,450
Um,

5767
02:44:54,450 --> 02:44:54,721
it's like,

5768
02:44:54,721 --> 02:44:55,201
well,

5769
02:44:55,201 --> 02:44:55,651
I'm not going to,

5770
02:44:55,651 --> 02:44:55,981
you know,

5771
02:44:55,981 --> 02:44:58,080
there's all these other people that
are trying to compete for this money.

5772
02:44:58,290 --> 02:45:00,720
Giving funding for something
like that is risky.

5773
02:45:00,721 --> 02:45:02,850
So they don't fund a lot
of creative research,

5774
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:06,810
which unfortunately is what
makes leaps in science.

5775
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:11,700
This mice thing is so fascinating because
they show that after four weeks stem

5776
02:45:11,701 --> 02:45:16,701
cells in both the areas of the muscle
and the brain kind of boost of activity

5777
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:20,220
and we're better able to produce
neurons and muscle tissue.

5778
02:45:20,460 --> 02:45:25,000
And then they also discovered
that injecting the old mice or,

5779
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:28,770
or rather with the young mice
with old blood was a huge setback,

5780
02:45:30,060 --> 02:45:30,990
was a huge setback,

5781
02:45:31,310 --> 02:45:31,620
uh,

5782
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:32,880
when conjoined to a,

5783
02:45:32,881 --> 02:45:33,900
an older mouse.

5784
02:45:33,901 --> 02:45:34,590
So the,

5785
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:34,831
you know,

5786
02:45:34,831 --> 02:45:36,690
bringing the old blood into the new mouse,

5787
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:41,400
the creation of new cells in the young
mouse slowed and old blood seemed to

5788
02:45:41,401 --> 02:45:42,990
cause premature aging.

5789
02:45:43,330 --> 02:45:43,990
Yeah.

5790
02:45:43,990 --> 02:45:44,650
That's incredible.

5791
02:45:44,650 --> 02:45:45,483
It is incredible.

5792
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:46,090
I mean,

5793
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:46,740
it's,

5794
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:50,790
but how long before people start
fucking doing something gross,

5795
02:45:50,791 --> 02:45:52,830
like taking a person,

5796
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:54,120
stealing their blood,

5797
02:45:54,450 --> 02:45:55,520
introducing me to their own,

5798
02:45:55,530 --> 02:45:56,161
stay young.

5799
02:45:56,161 --> 02:45:56,461
I mean,

5800
02:45:56,461 --> 02:45:57,690
it's really vampirism.

5801
02:45:57,970 --> 02:45:58,803
Yeah.

5802
02:45:58,880 --> 02:45:59,190
Uh,

5803
02:45:59,190 --> 02:46:01,330
I mean for sure.

5804
02:46:01,470 --> 02:46:01,681
Wait.

5805
02:46:01,681 --> 02:46:03,850
Now I remember that someone has read this.

5806
02:46:04,210 --> 02:46:05,350
I think I remember that study now.

5807
02:46:05,380 --> 02:46:07,000
I'm going to grab another water please.

5808
02:46:07,060 --> 02:46:07,893
This one right there.

5809
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,033
Um,

5810
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:11,810
well this study,

5811
02:46:11,860 --> 02:46:12,940
um,

5812
02:46:14,300 --> 02:46:15,890
it was published on,

5813
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:16,793
uh,

5814
02:46:16,850 --> 02:46:17,960
in the Washington Post.

5815
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:20,000
The article was published on May 4th.

5816
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:21,230
Um,

5817
02:46:21,230 --> 02:46:22,490
and the study,

5818
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:24,200
two of the studies published online.

5819
02:46:24,201 --> 02:46:26,630
The Journal of science came out.

5820
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:27,783
Uh,

5821
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:30,710
let's see here.

5822
02:46:31,790 --> 02:46:32,040
Yeah.

5823
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:33,530
One of them was from Stanford,

5824
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:34,940
the Stanford Group.

5825
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:35,451
Well,

5826
02:46:35,451 --> 02:46:35,610
the,

5827
02:46:35,610 --> 02:46:35,841
the,

5828
02:46:35,841 --> 02:46:36,021
the,

5829
02:46:36,021 --> 02:46:38,600
apparently they've been working
on this for quite a while,

5830
02:46:38,810 --> 02:46:41,780
but the results of the,

5831
02:46:41,781 --> 02:46:41,991
uh,

5832
02:46:41,991 --> 02:46:42,221
the,

5833
02:46:42,221 --> 02:46:45,440
the blood results have been pretty
shocking to a lot of people.

5834
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:46,160
Okay.

5835
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:47,600
I think a lot of it comes down to,

5836
02:46:47,601 --> 02:46:47,781
you know,

5837
02:46:47,781 --> 02:46:48,201
like I said,

5838
02:46:48,201 --> 02:46:49,034
there's these,

5839
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:50,630
if you look at the epigenome,

5840
02:46:50,631 --> 02:46:53,030
the methylation patterns
and these stem cells,

5841
02:46:53,031 --> 02:46:54,200
these young stem cells,

5842
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:55,730
even young cells in general,

5843
02:46:55,731 --> 02:46:58,000
they're very different from old ones.

5844
02:46:58,110 --> 02:46:58,320
Yeah.

5845
02:46:58,320 --> 02:46:59,420
And that affects the way,

5846
02:46:59,421 --> 02:46:59,661
I mean,

5847
02:46:59,661 --> 02:47:00,980
if you're looking at epigenetics,

5848
02:47:00,981 --> 02:47:03,800
we're talking about regulating
a whole host of jeans,

5849
02:47:03,801 --> 02:47:05,090
like hundreds of different genes.

5850
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:08,060
And so if these things are being
differentially regulated when you're young

5851
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:13,300
versus old than taking someone's young
blood and transplanting into the old,

5852
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:16,130
old a transplant,

5853
02:47:16,131 --> 02:47:18,020
he would make sense because now you're,

5854
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:18,861
you know,

5855
02:47:18,861 --> 02:47:19,131
you're,

5856
02:47:19,131 --> 02:47:20,840
you're basically taking all those,

5857
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:22,113
uh,

5858
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:24,050
patterns that we,

5859
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:27,530
that we've been able to identify and
gene expression things are now going back

5860
02:47:27,531 --> 02:47:27,981
to young.

5861
02:47:27,981 --> 02:47:29,000
So it's like now you're,

5862
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:32,950
you're not expressing genes that are
causing your stem cells to Sundance.

5863
02:47:33,010 --> 02:47:36,140
You're not expressing your expressing
more things that are involved in DNA

5864
02:47:36,141 --> 02:47:37,310
repair and things like that.

5865
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:38,353
Yeah.

5866
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:39,241
This is incredible.

5867
02:47:39,241 --> 02:47:39,480
The,

5868
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:40,650
what they were able to do,

5869
02:47:40,651 --> 02:47:40,791
they,

5870
02:47:40,791 --> 02:47:42,990
they actually had more a endurance.

5871
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:44,700
They navigated mazes faster,

5872
02:47:44,701 --> 02:47:46,170
ran longer on treadmills,

5873
02:47:46,171 --> 02:47:47,340
and they easily outperformed,

5874
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:48,730
performed their control peers.

5875
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:48,870
Okay,

5876
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:49,231
awesome.

5877
02:47:49,231 --> 02:47:53,190
We were only given céline so
it's like a definitive response.

5878
02:47:53,850 --> 02:47:54,600
Right.

5879
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:55,060
And just,

5880
02:47:55,060 --> 02:47:56,210
it's such a creepy one,

5881
02:47:56,530 --> 02:47:56,910
I think.

5882
02:47:56,910 --> 02:48:01,530
But I think this is something that we
can do with the reprogramming of our own,

5883
02:48:01,590 --> 02:48:05,160
like skin cells into like
pluripotent stem cells.

5884
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:05,890
Right?

5885
02:48:05,890 --> 02:48:07,400
And d w Yes.

5886
02:48:07,430 --> 02:48:07,791
Yeah.

5887
02:48:07,791 --> 02:48:08,121
That's,

5888
02:48:08,121 --> 02:48:09,200
that's really fascinating.

5889
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:09,370
Okay.

5890
02:48:09,370 --> 02:48:10,760
And it's the same concept,

5891
02:48:10,761 --> 02:48:12,260
but you don't have to get
someone's young blood.

5892
02:48:12,410 --> 02:48:13,400
You're doing it to yourself.

5893
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:16,520
And how would they been able to
come up with artificial blood cells?

5894
02:48:16,521 --> 02:48:18,620
Isn't that another thing
that they've been working on?

5895
02:48:18,860 --> 02:48:19,030
I,

5896
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:20,000
that sounds familiar.

5897
02:48:20,001 --> 02:48:20,480
I don't know.

5898
02:48:20,480 --> 02:48:21,313
I don't know.

5899
02:48:21,410 --> 02:48:23,390
Are artificial heart cells as well?

5900
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:24,320
I think.

5901
02:48:24,740 --> 02:48:25,250
Yeah.

5902
02:48:25,250 --> 02:48:25,610
You know,

5903
02:48:25,610 --> 02:48:25,941
I just,

5904
02:48:25,941 --> 02:48:26,774
I'm not,

5905
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:29,930
I don't remember exactly the
studies and the mechanisms.

5906
02:48:30,410 --> 02:48:31,243
It's just so much.

5907
02:48:31,250 --> 02:48:31,970
Well,

5908
02:48:31,970 --> 02:48:32,490
although it is,

5909
02:48:32,490 --> 02:48:32,550
it is

5910
02:48:32,550 --> 02:48:33,930
difficult to get funding.

5911
02:48:33,931 --> 02:48:35,640
There are so many different,

5912
02:48:36,390 --> 02:48:36,720
yeah.

5913
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:37,560
Artificial blood.

5914
02:48:37,650 --> 02:48:38,070
Wow.

5915
02:48:38,070 --> 02:48:38,903
Patient ready.

5916
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:40,171
This is on,

5917
02:48:40,171 --> 02:48:40,530
uh,

5918
02:48:40,530 --> 02:48:41,600
from uh,

5919
02:48:41,670 --> 02:48:46,670
the-scientists.com and it's saying that a,

5920
02:48:46,890 --> 02:48:47,723
wow,

5921
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:48,713
this is incredible.

5922
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:53,550
And the myths of a news that engineered
organs are being implanted into animals

5923
02:48:53,551 --> 02:48:54,091
and people.

5924
02:48:54,091 --> 02:48:57,690
Researchers announced the creation
of artificial blood for transplant.

5925
02:48:58,410 --> 02:49:01,080
This is a very recent to April 16th.

5926
02:49:02,310 --> 02:49:03,143
It's nuts.

5927
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:06,780
We live in strange times when it comes
to these things like every day or so it

5928
02:49:06,781 --> 02:49:07,980
seems some new study

5929
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:11,550
from somewhere in the world is popping
up that shows us incredible breakthrough.

5930
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:13,320
The young mice study this study,

5931
02:49:13,321 --> 02:49:15,300
the artificial blood story study,

5932
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:19,680
if they can engineer some sort of a super
potent blood and introduced into your

5933
02:49:19,681 --> 02:49:19,981
body.

5934
02:49:19,981 --> 02:49:20,101
I mean,

5935
02:49:20,101 --> 02:49:23,640
it's similar to like what the cyclists
did when they were blood doping.

5936
02:49:23,641 --> 02:49:25,020
They would take their own blood,

5937
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:25,913
pull it out,

5938
02:49:25,980 --> 02:49:29,490
injected back into their body
so they had more blood or Epo,

5939
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:30,061
which,

5940
02:49:30,061 --> 02:49:30,894
uh,

5941
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:32,760
stimulated red blood cell production.

5942
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:33,360
Yeah.

5943
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:33,631
That,

5944
02:49:33,631 --> 02:49:34,860
that kind of stuff is just,

5945
02:49:34,861 --> 02:49:35,051
it's,

5946
02:49:35,051 --> 02:49:35,940
it's so trippy,

5947
02:49:35,941 --> 02:49:39,450
the idea of sort of
hacking and retweaking the,

5948
02:49:39,451 --> 02:49:41,130
the components of the human body

5949
02:49:41,470 --> 02:49:42,170
IRA.

5950
02:49:42,170 --> 02:49:43,670
But I do think it's really cool.

5951
02:49:43,671 --> 02:49:43,971
I mean,

5952
02:49:43,971 --> 02:49:45,470
I know when I first,

5953
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:48,170
when I first got into
the biological sciences,

5954
02:49:48,171 --> 02:49:50,300
so I was a chemistry major in college.

5955
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:51,980
I did research using,

5956
02:49:51,990 --> 02:49:52,340
um,

5957
02:49:52,340 --> 02:49:53,540
these nematode worms,

5958
02:49:53,541 --> 02:49:54,374
see Allegan worms,

5959
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:55,273
worms,

5960
02:49:55,280 --> 02:49:55,590
uh,

5961
02:49:55,590 --> 02:49:57,950
that have like a 14 or 15 day lifespan.

5962
02:49:58,610 --> 02:50:00,710
And they have a lot of the
same genes that we have,

5963
02:50:00,711 --> 02:50:04,910
but I could like inactivate one of
their genes and literally double their

5964
02:50:04,911 --> 02:50:05,391
lifespan.

5965
02:50:05,391 --> 02:50:08,510
So they didn't went from living
like 14 or 15 days to like 30 days.

5966
02:50:09,050 --> 02:50:10,430
And so this was actually,

5967
02:50:10,431 --> 02:50:11,060
it was,

5968
02:50:11,060 --> 02:50:15,860
you inactivate insulin growth
signaling insulin growth factor.

5969
02:50:16,610 --> 02:50:17,840
And what happens is it,

5970
02:50:17,870 --> 02:50:18,111
uh,

5971
02:50:18,111 --> 02:50:18,710
this,

5972
02:50:18,710 --> 02:50:19,390
this,

5973
02:50:19,390 --> 02:50:19,700
uh,

5974
02:50:19,700 --> 02:50:20,391
growth factor.

5975
02:50:20,391 --> 02:50:21,190
Then,

5976
02:50:21,190 --> 02:50:21,351
uh,

5977
02:50:21,351 --> 02:50:23,060
usually when it's active it,

5978
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:23,961
it,

5979
02:50:23,961 --> 02:50:24,770
uh,

5980
02:50:24,770 --> 02:50:25,880
keeps the Fox,

5981
02:50:25,881 --> 02:50:26,691
this foxo gene,

5982
02:50:26,691 --> 02:50:30,530
which is a transcription factor outside
of the nucleus and doesn't allow it to

5983
02:50:30,531 --> 02:50:32,510
perform all the functions
that usually performs,

5984
02:50:32,511 --> 02:50:36,230
which is involved in a bunch of stress
resistance like hundreds and hundreds of

5985
02:50:36,350 --> 02:50:37,040
genes.

5986
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:40,170
And so when you'd get rid of that
IGF one signaling in the worms box,

5987
02:50:40,171 --> 02:50:43,220
so gets activated and all of those
genes and Bob and stress resistance get

5988
02:50:43,221 --> 02:50:45,740
activated and the worms
live twice as long.

5989
02:50:46,250 --> 02:50:50,570
So it's like literally a genetic program
in these worms that's controlling the

5990
02:50:50,571 --> 02:50:51,404
way the age.

5991
02:50:51,860 --> 02:50:53,150
So when I first,

5992
02:50:53,151 --> 02:50:55,190
I remember that hit me,

5993
02:50:55,191 --> 02:50:56,024
it was kinda like,

5994
02:50:56,450 --> 02:50:57,410
holy crap.

5995
02:50:57,800 --> 02:50:58,820
Like that's pretty cool.

5996
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:02,480
Like being able to
reprogram the way you age.

5997
02:51:02,770 --> 02:51:06,850
It's just such an amazing time with all
this stuff cause it seems like we're

5998
02:51:06,851 --> 02:51:10,240
around at just the right
time to catch this.

5999
02:51:10,241 --> 02:51:15,241
Just incredible perculating of all these
new studies and all these new things

6000
02:51:15,761 --> 02:51:16,720
that are being developed.

6001
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:17,671
I just,

6002
02:51:17,671 --> 02:51:21,130
just such a strange time to like try to
pay attention to all of it and watch it

6003
02:51:21,131 --> 02:51:21,671
all happen.

6004
02:51:21,671 --> 02:51:22,660
It's so exciting.

6005
02:51:22,810 --> 02:51:27,370
It must be really exciting for you
because this is like your field of study.

6006
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:27,891
Oh No,

6007
02:51:27,891 --> 02:51:28,521
it's great.

6008
02:51:28,521 --> 02:51:28,761
I mean,

6009
02:51:28,761 --> 02:51:30,320
I think we're definitely
going to live longer,

6010
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:31,340
you know?

6011
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:31,710
How long do you,

6012
02:51:31,710 --> 02:51:31,770
do you

6013
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:32,603
think you're going to live

6014
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:34,950
in my lifetime?

6015
02:51:35,370 --> 02:51:36,001
I don't know.

6016
02:51:36,001 --> 02:51:36,590
I'm going without,

6017
02:51:36,590 --> 02:51:37,020
you know,

6018
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:38,130
without really programming.

6019
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:38,521
Oh,

6020
02:51:38,521 --> 02:51:42,260
without you mean just that little
stone erupting or asteroid impacts or,

6021
02:51:42,261 --> 02:51:42,421
no,

6022
02:51:42,421 --> 02:51:42,900
I'd like,

6023
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,220
I'd like to be a centenarian.

6024
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:45,460
That's it.

6025
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:47,550
100 good with a hundred yeah.

6026
02:51:47,551 --> 02:51:49,060
You know when,

6027
02:51:49,070 --> 02:51:49,590
when,

6028
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:53,580
what if a hundred comes around and they've
got shit locked down where you look

6029
02:51:53,581 --> 02:51:57,570
like you look now at a hundred
and then I could go for 200

6030
02:51:59,250 --> 02:51:59,401
well,

6031
02:51:59,401 --> 02:52:02,520
I feel like I'm happier now
than I was when I was younger.

6032
02:52:02,521 --> 02:52:03,390
I'm smarter.

6033
02:52:03,630 --> 02:52:05,470
I understand stress better.

6034
02:52:05,471 --> 02:52:06,520
I understand

6035
02:52:06,850 --> 02:52:08,440
all sorts of the emotion,

6036
02:52:08,470 --> 02:52:08,920
right?

6037
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:11,440
I understand management
management of my body,

6038
02:52:11,441 --> 02:52:13,090
of my hormones,

6039
02:52:13,091 --> 02:52:14,740
management of my feelings,

6040
02:52:14,741 --> 02:52:16,540
management of my energy levels,

6041
02:52:16,541 --> 02:52:17,374
stress,

6042
02:52:17,740 --> 02:52:20,350
relaxation techniques to stretching,

6043
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:20,771
yoga,

6044
02:52:20,771 --> 02:52:21,604
all that different stuff.

6045
02:52:21,790 --> 02:52:25,810
I feel like I'm just way happier
and it said that old expression,

6046
02:52:25,811 --> 02:52:27,190
youth is wasted on the young,

6047
02:52:27,580 --> 02:52:27,971
you know,

6048
02:52:27,971 --> 02:52:29,920
like I understand life better.

6049
02:52:29,921 --> 02:52:31,030
I'm better at it now.

6050
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:32,530
I'm better at being me.

6051
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:33,251
It was like,

6052
02:52:33,251 --> 02:52:35,050
it was an awkward thing
when I was younger.

6053
02:52:35,110 --> 02:52:37,210
I'm way more relaxed and easy with it now.

6054
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:39,790
I feel like at 200 I'd
be a goddamn wizard.

6055
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:40,990
I wouldn't,

6056
02:52:40,990 --> 02:52:43,150
I would have shit down to a science.

6057
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:47,650
I would have the amount of errors
that I'd make as far as you know,

6058
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:48,903
every,

6059
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:51,700
every day average things that you fuck up,

6060
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:53,290
you would fuck up almost nothing.

6061
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:54,640
It would every day would be like,

6062
02:52:54,850 --> 02:52:56,860
you'd like to learn new things.

6063
02:52:56,861 --> 02:52:57,910
You could challenge yourself.

6064
02:52:57,911 --> 02:52:59,290
You'd constantly learning languages.

6065
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:01,000
Like I never understand
the people that say like,

6066
02:53:01,240 --> 02:53:01,511
oh,

6067
02:53:01,511 --> 02:53:02,410
I get bored.

6068
02:53:02,411 --> 02:53:04,400
I wouldn't even want to
live past a certain age.

6069
02:53:04,430 --> 02:53:05,410
Like I don't know,

6070
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:06,910
but I never get bored.

6071
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:08,920
There's always new things to learn,

6072
02:53:08,921 --> 02:53:10,670
new things or study the new thing.

6073
02:53:10,671 --> 02:53:11,380
So there's,

6074
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:12,970
the world is so big,

6075
02:53:12,971 --> 02:53:14,550
there's so much to learn.

6076
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:18,780
It would be awesome to just have time
to sit around and learn how to play the

6077
02:53:18,781 --> 02:53:19,351
piano,

6078
02:53:19,351 --> 02:53:21,120
learn how to speak a new language.

6079
02:53:21,121 --> 02:53:23,370
And I'm always sitting
around reading about science,

6080
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:24,120
um,

6081
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:25,380
which I really enjoyed doing.

6082
02:53:25,381 --> 02:53:26,490
But I agree.

6083
02:53:26,491 --> 02:53:26,731
I mean,

6084
02:53:26,731 --> 02:53:31,350
there's so much out there to learn and
you might get to a point if you're 200

6085
02:53:31,351 --> 02:53:31,621
years old,

6086
02:53:31,621 --> 02:53:33,570
he might've Bandon science totally.

6087
02:53:33,571 --> 02:53:36,450
And just fucking go down
some totally different roads.

6088
02:53:36,451 --> 02:53:37,470
You might be a sculptor,

6089
02:53:37,471 --> 02:53:37,831
you might,

6090
02:53:37,831 --> 02:53:38,091
you know what?

6091
02:53:38,091 --> 02:53:38,671
You know what I mean?

6092
02:53:38,671 --> 02:53:39,504
I mean,

6093
02:53:39,510 --> 02:53:42,960
you could live several
lives and still be active.

6094
02:53:42,961 --> 02:53:43,171
You know,

6095
02:53:43,171 --> 02:53:44,004
like I,

6096
02:53:44,190 --> 02:53:45,660
when I lived in San Diego,

6097
02:53:45,661 --> 02:53:46,231
I used to,

6098
02:53:46,231 --> 02:53:47,064
I was a surf,

6099
02:53:47,130 --> 02:53:49,970
I was a surfer and surf
instructor and I used to sterling.

6100
02:53:50,110 --> 02:53:51,140
You instructed people,

6101
02:53:51,180 --> 02:53:53,990
I used to teach an all girls'
surf school in La Jolla.

6102
02:53:54,560 --> 02:53:55,620
I love La Jolla.

6103
02:53:55,730 --> 02:53:55,961
Yeah.

6104
02:53:55,961 --> 02:53:57,840
I used to live two blocks
from the beach side,

6105
02:53:57,900 --> 02:54:01,800
walk to the beach before on fire right
now to see all that stuff about San

6106
02:54:01,800 --> 02:54:01,860
Diego.

6107
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,460
No,

6108
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:04,140
you haven't seen my family's there.

6109
02:54:04,170 --> 02:54:04,681
Oh my God.

6110
02:54:04,681 --> 02:54:07,140
San Diego's experiencing
crazy fires right now.

6111
02:54:07,230 --> 02:54:07,591
No,

6112
02:54:07,591 --> 02:54:08,424
I had no idea.

6113
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:11,220
Huge tornadoes of fire
a hundred feet high.

6114
02:54:11,580 --> 02:54:13,020
Well I haven't gotten a phone call,

6115
02:54:13,021 --> 02:54:14,010
so that's a good idea.

6116
02:54:14,070 --> 02:54:15,060
I mean good sign.

6117
02:54:15,410 --> 02:54:19,010
Well you mean the fire departments down
there on top of it because they have to

6118
02:54:19,011 --> 02:54:21,260
deal with this stuff
every couple of years.

6119
02:54:21,261 --> 02:54:21,501
You know,

6120
02:54:21,501 --> 02:54:23,720
there was the big one
a couple of years ago,

6121
02:54:23,721 --> 02:54:24,260
um,

6122
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:28,340
I was scheduled to go down and do a show
and there was these big fires and it

6123
02:54:28,341 --> 02:54:29,330
was so crazy.

6124
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:31,940
I wound up doing the show,

6125
02:54:31,941 --> 02:54:33,440
but I said I had,

6126
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:35,270
I donated all the money to the Red Cross.

6127
02:54:35,271 --> 02:54:35,511
I'm like,

6128
02:54:35,511 --> 02:54:36,344
I can't,

6129
02:54:36,530 --> 02:54:38,540
you mean there was so many
people off their houses.

6130
02:54:38,541 --> 02:54:41,650
I just felt like it would be so gross
to go down there and just make money.

6131
02:54:41,800 --> 02:54:42,633
Yeah.

6132
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:44,590
I remember back in like,

6133
02:54:45,010 --> 02:54:47,020
I think it was like 2002 or something.

6134
02:54:47,021 --> 02:54:50,710
When we had a really big fire in San
Diego and I was actually out surfing,

6135
02:54:50,711 --> 02:54:55,711
I was in the water and it was really weird
because there were all these pelicans

6136
02:54:56,261 --> 02:54:59,470
and all these birds flocking to the water.

6137
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:00,160
Like,

6138
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:00,341
you know,

6139
02:55:00,341 --> 02:55:02,290
I'm sitting out on my surfboard
looking out in the horizon,

6140
02:55:02,291 --> 02:55:02,891
waiting for the wave.

6141
02:55:02,891 --> 02:55:03,724
And it's like

6142
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:04,910
the apocalypse,

6143
02:55:04,911 --> 02:55:07,460
like birds were just coming to the water,

6144
02:55:07,790 --> 02:55:08,240
right?

6145
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:08,631
And it's like,

6146
02:55:08,631 --> 02:55:09,770
why is going on?

6147
02:55:10,190 --> 02:55:12,980
So I get out of the water
and there's just ash falling.

6148
02:55:12,981 --> 02:55:13,250
Like,

6149
02:55:13,250 --> 02:55:13,670
cause my,

6150
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:14,271
my car was,

6151
02:55:14,271 --> 02:55:15,081
I was in La Jolla shores,

6152
02:55:15,081 --> 02:55:17,780
the time of cars in the parking
lot and there was just ash,

6153
02:55:17,781 --> 02:55:19,760
like all over the cars and parking lot.

6154
02:55:19,761 --> 02:55:21,170
But it was like the field,

6155
02:55:21,580 --> 02:55:25,430
that moment where I was sitting on my
board and all the birds like came to the

6156
02:55:25,431 --> 02:55:25,671
water.

6157
02:55:25,671 --> 02:55:27,410
Like I had this almost like,

6158
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:27,831
oh my God,

6159
02:55:27,831 --> 02:55:30,610
it's a nuclear warfare
or something that you,

6160
02:55:30,611 --> 02:55:30,801
you know,

6161
02:55:30,801 --> 02:55:31,640
that niggery mom.

6162
02:55:31,670 --> 02:55:32,360
Like,

6163
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:35,630
have you ever had one of those where you
just get this eerie feeling where it's

6164
02:55:35,631 --> 02:55:35,811
like,

6165
02:55:35,811 --> 02:55:36,410
it's the end.

6166
02:55:36,410 --> 02:55:36,950
This is it,

6167
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:37,783
you know?

6168
02:55:38,060 --> 02:55:38,421
And,

6169
02:55:38,421 --> 02:55:38,600
uh,

6170
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:39,100
anyways,

6171
02:55:39,100 --> 02:55:41,900
that fire burned a lot of really
close to where my dad lives.

6172
02:55:41,901 --> 02:55:42,734
Actually

6173
02:55:43,230 --> 02:55:44,400
do it it twice out here.

6174
02:55:45,150 --> 02:55:45,520
Really?

6175
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:45,910
Yeah.

6176
02:55:45,910 --> 02:55:46,141
Yeah.

6177
02:55:46,141 --> 02:55:48,930
My neighborhood came
really close to times,

6178
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:49,680
um,

6179
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:51,120
to a giant fires,

6180
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:51,931
but I mean we,

6181
02:55:51,931 --> 02:55:55,350
we have fires that are so bad out
here one time while we're doing it.

6182
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:55,950
Um,

6183
02:55:55,950 --> 02:55:57,510
and this was the time I got evacuated.

6184
02:55:58,260 --> 02:56:03,210
I was filming fear factor and
I drove from Los Angeles to,

6185
02:56:03,211 --> 02:56:04,650
to hone ranch to hone.

6186
02:56:04,651 --> 02:56:07,350
Ranch is about an hour
and a half outside of La.

6187
02:56:07,890 --> 02:56:11,790
And as I was driving near Simi Valley,

6188
02:56:11,791 --> 02:56:13,530
which is about 40 minutes from here,

6189
02:56:14,430 --> 02:56:17,160
Simi Valley is where the fire kicked in.

6190
02:56:17,430 --> 02:56:22,430
And then four from there for
the next 50 minutes of driving,

6191
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:23,460
there was no fire.

6192
02:56:23,850 --> 02:56:24,241
Well,

6193
02:56:24,241 --> 02:56:25,350
when I got to work,

6194
02:56:25,351 --> 02:56:26,340
we started filming,

6195
02:56:26,341 --> 02:56:28,260
we were doing the show and then,

6196
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:28,670
um,

6197
02:56:28,670 --> 02:56:30,330
when we were done and we left,

6198
02:56:30,331 --> 02:56:31,980
the fire had reached us.

6199
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:34,140
So the fire had reached,

6200
02:56:34,380 --> 02:56:34,711
you know,

6201
02:56:34,711 --> 02:56:36,570
an hour of driving.

6202
02:56:36,571 --> 02:56:37,710
So we've talking about,

6203
02:56:37,740 --> 02:56:37,920
you know,

6204
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:42,920
somewhere around 60 plus miles and the
entire right side of the road was like a

6205
02:56:42,931 --> 02:56:44,250
Lord of the rings movie.

6206
02:56:44,490 --> 02:56:44,761
I was like,

6207
02:56:44,761 --> 02:56:47,880
I was expecting a demon
to ride a flaming over.

6208
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:50,190
It was insane for an hour,

6209
02:56:50,191 --> 02:56:51,330
an hour of driving,

6210
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:54,060
all you saw to the right
side of you was flames.

6211
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:55,350
It was amazing.

6212
02:56:55,351 --> 02:56:58,170
The only thing that separated it was
the highway and flames were jumping the

6213
02:56:58,171 --> 02:56:59,880
highway and you know,

6214
02:56:59,881 --> 02:57:00,041
they,

6215
02:57:00,041 --> 02:57:03,900
they had tried to keep the fire as far
away from the roads and farther away from

6216
02:57:03,901 --> 02:57:04,471
structures.

6217
02:57:04,471 --> 02:57:09,471
But it was so out of control that had
traveled 50 miles plus in a few hours.

6218
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:10,590
I mean in a place like,

6219
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:11,220
you know,

6220
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:14,250
this like la or San Diego
where there's a lot of dry,

6221
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:15,050
you know,

6222
02:57:15,050 --> 02:57:15,750
brush and,

6223
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:18,270
and like what kind of
mechanisms do they have to,

6224
02:57:18,271 --> 02:57:20,880
I mean they obviously know
this can be a serious problem.

6225
02:57:20,881 --> 02:57:21,151
Do that.

6226
02:57:21,151 --> 02:57:22,070
Is there any sort of like,

6227
02:57:22,150 --> 02:57:23,170
there's not much they can do.

6228
02:57:23,260 --> 02:57:24,490
I mean they try to stop it.

6229
02:57:24,491 --> 02:57:24,700
They,

6230
02:57:24,700 --> 02:57:25,810
they create fire breaks,

6231
02:57:25,811 --> 02:57:27,220
they drop repellents on it,

6232
02:57:27,221 --> 02:57:28,510
they dropped this red stuff.

6233
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:31,350
That's a that that
squashes the fire like in,

6234
02:57:31,351 --> 02:57:32,021
in certain areas.

6235
02:57:32,021 --> 02:57:33,490
But this fire leaps.

6236
02:57:33,491 --> 02:57:35,650
The problem is these
things cross highways,

6237
02:57:35,820 --> 02:57:37,690
they are the embers fly through the air.

6238
02:57:37,691 --> 02:57:39,730
They land and dry brush and poof,

6239
02:57:39,731 --> 02:57:40,660
they're off to the races.

6240
02:57:40,990 --> 02:57:41,890
We're running out of time.

6241
02:57:42,280 --> 02:57:42,850
Um,

6242
02:57:42,850 --> 02:57:43,990
you wanted to promote something,

6243
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:44,853
what do you got going on?

6244
02:57:44,870 --> 02:57:45,860
What's your iPhone APP?

6245
02:57:46,400 --> 02:57:47,720
I do have a new iPhone APP.

6246
02:57:47,740 --> 02:57:48,200
Um,

6247
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:51,320
it's found my fitness and it was just
released earlier this week and it's

6248
02:57:51,321 --> 02:57:54,920
basically you can get my podcast where
I talk about my information and also I

6249
02:57:54,921 --> 02:57:55,161
have,

6250
02:57:55,161 --> 02:57:56,450
I'm a new section where I,

6251
02:57:56,490 --> 02:57:59,720
I gave a new new new stories
and it's a community section.

6252
02:57:59,721 --> 02:58:01,380
If you've ever used reddit or hacker news,

6253
02:58:01,381 --> 02:58:03,390
it's based on that.

6254
02:58:03,391 --> 02:58:04,200
So it's like that.

6255
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:04,461
Yeah,

6256
02:58:04,461 --> 02:58:04,681
that's it.

6257
02:58:04,681 --> 02:58:06,150
I'm trying to make an
interactive community.

6258
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:06,691
Um,

6259
02:58:06,691 --> 02:58:07,860
so if you download my podcast,

6260
02:58:07,861 --> 02:58:08,790
so it'd be really cool.

6261
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:13,320
Right now it's new so it counts as
twice a download below and also found my

6262
02:58:13,321 --> 02:58:16,260
fitness.com is where you can follow me.

6263
02:58:16,261 --> 02:58:18,480
I've got a bunch of gadgets on there.

6264
02:58:18,481 --> 02:58:20,390
You can click to download my newsletter.

6265
02:58:20,430 --> 02:58:21,181
Follow me on Twitter.

6266
02:58:21,181 --> 02:58:23,250
I also have a Patreon campaign where I'm,

6267
02:58:23,251 --> 02:58:23,910
I,

6268
02:58:23,910 --> 02:58:24,181
you know,

6269
02:58:24,181 --> 02:58:24,661
I'm giving,

6270
02:58:24,661 --> 02:58:27,270
I'm trying to do these podcasts and I
have a couple of milestones where I'm

6271
02:58:27,271 --> 02:58:32,271
trying to do one talk to two
podcasts a month or four.

6272
02:58:32,640 --> 02:58:34,260
So I'm asking people to donate or not.

6273
02:58:34,261 --> 02:58:35,210
It's not really donut to,

6274
02:58:35,410 --> 02:58:40,410
to pay to pledge 25 cents a month to help
me reach my milestones that I can help

6275
02:58:40,441 --> 02:58:44,820
give you the context that you need and
the mechanisms for how science and health

6276
02:58:44,821 --> 02:58:45,540
and nutrition,

6277
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:46,680
all these things are interacting.

6278
02:58:46,890 --> 02:58:49,110
That's about as reasonable
as you could ever ask.

6279
02:58:49,111 --> 02:58:50,150
25 cents.

6280
02:58:50,460 --> 02:58:51,030
I'd really,

6281
02:58:51,030 --> 02:58:54,900
I'd like to have a lot of people just
doing 25 cents a month because it's,

6282
02:58:54,901 --> 02:58:55,081
you know,

6283
02:58:55,081 --> 02:58:56,280
it's less than a cup of coffee.

6284
02:58:56,840 --> 02:58:57,480
What,

6285
02:58:57,480 --> 02:58:58,620
one minute one minute ago.

6286
02:58:58,850 --> 02:58:59,071
All right,

6287
02:58:59,071 --> 02:58:59,381
we got what?

6288
02:58:59,381 --> 02:59:00,240
We've got to wrap this up.

6289
02:59:00,241 --> 02:59:01,500
So found my fitness,

6290
02:59:01,530 --> 02:59:01,860
uh,

6291
02:59:01,860 --> 02:59:02,461
at Twitter,

6292
02:59:02,461 --> 02:59:03,211
found my fitness,

6293
02:59:03,211 --> 02:59:06,060
found my fitness.com all
the information is there.

6294
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:06,751
Thank you Rhonda.

6295
02:59:06,751 --> 02:59:07,171

you're amazing.

6298
02:59:08,820 --> 02:59:11,730
These conversations is so
enlightening and so educational.

6299
02:59:11,731 --> 02:59:11,971
I mean,

6300
02:59:11,971 --> 02:59:12,241
I can't,

6301
02:59:12,241 --> 02:59:15,090
I gotta go back over at 30 or 40
times to really absorb it all,

6302
02:59:15,330 --> 02:59:16,111
but a really,

6303
02:59:16,111 --> 02:59:16,920
really appreciate it.

6304
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:17,500
Let's do it again.

6305
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:18,060
A few months.

6306
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:18,480
Awesome.

6307
02:59:18,480 --> 02:59:18,990
Awesome.

6308
02:59:18,990 --> 02:59:19,823
Thank you so much.

6309
02:59:20,010 --> 02:59:20,311
