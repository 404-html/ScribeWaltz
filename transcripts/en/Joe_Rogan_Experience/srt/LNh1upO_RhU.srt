1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,780
Company I made 12 bucks an hour,
but that's all I need.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,750
I live with a small apartment on the 
street.

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:09,600
I don't go out too much.
I like to watch TV.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,570
I can't afford a car.
I use public transportation.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,450
I don't mind.
I read until I reach my destination.

6
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:20,451
Sometimes a newspaper,
sometimes the amount of money at save 

7
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:23,160
the shit is off the hook end up.
Not every good with the women.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm a pretty sharp person and an average
look.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,160
Last time I had sex was in 2003 in a 
machine,

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,940
but it wasn't free.
I'm just regular everyday.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,460
Normal guy.
I get nervous in social situations about

12
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:42,461
the and regular normal guy.
I can't concentrate and once a month 

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,860
mother fuck us to regular normal guy and
I make pretty good spaghetti sauce.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
Motherfuckers to break the law and 
Bridgette,

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,740
normal guy and I get scared.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,150
Cool.
See the fences?

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,280
Pauly,
pauly.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,310
Shore of everyday life can be and he 
doesn't know about it.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,290
No,
I know he does.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,930
His buddy.
I'm too busy.

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,690
Manager wanted me to do something like 
is some specialty was doing.

22
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:17,310
I'm like,
he does not know.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,640
He's never heard.
Anything I've done just wants you 

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:22,640
because you're,
you becoming famous.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,550
Yara joined on the podcast today by 
Genre Lushwala.

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,830
That is the correct pronunciation,
sir.

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,890
I got it right.
Thank you.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,120
It sounds sexy.
Fantastic comedian from Montreal,

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,790
Canada,
Montreal,

30
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,650
Canada,
one of my favorite cities in the world.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,000
Uh,
before we even get started,

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,010
we're sponsored by the fleshlight.
If you go to Joe Rogan dotnet and enter 

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,850
in the code name Rogan,
you get 15 percent off.

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,590
Have you ever used one of those things 
by uh,

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,060
you know what,
I'm going to be weird.

36
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:51,120
I've used like A.
I don't know if it's a competitor thing,

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,160
like I haven't,
but I could,

38
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,870
you know,
any birth.

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,900
I mean,
how could you not know if you guys have 

40
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:58,900
for me?
Should definitely,

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,761
I'd love to.
I love this one has been around and 

42
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,490
everybody's been finger in it since the 
beginning of the year,

43
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,140
so we're going to have to get you a new 
one now.

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,990
I'll take that one.
It's the first time.

45
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,870
I don't want to be caught at home with 
the butthole version.

46
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,850
At least you get caught with the vagina 
version.

47
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,330
It's like,
yeah,

48
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,580
you're a pervert,
but you know,

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,180
whatever.
If you just run around just hey,

50
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,700
it's just tighter,
better Robert Bundles better.

51
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,350
Right?
Tighter girls are better just.

52
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,650
But what it represents,
man represents girls.

53
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,950
You want to fuck girls on the butts,
so bad,

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,360
fake one and not even like the rest of 
the girl attached to it.

55
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't even have a fake body.
You just have the fake bundle.

56
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,460
It just stuffed it in that fake 
butthole,

57
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,910
like some fucking feet,
but sex fiend,

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,050
a way to sell them and it's a fucking 
fantastic thing though.

59
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,210
Here.
It feels like put your fingers when no 

60
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,451
one has had sex with a couple of dudes 
of fingertip think Eddie Bravo licked 

61
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,830
his finger before he stuck it in there.
Oh yeah.

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,860
Weird.
Right?

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,460
Like,
I don't care what Saturday.

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,760
Me fucking this fucking my hands.
Yeah,

65
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,810
exactly.
It's a weird thing though.

66
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,580
It,
it's,

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,140
it's most certainly absolutely 
embarrassing.

68
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,560
It's embarrassing to allow people buying
it would be the worst,

69
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,450
but now you can get online,
which is.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,710
It's like they only get you with stuff 
like that.

71
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,860
If you get embarrassed by it,
then it becomes a shameful thing.

72
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,530
Like if someone comes in my office and 
goes,

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,970
fuck this thing,
do you fuck this thing?

74
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,030
I'd be like,
yeah,

75
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,790
yeah,
yeah.

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,490
Fuck it.
Like,

77
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,630
what do you care?
You know,

78
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,400
you can't get me with that.
But to a lot of people know,

79
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,380
you say to them,
Hey,

80
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,240
what do you fucking that tube over 
there?

81
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,550
And they get red and they feel like a 
loser.

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,700
I can't let other motherfuckers define 
you.

83
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,110
Ladies and gentlemen.
That's my message.

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,220
All right,
fuck that.

85
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,780
Fuck that tube son.
Fuck it.

86
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,830
My cleaning lady just like,
she comes in and like,

87
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,360
I have shit,
you know,

88
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,630
that tissues should not even just like,
just like stuff,

89
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,540
you know,
some fun toys that I use with some.

90
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,660
Oh Lady Dildos and shit.
God damn man goes deep cleaning lady.

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,040
She's like,
she'll clean my plate and this will be 

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,040
like,
oh.

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,480
She'll find them and just put them on 
top of a dresser.

94
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Like it'd be like,
what the fuck is that like for her 

95
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,180
picking up your dirty,
slimy frosted?

96
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,700
It looks like a donut,
like frosted donut.

97
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,890
Deldot clean.
Just lying on the bed recently.

98
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,760
Have you noticed like girls,
like,

99
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,090
like different girlfriends don't like 
using like old dildos.

100
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,810
Like with the.
I always had the girls.

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,320
Well I started to like try to put them 
in nights,

102
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,050
own packaging and stuff like that.

103
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,410
No mother fucker.
That's ridiculous.

104
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,330
How much is the Dildo that only like 
$10.

105
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,800
I buy good ones.
You know like the whatever,

106
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,490
the dolphins and the Dolphin.
It's like $90.

107
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,860
That's like the playstation of fucking 
deal that girls like this has been 

108
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,060
inside some other girl's pussy with you 
and like push shoving it in there.

109
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,070
Like she doesn't want his fingers.
They're washed.

110
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,570
That's good points.
These are,

111
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,900
it is a good point but it doesn't matter
because it's still your body and somehow

112
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,080
or that it makes it okay.
Yeah.

113
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,680
Some rubber,
rabbit,

114
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,510
rabbit and asshole at the same time it 
was a rabbit.

115
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,550
It's worse also that you bought it 
specifically to fuck some other girl 

116
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,730
with it.
Like it wasn't like,

117
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,731
oh,
I found this lying around and I just 

118
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:20,940
fucked this other girl is like,
you bought it with this other sugars and

119
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,810
fucked her with it,
and then you're like,

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,840
oh,
I'm not with her anymore and now I'm 

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:27,840
with this other.

122
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,650
You got to be careful getting into that 
fucking robotics world.

123
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,230
No,
she fucking setting a pace.

124
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:37,231
You can't really match up with what you.
A chip with one of those rabbit things 

125
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:40,831
and it's beating the fuck out of the 
sides of her pussy and just Anderson 

126
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:43,600
Silva knee and the size of her buzzy.
Just slamming it down.

127
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,150
That little rabbit ears or janitor and 
her butthole.

128
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,100
What do you do with your average Dick?
Human.

129
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,430
Yeah.
What are you gonna do with that fleshy 

130
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,430
little soft thing that you know that 
you've got to worry about?

131
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,110
If she gets on top,
she might break it down.

132
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,660
It happened,
man,

133
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,020
where it almost breaks when you get a 
fallout and then it hits the tank.

134
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,150
Pulls that dude.
God's got to the hospital for this shit.

135
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,440
Are you serious?
Yes.

136
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:11,441
You can tear your,
your Dick Breaks and not only does it 

137
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:14,741
break,
but a lot of times it stays crooked 

138
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:14,741
forever.
Oh,

139
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,380
I think I broke my dick before that.
But you did,

140
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:15,920
man.
I bet.

141
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,260
I think I broke mine a little.
I didn't think it was possible,

142
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,580
so I always just went,
ah,

143
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:23,760
yeah,
because it's going to break over time.

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,660
An old ship fucking hit too many rocks.
It looks like a broken naive man.

145
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,260
Spilt beer,
rotten.

146
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,660
A deck.
A lot of waves hitting the left side.

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,070
There's this dude.
I'm my message board.

148
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,270
I fucking.
I'm sorry man.

149
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,980
I forget your name,
but he's a.

150
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,220
He has a fucking giant hog and his 
pictures like totally bent digs,

151
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,290
like completely bent to the right,
so much so that it subverted and that's 

152
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,850
his name on the message board.
It's so.

153
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,310
His Dick is so ridiculous.
It looks like it's photoshop.

154
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,700
I mean there's no way it could be that 
fat because he's a little dude,

155
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,930
giant Dick and no way.
It could be taking such a hard angle and

156
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,960
he sends it to chicks and created some 
drama line because he sent it to some 

157
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,340
girls,
sent you a picture of his dick,

158
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,420
puts them online,
man.

159
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,250
Guy Put them online for everybody to 
see.

160
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,050
I would love to have my dick like 
pointed up,

161
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:19,540
like bent up.
So it just hit the top of the girls.

162
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,400
How many pictures have you seen online 
of the dudes that you know?

163
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,260
I'm really.
I mean

164
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:26,870
no,

165
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,930
I mean on the message board.
Everybody's fortunately more impersonal 

166
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,340
because we hang out with comics.
Is it like that John is from Montreal,

167
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:35,990
Canada?
Is it,

168
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:40,991
is it like that up there to do with 
their dicks out all the time or is it 

169
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:40,991
too cold?
I think it's a little,

170
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,680
but I had a buddy who had the prince 
Albert thing.

171
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,740
Oh,
a piercing of whipping on his dick and 

172
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,840
show the fuck is up with that guy.
Seriously.

173
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,460
Had some fucking crazy shit.
I've never looked at my ticket.

174
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,430
Thought about throwing some metal 
through it,

175
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,740
like a hole through the tear.
What are you fucking like?

176
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,790
Whoa.
Cut Open like a sausage.

177
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,500
Have you seen everything?

178
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,700
No,
no,

179
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,180
no,
no,

180
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,370
no.
It's another one.

181
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,750
There's like a ring like right through 
the tip of the Prince Albert,

182
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,740
but the other one that you're talking 
about as a more of a body modification,

183
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,910
they cut into the penis and they slice 
it open like a hot dog.

184
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,590
It's common.
It's common.

185
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:23,970
It's really common.
So what.

186
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,300
Okay.
So is the whole hot dog in a microwave?

187
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,990
What spreads must just spray all over 
the fucking place.

188
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:32,810
I have no control over the pis.
You know,

189
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,130
it looks horrendous to.
It looks terrifying.

190
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,400
But bb t here like.
Yeah.

191
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,170
Cool.
Yeah,

192
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,420
some Weirdo just wants to change the way
looks.

193
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,630
You'd have a listening to some fucking.
I Dunno.

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,280
Indie rock albums.
Records Dude.

195
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,280
Butcher your Dick.
That's a weird thing man.

196
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:55,980
It's a weird thing when you know,
it's like where do draw that line?

197
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,260
You know when you see a chick with a lip
ring,

198
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:58,820
like,
whoo,

199
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,830
you gotta ring on your lip,
your upper lip,

200
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,550
there's a ring on it,
a metal ranked.

201
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,060
How far are you willing to go because 
you're already in crazy town.

202
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,830
You've already got the staples in your 
face.

203
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,810
Who fucking free?
What are you doing?

204
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,520
You ever a girl with the clit ring?
That's Kinda cool though.

205
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,550
It's kind of cool,
but it also kind of seems like she's a 

206
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,550
mess.
Oh go.

207
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,720
And you know what you're getting.
If you're decorating down there,

208
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,090
it's because you have open houses all 
the time.

209
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,630
Going down here.
I'm like,

210
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,150
wait a minute,
dude.

211
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,760
You gotta write that down.
That's an ad Lib.

212
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,010
Shit.
That's a bit.

213
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,550
Don't forget that one will hold.
We'll hold here.

214
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,360
Okay.
That's it.

215
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,980
That's a god damn genius beer.
That's hilarious.

216
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,270
It is.
There's a thing about girls with clit 

217
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,051
rings.
You got to know that if a girl's 

218
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:48,051
decorating down there,
she's having open houses all the time.

219
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,530
Know that Shit,
man.

220
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,490
Okay,
I see.

221
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't sit down and write comedy and 
then all of a sudden I just fucking.

222
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,380
I do the same thing,
man.

223
00:09:55,381 --> 00:10:00,381
I have ideas and I have to slam them 
onto a piece of paper or I have to get 

224
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:04,101
it down as quick as possible too because
five minutes later I'm like a fucking 

225
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:04,250
idiot savant.
I don't know what I said.

226
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,300
That's why these podcasts are actually 
pretty good because you can actually 

227
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,320
write comedy while you're talking.
There's so many times.

228
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,200
Yeah,
I just spiderman talking about spiderman

229
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:18,201
where it's me throwing come on walls of 
hotels and I do it on stage now and it 

230
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:18,270
fucking kills.
That's great.

231
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,470
If you do that for real.
He's a mess.

232
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Motherfucker.
Walls that you and I have to go and 

233
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,020
touch.
No,

234
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,250
you're in your underwear and you're 
putting your socks on.

235
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,570
You might lean against the wall.

236
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,210
Could easily be touching.
This creeps loads even worse.

237
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:35,211
I played chicken.
I throw it on the ceiling and keep my 

238
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:37,221
mouth open and play with someone else 
for yourself.

239
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,050
Whereas if I start out of the way,
but I don't and that's why I get id for 

240
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,050
cigarettes.
Look my skin.

241
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,210
So that is an excuse for you to be gay 
for yourself.

242
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,770
I'm not playing a part of this play come
chicken with like,

243
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,730
how fucking gay gay that's like,
no,

244
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,660
it's just recycling.
It's just bizarre.

245
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Jim Norton and says,
great bit about this chick that used to 

246
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:06,840
make them do things like she.
I guess it's his girlfriend.

247
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,110
She tells him what to do and you know,
she used to be a dominatrix or something

248
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:16,111
nutty like that and Jim comes on her 
tits and she makes him lick it up and 

249
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,790
it's a true story and he's talking about
and it fuck oh delirious.

250
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,550
But it's also your fucking toes curl up.
Your butthole crunches up.

251
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,310
You closed your nostrils when you hear 
it,

252
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,040
your whole body like construction,
like don't eat your own.

253

Need a scar in your brain for life 

274
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,150
because the moment you know the moment 
you,

275
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,420
what the fuck have I done?
He would immediately recognize the 

276
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,620
depths of your depravity and I think I'd
let someone,

277
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:49,490
some guys suck my Dick.
Make out with a more intimate.

278
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:50,540
I don't know,

279
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,600
Up Stop.
You can control yourself.

280
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,700
I mean you're.
You can defend yourself.

281
00:12:55,701 --> 00:13:00,701
Some dude has his mouth over your Dick.
He can just clamp down on that thing at 

282
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:00,830
any moment.
And at the end of your Dick.

283
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,640
Yeah,
that's true.

284
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,670
Fuck all that.
When Saturday night live do it thing 

285
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,400

the fuck he talking about.

286
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,020

Saturday and they make out with each 

287
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,020

Then there's a live studio audience is 

289
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:17,990
different than being like,

290
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,780
there's a lot of guys that think it's 
funny to just be nutty like that,

291
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,790
you know,
that was a big thing the hell's angels 

292
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,790
used to do in the sixties.
Hunter s Thompson wrote about it.

293
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,820
About how in that,
uh,

294
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,000
the,
the um,

295
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,230
the hell's angels book that he wrote,
he wrote about how they would try to 

296
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,951
freak out squares.
Like when they were around like regular 

297
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,171
people,
they would just start making out with 

298
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:38,171
each other big burly guys like tongue 
and all that.

299
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:39,660
Just whoa.
Hey,

300
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,680
there's all these video of it.
It's the documentary Gonzo great 

301
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,730
documentary narrated by a Johnny Johnny 
Depp.

302
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,690
Super Inspirational,
makes you want to write.

303
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,670
And it makes you really appreciate his,
his whole outlook on things.

304
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,570
And also recognize him for real.
Like they didn't try to make him look up

305
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,700
anything other than what he was like,
it's flawed,

306
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,880
brilliant but flawed,
crazy all over the place.

307
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,530
But look what he produced,
you know,

308
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,660
it was like one of those things.
But it was also like,

309
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,070
look how he fell.
Like,

310
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:08,810
look,
look how it all fell apart for him.

311
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:13,740
Look how his career,
all the uphill battles he said,

312
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,590
yeah,
it's scary shit man.

313
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:17,020
Because you know,
as uh,

314
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,590
any,
any artist I think,

315
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,230
I think we all look at ourselves and you
know,

316
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,300
you look at what's,
what's your eventual take on this?

317
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,080
Going to be like,
what is,

318
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,290
what's your body of work going to be 
like after 20 years or 30 years and at 

319
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,450
the end are you going to still be 
enjoying this?

320
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,970
Like look at this brilliant guy.
Like what did he do wrong?

321
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,830
Like why,
why was he some of his shit so good.

322
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:40,090
Some of the shit that he wrote,
fear and loathing in Las Vegas is still 

323
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,900
one of my favorite books just to just a 
fucking mad crazy book.

324
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:46,901
You know,
this dude and his friend just dropping 

325
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,811
acid.
And just fucking people over on the 

326
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:49,811
hotel bills.
I mean,

327
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:49,910
it's a great fucking book.
It's just,

328
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,460
it just,
it's alive,

329
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,020
you know what I mean?
And

330
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,020
he's like his writing there some shit in
there that was alive and it's not 

331
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,851
everybody can do that.
I don't know what it is or why a person 

332
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:03,671
can or can't.
But what drives me crazy is when they 

333
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,100
can do something like that and then they
still fall apart.

334
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,070
You know?
It's like,

335
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,900
it's almost like what brings them to the
dance kills them when they get there.

336
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

337
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,360
Well it's because nothing is constant.
You know,

338
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,760
like if you're so passionate about 
something,

339
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,640
there's something that you need to 
nurture in that or like.

340
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:20,000
And we're constantly changing.
Nothing is forever going to be that way.

341
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:24,290
So in five years from now,
like if you don't cultivate that kind of

342
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,430
life and everything,
you can,

343
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:27,410
all of a sudden five years down the 
road,

344
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,530
just not give a fuck about land.
Just completely like be a completely 

345
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:32,630
different,
which is fine.

346
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:32,970
We need to,

347
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,150
you have to get the,
you have to be comfortable in the 

348
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,741
struggle.
And part of the struggle is constantly 

349
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:44,010
creating,
constantly coming up with new things 

350
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,440
because as soon as you stop doing that,
if you stopped creating and you stop 

351
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,351
exploring it and the,
utilizing that part of your mind in 

352
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:49,351
your,
you know,

353
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:49,351
whatever it is,
your spirit,

354
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,780
it goes away.
That's the only reason why it's there is

355
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:57,781
because it took you fucking 10,
15 years ago and on stage over and over 

356
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,740
again until I cultivate this thing where
you know how to do it correctly,

357
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:04,741
like you get into this groove.
But that can easily slip away from you 

358
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:05,410
just don't pay.
Like when I was on news radio,

359
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,070
there was like two years when I was on 
where I didn't write a fucking single 

360
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,080
joke.
I didn't do it.

361
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,180
All I did was performed at the laugh 
factory.

362
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,780
And I performed at the comedy store.
And uh,

363
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,400
I didn't do any roadwork at all and I 
didn't write it all.

364
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,610
I just,
I did the Sitcom.

365
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,160
A Sitcom was a lot of work.
It was,

366
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:26,161
you know,
we work long hours and I'd be tired and 

367
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:26,161
I would show up at the comedy clubs.
And I just had no,

368
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,550
no ambition,
you know,

369
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:30,160
I didn't have any new material.
It was all the stuff that I'd been doing

370
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:35,161
for years already.
And I had lost all connection with what 

371
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:35,161
I was saying,
you know what I mean?

372
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:39,271
Like some bits they get to a point where
you just kind of saying a bunch of 

373
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:42,691
things that you know will work.
It's like I'm not even thinking about 

374
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,721
this.
I'm not in the moment while I'm saying 

375
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:45,721
this.
And uh,

376
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:45,721
anyway,
um,

377
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:49,170
I,
I didn't realize it until I had some 

378
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,601
writers come to see me,
some guys that were writers on news 

379
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:51,601
radio.

380
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:54,610
It was ugly and it was a late night sat 
at the comedy store and the late nights 

381
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,891
at the comedy store in the main room.
And there's only like fucking 15 people 

382
00:16:58,891 --> 00:16:58,891
that places a vacuum.
Man,

383
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:01,570
it's a cavern.
And I went up there and just just really

384
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:04,840
had a shitty set.
It just felt uncomfortable and that made

385
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,040
me really realize like,
God,

386
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,600
you don't even work on your comedy 
anymore.

387
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:08,680
Like,
what the fuck are you doing?

388
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,530
It's going to go away.
Like the thing that was the most fun for

389
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:16,531
you to do,
now you're not doing it anymore and now 

390
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:16,531
when you do it,
you're like weird about it.

391
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:19,030
So maybe like sort of reorganize and 
figure it out.

392
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:22,890
But I think for a lot of guys,
like they just start doing the,

393
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,990
they become successful or they somehow 
or another,

394
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,930
you know,
get enough success so that they can make

395
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,000
a living.
And then they just kinda like stop,

396
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:31,910
you know,

397
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,570
that's when you kind of die on.
It's so sad.

398
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,840
And yet I feel myself,
I constantly have to keep.

399
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,000
I go,
you know,

400
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:45,001
can like it.
And I'm so new to this comedy game and 

401
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:45,001
um,
I,

402
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:49,440
I find myself,
like when I was just in my little tiny 

403
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,440
apartment in London,
I mean now it's still a tiny apartment,

404
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,040
Hollywood,

405
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,120
but you just change your surroundings 
and the change the people around you.

406
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,270
And now all of a sudden it's a business 
and you have an agent and a manager and 

407
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,690
they have plans to career planning and 
all of a sudden you're like,

408
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,110
Whoa,
whoa.

409
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:06,111
What's that?
What's that little spark that I had 

410
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,031
inside me?
What was pushing me to do this in the 

411
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:08,040
first place?
As soon as you lose that,

412
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,840
like you just like completely lost and 
all of a sudden so easy to talk you into

413
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,620
being business minded and business 
oriented too.

414
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,690
And I've talked to like comics that I 
really like their interesting guy and 

415
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,650
he'll start talking about like liquor 
sales and shit and I'm like,

416
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,210
what are you even.
How do you even know that?

417
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,920
Like what are you,
why are you talking about this?

418
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,440
Have you ever thought about doing a song
about mountain dew though?

419
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,980
Roads.
Commercial.

420
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,940
When you're like,
as soon like online you have a 

421
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,010
following.
Did you get approached by so many 

422
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:40,010
people?
Well,

423
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,411
your videos have ridiculous numbers.
The every average everyday normal guy 

424
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:42,960
just like,
was it 20 million?

425
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,800
Almost 21 million.
That's some serious numbers,

426
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:51,801
man.
You put ads on those and make money off 

427
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:54,531
that shit.
Well they do like through a partnership 

428
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:57,201
program at Youtube and they,
they'll put the little ads at the 

429
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:57,201
bottom.
So they send you checks for that shit.

430
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,190
Yeah.
Make it a little bit of money on there.

431
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,000
Nothing spectacular.
No,

432
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:05,001
it's nothing.
I have to do other things and even to 

433
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:08,841
pay my bills.
I heard that there's some dudes that 

434
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:09,620
have like a kid's ones on there and 
these,

435
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:12,500
these kids videos have such ridiculous,
like,

436
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,070
like very regular repeated customers.
And so the numbers are huge,

437
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:22,071
like $5 million and now these guys are 
making like ridiculous money from 

438
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:22,360
Youtube ads.

439
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,120
I've always heard that too,
but I've never really understood.

440
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:27,510
I thought it was a real commitment to 
Dana White.

441
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,440
Really?
Yeah.

442
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:33,441
So it's real.
There are some kids who like I put out 

443
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:36,621
videos and mine's more like content.
You allow sketches and songs and like I 

444
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:37,260
created the content.
I'll shoot it,

445
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,700
edit it and put it out as like,
you know,

446
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,380
I don't have a TV show,
so this is me doing my own content and I

447
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:48,381
fucking love it.
And the creative freedom that comes 

448
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:48,381
along with it.
No one's looking over your shoulder,

449
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,890
you're just doing whatever you want.
And I get,

450
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:51,030
I got to d,
that's my tip.

451
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,530
Oh,
it's amazing.

452
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,180
Like I'll never give that up.
You know,

453
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,210
I'll never,
it's also why your stuff is so good 

454
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,210
because he is coming from your mind gets
all like when,

455
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,020
when,
when one person does this and it sounds 

456
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,020
crazy,
but I really believed this.

457
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,730
When one person is involved in creating 
something and then they put it out,

458
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,420
it's almost like you,
you,

459
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:12,421
you get a sense of their personality,
like you get like a glimpse into their 

460
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,490
creative,
you know,

461
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,530
whatever the fuck of frequency.
They tune into what a bunch of people 

462
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,351
get in it.
It can be really funny but might not 

463
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:21,351
enjoy it as much as water down a little 
bit more if that's real.

464
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,190
It sounds like totally like hippie 
nonsense.

465
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,360
But I,
you know,

466
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:29,361
you,
it's why we appreciate people so much 

467
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,611
when they do something and we enjoy it.
I mean think about what that's like to 

468
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:31,611
like,
you know,

469
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,670
like whatever.
If it's a band,

470
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:37,671
some band that you fucking love,
like you got to hang out with Trent 

471
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:37,671
reznor when you were a kid.
I mean,

472
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:37,830
what are you doing?
You're appreciating something.

473
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:40,680
This guy's producing and creating and 
that's really what it's all about.

474
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,540
That's what being a fan is about.
Yeah,

475
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,590
trippy fucking thing.
Yeah.

476
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,480
No,
it's crazy.

477
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,510
I don't really even think about that.
Don't know how you get like I do the 

478
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:50,890
shows and people.
Anyone just goes,

479
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,760
dude,
I love what you do.

480
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm so like,
like taken.

481
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
Yeah,
and I'm so weird.

482
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm very recent that recently in this,
but like I'm always like fucked.

483
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,510
So thankful.
I'm like,

484
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,260
dude,
like you know,

485
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,140
you're watching you enjoy it and loud.
Fuck.

486
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,090
It's just,
it's just a beautiful thing.

487
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,130
It's a great.
It's a great exchange.

488
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,540
Of course you got to deal with a bunch 
of nuts.

489
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,810
You ever watched his video?
Highest fuck yeah.

490
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:14,680
Yeah,
I've seen that one too.

491
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,610
That's great.
We'll,

492
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,100
we'll play that one at the end.
Alright,

493
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,070
cool.
That's a teaser.

494
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll let you know at the end.

495
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,340
We're going to have a song for you.

496
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,910
Anybody who's having a problem with this
podcast,

497
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I'm getting it from itunes,
looking for the latest episodes every 

498
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:28,920
time.
It's way easier.

499
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,980
If you just subscribe,
if you subscribe,

500
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,540
you get them as soon as we put it up 
there,

501
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,940
but apparently apple has some weird new 
way.

502
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:38,290
They're handling podcast now where it 
doesn't allow you to ping the server.

503
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,860
This is all complicated shit,
but the long and short of it is the best

504
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:46,861
way to get the podcast.
The quickest is just subscribed on 

505
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:47,980
itunes or you can always go to Joe 
Rogan.net

506
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,560
and right after the podcast is over,
within a couple of hours,

507
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,890
Brian has a link up and you can,
you can download it from that.

508
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,870
So that's easy to.
So that's the way to do it.

509
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,590
Don dolby winding anymore.
And how does that work on your website?

510
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:01,740
Does it go?
Because I'm so technologically.

511
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,090
I,
yeah,

512
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,270
I've downloaded on itunes,
go straight to my library,

513
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,820
syncs with my ipod.
Like if I go onto your website,

514
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:09,430
does it go right into the itunes or drag
and drop or.

515
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Well,
it's just a file to download the MP 

516
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,541
three and MP three file and it's always 
because I want it to be available not 

517
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,230
just for Itunes,
you know I wanted on Zune and you've got

518
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,330
some wonky old MP,
three recorder,

519
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,730
one of them little USB jammies.
It doesn't even have like A.

520
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,480
Yeah,
if you're.

521
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,940
If you're in the Zune marketplaces,
hold down your power button,

522
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,970
wait for it to reset,
and then I realized shit

523
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,910
making jokes.
Is that a Microsoft joke?

524
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,650
Darkly with.
We'll try to sneak in Microsoft joking 

525
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,320
you both the device.
The device was no good.

526
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,080
Hey Verizon,
you can't.

527
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,500
What's up with this new iphone?
Has a world chip in it,

528
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,360
but you don't.
You don't turn it on.

529
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,880
You fucking Weirdos.
You're scared.

530
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,350
You're scared.
Your network's gonna Crumble,

531
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:54,190
bitches.
That's what it is.

532
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,800
They've been talking so much shit on 18 
and t they don't understand the power of

533
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,090
the iphone.
When that motherfucker comes,

534
00:22:58,091 --> 00:23:00,220
a wave of freaks,
they're going to come over to your side.

535
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,400
It's going to be like 15 percent of the 
people from 18 t they're estimating are 

536
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,500
gonna vacate their contracts early.
That's a large number of men,

537
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,110
even more like business people.

538
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,630
You know what I was doing an AP and t 
commercial last night I was sitting 

539
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,391
there and I was sending all these photos
to my flicker and I was also trying to 

540
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:22,460
download this youtube video and then 
somebody calls me if somebody would have

541
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:24,320
called me during that on the verizon 
network,

542
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,490
all that shit would have failed your 
right.

543
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,480
And so I was thinking that's pretty big 
for me.

544
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,290
I'm a heavy user of Internet.
Yeah.

545
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,360
But I mean even if you're on twitter and
you're loading of video and then 

546
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,950
somebody calls you halfway through it,
guess what?

547
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,480
That video is not loading.
That's right.

548
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,620
Yeah.
That's a good plug.

549
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,010
That.

550
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,970
That's a good point if you look at it 
that way.

551
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,870
No.
Yeah.

552
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,490
Well I don't understand why verizon 
can't do that.

553
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:49,820
I,
from what I understand though,

554
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,490
when they get to four G,
that won't be an issue anymore.

555
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:53,920
Is that correct?
Yeah.

556
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,670
Yeah.
Four.

557
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,700
So for ge,
even though it's cdma as opposed to just

558
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,280
the network's good,
but it's actually just older,

559
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,870
like an older older technology.
It's called CDMA and if for some reason,

560
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,870
even though it's older technology,
it penetrates deeper into buildings.

561
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Yeah,
I guess that's one of the that goes so 

562
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,060
it gives you more cancer kids.
You better cancer,

563
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,080
but I've got a new top,
new,

564
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,090
a title to my book.
It's called if you get cancer from your 

565
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,090
cell phone,
you're a fucking pussy.

566
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,390
I know what you really wanted to say,
but pussies.

567
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,730
They're retired word.
No,

568
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,370
no,
no.

569
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,890
It'd be more.

570
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,520
You're a pussy and FFA.
Gigi.

571
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,320
Word.
Otee word.

572
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,250
You know what though?
I mean,

573
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,360
has anyone done research like on ball 
cancer?

574
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:41,361
Is Ball cancer up right now because 
you're a fucking cell phones by your 

575
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:44,411
balls 90 percent of the time.
I don't know what the fuck you're doing 

576
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:45,310
with your phone ma'am.
Don't stick it on your ball pocket.

577
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,610
That's like being on the side of your 
head.

578
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:51,611
Right?
So it's pretty close to your boss about 

579
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:52,940
the having a laptop on your.
On your lap,

580
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,550
just so close to books,
balls and all your shit.

581
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,970
I can imagine some kind of.
You know the laptop though.

582
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:00,530
It's heat.
The battery,

583
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,030
I use that for it as a form of birth 
control.

584
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:03,350
Right.
Kill your boss.

585
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
I did it on purpose.
Torture.

586
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,700
Those little faggots.
Whoops.

587
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,780
Oh,
trick trick.

588
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,770
Trick me to put it in my head.

589
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
I'm you.
That word in Canada there.

590
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,730
Well,
it shouldn't be an American either.

591
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,380
It's not.
That shouldn't be said to.

592
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,850
Shouldn't be award that has all this 
power.

593
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Especially a good juicy one.
Jamie Kilstein told me he retired it 

594
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,330
recently to really,
every time you accidentally say it,

595
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,180
you should do something like you have to
buy an Elton John cd or you have to.

596
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,560
You have to watch one episode of Ellen 
Full George Michael Video.

597
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,880
You have to give something back.
I love that freedom song,

598
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,890
man.
Remember that time we sang it on the 

599
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:39,890
podcast.
That's a great God damn thing in the hot

600
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,460
tub.
No,

601
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,030
I blocked that out bro.
Shut up bro.

602
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,250

603
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:50,150

604
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:51,170
Uh,
yeah.

605
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:53,240
I mean I've been trying to quite a bit 
for the past two years.

606
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:58,241
I took a little break because one is 
write some stuff and do some more the 

607
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:58,241
internet stuff,
but when you do it,

608
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:58,340
you do it.

609
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,990
I'm like,
go out for a weekend.

610
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,270
Come back.
I started doing that.

611
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,280
I have minneapolis so bad.
It's so.

612
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,950
I don't even know my dates,

613
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:13,760

Yeah.

614
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,450
Uh,

615
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:17,480
Let's check out the website.
Michael Keaton's on.

616
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,770
Yeah,

618
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,820
Yeah.
Good luck.

619
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:26,520
J O n l e j o I eat or just go to 
youtube.

620
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,070
Google like data and just search.
Sorry.

621
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Go ahead.
Have you ever thought about just 

622
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,080
changing your last name?
Like John La,

623
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,960
la or something?
Johnny La.

624
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,620
Kevin James had to do that.
His last name was sniffing those.

625
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,080
Really?
Yeah.

626
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,130
It was really tricky.
And Him,

627
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:45,131
his brother Gary and Gary picked 
Valentine and Kevin Pick pick james 

628
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:46,530
because it was the name of his old Kung 
Fu instructor.

629
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,530
My last name is not red band because my 
last name,

630
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,600
bright red bird right from the movie 
trailers.

631
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,500
When you see a movie,
other advantage.

632
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,750
I used to be a projectionist most of my 
life.

633
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,920
Okay,
okay.

634
00:26:58,921 --> 00:26:59,640
I like it.
I like.

635
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:04,641
His videos were really good.
I got to figure out how to make money 

636
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:05,970
with it.
Anybody out there with a suggestion?

637
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,450
You do yourself freaks because I don't 
know you stars Porn Stars.

638
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,600
Porn stars is the way to go and make 
comedy.

639
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,440
Comedy Porn.
Yeah.

640
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,140
Making money on the Internet.
That's what Brian Needs.

641
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,550
Brian needs more porn stars of his life 
for sure.

642
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,130
I know.
How do you get into the porn circle?

643
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,780
Oh,
he's deep.

644
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,650
Really?
He went into a podcast.

645
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,550
Is that all it takes?
My house.

646
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,500
We'll have a podcast and that you can 
interview this morning.

647
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:32,110
Star deep.
Get deep in the crate.

648
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,460
You write all your stuff yourself and 
like,

649
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:36,180
do you just sit there and think of a 
good idea?

650
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,370
And I mean,
did you start off doing like,

651
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,550
like just you using a cell phone camera?

652
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,710
They playing around what it was was like
I was uh,

653
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,840
I,
I went to theater school in Montreal.

654
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:50,130
Then I graduated and I got a roll on 
this French language TV show,

655
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:51,480
which it was,
you know,

656
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,290
it's cool.
It's great.

657
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,880
I appreciate it.
Great job and everything,

658
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,980
but it wasn't really what I want to do.
By the way,

659
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:59,500
how much does it help with chicks being 
bilingual and the other languages?

660
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,520
French sally field.
You must seem so sophisticated.

661
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,410
Especially if you know something about 
wine,

662
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,400
that's all you need.
I mean so many.

663
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,590
Growing them so quickly.
You can know nothing about wine.

664
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,620
Oh,
you'd have to do is just start talking 

665
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:17,680
about the area of France where these 
grapes are grown and that bitch she.

666
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,580
Oh yeah,
yeah,

667
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,400
no,
it uh,

668
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,040
it helps a little bit but it's weird to 
Montreal,

669
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:31,041
like if you don't like it being an 
English dude in Montreal and on a 

670
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,820
friend's show like chicks like me 
because I had the English,

671
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,480
the English or the French chicks like 
you because he's spoken with as well.

672
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,030
And then out here it's Kinda like,
Oh really?

673
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,960
Yeah,
the French thing.

674
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:44,961
Skill.
I thought you guys didn't like French 

675
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:46,880
people,
wasn't all that freedom fry French 

676
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Montreal is okay.
France,

677
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,010
France is a different animal,
those guys,

678
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,570
we don't even like French fries.
And you're more freedom.

679
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
So you were on the show.
So you're on this,

680
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:57,200
uh,
uh,

681
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,940
French speaking show and you speak 
fluent French as well as English.

682
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,330
Not as well as English is.
My Dad's French.

683
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,260
Canadian.
So is there a different,

684
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,290
like when you're sending the language,
is structured different comedy 

685
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,400
structured different when you do it?
Yeah,

686
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:15,540
I find comedy in French.
It's a completely different beast.

687
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,430
It's like you have a bunch in Montreal,
Montreal,

688
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,890
when they do the just for laughs 
festival,

689
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,290
they'll have all these like guy speaking
in France.

690
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:25,350
It's really weird and it's super like 
superstars,

691
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,930
French Canada,
huge that people have never heard of.

692
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

693
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:33,591
Just to give you an example,
there are 7 million or 8 million people 

694
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:36,801
in Quebec.
The show that I was on had one point 2 

695
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:39,360
million people watching it every week.
Like on the league,

696
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,070
that's what we get,
but that's broadcast all

697
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,070
over the United States.
Like they're very supportive of their 

698
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,491
culture and they,
they consume a quebecois culture and 

699
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:51,860
they have like huge comedy star.
It's like a little,

700
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,090
that's why they kinda like why their own
country is like a little country on its 

701
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,090
own.
On the French side.

702
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,590
English side is just is like,
like English Canada anywhere else.

703
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,610
Quebec is a very strange area in and of 
itself that they want to separate from 

704
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,480
the rest of Canada.
It's like a constant issue.

705
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,780
Oh yeah,
yeah,

706
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,790
yeah.
What's that about?

707
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Uh,
well I mean it's goes way back but it's 

708
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:15,560
basically,
you know,

709
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,660
new France became kinda like the,
the English beat,

710
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,740
the French and then like you had all 
this huge French population and now was 

711
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,870
English territory and they were kind of 
of like lax enough to go,

712
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:32,871
okay,
I can keep practicing your Catholicism 

713
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:32,871
and your things,
love,

714
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:32,871
we'll let you alone,
but you're,

715
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:34,430
you know,
this is the British empire know.

716
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,920
But they kind of flourished as a culture
and they stayed pretty close together.

717
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:45,501
And like now,
Quebec is predominantly French speaking 

718
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:48,561
and it's a culture that's just kind of 
kept going throughout the years and now 

719
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:52,341
they want to protect the culture and 
there are many of the laws in Canada 

720
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:55,791
that do protect the culture,
like Kinda like signs have to be more 

721
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,580
French than with a larger in French than
in English.

722
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,180
Like a lot of things like that that are 
very controversial,

723
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,010
um,
equal rights.

724
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:02,400
Right?

725
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,930
Well,
it's just that you have to have that.

726
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,640
It has to be in French at all.
Like you can go to Chinatown,

727
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,420
there's some shit that has nothing in 
English on it,

728
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,380
so that's fine.
Right,

729
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,250
right.
Yeah.

730
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,540
I don't feel well that's ridiculous.
No,

731
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,690
I know it's very controversial,
but there are many things that they're 

732
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,950
trying to protect because the fear is 
basically that 100 years down the road,

733
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,490
uh,
there were French culture.

734
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,910
But I mean,
you know,

735
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:31,911
things change.
What are we going to do once we start 

736
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:32,050
reading minds and we can travel through 
time.

737
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,370
We're still going to have to talk 
French.

738
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,740
You fuck.
No.

739
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,180
Is it that important?
Goddammit,

740
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,680
you're slowing down evolution county.
The language dies.

741
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:40,660
It dies,
man.

742
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,810
Fuck it isn't what you mean.
Is that what it's supposed to be 

743
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:45,810
important,
right?

744
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,510
Your intent not what?
Fuck,

745
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,910
Blah Blah.
The way you fucking say it.

746
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,290
Let's do it.
Which is neutral.

747
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:55,291
You know,
it just expresses they don't want their 

748
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:55,291
language to evolve.
If it,

749
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:55,291
if it gets absorbed,
it gets involved.

750
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,140
That's what happened.
Sorry,

751
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,210
that doesn't mean it's bad.
No,

752
00:31:58,211 --> 00:31:59,890
I have not.
Right Brian.

753
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Goddamn.
I made out like I'm going to get shit 

754
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:04,920
for this a little bit so I'll do the 
French.

755
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,480
I'll just go.
I'm not going to know because I know how

756
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:12,481
important it is.
Especially like artists on the French 

757
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:12,481
and I've worked with quite a bit like on
that TV show.

758
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:16,950
They're,
most of them are sovereigns are 

759
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,950
separate.
This.

760
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,950
Yeah.
No,

761
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,941
I guess they probably know they wouldn't
survive if the full country to hear 

762
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,551
them.
You want to stay in one area and only 

763
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:23,551
speak French.
I'm,

764
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:28,240
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna stay neutral on competitive 

765
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,860
motherfuckers topics and I love Montreal
and I love French Canada.

766
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,660
Don't know what I'm saying.
I'm as a human being,

767
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,800
as a human being,
I don't.

768
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,870
I don't like an attached to anything.
Yeah,

769
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,470
especially getting attached to the way 
you say things.

770
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,680
A certain lands.
Who gives a fuck and everybody's like.

771
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,990
Someone said that to me,
man.

772
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,180
You don't have to care for man fucking 
English.

773
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Going to be a second language and 
everybody's going to speak Spanish 

774
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,200
first.
I go,

775
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,390
well then I'll learn Spanish and fucking
dummy and guess what?

776
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,080
Stupid.
It's not.

777
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,610
It's not going to happen within my 
lifetime.

778
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,980
And if I grew up learning Spanish 
instead of English,

779
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,750
does that really make a difference?
God dammit.

780
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,990
Of course it doesn't.
You fucking stooge it's what you're 

781
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,961
thinking is what's important.
It's not what language you think it and 

782
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:05,900
that's dumb.
It's better if we all have one language.

783
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,060
Let's get rid of.
I mean we got rid of Latin.

784
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,020
Okay,
can we get rid of Chinese?

785
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,420
What's do this?
Kick that shit out.

786
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,260
You guys know what to say.
English things.

787
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,350
Come on.
Get rid of it.

788
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,670
The ultimate of a president got into 
office.

789
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,730
It's like,
first of all,

790
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,470
everybody's got to fucking learn 
English.

791
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,540
Done right.
You want to really communicate.

792
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,890
It's real simple.
Okay,

793
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,290
we'll learn English.
We won't bomb you.

794
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,060
You learn English.
Is that a deal?

795
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,040
The fuck.
Is it so hard?

796
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,950
No secret languages.
Kill all your other languages because I 

797
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,950
don't want you to be saying some shit 
that I don't understand.

798
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,600
The new president when I was 17,
I was on spring break and this is 

799
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,710
probably the problem is there's fucking 
a lot of dudes that are listening to 

800
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:46,710
that going,
well,

801
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:46,710
fuck you,
man.

802
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,120
He's going to fuck.
Good point.

803
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,470
We do have all the bombs.
Fuck all those Brown queers.

804
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,800
Queers in Quebec so you can French all 
over the world.

805
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:02,801
All of them.
Anyone fucking even English if the 

806
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:02,801
Spanish.
When I'm on the Spanish side,

807
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:03,670
I'm whoever's winning.
I'm with evolution.

808
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:04,760
God dammit.
Oh yeah.

809
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,040
Mexico comes over and takes over 
America.

810
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,690
Well,
I guess we have made cocaine legal.

811
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:13,691
You fuck like what you did.
Stupid fucking Mexican gangsters take 

812
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:15,530
over the country.
They realized how soft we are.

813
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,590
We're creating a whole nation of savage 
killers down there.

814
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,800
You know,
you've seen those video footages from 

815
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,631
live leak with a 12 year old hitman or 
fucking torturing people before they 

816
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:26,270
tell them Yo.
I mean,

817
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:28,400
that's right there.
You can derive their.

818
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:33,401
This is nuts.
The fact that we're not dealing with 

819
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:33,401
that.
We shouldn't even fucking Afghanistan.

820
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:38,380
It takes me 12 hours to get there on a 
plane who shouldn't be beer right next 

821
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,371
door where everyone's crazy,
where they're cutting people's fucking 

822
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:42,371
heads off and selling coke.

823
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,430
God Damn Mother fuckers on Hollywood 
fucking boulevard.

824
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,500
The Mexicans,
Mexicans are mad at me.

825
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,670
The French Canadians are mad at me.
I'm trying to piss off everybody already

826
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,370
know.
Everyone saw verizon.

827
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,690
French Canadian know.
I love you.

828
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,530
I love you and I love your poutine.
I love the comedy works in Montreal.

829
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:06,860
That little club I didn't last time.
It was a bunch of fucking great man.

830
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,520
Well,
you know,

831
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Montreal always confused me because I 
lived in Boston and I had this cold 

832
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:15,230
weather douchebag theory.
I was like,

833
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:20,231
well,
the reason why Boston people are so 

834
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:21,821
douchey is because it's cold as fuck up 
there and get you get angry like six 

835
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:21,821
months out a year,
you know,

836
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,590
mass holes we call them and you know.
But I was like,

837
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:26,150
but wait a minute,
I go up to Montreal,

838
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:29,060
it's three hours north or more,
right?

839
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,510
More drivings and like four hours,
no,

840
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,180
four hours for four fucking hours in a 
car north of Boston.

841
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,070
And the people are cool as fuck and it's
like a European city.

842
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:43,250
It's more sophisticated.
It's like the culture is totally 

843
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:43,680
different.
The women are so much nicer,

844
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,360
you know?
It's weird,

845
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,290
man.
It's a weird,

846
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,380
weird thing.
But also we're very polite so we hide 

847
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:51,840
that shit.
Like you guys are just like fuck you.

848
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:53,680
And we're like,
fuck this guy.

849
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,220
Yeah.
But fuck,

850
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,890
this guy's way nicer to be around.
I keep it together.

851
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,420
Shithead.
No.

852
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,100
Yeah,
I know you guys like Boston,

853
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:05,790
like everyone from 18 to 20.
Everyone's always up in Montreal.

854
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,530
Just partying because like you guys 
still have.

855
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:10,740
I still don't understand 21 to drink.
It's good.

856
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,710
It's good because it makes it harder for
people to get into bars.

857
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:17,070
It shouldn't be in bars and it's good 
because they don't know how to not drink

858
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,110
and drive yet.
That's the scariest shit.

859
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:24,111
Just got the license.
The as shit to me is kids that don't 

860
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:24,111
know how to drive and they're drinking,
you know?

861
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:26,040
I've seen.
I've seen stupid shit man.

862
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:29,280
I've seen people rear end people and 
I've seen many things.

863
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,840
I,
I think it's a good thing.

864
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:32,580
I think they shouldn't be able to drive 
for their 21.

865
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:37,730
I shouldn't have been able to drive,
but the problem is you have to work so 

866
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,981
you gotta let them drive it.
Eighteen or 17 or whatever the fuck it 

867
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:42,471
is,
but I saw some fucking kid down the 

868
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:43,410
street the other day in his mom's Lexis,
like it was a big lexus truck and suv.

869
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,450
He couldn't have been more than 15,
16 years old.

870
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,840
This kid was fucking riding my ass and 
weaving through traffic and cutting 

871
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,560
lanes off and going way over the speed 
limit.

872
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:53,070
I'm like,
kid,

873
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:54,540
you don't know how to drive.
Yeah.

874
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,690
You're like,
you're taking a big chance with a large 

875
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,110
vehicle that doesn't stop well,
it doesn't turn well at all,

876
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:05,111
or giant trucks and this fucking kid is 
driving like he's doing formula one 

877
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:05,470
racing.

878
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,160
Scary Shit.
Speed.

879
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,940
He got away with it.
I mean he got home,

880
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,941
he didn't die,
but something could have happened 

881
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:13,941
easily.
Someone could have fucked up.

882
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:14,730
Someone could have ran off a curb so you
know,

883
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:19,731
he could have had to make a split second
move and it would have been around what 

884
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:19,731
you think about it.
15,

885
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:21,540
16 years old.
Like I was retarded.

886
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,180
Retarded.
Totally like an idiot.

887
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,390
And to be in,
to be behind the wheel controlling is 

888
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,901
huge.
Hunk of metal around thousands of 

889
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:32,901
people.
Yeah.

890
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:34,020
I don't think that's a good idea.
It's funny.

891
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,480
This has been a topic of conversation 
recently.

892
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:39,450
Even though my message board about 
people that were like 21,

893
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:41,280
I was saying that when I was 20 I was 
retarded.

894
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:42,030
Like you know,
don't,

895
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,800
don't tell me what the fuck is going on 
when you're 20.

896
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,020
I don't want to hear you talk about,
you know,

897
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,320
what's wrong with the world when you're 
20 and a lot of people are going back in

898
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,880
the fucking Middle Ages,
you know,

899
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,020
20 was middle aged like you know,
you know,

900
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,140
we could try and don't discount my 
opinion because I'm 20 years old.

901
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I totally agree with you.
You have 10 kids and have you killed 

902
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,000
people playing world of warcraft,
your mom's basement.

903
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:11,700
You're not the same 20 year old and it's
not to undervalue Europe.

904
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,670
Your opinion or your observations.
You might be very intelligent.

905
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:17,070
You might have some observations that 
are very valid.

906
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Is Not saying that.
It's just say the fact that you're even 

907
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,840
confident enough to want people to 
listen to your opinion at 20 shows me,

908
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:27,390
you're on the wrong road to stop being 
cocky.

909
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,050
You should be like just asking questions
and looking around.

910
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,290
Just jumping in and,
and,

911
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,440
and trying to force your opinions on.
When you're 20,

912
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,160
you don't really know

913
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,960
that much.
It might have some information,

914
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:42,961
but man,
you look back and how when you were 

915
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:42,961
like,
when you were 20,

916
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:46,111
there's no 20 year old that is going to 
be able to stand on television with a 

917
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:46,600
microphone and tell the world what needs
to be fixed.

918
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,220
You know,
just fucking stopped dude.

919
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,710
It's a developmental cycle or you're 
very confident.

920
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,360
You're very intelligent.
Congratulations.

921
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:54,190
Yeah,
but don't get ahead of yourself.

922
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,490
Of course.
You know,

923
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,540
when I was 20 I was fucking dumb,
but I thought it was smart and I was 

924
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:00,540
right about a lot of things.
You know?

925
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:00,760
I had a good,
good point of view,

926
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,250
but it was still,
you're just fucking spastic.

927
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:05,290
You're just like that 15 year old kid 
driving that truck.

928
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,610
You don't know what the fuck you're 
doing.

929
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,260
You're slamming into walls and shit.
You don't know how to use the brakes.

930
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,940
I have once in a while I have to check 
in with early twenties John.

931
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:15,640
I mean it's morally like,
so like,

932
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,790
oh this I'm reading like I still am very
curious.

933
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,820
I love reading,
but at early twenties like I thought 

934
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,470
like I figured it out like my moral code
and I was so like,

935
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,120
what was the code?
We didn't know.

936
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,940
I was very much a,
a Vegan for.

937
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh really?
Yeah,

938
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,530
but that I know,
I know,

939
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:35,190
but that took me a little while to go.
Oh,

940
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,980
okay.
No,

941
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:40,981
because I was reading a lot,
like I'm trying to figure out what is a 

942
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,530
right decision was wrong and figuring it
out.

943
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,550
Sure.
And that was now like a totally 

944
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:47,550
different,
completely different person.

945
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,291
But in my early twenties,
like everything was an important moral 

946
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:52,291
decision and I have very,
like,

947
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:55,630
my parents are like really pentecostal,
like really religious,

948
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:57,020
very like good people,
but you know,

949
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,060
very religious people.

950
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,300
So I kind of have that baggage where I'm
like I'm trying to,

951
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,970
you know,
doing good is like what makes my parents

952
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:07,060
proud and as opposed to like oh I have 
all these fans and stuff.

953
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:10,150
Like if I do something like really nice 
or something like that,

954
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,860
that's when my parents are really proud 
of me.

955
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,540
So like,
I kind of have this thing,

956
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,570
so I was trying to figure like him and 
now you know,

957
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,810
you know,
and I'm 30 and living in La and you 

958
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,141
know,
like I've have a bit of success and so 

959
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:25,200
once in a while I have to go,
okay,

960
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,450
early twenties John,
am I being an asshole right now and am I

961
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:30,400
being a good person?
What do you think?

962
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,450
And a lot of the time he's like,
fuck you asshole.

963
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,970
Don't talk to me.
Well what's early twenties John?

964
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:36,240
A radical though,
was he?

965
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,370
No,
no,

966
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:37,840
no,
no,

967
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:43,140
no.
I'm still very close to who I was but I 

968
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,180
was much more like,
I guess rigid about things.

969
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:45,390
So like there's more like,
I dunno,

970
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,950
like I went to a certain,
like the super,

971
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,670
I still don't,
I when I'm shopping,

972
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:56,671
like I tried it give my money were like,
it's because buying is voting but back 

973
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:56,740
it's like,
really,

974
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,350
it's that early when you're figuring 
shit out,

975
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:00,790
you're like,
I just read this book.

976
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,190
And Naomi Klein's uh,
you know,

977
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,620
whenever the fuck it was called.
And I'm like,

978
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:06,970
okay,
I get it.

979
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:07,570
I don't know,
you know,

980
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,610
you try to like be,
I don't know,

981
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,440
it's everything's kind of black and 
white.

982
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,070
When you realize you get older,
you're like,

983
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,430
oh,
it's just all gray and you try to figure

984
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:20,431
it out.
You try to be a good person as much as 

985
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,010
you can and try to approach things with 
love and all that kind of stuff.

986
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,830
It's very tricky.
You know the eating of animals thing,

987
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:28,831
is it really a very controversial 
subject and I know a lot of people that 

988
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,700
have a lot of different opinions on it 
and they're all very,

989
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:34,040
very like adamant about how they are.
Like the people who eat meat

990
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
just really want to justify it and they 
get super aggressive about it and you 

991
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,260
know,
the people that don't,

992
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:44,261
they.
I mean I've had some annoying 

993
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:45,761
motherfuckers on my message board.
They want to talk to me about eating 

994
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:45,761
animals,
like don't do it.

995
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:46,820
Just try it and then go on and on and 
on.

996
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:51,821
Just trying to shove it in your throat 
like God damn you annoying fucking 

997
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,270
socially retarded dunce.
Whatever you're doing is going to make 

998
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,270
me not want to do it.
Do you not get that?

999
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,240
When people like say an annoying shit 
like that and like make a mistake,

1000
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,990
you know,
think of Karma kicking you in the Dick.

1001
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:04,430
Stupid.
Get Away,

1002
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,730
get away with your nonsense.
Those beans are alive.

1003
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,750
You fuck.
Okay.

1004
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:13,751
Those beans are eating.
They're screaming as you bite down on 

1005
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:13,751
it,
you boil them,

1006
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:17,471
they're dying in there.
They're rotting and boiling water that 

1007
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,070
led us screams and agony as you rip it 
from its fucking mother.

1008
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,350
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1009
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,970
That's life too stupid.
It's like,

1010
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:27,971
why is,
why is animal life more important than 

1011
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:27,971
plant life?
Because we're semi related,

1012
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:28,170
you know,
but that,

1013
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,530
that's fucking stupid because you step 
on bugs all the time.

1014
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,920
We're convenient.
Shitheads.

1015
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,110
All right.
And the funny,

1016
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,180
the most,
uh,

1017
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:39,181
the funniest thing is that eating meat 
and animal proteins helped us develop 

1018
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:44,130
like our and come to the point in our 
consciousness that where we are because 

1019
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,290
it helped develop the brain rapidly,
which is the fall.

1020
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,860
That's actually a controversial theory.
Yeah.

1021
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,700
Because it doesn't work that way with 
the other predators.

1022
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,450
I mean Jaguars when have big brands and 
by the way,

1023
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,480
but that was a theory that theory,
I believe was formulated before they 

1024
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,650
realize how many monkeys chimpanzees 
eat.

1025
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,270
No,
they didn't realize how,

1026
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,300
how fucking ruthless and violent chimps 
really were until they started doing 

1027
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:08,540
some studies.

1028
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,730
I forget the,
the,

1029
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,450
the um,
the guy's name who ran the show.

1030
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:17,451
It was like a BBC show,
but he was the first one to get footage 

1031
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:17,900
of chimps eating monkeys.
And I think that was in the nineties.

1032
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,480
So I think these ideas that they had 
about that,

1033
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,400
there was this too.
There's two other theories.

1034
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,780
One of them is a throwing arm and that 
when people develop the ability to throw

1035
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,160
things,
that,

1036
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:33,161
that sort of kicked off our evolution 
because we started killing things that 

1037
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:34,220
were far,
far away from us.

1038
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,810
Then we started getting better at 
hunting.

1039
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,400
We thrive.
Then as we thrive,

1040
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:40,790
we got a little bit more confidence and 
we started thinking about things more.

1041
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,250
It's like that the more calm you can 
get,

1042
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:48,251
the more control of your environment,
the more you have free time to think 

1043
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:52,421
about shit because you're not always 
fighting off Jaguars and all these 

1044
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:52,421
different things.

1045
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:52,850
So we figured out how to do things like 
throw spears,

1046
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,320
throw rocks,
you know?

1047
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,910
That's one theory.
That's another theory.

1048
00:43:55,911 --> 00:44:00,911
The other one is psychedelics.
The other one is psychedelic mushrooms 

1049
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,630
and that's the most controversial one,
but really the most fascinating one,

1050
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,760
and it's a terence Mckenna stoned ape 
theory and this theory is that somewhere

1051
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,250
along the line,
and this is the undisputable facts,

1052
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:15,251
somewhere along the line,
the human brain size doubled over a 

1053
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:17,480
period of 2 million years and that is in
the entire fossil record,

1054
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:19,880
the most confusing thing,
like more than anything,

1055
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:20,420
like they're like,
well,

1056
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:25,421
how does this happen?
Like it's weird for any Oregon to grow 

1057
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:28,720
double the size,
but the most spectacular Oregon as far 

1058
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,530
as creating things on the planet is in 
no question the brain,

1059
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:32,850
the human is when we alter our 
environment,

1060
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:35,850
we create nuclear bombs beyond beyond a 
doubt.

1061
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,260
It all happens supposedly inside this 
area and this area doubled in two years.

1062
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Well,
it's coincidentally also the same time 

1063
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:45,440
that the,
uh,

1064
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,680
the rain forest receded into grasslands.
There was a climate change and Terence 

1065
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,780
Mckenna's theory is that monkeys were 
forced or lower primates were forced to 

1066
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,011
come out of the trees and experiment 
with new foods sources because the rain 

1067
00:44:58,011 --> 00:45:01,541
forest were gone and these animals that 
were in this once lush tropical 

1068
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:02,580
environment had to adapt to this new 
environment.

1069
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:07,581
And one of the things they did was there
was a lot of cows that were eating the 

1070
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:08,460
grass and they would flip over counters 
looking for bugs.

1071
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,070
And that's the best place for cubensis 
mushrooms to grow.

1072
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,590
So these cubensis mushrooms would grow 
in this cow shit.

1073
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,450
And these,
these chips and those,

1074
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,540
whatever the fuck they were,
you know,

1075
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,020
lower primates Australia pivot gets 
wherever the fuck it was.

1076
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,650
They would eat these mushrooms.
And the idea is twofold.

1077
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:27,651
One that there was a,
a direct increase in their ability to 

1078
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:29,880
see things because when you eat suicide,
and especially in low doses,

1079
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:34,881
it increases your visual acuity.
And the other thing was that it would 

1080
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:38,610
give them this sort of community like 
loving atmosphere,

1081
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:43,320
protecting atmosphere and that will also
aid and they're less conflicts.

1082
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,750
The less conflicts that they had would 
aid in their innovation,

1083
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,490
you know,
just like with the other thing.

1084
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,640
And also they would start having 
psychedelic experiences and in large 

1085
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,220
doses these psychedelic experiences 
would slowly help them evolve much,

1086
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:59,970
much quicker and sort of figure things 
out that they may be not a figured out.

1087
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:05,210
And the idea of the really weird part of
the idea is that they think this is all 

1088
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,790
Mckenna and a few other psychos.
They think that what mushrooms are,

1089
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,570
is some sort of an alien intelligence 
that it's come here from an asteroid.

1090
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,530
Because the reason for that is there's 
no,

1091
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,580
like there's nothing that can survive in
a vacuum better than spores.

1092
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,820
And we know that a bunch of shit is come
here on asteroids from other planets 

1093
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,280
like Dna or excuse me,
I'm like,

1094
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:26,810
uh,
uh,

1095
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,530
amino acids are the building blocks for 
life and water.

1096
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:36,531
Water comes on comets and asteroids.
And we know that spores can survive in a

1097
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:42,021
vacuum.
And the idea is that somewhere on some 

1098
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:44,961
other planet there was some type of a 
spore and it came here on an asteroid 

1099
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,660
landed and the way it communicates with 
people as you eat it,

1100
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,410
this is what caused human beings to 
evolve at a monkey's.

1101
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:59,411
I mean,
it is one of those five bong hit stare 

1102
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:00,200
at space and think it through for like 
10 hours.

1103
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:05,201
At first.
It sounds totally ridiculous that 

1104
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:05,201
mushrooms,
mushrooms are silly,

1105
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:08,990
like you know,
if he's one scientist or whatever,

1106
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,960
that that thinks that there's scientists
really.

1107
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,250
I mean he was,
he was a scholar.

1108
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:14,180
I mean,
I don't know what it was.

1109
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:16,990
The ethno botanists I think was his 
chosen.

1110
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,930
If you ask any of the other thousands of
scientists that would know that anything

1111
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,030
close to what he's talking about when 
they think are very,

1112
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,700
very high,
you have to realize that as a scientist,

1113
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,010
first all getting

1114
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:35,010
behind anything that advocates a 
completely new direction in evolution 

1115
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:39,100
and one based on psychedelic mushrooms,
illegal drugs,

1116
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,520
that's a tough fucking sell.
So most scientists would never choose 

1117
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,150
that as a point of study.
It's a virtual cycle.

1118
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,810
No,
come on,

1119
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,510
could be that,
it could be that too,

1120
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,690
but it's also they discount the idea 
that mushrooms could be some sort of 

1121
00:47:55,030 --> 00:48:00,030
potential human evolution tool.
They discount that because it sounds 

1122
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,811
ridiculous that an illegal drug could 
potentially aid in your evolution and 

1123
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,010
most of them are ignorant of the 
experience itself.

1124
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,770
I mean maybe some of them are fucked 
around with it had a little bit,

1125
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,800
but to have a real full blown 
psychedelic experience,

1126
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:14,260
I guarantee you you wouldn't discredit 
it.

1127
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:17,450
So what are these monkeys?
Instead of like taking the cow turds,

1128
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,460
they were like,
they took one bite with like it says 

1129
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,750
gross and they told their friends food 
come on and they eat bugs.

1130
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,310
Eat ever go.
That's dumb.

1131
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:29,370
That's dumb.
Because they don't have observed the 

1132
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,280
mushrooms.
This whole theory does make it makes no 

1133
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:31,280
sense.
Right?

1134
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,561
Right.
But they do what they've observed the 

1135
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:33,561
meeting mushrooms.
So observe other long time ago,

1136
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:36,280
but no on monkeys now he,
you know,

1137
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:39,650
a lot of animals like target psychedelic
substances like rain,

1138
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:40,420
beard,
target,

1139
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,810
the Amanita mushrooms in Siberia.
It's,

1140
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,820
they're famous for it.
They like knock people over to get the 

1141
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:47,820
mushrooms.
They fucking love them.

1142
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,100
I dog used to knock shit over to get to 
my.

1143
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,280
We'd really,
really like little buckets and he'd just

1144
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,070
go and I come back and he'd be acting 
all weird and look in the ash tray.

1145
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:02,210
It's just like all empty and like,
no,

1146
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,840
it's this,
this subject is a very controversial one

1147
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,390
because whenever you,
um,

1148
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,600
the,
a lot of people have a very strong 

1149
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,510
opinion against this idea and they're 
just like,

1150
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,480
that's ridiculous.

1151
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,650
That doesn't make sense.
You know,

1152
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,430
mushrooms,
like,

1153
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,300
think about what the fuck mushrooms do 
do to you if you've done it,

1154
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,260
if you've ever done it,
you know what they do.

1155
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,790
It's fucking crazy.
Beyond description,

1156
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,940
your whole world changes.
Everything around you becomes 

1157
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,560
interlocking geometric patterns that you
can see through to infinity.

1158
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,560
Just that experience itself.
What the fuck is happening?

1159
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:40,770
Why is it so powerful and why it's so 
you Nana mostly positive do that to your

1160
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:46,600
mind what's going on?
And if it is an agent of evolution,

1161
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,300
right,
are you know,

1162
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:52,310
but you're not being poisoned that the 
ld 50 rate for siliciden mushrooms is 

1163
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,640
like fucking 50 pounds or something.
That's like what you have to eat to kill

1164
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:56,410
half the people.
It's ridiculous.

1165
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:01,411
It's like you can't die from it.
We were talking about like hundreds of 

1166
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:02,110
times more than the effective dose it 
would take to kill you.

1167
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,260
You'd have to be a total idiot to die 
for mushrooms.

1168
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:09,270
Right?
I mean there's a lot in you just 

1169
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,270
probably throw up.
Anyway.

1170
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,030
There were some.
I don't think anybody's ever died unless

1171
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:13,150
there's some toxic mold that was on it,
which is very common in my short.

1172
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,850
Not only that mushrooms that look like 
psilocybin mushrooms,

1173
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:19,000
but there's some other fucking one that 
completely jacks your system.

1174
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,050
But that's the problem with anything.
Like you could say.

1175
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,420
Again,
there's no mold on these mushrooms.

1176
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:24,600
You're not going to die and there could 
be mold on this.

1177
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,260
What you're supposed to be buying or not
buying,

1178
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:28,010
supposed to be eating and

1179
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,600
run out of the ground are supposed to be
legal.

1180
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,840
I know this is all subject of what we're
doing to like food.

1181
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,150
We don't let anybody grow their own 
mushrooms.

1182
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:43,151
We in.
It's fucking really hard to get to so 

1183
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,020
you don't know who's handling it and how
the guys growing it to yourself,

1184
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:50,021
it was legal.
You can have any God damned backyard or 

1185
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:51,911
in your basement.
You could grow a whole shelf of 

1186
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:51,911
mushrooms.
It's easiest.

1187
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:54,941
Fuck a dude who had like Scott Mushrooms
out here like I had back home.

1188
00:50:55,251 --> 00:51:00,251
He said,
have a reliable source where it didn't 

1189
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:00,251
kill me and it was awesome,
but I just,

1190
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:02,930
I just so weird when it's not controlled
your life.

1191
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Not only that,
it's selling who's selling something 

1192
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:07,960
illegal and that that's where it gets 
tricky.

1193
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,520
You know,
the real problem with illegal drugs is 

1194
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:12,520
you got to talk to people to get them.

1195
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,180
You know,
that's the deal with some dude and he 

1196
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,450
wants to sell you mushrooms.
Come on,

1197
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,330
man.
Who is this guy?

1198
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:19,550
You're selling mushrooms.
Where are you at in your life?

1199
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,960
You're selling mushrooms.
You know,

1200
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,400
how crazy are you?
You know you weren't a wire.

1201
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,510
Get the fuck over here.
You know,

1202
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:26,460
you know,
it's like,

1203
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,220
that's the problem.
It should,

1204
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:31,250
you shouldn't have to deal with some 
person is willing to break the law.

1205
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:31,730
It would,
would,

1206
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:33,380
it should be,
is there's no fucking law.

1207
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:38,470
And by the way,
there's a lot of cool people sell 

1208
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:38,470
mushrooms.
Don't get me wrong,

1209
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,010
I'm just teasing,
but what I'm saying is valid in a lot of

1210
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:40,680
cases,
man.

1211
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,040
I remember the guy we used to deal with,
this dude named Jake the snake.

1212
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,690
That's how you get weed for,
uh,

1213
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,780
before I got a medical card,
this motherfucker was so annoying.

1214
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,780
He was so annoying that Eddie Bravo had 
a choke him out like three times and 

1215
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780
couldn't believe that Eddie could choke 
them out.

1216
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,910
He's like,
man,

1217
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,810
it was a real fight,
dude.

1218
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,310
I kick your ass.
And so Eddie's like,

1219
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,170
come on man,
you act like an asshole.

1220
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,490
And the guy's like,
I'm telling you man,

1221
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,040
that shit ain't gonna work on me.
And I was like,

1222
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:01,760
okay,
okay,

1223
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:06,761
let's,
let's go out in the yard and let's say 

1224
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:06,761
it takes him down straggles and puts him
to sleep.

1225
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:07,270
Wakes him up.
Who?

1226
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,360
This happened,
man,

1227
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:09,680
I didn't fucking happen.
That's bullshit.

1228
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,450
You got lucky.
So they do it again.

1229
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:12,470
Let's go again.
Let's go again.

1230
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,880
He takes him down,
chokes him out,

1231
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,220
puts them to sleep like you fucking 
dummy.

1232
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:17,930
That's a black belt in Brazilian 
Jujitsu.

1233
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,360
Like really?
You think you could just,

1234
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,560
just,
you're just tough enough to fight that 

1235
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,291
shit off.
And this is where we used to get our 

1236
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:26,291
weed from.
It was so annoying.

1237
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:29,591
This guy was so dumb.
He was like a dude who's half his head 

1238
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:32,561
was made of cardboard.
It was just like there's something in 

1239
00:52:32,561 --> 00:52:32,561
there that's dulling your electrical 
circuits.

1240
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,260
His wet cardboard leaking on the 
circuitry is whole fucking thing is 

1241
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:38,720
shorting out.
It was just dumb.

1242
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,070
Motherfucker sold weed.
Yeah,

1243
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:41,820
that was his name.

1244
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,050
Uh,
the uh,

1245
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,130
the monkey thing possible,
man.

1246
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:54,150
Wait harder for me to go.
I believe in something then for me to 

1247
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,030
dis not whoa,
fuck.

1248
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:57,290
I just lost it.
I know what you're saying.

1249
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,920
But like,
yeah,

1250
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:02,280
I remained open.
Like just the fuck that we're we,

1251
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:07,380
we used to be like bacteria on this rock
and now we're sitting here talking with 

1252
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,010
headphones about shit on computers.
Like,

1253
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,430
yeah,
that's fucking weird.

1254
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,930
They go,
oh,

1255
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,190
maybe that happened.
Yeah,

1256
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,380
maybe it happened.
Like I'm not going to disbelief,

1257
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,910
but for me to go for sure that this 
thing that's harder to fix my point.

1258
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:20,890
Exactly.
Love that.

1259
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,900
You just said that.
I always say the exact same thing when 

1260
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:25,900
it comes to like Ufo and stuff and I'm 
like,

1261
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,040
why do you want to

1262
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
believe?
Do you have personal experience with a 

1263
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,040
Ufo?
You've been taking a board.

1264
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,350
How do you not know that all these 
people are crazy?

1265
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,090
Because I know a lot of crazy people,
man.

1266
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:35,210
People are full of Shit.
They lie a lot.

1267
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,680
You have to always keep that.
Brian always says it best.

1268
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:42,830
You always got to keep what you say.
You've always got to keep all doors 

1269
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:42,830
open.
So what do you say?

1270
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,780
We were talking about this once before 
when it was about Ufos.

1271
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,980
Oh,
keep everything on the table.

1272
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,920
I'll give you ever yet.
Not Everything on the table.

1273
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Don't just commit to one thing or the 
other man said when you were speaking 

1274
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,810
about life and,
and this is,

1275
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,870
I mean,
think about this is the nuttiest fucking

1276
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:02,871
shit ever.
There's a new study that they found it 

1277
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:05,570
and that life today resembles life of a 
billion years ago,

1278
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,680
or cancer today.

1279
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,680
Rather,
it resembles life of a billion years 

1280
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:12,690
ago.
That I'm going to try to find the.

1281
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,140
It's very scary because what it implies 
is that,

1282
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:17,430
you know,
what we came out of,

1283
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:19,030
we came out of here,
this right here.

1284
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,260
Here's the article.
Life resemble a cancer cells resembled 

1285
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,810
life 1 billion years ago,
and they have all these,

1286
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:26,370
uh,
these comparisons.

1287
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:27,380
And you know,
this all,

1288
00:54:27,381 --> 00:54:32,381
like some serious scientific study about
the origins of life and the origins of 

1289
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:32,730
cancer.
And the idea,

1290
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,800
and this is where it could be completely
insane,

1291
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:40,130
but the idea is if human life becomes so
fucked up and chaotic and so unnatural 

1292
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,590
and so polluted by chemicals and 
destroyed by ideology and nonsense,

1293
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:51,720
and we just breed ourselves down to 
mush.

1294
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,260
This is the mush.
What this is is this is what started 

1295
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,681
life in the first place.
Life was just a series of fucking cells 

1296
00:55:00,681 --> 00:55:04,281
that grew out of control and became 
eventually human beings and for this 

1297
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:08,571
shit to be growing inside of us at an 
ever expanding rate constantly is like 

1298
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,420
the primordial ooze trying to reclaim 
its creation.

1299
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,320
This is the universal fucking extra 
sketch and they're shaking it right now.

1300
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,980
Wrap your fucking head around that man.
That's what cancer is,

1301
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:24,981
man.
What cancer is is absolute proof 

1302
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:27,231
positive that this is the wrong path and
the universe is slowly swallowing the 

1303
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:28,770
human race.
Back up,

1304
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,810
wrap your shit around that homey.
That's the universe is know as art.

1305
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,540
Fuck man.
You know,

1306
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,880
and we don't,
we don't look at it that way.

1307
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:40,350
I mean we're obviously just learning 
this,

1308
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:45,351
but we don't look at it as being 
something that could be reversed that 

1309
00:55:45,351 --> 00:55:45,690
quickly.
But look at like,

1310
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,840
you know,
they're talking about like cancer of 

1311
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:50,840
like,
like the $10,000

1312
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:50,840
100,000
years ago.

1313
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,420
The people didn't get cancer,
they didn't get cancer.

1314
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:57,421
And there's a lot of scientists that 
believe that all cancer is within the 

1315
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,170
industrial age and previously before 
that,

1316
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:01,410
any exposure to chemicals and things 
that Cortina just shit,

1317
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,500
but this shit doesn't really exist in 
nature.

1318
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,000
And when you're eating a,
like a,

1319
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,820
a primate or um,
what,

1320
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,510
what would you call it?
A Paleo Diet,

1321
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,460
you know,
evolve vegetables and all,

1322
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,150
uh,
you know,

1323
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:17,390
clean animals that you kill,
like you're not getting introduced to 

1324
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,140
any of the shit that creates cancer.
And I don't know if that's right or no.

1325
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:24,141
I mean,
I don't know how the fuck they could 

1326
00:56:24,141 --> 00:56:24,141
ever prove it.
Yeah.

1327
00:56:24,141 --> 00:56:24,141
They would have to go back in time,
you know,

1328
00:56:24,141 --> 00:56:24,141
whatever.
1,000

1329
00:56:24,141 --> 00:56:26,200
years or whatever the fuck it was before
people ever figured out how to fuck with

1330
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,700
chemicals.
What is at 10,000

1331
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:28,630
years ago.
Not even,

1332
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,620
probably only a couple chemicals.
I mean,

1333
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:35,980
when was the first cancer?
When was the first cancer ever recorded?

1334
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,710
Fuck this.
It's a really interesting thing,

1335
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:43,711
man,
because let's say let's just get crazy 

1336
00:56:43,711 --> 00:56:46,201
and let's give it a few thousand years.
Let's say the first cancer started like 

1337
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:46,201
2000 years ago.

1338
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:47,020
Okay.
If that is the case,

1339
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:52,370
we think about what a short period of 
time that is 2000 years to tonight to 

1340
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,970
today and you compare how much more 
people have cancer now and how many more

1341
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:59,260
people are around now than before in 
constantly we're working on a cure for.

1342
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,970
We're going to figure it out.
We're going to figure it out.

1343
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,110
It's like,
Whoa,

1344
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,400
what is this?
Yeah,

1345
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,500
what the fuck is cancer life?
It's life growing out of control and the

1346
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:11,860
way to get this is the crazy thing about
life growing out of control and cancer,

1347
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,400
the way they kill it is it's fucking 
poison the shit out of you.

1348
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,460
They poisoned the shit out of you and 
they hope that this,

1349
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:21,570
this thing dies before the host does.
That's what chemotherapy is.

1350
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,210
That's terrifying.
That's a terrifying notion.

1351
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:30,390
It's like you have a parasite inside you
and we're going to slowly bring you to 

1352
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,480
death's door and hopefully it'll kill 
the parasite.

1353
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:36,870
And then you get to like start eating 
oatmeal again and walking without a 

1354
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:36,870
limp.
And then as soon as that happens,

1355
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,270
get.
Oh,

1356
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,250
your friend is back for another fucking 
round,

1357
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,880
grabs a hold of you,
tried to choke you and drag you to the 

1358
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:44,880
ground.

1359
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Brother had,
uh,

1360
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,330
Hodgkin's roommate is like a 14 years 
old.

1361
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,220
Oh my God.
I had lumps and stuff.

1362
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,170
We want to see a doctor first.
Dr Wentz.

1363
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:50,860
See like,
Hey,

1364
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:55,861
you're working out.
It's normal something your glands or 

1365
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:55,861
whatever.
Okay.

1366
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:57,310
Go to a second doctor.
I know you have cancer.

1367
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,340
Like I know he did it.
A chemotherapy and everything is fine 

1368
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,980
and you know where the lumps like a 
dude,

1369
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,890
he had like this huge lump right here.
Like,

1370
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,210
yes.
Joey Dexter had the dude name Philip.

1371
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,720
Michael.
Michael.

1372
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,880
Michael Hall in the eighties movies.

1373
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:18,830
Um,
so yeah,

1374
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:20,110
it's a really common thing,
right?

1375
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,070
Yeah.
What is it?

1376
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:22,630
What do they think it's cross from?
They have any idea?

1377
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,320
Is it genetic?

1378
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,570
Because idea,
man.

1379
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,750
And at the same time we grew up like,
we're just like eating,

1380
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,940
like I'm a big family,
they brothers and sisters,

1381
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:33,360
so we'd like we'd eat hot dogs and 
hamburger helper and,

1382
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,420
and just,
you never know where it can come from 

1383
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,710
anywhere.
It can be genetic and like all that 

1384
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:41,710
stuff.
Uh,

1385
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:44,821
my,
my aunt died of the same thing when she 

1386
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:48,030
was 24 like way back when she was young.
So it's somewhat in the genetics,

1387
00:58:48,031 --> 00:58:49,410
but at the same time,
you never know.

1388
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,940
May Not even like,
I'm like,

1389
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,850
I do go to a doctor like twice a year or
no,

1390
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:56,080
I don't go to the doctor probably for 
that reason.

1391
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,630
I probably should.
Wow.

1392
00:58:57,631 --> 00:58:59,040
That's terrifying.
Yeah.

1393
00:58:59,041 --> 00:58:59,940
No,
it is really,

1394
00:58:59,941 --> 00:59:01,050
really healthy.
Yeah,

1395
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:01,620
I will.
Well,

1396
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,050
I know a dude who eats really brown.
He's got cancer right now.

1397
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:04,930
Oh,
just,

1398
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:10,110
he's.
He's got really pale skin and he's 

1399
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,751
always out in the sun.
Apparently it got some skin cancer and 

1400
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:14,211
cancer and eats terrible.
It's all mashed potatoes and fucking 

1401
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:14,280
meatloaf and you know,
no vitamins.

1402
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,530
So homeboys got to start eating like 
serious,

1403
00:59:16,531 --> 00:59:17,970
serious,
heavy green diet.

1404
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,050
Very leafy,
thick,

1405
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:24,051
green vegetables.
Whenever I do that man and I got really 

1406
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:24,051
heavily

1407
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:24,650
into like eating salads,
like big salads every day.

1408
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,080
Really feel way better.
It's really amazing.

1409
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,530
It's like,
yeah,

1410
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,320
most of our food is so fucking like 
dead.

1411
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,960
You know,
like you can get something.

1412
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,900
There's something out of eating plants 
and eating live things,

1413
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:37,580
you know,
you really do get something from it.

1414
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,830
But the thing is you've gotta get you 
gotTa,

1415
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,940
get fresh,
organic like in Montreal,

1416
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,790
like I just went back there last week.
It's snow storm,

1417
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:51,791
like nothing fresh is growing there.
So everything's important from all 

1418
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:55,871
around the world sprayed with Kent if 
you're not getting organic and fresh 

1419
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,100
like the shit's been in a freezer,
sitting in chemicals,

1420
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:01,020
get a wash your lettuce.
My brother worked at uh,

1421
01:00:01,021 --> 01:00:06,021
a fruit and vegetable place.
He said they used to take the celery 

1422
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:07,390
out.
You have to wear gloves when you like.

1423
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:12,470
They'd unloaded from the boxes and put 
it in the front because he'd get burns 

1424
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,540
on his hands from the chemicals that 
were on the celery.

1425
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,000
I think about that shit.
You're putting that in your body man.

1426
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:20,210
And how long do you have to wash the 
salary for that shit to get?

1427
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,030
How long would it take before you 
started getting burns?

1428
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,680
Oh,
he said like you write like you learn 

1429
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:28,680
right away,
like it,

1430
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,030
you handle it a bit and it's just the 
chemicals,

1431
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:30,980
especially on celery for some reason.
Fuck,

1432
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:31,970
I love salary,
man.

1433
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:33,520
I made celery juice all the time.
Yeah.

1434
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,080
Well if you get then once again organic 
too,

1435
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,500
but still.
Yeah,

1436
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,760
I've heard a lot of organic is bullshit 
to label it as organic and it's not 

1437
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,880
really organic.
What does organic stand for?

1438
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:44,290
I mean,
what is it?

1439
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:46,160
What is the actual definition of 
organic?

1440
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:48,380
Does it mean no chemicals?
No pesticides.

1441
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,770
No genetically modified.
I think that's what it's supposed to 

1442
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:53,770
mean.
Boast to me then.

1443
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:57,310
But as we know,
you watch those documentaries like food 

1444
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:57,310
inc,
like it's just the,

1445
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,370
uh,
the genetically modified.

1446
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,710
This shit's like flies all over.
That's nuts.

1447
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,380
Yeah.
Well,

1448
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:06,400
that's what's really crazy about 
genetically modified crops is how they 

1449
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,431
affect other farmers have gotten sued 
because the shit flew through the air 

1450
01:01:09,441 --> 01:01:13,730
and landed on their fields and they 
found there these crops and they,

1451
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,740
they'll do a test on them and then these
guys have to go to court and they want 

1452
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,970
money from them.
It's like it's the most evil shit ever.

1453
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:22,260
Monsanto is one of the most evil 
corporations ever,

1454
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:27,550
by the way.
And there was some fucking thing online 

1455
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,060
about them buying blackwater.
Uh,

1456
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,740
I don't know if they did.
I don't know if they did,

1457
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:33,170
but there was like people were like,
this is the end of the world,

1458
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,390
just like the most evil organizations 
ever.

1459
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,700
And one's going to buy the other and 
they're going to become one massive,

1460
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:39,080
super evil organization.

1461
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,140
Could you imagine there?
They want to fuck over the whole world.

1462
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:43,610
They want to take over the food 
industry.

1463
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:46,130
They want to make sure that people have 
to pay them for their crops.

1464
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,390
You don't own your crops,
you don't own the seed.

1465
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:51,980
You can't replant the seeds.
And we got an army.

1466
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:57,130
We got an army that army that will do 
anything we tapped.

1467
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,460
I need to find out if that actually is 
still happening or if it was bullshit or

1468
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:03,590
if they just hired him for something.
Um,

1469
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,680
yeah.
There's this great French documentary 

1470
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,691
life according to Monsanto,
which is on Google that people should 

1471
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:10,691
watch it.
It's crazy.

1472
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:12,650
What's the seed called?
The one that doesn't,

1473
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,670
um,
you know,

1474
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:16,640
you have to keep buying it.
The not the shot.

1475
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,950
This shotgun there.
It's something.

1476
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,010
It's a

1477
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,120
seat that doesn't,
you know,

1478
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,200
it,
it's not a crop that will keep coming 

1479
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,200
back.
You have to plant it every season.

1480
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,230
Um,
fuck modified seed that you have to 

1481
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:34,731
just.
The farmers are at Monsanto's mercy 

1482
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:35,630
because they can't just keep some of the
crops and like they,

1483
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,550
these things die every year to keep 
buying.

1484
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,290
They've engineered dealer.
Yeah.

1485
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:43,620
They engineered the uh,
what's this crazy world anyway.

1486
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,520
But yeah,
no,

1487
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:46,350
they're like,
you've looked at them.

1488
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,070
Well,
okay.

1489
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:49,950
Here's the answer there.
They're hiding it because it's a,

1490
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,510
they've.
This is one,

1491
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,540
one article said Monsanto Buys 
Blackwater and then another argument or 

1492
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:01,131
another article rather says,
black has been sold via shell company 

1493
01:03:01,131 --> 01:03:04,911
and a pair of private equity firms,
so does this mean Monsanto has actually 

1494
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:10,380
bought into Blackwater and they're 
saying there's no way to know how creepy

1495
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:12,120
and scary or these motherfuckers

1496
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:17,190
when one of the biggest corporations 
that controls the food on this planet 

1497
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,550
has its own private army.
Not Crazy.

1498
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,760
Come.
This isn't being discussed.

1499
01:03:21,761 --> 01:03:23,410
Everybody wants to talk about how many 
black guys,

1500
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:24,460
Kim Kardashians.

1501
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:28,230
Everyone wants to know gay people 
shouldn't get married.

1502
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:30,300
Yeah.
This has taken over the world and you're

1503
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:32,730
worried about fucking guys getting 
married.

1504
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,740
Crazy thing is people think this is 
ridiculous.

1505
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:36,950
This is like hippie nonsense.
All this fucking.

1506
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,350
You know,
what?

1507
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:38,250
Are you doing this?
No,

1508
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:38,520
no,
no.

1509
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:41,820
This is big business is what this is,
is the biggest business in the world.

1510
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,120
The number one business in the world 
besides drugs is food and the only 

1511
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,730
reason why drugs is more than foods 
because drugs is illegal.

1512
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,890
You know,
foods worth way more than drugs.

1513
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,810
Drugs should be cheaper,
but they're illegal.

1514
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,700
You know,
I mean fuck man,

1515
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,730
but it's probably not even close anyway.
More people spend way more money on food

1516
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:58,480
than drugs anyway,
even though drugs are illegal.

1517
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,320
Even though I forget what I was saying.
Like a mania would.

1518
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:06,740
You'd have to be off the charts.
Everybody would have been off the 

1519
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:06,740
charts.
But anyway.

1520
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,570
So how the fuck man,
how could this happen?

1521
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,690
I man,
dude,

1522
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:13,730
I.
that's so scary.

1523
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:19,030
It's very scary.
I mean I just read like on another 

1524
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:21,910
similar kind of thing I just read about 
there's gonna start selling genetically 

1525
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:25,001
modified salmon that grows twice as big 
and in half the time and you're laying 

1526
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:25,940
there like,
oh,

1527
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:30,941
we're not too worried about the cross 
pollination and going into the why do 

1528
01:04:32,191 --> 01:04:33,950
you have no,
and they're like,

1529
01:04:33,951 --> 01:04:35,230
oh,
the tests have proven that it's,

1530
01:04:35,231 --> 01:04:37,610
it's fine.
Like there's no really.

1531
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,760
How long have you tested this on a 
generation of people?

1532
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,070
No you haven't.
No one has a fucking clue.

1533
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,570
No fucking idea.
They're like,

1534
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:45,980
oh,
we tried for three months.

1535
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,240
He never.
No one got sick.

1536
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:52,390
Let's put a new species of animal that 
will be out on the market for people to 

1537
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:52,390
eat.

1538
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,110
There's a fish that,
um,

1539
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,080
let me just,
uh,

1540
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,200
whenever an animal comes from another 
ecosystem and invades as an alien thing 

1541
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,100
can ruin everything.
Man.

1542
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:06,350
I think there's,
I think it's called the snake and I 

1543
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:06,350
think that's the name of the fish,
but it's a fish that I believe it's from

1544
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:11,211
Africa.
I'm just talking out of my ass right 

1545
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:11,211
now.
I'll find out what it is.

1546
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:12,840
But snakehead invasion is what I'm going
to look up because these fish,

1547
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:17,130
they started showing up in,
in lakes and ponds.

1548
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,920
Just eating everything dude.
Eating everything.

1549
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:21,840
Yes.
Snakehead.

1550
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,830
That's exactly what it is.
Yeah.

1551
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:28,831
They're in.
They've turned up and lakes and rivers 

1552
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,651
all over the country and it's,
it's a real big problem because they're 

1553
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:33,900
like,
they're like invincible breed.

1554
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:35,920
Like a motherfucker I'm looking forward 
on here.

1555
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:41,370
Um,
it doesn't say what country it comes 

1556
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:41,470
from Cobra.

1557
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,670
Wikipedia.
See,

1558
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,920
it's a.
it's a scary thing though,

1559
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:49,090
man.
They just come in and like,

1560
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:54,091
imagine if you're like,
the guy likes going fishing and they're 

1561
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:54,091
scary as fuck.
Looking man,

1562
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:56,170
they look like some fucking crazy 
dinosaur thing,

1563
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:56,980
man.
Okay.

1564
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,410
They are from Africa,
so I wasn't talking out my ass.

1565
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,320
So this is the.
This is the fish.

1566
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,670
It's.
It looks like.

1567
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,430
Look at this shit.
It looks like a dinosaur.

1568
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,490
Yeah,
it looks like a dinosaur.

1569
01:06:10,491 --> 01:06:12,730
I mean look at that fucking thing.
That's creepy.

1570
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:16,240
Looking front extension and dudes just 
have them for pets.

1571
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:21,241
I had paranas for pets and it was 
against the law because of that very 

1572
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:21,910
reason.
Yeah.

1573
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,250
But I know a dude who knows a dude,
you know what I'm saying?

1574
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:25,660
We'll get you some Palanas.
Yo.

1575
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:29,920
I had to like get illegal paranas and 
it's pretty bad as it was,

1576
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:31,950
but it wasn't like your cat in there.

1577
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,890
The feed them like what need you do?
I love my man.

1578
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,920
Come on.
Well,

1579
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,070
what?
It had no freedom.

1580
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,560
Goldfish.
Goldfish.

1581
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,440
Goldfish is a.
is what they love.

1582
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:43,360
Yeah.
It's a,

1583
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,190
it's a trip.
Watching a feat to man.

1584
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,380
You can feed them hot dogs and shit like
that too.

1585
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:49,240
If you're really not into watching them 
kill something,

1586
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,870
but there's something so primal about 
watching those fucking things.

1587
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:56,420
Just to attack a school of goldfish and 
the Goldfish,

1588
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,940
it was really a sick thing that I should
do.

1589
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,970
I used to get a bag of goldfish and then
I would sit.

1590
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,370
I'd pull my bar stool in front of this 
giant tank.

1591
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,020
I just trying to take how many,
how many of the Pronto?

1592
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:11,370
At one point I had 30 Jesus.
It was a big tank is huge tankers.

1593
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,080
I don't know.
Hundreds of gallons.

1594
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,850
I forget how many hundreds,
but it was really big.

1595
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,750
Anyway.
It was made where we're a thousand.

1596
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,480
It might have been over a thousand 
gallons I think.

1597
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,850
Whoa.
I don't even remember anymore.

1598
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:23,010
It's been so many years.
Anyways,

1599
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,730
big tank.
I had too many.

1600
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:26,560
When I had like 30.
It was good number.

1601
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:31,561
When I had like five five's a good 
number because they get crazy and you 

1602
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:31,561
started to kick start killing each 
other.

1603
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,870
If you have too many of them are not.
Even if you have too many of them,

1604
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:37,300
just one of them shows up with a limp.
That's a wrap.

1605
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,560
That's a wrap.
Daisy,

1606
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,480
even if they're not hungry,
they just attack them.

1607
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,860
They just tack them and fuck them up.
So um,

1608
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:48,060
I would uh,
dumped the goldfish in there and they 

1609
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,540
would look at the goldfish for a second 
and they would like slowly move closer,

1610
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:54,541
slowly move closer and then one of them 
would go for it and when one of them 

1611
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:54,690
would go for it,
they would just dart,

1612
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,780
snap and cut a goldfish in half and then
the blood would be in the water and then

1613
01:07:58,781 --> 01:08:00,370
it was on like donkey Kong.

1614
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,700
And then I would sit there and watch 
them go back and forth and chasing them 

1615
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,040
around these little driftwood things and
shit.

1616
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,350
And the Goldfish don't know what the 
fuck is going on.

1617
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,910
And they're just getting cut down like a
Goddamn horror movie.

1618
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:17,110
And their primal man,
they're fucking savage stealing dead 

1619
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,080
goldfish from each other.
Like one's got a half a goldfish.

1620
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,930
The other one comes up and bite it off 
of his face.

1621
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,460
So after like a good,
like,

1622
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,110
like killing.
When they would go nuts,

1623
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:29,320
they would be missing lips and shit.
Their lips would be because there would 

1624
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,350
be stealing from each other and they cut
their own lips off,

1625
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,660
so they were always like this.
Really.

1626
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:37,830
They're creepy looking anyway,
but there were even more creepy when 

1627
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,661
they're.
They're white teeth were exposed and 

1628
01:08:40,661 --> 01:08:42,821
they'd be swimming around his fucking 
tank and a lot of people cut their lips 

1629
01:08:42,821 --> 01:08:46,540
off just so they can see the white teeth
and you pull them out and you remove 

1630
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:50,291
their lips and then you put them back in
the water and they swim around and they 

1631
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:50,291
swim around like monsters.

1632
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,470
They look.
They look even scarier that way.

1633
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,180
Modified paranas dude.
There's a fucking crazy parana.

1634
01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:00,210
It's a.
it's a like a cousin to a persona and 

1635
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:00,260
they just fuck.
What is the name of it?

1636
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:03,380
This big tiger fish and they just caught
one in the Congo.

1637
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:05,450
This guy went and they had this TV show 
about it.

1638
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,660
He caught this thing in the Congo.
It's the nuttiest thing you've ever seen

1639
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,600
in your life.
It's got teeth that are as long as great

1640
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:13,910
white shark teeth,
enormous teeth,

1641
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:19,090
and it looks like a monster.
It does not look like a real fish and 

1642
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:22,900
just this ridiculous mouth of giant 
fucking teeth and just the dead eyes and

1643
01:09:23,651 --> 01:09:27,260
his big fucking plate covered body of 
death,

1644
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:32,470
just swimming through incredibly fast 
waters and fucking things up and it's 

1645
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,920
huge.
It's a hundred pounds,

1646
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,870
150 pounds.
They killed people.

1647
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,350
They've bitten people's legs and shit.

1648
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,170
Taking chunks out of them.
You fall in man,

1649
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,460
they bite you.
If you're still in there,

1650
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:41,960
they're going to keep biting.
Set.

1651
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:43,420
It's a wrap.
There's a bunch of them,

1652
01:09:43,421 --> 01:09:46,280
man.
They really are like a giant Purana that

1653
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,320
we're separated from these man.
Those things had the legs.

1654
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,610
We'd all need to.
Well,

1655
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:57,611
we're fucked.
If fucking mountain lions increasing 

1656
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,030
population in California,
especially southern California.

1657
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:01,190
It's every couple of years.
Some asshole on a bike.

1658
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,420
It's jacked by a cougar.
I know.

1659
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:08,421
I love fucking hiking,
but I guess so smoking and going hiking 

1660
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:12,461
and I get so apparent.
I walk around and my brother came to 

1661
01:10:12,461 --> 01:10:15,251
visit me.
I was walking around with rocks because 

1662
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:15,620
it's not discovery channel thing,
but people getting attacked by mountain.

1663
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,510
Bring Mace if you want to bring 
something.

1664
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:22,511
Bring.
Like I had bear mace that I used to 

1665
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:22,511
bring when I would live in Colorado.

1666
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:22,910
When I lived in Colorado,
I used to carry a gun.

1667
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:26,060
I carry two guns once a gun always.
And Mace.

1668
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,510
I bring Mace because bears.
You don't really want to shoot bears 

1669
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,510
man,
because first of all,

1670
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,720
the nine millimeter you shoot a bear,
guess what?

1671
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:35,090
You're not going to kill him.
You're just going to make them really,

1672
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,170
really fucking mad.
You know?

1673
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,380
And Colorado doesn't have too many.
Grizzlies are.

1674
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:41,780
A lot of it was black bears,
but they could.

1675
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,640
I mean Shit.
And they're in Montana.

1676
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:45,250
They're in a lot of places you don't 
know.

1677
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:50,260
I mean they don't have a real accurate 
number of how many grizzlies are out 

1678
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,831
there and if they've found a few in 
Colorado it was because there was a zoo 

1679
01:10:53,831 --> 01:10:55,850
that we went to that they had to 
grizzlies that were in the zoo.

1680
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:59,510
And the reason why they had them in 
there was because they had gotten to use

1681
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:04,511
to people and they start jacking 
people's garbage and once they start 

1682
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:04,511
jacking your garbage,
that's it.

1683
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:05,660
They know that that's a food source and 
they never quit.

1684
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,180
They just didn't ever move on to a new 
neighborhood.

1685
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:13,390
They just will camp out and just jack 
your garbage every night so it becomes 

1686
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,550
an issue and they have to kidnap him.
Fuck it,

1687
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:16,560
man.
That's when you see them out there.

1688
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,090
I mean,
I never saw a bear in the wild,

1689
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:23,091
but I did see a mountain lion.
But seeing a bear in the zoo and just 

1690
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:26,691
thinking about this thing is allowed to 
roam around in the same area as you 

1691
01:11:26,691 --> 01:11:28,050
like.
This is a monster.

1692
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:33,660
Giant fucking enormous monster.
And sometimes they get really hungry.

1693
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,420
Oh,
and let your kids don't fuck.

1694
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,850
They'll fuck you up man.
Just see grizzly man.

1695
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:39,720
No,
no,

1696
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,940
no to you guys.
The best comedy ever.

1697
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,040
Oh my God.
What's Grizzly man?

1698
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:47,220
Grizzly man is a documentary about this 
guy named Timothy Treadwell.

1699
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:52,550
Timothy Treadwell was this guy.
It was like a love with grizzlies was 

1700
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:53,520
one of the weirdest things ever mad,
really strange,

1701
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:58,580
and the guy was Uber Gay,
just really gay and completely in denial

1702
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:05,240
and the way he would like face his 
gayness was to live in the woods with 

1703
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,800
these fucking bears.
It was the strangest thing ever.

1704
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:12,980
Has God.
There was so many deep psychological 

1705
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:12,980
issues going on with this guy barry 
closet.

1706
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:17,800
Yeah,
like the interview his friends and 

1707
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:17,800
they're like,
well,

1708
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:17,800
he used to talk in an accent,
but then he stopped.

1709
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:17,800
He just one of those guys.
I mean,

1710
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,780
it's completely nuts and he'd be out 
there.

1711
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,930
I'm the only one who's out here saving 
these bears.

1712
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,520
Meanwhile,
the park rangers like,

1713
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:25,350
you don't have to save them.
All right there bears.

1714
01:12:25,351 --> 01:12:28,200
No one's here not doing anything.
Like you're crazy.

1715
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,460
You're living with these bears.

1716
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:29,820
You're,
you're,

1717
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:33,150
you're actually endangering the bears 
because you're getting the beers used to

1718
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:35,820
being in contact with humans and that's 
what gets bears in trouble.

1719
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:40,821
They get used to people being around 
because he's around all the time and 

1720
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:40,821
like,
oh,

1721
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:40,821
well let me go just jack this dude 
picnic basket.

1722
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:41,930
And then you gotta shoot him.
So what?

1723
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,980
He's actually doing his fucking these 
bears over,

1724
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:49,070
right?
So this guy is just out there every 

1725
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:49,070
year.
I'm here saving these bath.

1726
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,460
These parents without me,
they'd be nowhere.

1727
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,300
And they're like,
he's.

1728
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,230
He calls them my.
Has a bunch of names so I am.

1729
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,420
Hello Mr.
Cupcake,

1730
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,090
you know,
and the bear takes a shit and he runs up

1731
01:12:57,091 --> 01:12:57,900
to the pair shit.
He goes,

1732
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,400
oh,
it's warm.

1733
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,760
Oh it just came out of her.
But it just came out of her.

1734
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:07,761
But this is warm.
Like this guy is touching it and he's 

1735
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:11,571
excited that he's in contact with this 
shit that just came out of her ass and 

1736
01:13:11,571 --> 01:13:11,571
I'm not kidding.

1737
01:13:11,571 --> 01:13:14,210
And he thinks it's a magical shit.
I could just amazed by this.

1738
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,940
Amazing.
It's warm.

1739
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,080
He actually said that she's feeling her 
shit saying that it's warm because you 

1740
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,270
imagine if he was doing that to a woman,
a woman,

1741
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,060
a woman,
you know,

1742
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,800
he runs into her bathroom and fucking 
jacks are shit.

1743
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,200
And he's holding onto it.
It's just came out of her.

1744
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:31,260
But it's warm.
It's just as bizarre.

1745
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,630
Just as bizarre to be doing that with a 
fucking bear.

1746
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:36,120
You weird.
Great movie at the end.

1747
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,090
He dies.
Yeah,

1748
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,290
sure it is.
It's um,

1749
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:43,340
Werner Herzog.
Fucking fascinating because it seems 

1750
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,250
like Werner Herzog is not in on the 
joke,

1751
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:49,251
which makes it even more interesting.
It's like his guy is a brilliant 

1752
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:49,920
documentarian.
Does he know how hilarious is,

1753
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:53,100
is because it doesn't appear that he 
does because it's doesn't seem like he's

1754
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:54,480
playing it off that way at all.

1755
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,160
And even when he talks to the woman at 
the end,

1756
01:13:56,161 --> 01:14:01,161
I would love to sit down with him,
like off the record and asked him a 

1757
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:01,161
question.
I would love to go blue.

1758
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,850
Did you know that was funny when you 
were doing it?

1759
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:05,130
Yeah,
because it's God damn brilliant dude.

1760
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:07,440
It's hilarious.
It's so funny.

1761
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:12,470
I was like great.
Christopher guest movie deadpan 

1762
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,850
everybody to bring in like the sheriff 
from up in Alaska.

1763
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:14,840
Well I knew he was going to get in 
trouble up there.

1764
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,710
These interviews,
these people,

1765
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:20,740
and they're talking about how like,
how he had to,

1766
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:25,741
you know,
recognize the body and now they had to 

1767
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:25,741
shoot the bear because the bear was 
still there,

1768
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:26,410
like guarding over the bodies.
Yeah.

1769
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:28,240
They had,
the guy had flown over.

1770
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:33,330
Oh yeah,
you have to kill them once they start 

1771
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:33,330
killing people.
You have to cry.

1772
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:33,330
But it was an old what it was.

1773
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,160
Was he the guy they called it suicide by
bear.

1774
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,240
And what happened was the guy had just 
decided to stay way past.

1775
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:42,670
You're supposed to and when you get to a
certain point in time,

1776
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:48,030
the bears that are conscious or that are
up that aren't hibernating or all the 

1777
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,571
ones who are dying,
they're all really old and the really 

1778
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:52,480
old bears get desperate and they can't.
They can't get any food.

1779
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,070
And they started killing their own 
babies.

1780
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:59,370
And when,
when you see bears killed their own 

1781
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,351
babies,
you're supposed to get the fuck out of 

1782
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:01,351
there,
right?

1783
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:01,351
Because if they're killing their babies,
they're desperate.

1784
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:01,351
It's fuck,
you know,

1785
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:03,130
they're eating anything.
They eat their own goddamn babies.

1786
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,460
And um,
he,

1787
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,500
he basically went back and like October,
November when the bears are camping and 

1788
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,110
in,
and a bear killed him and took a long 

1789
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:13,990
time and there's a video,
but there's no,

1790
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:16,330
there's no image because the lens cap 
was on,

1791
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,480
but the camera was running and they have
like seven minutes of him getting torn 

1792
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,440
apart by bears,
by this one bear.

1793
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:26,650
And because the thing about bears is 
they just start eating.

1794
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:31,651
You see a real carnivore or rather real 
Predator like a cat.

1795
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:37,500
Cats kill you first because they want to
keep killing things and they don't want 

1796
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,650
to have to worry about fighting you.
You know,

1797
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:41,500
the hyenas.
Hyenas just started eating.

1798
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,110
And that's the same with bears.
Bears that get you down.

1799
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:46,020
They just started eating monkeys.
Chimps,

1800
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:48,220
chimps kill monkeys.
They just eat them.

1801
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:52,750
They don't kill them first.
There's videos of chimps screaming while

1802
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:57,751
I'm or monkeys rather screaming while 
the chip has a hold of it's little body 

1803
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:01,570
and his biting its legs off,
pulling it apart.

1804
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,070
And this monkey score reaming and it 
looks like a little person.

1805
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:11,250
It looks like a weird little person in 
an outfit and it's getting ripped apart 

1806
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,990
by this champ.
Who's this chewing on it.

1807
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,450
It's fucking dark dude.

1808
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,650
And that's what bears do.
And that's what bear did.

1809
01:16:18,651 --> 01:16:22,270
The Timothy Treadwell just aidem for 
seven minutes until he died somewhere.

1810
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:24,280
That footage exists to no video,
man.

1811
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,050
Only audio.
There was no video footage.

1812
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:27,970
Yeah,
but Werner Herzog listened to it.

1813
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:32,971
That fucking.
He didn't play it for us and he said 

1814
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:32,971
this,
this is too much for people to handle.

1815
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:36,340
We need to burn this,
burn this like bitch.

1816
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,360
Some the people decide maybe just being 
a little over reactive.

1817
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:40,950
Well,
how,

1818
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,370
when did they,
when did you shoot that?

1819
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,250
How long ago?
A few years ago.

1820
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,450
It's like 2000 years ago.
Maybe.

1821
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,840
Maybe even more than that.
It might've been like 2004 on watch this

1822
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:55,850
video.
Every time somebody gets his head 

1823
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:55,850
chopped off,
my brother's like,

1824
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:55,850
he'll check out the video.
I'm like,

1825
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:55,850
what are you?
Well,

1826
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,700
there's nothing graphic about it.
Two thousand five.

1827
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,740
There's nothing graphic about it.
I mean,

1828
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,410
they don't really show you,
but when they say the way they found out

1829
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:07,060
that the guy had died was that um,
they flew in like with some supplies for

1830
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:09,410
them and as the guy was flying in a 
plane,

1831
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:13,490
he saw a bear that was out,
which you thought was unusual and he saw

1832
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,800
the bodies,
like he flew over and saw like this,

1833
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,190
the white rib cage poking up of a guy 
that had just been eaten.

1834
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,520
He ate two of people.
He ate him and he ate his girlfriend 

1835
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:24,520
too,
and they are both fucked up there.

1836
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,200
So they landed and they had a,
they had a land with rangers and rifles 

1837
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,321
and Shit,
and they had to kill the bear and the 

1838
01:17:32,321 --> 01:17:32,321
bear that killed the bear and they left 
the bear.

1839
01:17:32,321 --> 01:17:36,911
This is the really crazy thing.
And then they came back or a couple of 

1840
01:17:36,911 --> 01:17:36,911
months later,
fucking nothing left.

1841
01:17:36,911 --> 01:17:38,900
Nothing of the body.
It had all been absorbed.

1842
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:41,050
Animals had eaten in other bears at 
eating,

1843
01:17:41,051 --> 01:17:43,280
at the bones were all crushed up,
was incredible.

1844
01:17:43,281 --> 01:17:45,830
They finally were a couple of rib bones.
It's really amazing.

1845
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,930
We were talking about this giant grizzly
bear,

1846
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:52,931
I mean they had photos of the bear and 
video footage of the bear from previous 

1847
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:57,010
stuff that he had gotten before the bear
killed him back when they were salmon 

1848
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:57,010
running like they got the bear eating 
fish and shit.

1849
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:02,250
Dude.
Giant animal and it just within a few 

1850
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,650
months it's gone get really big before 
you watch it though.

1851
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:08,770
Oh Dude.
It's one of the greatest documentaries 

1852
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:08,840
ever.
Most unintentional comedy,

1853
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:14,210
I think ever in a document that Richard 
Simmons out in the woods and colony 

1854
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:17,910
brothers.
It really is like the Coen brothers did 

1855
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:17,950
it as a goof.
I mean,

1856
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,670
I really.
I mean I was amazed,

1857
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,040
but it's kind of perfect that the bear 
ate him.

1858
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,700
Like in terms of the documentary,
like sure hurts.

1859
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,510
I was probably there going.
Yeah.

1860
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,510
Well I believe he started the 
documentary after the guy died.

1861
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,280
Oh,
okay.

1862
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:35,740
How did they.
He had video footage that he had shot 

1863
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:38,231
himself for years and years set up by 
himself and he's so crazy who set up the

1864
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:40,430
camera and he would look into the 
camera.

1865
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:45,670
I'm out here alone in this far as 
protecting these bears because no one 

1866
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:46,550
else gives a shit.

1867
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,310
No one gives a shit,
so fuck you park ranger.

1868
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:50,780
Fuck you.
United States government.

1869
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,770
Fuck you.
Alaska.

1870
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,500
He's just going off like screaming.
Okay,

1871
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:55,730
let's try this again.
Take three.

1872
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,920
And they'll do it like over and over and
over again.

1873
01:18:57,921 --> 01:19:00,380
And he obsessive Lee filmed themselves.
So they have,

1874
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,990
not only do they have this incredible 
wealth of footage from here,

1875
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,660
but I watched the grizzly man diaries.
Okay.

1876
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:10,780
Because he had so much footage.
They turned into a fucking reality show 

1877
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,690
seven years after this Doodad.
Okay.

1878
01:19:11,691 --> 01:19:14,220
And I watch it all the time.
There's a fucking reality.

1879
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:19,221
She didn't know that.
This is like all the Easter after we're 

1880
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:20,510
done here in Bro.
Let's get something to eat.

1881
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:23,080
We'll hit the fucking vaporizer.
Fucking have a good time.

1882
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,920
It's genius,
man.

1883
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:25,470
It's,
it's.

1884
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,530
He's just gold.
He's gold all day.

1885
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:32,531
I wish the motherfuck was still alive.
I would have them on the podcast in a 

1886
01:19:32,531 --> 01:19:32,531
heartbeat.

1887
01:19:32,531 --> 01:19:33,950
Wasn't there a part in it where he goes,
everyone,

1888
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,690
did you already say this?
Everyone thinks I'm gay.

1889
01:19:36,691 --> 01:19:39,470
Then he talks about it,
there's a part he wants with the camera.

1890
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:40,430
He's like,
well,

1891
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:41,380
you know,
you know,

1892
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:41,950
I guess.
No,

1893
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,070
this is what he said.
He goes,

1894
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:45,340
it'd be so much easier if I was gay,
you know,

1895
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,200
just can't.
I just can't find a girl.

1896
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,400
Can't find the right girl.
I can't find the right girl.

1897
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,570
Maybe it's because you're living in the 
woods with monsters.

1898
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:58,370
You fuck like which chicks want to be.
Put it in a nice roof over their head.

1899
01:19:58,371 --> 01:19:59,780
Okay.
They want to be taken care of.

1900
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:02,020
They want a man who loves them and 
supports them taking.

1901
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:02,890
They don't want to.
Yeah.

1902
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,630
Let's go live in a house.
Made of fabric.

1903
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,620
Okay.
Um,

1904
01:20:06,621 --> 01:20:11,621
amongst.
You want me to sleep outside on the 

1905
01:20:11,621 --> 01:20:15,501
ground with no more within fabric above 
me while monsters roam around there.

1906
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,960
My friends like it's Mr Cupcake.
Hey Mr.

1907
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:22,320
Capp k,
when you eat me in a couple of months,

1908
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,900
can you think you could start from the 
headfirst,

1909
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:28,020
like die quicker as fast seven minutes.
This guy dies.

1910
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:33,021
Think about how fucking law.
Think about holding your breath for 

1911
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:33,021
seven minutes.
Right?

1912
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:33,780
That's a long ass time now.
Thank you.

1913
01:20:33,781 --> 01:20:38,781
Can't do it now.
Think about something eating you seven 

1914
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:42,711
minutes of what you died.
You just pulling chunks out.

1915
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:48,561
You're screaming and it's just eating 
your feet and you're just squirting 

1916
01:20:48,561 --> 01:20:50,870
blood like a broken faucet when it just 
pass out a few.

1917
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:52,170
I don't know,
man.

1918
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,550
I don't know that you're like,
okay,

1919
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:58,551
I'm dying and you accept it and then you
wake up when a bite your dick off six 

1920
01:20:58,591 --> 01:20:59,550
more minutes.
You're like,

1921
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:04,710
okay,
that still still conscious to just 

1922
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:09,610
starts eating your asshole.
Just big chunks and he's got his giant 

1923
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:13,551
Paul and he puts it on your cheek and 
you just rip it out your ass or just 

1924
01:21:13,551 --> 01:21:15,480
pulling up literally eating your asshole
while you're still alive.

1925
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:19,650
Dude.
Fuck man.

1926
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:21,810
Fuck a bear.
People in my neighborhood too,

1927
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,060
and I lived in the Colorado mountains.
I'm like,

1928
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:23,850
well,
if you see a bear,

1929
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:25,840
you report it.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1930
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:30,850
I'm going to shoot that thing.
I'm going to shoot the fuck out of that 

1931
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:30,850
thing.
If I had a rifle,

1932
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:31,500
not with the pistol,
the pistol,

1933
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:34,410
you got to use the main span.
Fucking scary animals.

1934
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:36,060
God Damn.
We need them.

1935
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:38,220
We need them.
We need them in our woods.

1936
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,500
Fuck you.
We do that can kill them all.

1937
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:41,130
Put them in zoos.

1938
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:42,670
I don't do the whole.
I don't.

1939
01:21:42,671 --> 01:21:47,671
I don't know if you guys serve,
but I have a bunch of friends at surf 

1940
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:47,671
and they want me to go.
I'm like,

1941
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:51,130
you,
do you have any ideas like the size of 

1942
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,680
the monsters in there.
Guy Just died recently in Santa Barbara 

1943
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,500
and a half in front of his friends,
like if sharks were walking on land,

1944
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,110
you'd go,
I'm not going.

1945
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:03,230
Were those those?
Those monsters are hanging out.

1946
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:06,020
You're going really on this little 
board.

1947
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:11,230
You're going where there are like things
that eat people that are twice or three 

1948
01:22:12,321 --> 01:22:15,800
or four times the size of you.
You know what I am going to play.

1949
01:22:15,801 --> 01:22:20,801
If I'm going to surf,
I'm going to do it on the xbox and I'll 

1950
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:20,801
do this.
This is what I tell them.

1951
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:20,801
Tell people

1952
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:23,300
if there were three werewolves in the 
country,

1953
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:28,360
fact proven three werewolves,
would you ever be in the woods at night 

1954
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:32,180
on a full moon?
Why the fuck would you take that chance?

1955
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:33,600
You wouldn't.
Okay,

1956
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:38,710
well there's a million sharks you fuck.
And they're not just sharks when it's a 

1957
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:42,311
full moon there sharks every day and 
they can't even stop because if they 

1958
01:22:42,311 --> 01:22:42,311
stopped,
they drowned.

1959
01:22:42,311 --> 01:22:46,270
So they have to keep swimming and they 
have to keep beating navy shoes and 

1960
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:46,880
license plates and tires and they'll eat
you.

1961
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:49,160
They'll eat you bro,
and they'll eat you quick.

1962
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,510
They take giant bites out of you and 
your fucking.

1963
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:54,950
I'm sure surfing is awesome,
but it ain't that off.

1964
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,420
I wear shoes in the ocean and wouldn't 
even fight like the biggest thing ever.

1965
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:02,360
Can we save an oculus on that smart 
thinking right there?

1966
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:05,190
Yeah.
I mean people like we'll always like,

1967
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,950
like this is another subject,
but people who might not be so scared of

1968
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:13,951
things,
so paranoid of things like obviously a 

1969
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:13,951
lot of this is for entertainment folks.

1970
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:15,520
I'm not shaking every time I walk by the
ocean,

1971
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,670
but the point being logically and 
realistically,

1972
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,680
we're all going to die eventually.
Absolutely,

1973
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:25,890
but that's not the fun way to go.
The Fun way to go is you live a long 

1974
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:26,740
life.
You fucking party your ass off.

1975
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:28,300
You make a lot of good friends and 
people miss you.

1976
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:33,301
When you're gone.
You're surrounded by your friends and 

1977
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:34,771
loved ones.
This is passed to the next stage of his 

1978
01:23:34,771 --> 01:23:34,771
existence.
Not,

1979
01:23:34,771 --> 01:23:34,771
oh,
look how pretty.

1980
01:23:34,771 --> 01:23:39,331
The water fucking thing is.
Just taking chunks out of Sadie.

1981
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,280
I mean fucking huge man.
I mean there are sharks that are 30 feet

1982
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:48,520
long out there.
What are you talking about?

1983
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:50,180
30,
long,

1984
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:54,670
30 feet long with giant mouths that have
so many teeth.

1985
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:57,730
If one breaks off,
another one pops into its place.

1986
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,980
There's no animal like it in the world.

1987
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,830
Every other animal when they lose a 
tooth or fucked,

1988
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,960
okay?
If a lion loses his tooth,

1989
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:06,910
managed to new,
young lions going to take over,

1990
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,080
motherfucker.
You can't be gumming no gazelles.

1991
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:14,130
How He protected me with them,
fucking shitty teeth that deadline and 

1992
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:14,130
dies up.
Not a shark,

1993
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,340
they can lose 100 teeth.
What are clink?

1994
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,870
Clink,
clink,

1995
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,390
clink.
Just designed to fuck you up,

1996
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:21,260
man.
You're drowning at the same time.

1997
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:28,050
Horrible is drowning.
You're drowning while something is 

1998
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,260
eating your entire like those Parana 
fucked up those Goldfish,

1999
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:30,700
man.
I'm just scared of Karma,

2000
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:31,330
man.
I'm fucked.

2001
01:24:31,331 --> 01:24:36,331
A lot of goldfish.
Over a lot of goldfish to a watery 

2002
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:37,330
grave.
If there's any Karma out there,

2003
01:24:37,331 --> 01:24:40,000
I mean the universe does it really give 
a fuck about the difference between life

2004
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:45,001
of a goldfish or life of a person and I 
took some pleasure in the death of 

2005
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:45,001
Goldfish and I set it up.

2006
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:50,000
You know I introduced them.
Alien fish that aren't even supposed to 

2007
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,621
be in this environment.
I had a fake artificial environment in 

2008
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,840
my own home and I will use it for a 
little goldfish.

2009
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,080
Coliseum you playing God and playing 
God.

2010
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:57,130
Man,
I ain't going to no water.

2011
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:58,830
I know what I did wrong.
I'm not going in there.

2012
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:02,260
Make a genetically modified goldfish 
fish going to get huge.

2013
01:25:02,261 --> 01:25:03,760
It's going to come for you.
Minutes can grow.

2014
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:05,470
Legs is going to come knock on your 
door.

2015
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,510
Did you hear about the shit that's going
on in Russia?

2016
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:09,040
Man?
What's going on in Russia?

2017
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,890
The wolves.
The.

2018
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:12,490
What is this going on in the screen 
there,

2019
01:25:12,491 --> 01:25:14,110
Brian?
Some weird shit right there.

2020
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,430
That's always been like a.
What is it?

2021
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:17,530
Like the design.
Oh,

2022
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:18,330
you put it there?
Yeah.

2023
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:19,270
Oh,
you fucking Weirdo.

2024
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,830
Trying to be artistic.
It's.

2025
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:21,190
Anyway.

2026
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:24,100
There's a pack of wolves in this area of
Russia.

2027
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:29,280
There's unprecedentedly big.
It's 400 Woltz and they're acting 

2028
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,140
together and they're killing livestock 
like horses.

2029
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:36,380
They're acting together as a group.
It's a really scary and they.

2030
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,770
They have groups of hunters that are 
going after him.

2031
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,180
Let me,
let me pull it up real quick.

2032
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,590
Holy.
It's really scary.

2033
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:46,300
You imagine you're in a woods stroll.
400 will do it.

2034
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:49,210
It's really scary.
There's a video of wolves in Russia.

2035
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,280
Have you ever seen the video on youtube?
Yo,

2036
01:25:51,281 --> 01:25:52,510
you gotta.
Check out this video.

2037
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,220
It's fucking bad ass.
Have you ever seen it,

2038
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:56,110
Brian?
Now some people think it's fake.

2039
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,760
I don't.
I do not believe it's fake.

2040
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:01,930
It's a video of these guys that are 
pulling over people in Russia,

2041
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:04,720
they're pulling people over for traffic 
violations and it's,

2042
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:06,080
you know,
they're right by the wolves,

2043
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:06,800
the woods rather.

2044
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:10,700
And as they're in there,
one guy's pulling a guy over,

2045
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:16,450
a guy yells who's on the other side of 
the street and as he yells to the guy 

2046
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:17,270
who's the comp panics,
he yells something in Russia,

2047
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,120
Russian panics and gets into the car of 
the people he pulled over,

2048
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:27,310
jumps in it quick and as he jumps in it,
this pack of wolves runs down the 

2049
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:28,550
street.
It's a mother fucker dude.

2050
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:29,650
And as they're running,
they go,

2051
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,780
why do people think it's fake?
A lot of people don't think is real.

2052
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:39,850
You know,
people would call fake mean looking at 

2053
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:39,850
you.
You call faking everything I pull,

2054
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:41,870
pull it up.
I'm a pack of wolves.

2055
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:43,610
Police officer.
Pull up,

2056
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:45,380
pull that up on Youtube.
But anyway,

2057
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:49,070
so this is super pack of wolves is 
terrorizing this fucking town.

2058
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:53,270
They have killed 30 horses in four days.
Oh yeah.

2059
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:58,300
What?
They've never seen anything like it 

2060
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,751
before.
And they've had to put bounties on 

2061
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:01,751
wolves heads.
So they're putting 210.

2062
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:03,710
I don't know what it is,
a because it's pounds.

2063
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:05,360
I believe it is.
It might be euro's 200,

2064
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:06,830
10 euros.
It's probably euro's,

2065
01:27:06,831 --> 01:27:08,290
right?
Do they go into the year?

2066
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:11,500
That was a vodka by the way.
It was.

2067
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,040
It fake.
It was figure.

2068
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:14,780
Okay,
well this isn't a podcast.

2069
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,560
How did they find it?
How did they get to volunteer?

2070
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:22,930
I searched it and it says a wolf attack.
Videos of viral ad for vodka brand.

2071
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,570
But it doesn't even have the.

2072
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:27,930
Pulled the video.
It's pretty.

2073
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:31,730
It does seem a little bit to uh,
well filmed.

2074
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:35,720
Did it too good of a job.
So anyway,

2075
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:38,000
this,
think about this shit man.

2076
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,370
The,
the,

2077
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:43,430
the,
the is up there are minus 49 degrees 

2078
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:46,961
Celsius and it killed off all the normal
prey of these wolves says wolves thrive 

2079
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:50,210
in cold weather.
But there's a lot of animals.

2080
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,270
What are you doing,
man?

2081
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,220
Just cue that shit up.
So we'll have to watch this guy's gay ad

2082
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:00,680
presents.
I present here it goes.

2083
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,590
So yeah,
see that looks like to.

2084
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:05,360
Well framed,
you know,

2085
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,370
that's a good traffic camera.
Both,

2086
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:11,210
both cars are in frame,
but it's pretty dope man.

2087
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:13,370
Alive when it happens.
I wish it was real.

2088
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:16,150
She was aware it wolf.
Yeah.

2089
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:21,370
So,
I mean think about that temperature 

2090
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:21,370
right there.
Forty nine degrees Celsius.

2091
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:24,230
That's fucking crazy.
That's Edmonton minus 49 degrees.

2092
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:24,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2093
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,120
And so,
um,

2094
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,180
these wolves have nothing to eat.
So they all figured out how to get 

2095
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:31,180
together.
And this population,

2096
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:35,300
this town is only 1300 people.
So wrap your head around that.

2097
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,890
1,300
people.

2098
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:41,950
400 wolves.
So almost for every three,

2099
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:43,700
three people,
there's a wolf.

2100
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:46,610
Oh Man,
what the fuck man.

2101
01:28:46,611 --> 01:28:50,870
Get the fuck out of that.
Every three people there's a wolf.

2102
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,920
The chances of you dying by wolf attack 
are like,

2103
01:28:55,010 --> 01:29:00,010
oh,
like the chances of you dying of old 

2104
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,571
age.
It's terrifying and it's just starting 

2105
01:29:01,571 --> 01:29:01,860
to happen again.
There's been two instances in the last,

2106
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:06,210
like fucking 100 years or so,
and they've both been within the last 10

2107
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:08,490
years of people getting killed by 
wolves.

2108
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:13,491
It's on record.
We used to think that like wolves are 

2109
01:29:13,491 --> 01:29:13,491
cool,
man.

2110
01:29:13,491 --> 01:29:13,491
They're like,
dogs,

2111
01:29:13,491 --> 01:29:13,491
man.
They're like Randall's.

2112
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:14,910
No,
they're fucking killers.

2113
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,740
They'll kill you too,
you know,

2114
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:17,760
if they catch you alone.

2115
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,370
We used to have like all the member,
the Old Walt Disney movies,

2116
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,980
there was a woes like try to get beauty 
and the beast.

2117
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,590
The wolf would fucking sneak up on him.
So yeah,

2118
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:29,400
you'd have to fucking fight off the 
wolves that wanted to kill beauty.

2119
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:30,540
Right?
Remember that shit,

2120
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,760
they attacked them.
That's real.

2121
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:38,120
We just have fucked them over so bad in 
this country that we started to have 

2122
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:38,120
respect for them.
Again,

2123
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,390
like wolves aren't so bad,
so you're cool man.

2124
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,660
We need them.
They're beautiful.

2125
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:44,160
You know,
they represent freedom.

2126
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:48,240
Rules represented freedom.
Like there's a never think about walls,

2127
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:53,241
but this guy thinks about was everyday I
think about because I'm closer to an 

2128
01:29:53,241 --> 01:29:56,270
animal than you are for sure.
There's one percent DNA differential,

2129
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,160
whatever the fuck it is between humans 
and chimpanzees.

2130
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:02,550
I'm closer to Mr Cat.
Goddammit.

2131
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,770
I'm too close.
I want to go into the woods.

2132
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,560
Some gravitating.
I gravitate towards wild.

2133
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:09,870
If we lived in or if there was a rain 
forest,

2134
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,790
I'd fucking live in it.
If we have a rain forest right here,

2135
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,850
I figured out how do you kill the bugs?
Where do you go?

2136
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,540
Electricity.
Can you zap them?

2137
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:19,720
I need to have an area around,
but we live in a fucking rain forest.

2138
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:20,490
It'll be the shit.

2139
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,050
Yeah.
Buy Shit.

2140
01:30:22,051 --> 01:30:27,051
You mean insanely dangerous and boring?
Blinders can kill you and spiders can 

2141
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:29,290
kill you.
I'm not going there.

2142
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:32,400
How about spiders to destroy your 
hormones?

2143
01:30:32,401 --> 01:30:37,401
Man,
there's a fucking Brazilian spider that 

2144
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:37,401
we talked about.
What the fuck was I thinking?

2145
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:37,710
I'm just scared of.
I don't remember.

2146
01:30:37,711 --> 01:30:41,040
I'm just scared of regular spiders in my
bed because you read that.

2147
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:46,041
Some of these spiders are poisonous here
in California and they hide in your 

2148
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:47,780
shoes and your birch.
Yeah.

2149
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:49,430
They're black and brown.
Yeah.

2150
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,560
I saw brown outside my house.
The other glue.

2151
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:55,740
So the scary ones because rec looses.
They do something to your skin.

2152
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:58,450
It causes your skin to die so it causes 
your

2153
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:01,170
tissue to dissolve.
It's really fucked up,

2154
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:02,520
man.
Necrosis.

2155
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:04,800
I believe it's called and when they bite
you,

2156
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,080
they unload on you with all this fucking
toxin and it just crushes your skin.

2157
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:15,320
Whereas like giant gaping wounds occur 
from one little spider bite because all 

2158
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:19,980
the area around your skin dies and rots.
It's scary shit,

2159
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:22,020
man.
Really Spooky Shit.

2160
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,950
And again,
I'm taking this flashlight,

2161
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:27,290
Brazilian wandering spiders.
That's what it is.

2162
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:32,291
And I believe we've talked about it on 
the podcast before you got to look this 

2163
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:35,771
up.
Were you always a musician like growing 

2164
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:38,080
up or did you don't change subject 
motherfucker.

2165
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:41,500
We're talking about vipers and shit.
I wanted to bring up this,

2166
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,890
this one thing,
and we're talking about less the,

2167
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:48,190
the Hornet versus Hornets versus wasps 
thing that you mentioned the.

2168
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,540
Was it hornets versus wasps?
The,

2169
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:55,541
uh,
when the Hornets attack the bees nests 

2170
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:55,541
or whatever.
Yes.

2171
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:58,220
You see that,
that military shit scary.

2172
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,280
Those are monsters.
I mean if they were big,

2173
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:05,280
they were like horses.
Can you imagine a beam of the size of a 

2174
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,850
horse called the Burmese Russell Viper.
That's what it is to Russell Viper.

2175
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:11,851
And what these things,
they caused uncontrollable hemorrhaging 

2176
01:32:11,851 --> 01:32:13,210
of your pituitary gland where all your 
sex hormones are controlled.

2177
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:16,450
So if you get bit by this fucking thing 
and if you survive the bite,

2178
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:19,240
which you probably won't,
you'll be permanently impotent.

2179
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,470
And you become like a unit,
like you lose all your pubic hair,

2180
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:26,080
you stop,
you stop producing testosterone,

2181
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,140
your body just gets jacked,
you get neutered.

2182
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,670
And if you get neutered by a bite,
no,

2183
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:32,480
this is a python.
Oh yeah.

2184
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:38,030
With the,
with the spider does is a spider brakes 

2185
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,920
your dick by forcing you to have raging 
uncontrollable hard ons that you can 

2186
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,990
like painful agonizing hormones are hard
ons.

2187
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,130
And when the heart opens over your 
Dick's broken.

2188
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,280
So either you're dead,
either you die.

2189
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,080
And then when,
by the way it's the most potent toxic in

2190
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:56,370
any spider.
So it either kills you or you live and 

2191
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:57,460
your Dick's broken forever.
So both animals break your Dick.

2192
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,420
It's just like they're instinctively 
worth.

2193
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:05,440
We're afraid of spiders.
Just a tiniest bit like,

2194
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,680
ah.
Because some of those can fuck you.

2195
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:09,660
Fuck up.
Yeah.

2196
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,460
There's genetic memories I'm absolutely 
convinced.

2197
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:14,110
And I've read about it before where 
they,

2198
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:17,170
this guy I'm a rupert sheldrake,
was talking about,

2199
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:22,200
he's an,
I believe it's an evolutionary 

2200
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,581
biologist,
and he was talking about how animals 

2201
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:26,280
are,
what people are really terrifying of 

2202
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,531
monsters,
like no matter what the real dangers of 

2203
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:31,231
your environment,
if you're a child and you live in New 

2204
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:31,231
York City,
you know,

2205
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:34,141
you're not worried about car accidents 
or rapists or you're worried about 

2206
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:37,741
monsters.
And the reason being is because there's 

2207
01:33:37,741 --> 01:33:40,170
some ancient,
ancient memories of us when we used to 

2208
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:40,170
get killed by Jaguars and shit,
you know,

2209
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:41,890
and we're scared of the night and we're 
scared of monsters because that's really

2210
01:33:41,891 --> 01:33:43,060
what they were a man,
you know,

2211
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:47,230
and the ones that survived of this,
he carried this incredibly potent,

2212
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:48,640
terrifying memory.

2213
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:51,700
And it's actually in printed into people
genetically.

2214
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,820
You know,
we have this idea of instincts,

2215
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:56,200
you know,
when people have certain instincts.

2216
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:58,150
But then what does that mean?
Okay,

2217
01:33:58,151 --> 01:33:59,480
what his instincts mean,
you,

2218
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,190
you,
you know,

2219
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:01,510
something already.
Okay?

2220
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:02,770
What,
how do you know something already?

2221
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:07,771
Is it because of past experience of your
ancestors in as it comes through your 

2222
01:34:07,771 --> 01:34:07,771
genetics?
Well,

2223
01:34:07,771 --> 01:34:09,590
how much stuff goes in there,
how much information is now.

2224
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:12,130
What they've shown is that means in some
ideas,

2225
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:16,270
even useless ones like racism can be 
transmitted through genetics.

2226
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:19,780
So the same thing that causes you to 
like have an instinct,

2227
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,730
you know,
to not do something like don't go,

2228
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,960
don't go near Heights.
Oh No,

2229
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,260
you already know it.
Instinctively.

2230
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:30,300
The same thing is actually you can 
transmit other ideas into people's 

2231
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:30,800
heads.
You know,

2232
01:34:30,801 --> 01:34:33,580
you can transmit even talent maybe into 
people's heads.

2233
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:36,640
It's pretty fucking tripping when you 
think about it because we don't know.

2234
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:39,670
We don't have a documentation of where 
all our information comes from.

2235
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:44,850
I mean,
how much of your information is from 

2236
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,441
your ancestors?
How much of it is from all these people 

2237
01:34:46,441 --> 01:34:49,411
that have lived before you,
that have made mistakes and learn from 

2238
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:50,770
them and you sort of have this internal 
wisdom thing going on because of that.

2239
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:52,170
I believe that totally.
Right?

2240
01:34:52,171 --> 01:34:54,220
Yeah.
When you meet someone who is wise beyond

2241
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,180
their years,
you know,

2242
01:34:55,210 --> 01:35:00,210
what is that?
Is it that they've had an incredibly 

2243
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:00,210
life that's

2244
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:00,440
a possibility or is it that,
you know,

2245
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,560
somehow or another they have gotten a,
a rich history of people who have 

2246
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,120
survived and learn shit and it's 
incorporated into their DNA?

2247
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:09,000
Yeah,
yeah,

2248
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,070
yeah.
Yeah.

2249
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,050
And it's very egotistical also to think 
that,

2250
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,100
oh,
I'm,

2251
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:18,430
oh,
I'm just a smart person where I'm very 

2252
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:18,430
careful because I'm afraid.
Like,

2253
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:18,430
it's like,
no,

2254
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:22,241
you are afraid.
You have millions of years of people 

2255
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:22,241
going.
That is bad.

2256
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:23,720
That is good.
That is bad,

2257
01:35:23,721 --> 01:35:24,980
that it's good.
It's not either or.

2258
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:27,290
It's not either or.
I mean you certainly have learned.

2259
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,910
You certainly are smart and there's,
you know,

2260
01:35:28,911 --> 01:35:33,770
some people will most certainly do learn
better from fucked up situations.

2261
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,210
There's a lot of them that absolutely 
do.

2262
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:36,810
Yeah.
I got a lot of buddies who don't learn,

2263
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:39,080
man.
There's a lot of that going on,

2264
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:39,980
man.
Yeah.

2265
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:45,130
There's a lot of people that don't ever 
learn and you just got to constantly 

2266
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:45,130
fucking talk to him about shit,
dude.

2267
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:49,050
Come on really full Kim.
Yeah.

2268
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:54,260
She's got a third Dui and I'm like,
really?

2269
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:59,261
Like are you like was I see I don't get 
that because I am very bad at drinking 

2270
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:03,280
and driving,
but I'm 30.

2271
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,560
No,
I'm really good at it and I think,

2272
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:10,490
I don't know if it's well,
how well do you drink and drive?

2273
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:13,580
Well,
I mean I think having a few beers,

2274
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:18,581
it's considered drinking and driving,
so I probably drink and drive everyday 

2275
01:36:18,581 --> 01:36:19,910
to listen.
First of all,

2276
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:25,100
you're just kidding because cops listen 
to this dummy.

2277
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,490
They ever pull you over for a fan of the
podcast.

2278
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,170
You know what I'm saying is I get out of
the car.

2279
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:35,700
Which comedy club you're going to.
What I'm saying is that anytime you go 

2280
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:36,290
out,
you have maybe a couple of drinks.

2281
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:38,960
You go in your car that's considered 
drinking and driving.

2282
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:43,990
You know,
if you have two beers in you that's 

2283
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:43,990
drunk.
Hey,

2284
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:43,990
whenever you know,
whenever Brian is wrong about something,

2285
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:45,800
he gets very excited.
He knows his voice.

2286
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,150
No,
it's how much,

2287
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:52,180
how much you went about,
I bet you money two beers is drunk and 

2288
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:52,180
we get pulled over.
Yes,

2289
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:55,160
that's what I'm saying.
Especially man,

2290
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:58,010
that's what I do.
If I'm going anywhere,

2291
01:36:58,011 --> 01:36:59,300
I'm drinking alcohol.
My problem,

2292
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:04,480
my problem is I don't do the two.
Like if I have two or three even I'm 

2293
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:04,480
like,
all right,

2294
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,600
I'm big boy.
I know how to stay in between the lines 

2295
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,651
and stuff,
but the problem is is if I did get 

2296
01:37:11,651 --> 01:37:11,651
pulled over,
of course I would get a Dui.

2297
01:37:11,651 --> 01:37:14,180
What I want to know is these three,
these people that have three of them are

2298
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:18,170
not usually the case.
Is that usually the case that or I mean,

2299
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:21,570
is your friend like blackout drunk 
driving or is he.

2300
01:37:21,571 --> 01:37:23,650
You know,
just like just friends.

2301
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:25,550
I don't know.
Maybe it's just got bad luck.

2302
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:29,660
Bad lesson.
Only three times have ever had more than

2303
01:37:29,661 --> 01:37:31,790
one drink.
This guys got good luck.

2304
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:33,620
Really?
It's worse than that.

2305
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:38,090
Are you done after three?
He's done because he may go to jail.

2306
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:42,890
I'm never going to do that again.
Really after two people are scary.

2307
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:46,530
Drunks and cars.
People were scary people.

2308
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,810
I mean that's the real problem is 
there's too many of us and we can't help

2309
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:55,811
everybody get their shit together.
So you're always going to be around a 

2310
01:37:55,811 --> 01:37:55,811
bunch of people that are broken no 
matter what our.

2311
01:37:55,811 --> 01:37:56,040
The way our

2312
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,920
society exists,
it's just too God damn big.

2313
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:04,430
It's too big and the competition is too 
powerful and too strong for us to pay 

2314
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,100
attention to these people that are 
falling by the wayside.

2315
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,890
So if you don't pay attention to them,
well all these fucking idiots,

2316
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,920
they're just running around,
slamming into people and you can't fix 

2317
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:12,920
them.
Began with eggs on man.

2318
01:38:12,921 --> 01:38:15,180
This is just the candidate evolved the 
whole world.

2319
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:18,330
It's like God damn,
I only got a certain amount of years.

2320
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:20,880
This is ridiculous.
There's nothing you can do to help them.

2321
01:38:20,881 --> 01:38:22,530
They have to help themselves and they 
don't want.

2322
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,090
They don't even think there's anything 
wrong with them.

2323
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:26,010
You know,
like fuck you bitch.

2324
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:27,000
You know,
enrolling with me,

2325
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:27,540
bitch.

2326
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:33,300
You imagine that you end of your life is
some idiot who's just like fucking 

2327
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,350
wasted gets his car.
I can drive home.

2328
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:36,990
It happens all the time,
mack.

2329
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,010
It's terrifying

2330
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:43,690
and no one know and there's so many of 
them out there that it's almost nothing 

2331
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:43,690
you can do about it.
You just have to be vigilant,

2332
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:48,611
keep an eye out and be very careful as 
you drive and getting connected in any 

2333
01:38:48,611 --> 01:38:53,021
way randomly on purpose to fucking nuts 
to people that suck to dummies.

2334
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,620
So many of them out there,
man.

2335
01:38:54,621 --> 01:38:59,621
We all know him.
We all know dudes who are just beyond 

2336
01:38:59,621 --> 01:38:59,621
fixing.
There's nothing.

2337
01:38:59,621 --> 01:39:01,580
I know a bunch of dudes that if I knew I
could get away with it,

2338
01:39:01,610 --> 01:39:02,560
I fucking shoot him.
Right,

2339
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:08,760
right in the head.
If I was alone in the woods and it was 

2340
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,841
like armageddon time and like there was 
no more media and cell phones didn't 

2341
01:39:10,841 --> 01:39:12,830
work anymore and I thought,
this dude be a problem.

2342
01:39:12,831 --> 01:39:13,940
I just walk them in the woods.
Come on,

2343
01:39:13,941 --> 01:39:15,500
let's go for a walk.
Man.

2344
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:17,010
I saw some deer over here.
You might help me hunt.

2345
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:18,710
Bow Hunt.
It's over there.

2346
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:20,810
Yeah,
she fucking.

2347
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:25,950
I remember you said one of the people in
Austin and scared the shit out of 

2348
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:26,440
whoever we were with.
I can't remember.

2349
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:29,970
We were like,
why are you being says he being serious.

2350
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:33,610
Tell them mice and men.
You just bring your friend.

2351
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:39,150
Look over there.
We're going to go to that looks to the 

2352
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:39,150
pickup chicks all night.
We're going to get wasted.

2353
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:39,520
It's going to be a good time.

2354
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:46,800
Yeah.
There's certain people that you worry 

2355
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,000
when you're around them.
There's certain people that you feel 

2356
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,000
like they're going to victimize your 
loved ones.

2357
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,970
You know,
there's certain people like certain,

2358
01:39:49,971 --> 01:39:54,971
like a certain level of of criminal,
certain level of violent offender and 

2359
01:39:55,280 --> 01:40:00,280
random violent offenders.
People rape and beat women up and then 

2360
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:00,280
you know,
it could be your mom,

2361
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,550
it could be your sister,
it could be your daughter.

2362
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:03,950
I should be dead,
dead.

2363
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:06,500
Not In jail,
not for a year,

2364
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:09,380
not for a day.
Shoot them and let's move on.

2365
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,180
Okay?
We got a broken person.

2366
01:40:11,181 --> 01:40:16,181
We can't fix them.
Their favorite thing to do is to hurt 

2367
01:40:16,181 --> 01:40:19,181
people.
The favorite thing to do is to hurt 

2368
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:19,181
people that you love and you're the 
vulnerable ones.

2369
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:20,900
The women really kill it.
Kill it.

2370
01:40:20,901 --> 01:40:23,080
Now,
killer would fucking fire bullets.

2371
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:24,950
Whatever's cheapest.
Fuck Cam.

2372
01:40:24,951 --> 01:40:26,480
Sorry.
Come back as a butterfly.

2373
01:40:26,481 --> 01:40:28,280
Suck my cock by Bang,
Bang,

2374
01:40:28,281 --> 01:40:29,000
Bang.
Fuck you.

2375
01:40:29,001 --> 01:40:29,480
Stupid.

2376
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:32,090
A humane level so he doesn't know he's 
going to die.

2377
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:34,980
It doesn't even matter if it's humane.
Just fucking shoot him.

2378
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:38,470
What is his last moments are important.
You know,

2379
01:40:38,471 --> 01:40:40,300
don't torture them,
but you know,

2380
01:40:40,301 --> 01:40:42,040
what does the police stop?
Shut the fuck up.

2381
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,350
It doesn't matter if yellow,
you're going to shoot him in the head to

2382
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,140
yell at him.
Yeah.

2383
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:47,790
Right.
Well,

2384
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,670
animals in the zoo.
I mean,

2385
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:51,210
how many animals in the zoo need to be 
fed and what are we going to give him?

2386
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,300
Steak.
That's stupid.

2387
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,040
Give them chickens.
You fucking

2388
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,510
beeble man.
Get some cons.

2389
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:58,120
Throat concen there.
I bet bears would love to eat.

2390
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:01,960
I'm tired of berries too.
Tired to picnic baskets.

2391
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:06,040
Just throw a net cage.
Some fucking guy has been busted for the

2392
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:11,041
fifth time.
Drinking and driving slides into a 

2393
01:41:11,041 --> 01:41:11,041
family of five.
Thrown in that fucking cater.

2394
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:15,220
Dana white will be in charge of that.
And this colosseum now.

2395
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:17,260
That's what I take over the UFC.
Dan is going to retire.

2396
01:41:17,410 --> 01:41:19,150
They're going to ask me to take his job.
I'm going to go.

2397
01:41:19,151 --> 01:41:20,080
Okay.
I've got an idea though.

2398
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,450
Sit down.
Listen.

2399
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:23,920
Okay.
After the nuclear war,

2400
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:27,730
life is cheap too.
That's the problem.

2401
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:30,910
If there was,
if we could go back in time right now to

2402
01:41:30,911 --> 01:41:31,750
the coliseum,
you know,

2403
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,490
what would you do?
Would you stand up and say,

2404
01:41:33,491 --> 01:41:36,220
you must stop this please.
What are you doing?

2405
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:38,170
No,
you would sit down and you'd go,

2406
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:39,040
you're going to drink that wine.

2407
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:39,520
Yeah.
Fuck.

2408
01:41:39,521 --> 01:41:44,320
It would be sitting there.
We'd be drinking wine right next to us.

2409
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:46,630
There'd be some old dude fucking some 
boy in the ass.

2410
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,990
You know?
That's how they rocked it back then.

2411
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:50,320
It would just bend them over the fucking
rails,

2412
01:41:50,321 --> 01:41:53,500
the coliseum and bang them in the ass 
while the while the things are going on.

2413
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:59,330
Dude,
they were banging little boys left and 

2414
01:41:59,330 --> 01:41:59,330
right back down and you just had to look
away,

2415
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:01,360
look away and take us to be banging 
boys.

2416
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,910
We'd like a time machine and you're 
like,

2417
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:06,820
it's just so culturally accepted and 
like everyone's doing.

2418
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,200
All of a sudden you're like fuck.
And you're like,

2419
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:13,530
why am I bugging this kid?
And you're like,

2420
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:19,080
oh well it's kind of accepted it.
And then you go back to the future and 

2421
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:19,080
like,
what did you do?

2422
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,020
A wig.
That is so funny.

2423
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:24,220
Oh my God.
What?

2424
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:27,190
How long would it take you to think in 
jail before you started going gay?

2425
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,760
Never.
Never.

2426
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:33,770
You never go to yammer would go again.
What if it was like a really feminine 

2427
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:33,770
guy?
Look really soft.

2428
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:36,610
Hardly any appeal.
Masturbation forever.

2429
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,890
Like everyone who says they wouldn't 
like,

2430
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:43,910
you're like,
I'm sure those fucking dudes when they 

2431
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:43,910
were going to jail,
like I'm not going to be gay.

2432
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:44,510
And like 15 years down the line,
like,

2433
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:47,770
well I feel like fuck it.
Something that only gets 15 days,

2434
01:42:47,771 --> 01:42:48,300
man.
Yeah,

2435
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:50,290
I think they just start getting addicted
right away.

2436
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:54,970
In the Mexican community,
they call it gay for the stay.

2437
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:58,510
There's a thing with a,
a lot of people that go to jail and then

2438
01:42:58,511 --> 01:43:03,511
do some gay shit,
but they only do it in jail when they 

2439
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:03,511
get out.
They're not gay at all.

2440
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:04,870
He ever see that American me,
that Edward James almost moving.

2441
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:07,430
There was a lot of that going on that 
movie.

2442
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,520
Like he would come out and it was all 
fucked up sexually,

2443
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:14,521
just wanted to rape chicks,
bang him in the ass because that's how 

2444
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:14,521
you would get guys in jail.
Yeah.

2445
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:19,460
It was really creepy movie man.
It was my first real exposure to the 

2446
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:22,660
Mexican gang culture that I've ever had 
or any la gang culture.

2447
01:43:22,661 --> 01:43:27,661
You know that in colors.
I watched a music video for colors the 

2448
01:43:27,661 --> 01:43:30,770
other day.
I forgot about that one night man.

2449
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,910
Talking Co's as ice tea before he played
a cop on TV.

2450
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:38,110
The most ridiculous shit ever.
Iced tea as a cop on TV.

2451
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:38,840
It's like,
what?

2452
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,570
What,
how did that happen?

2453
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:42,940
He had a song called cop killer.
A song.

2454
01:43:42,941 --> 01:43:44,470
Okay.
It wasn't a party he was playing.

2455
01:43:44,471 --> 01:43:47,650
He wrote that Shit.
You know I'm a motherfucking cop.

2456
01:43:47,651 --> 01:43:49,120
Killer number.
He was asked.

2457
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:51,410
He was in a a wrap.
A rock for sure.

2458
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:54,300
Body count.
Body count,

2459
01:43:54,301 --> 01:43:58,250
body motherfucking can button.
That was some hard.

2460
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,790
Met Him at the comedy store one night 
here.

2461
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:02,000
Who's in the audience at the comedy 
store when he was cool.

2462
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:03,050
Yeah.
I met.

2463
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,640
Make some joke.
I forgot what it was,

2464
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:07,910
but I was a big ice tea fan when I was 
in the newspapers.

2465
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:10,340
I used to listen to a iced teas,
rap albums.

2466
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,180
Let's get buck naked.

2467
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,920
You didn't fuck.
Holy Shit.

2468
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,450
We got some great ship.
It's just so weird seeing them playing a

2469
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:16,750
cop.

2470
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:17,550
It's like,
what?

2471
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:20,790
Huh?
It is playing a dad.

2472
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:23,000
You can sit down back there and

2473
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,310
yeah.
Ice Cube ice cube rather than this.

2474
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,370
The Dad.
Yeah,

2475
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:29,340
man.
He's a duty as a dad.

2476
01:44:29,341 --> 01:44:31,650
I understand all that,
but God damn dude,

2477
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,780
if easy you were alive.
He'd be like on two and a half men or 

2478
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:38,220
something.
We take it out of his mouth and go,

2479
01:44:38,221 --> 01:44:39,690
will you stop that?
That's gay.

2480
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:43,310
Yeah.
Body count had the song where they.

2481
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:46,590
He kills his mom.
Just flush her down at toilet.

2482
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:51,510
Were kids going wrong?
He went as dark as he could.

2483
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:57,140
It was easy.
Either first guy to ever die from AIDS 

2484
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:57,990
in the road or in the entertainment 
world.

2485
01:44:57,991 --> 01:44:58,170
Was it

2486
01:44:58,370 --> 01:44:59,390
for Asher?
What was it?

2487
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:03,020
Easy to remember who died?
First of all?

2488
01:45:03,021 --> 01:45:04,830
I know Arthur Ashe database,
right?

2489
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:07,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

2490
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,520
Easy.
He was one of the rare ones because I 

2491
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:12,520
remember when easy he died of AIDS.
I was like,

2492
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,671
Holy Shit.
Like I was thought this was just the 

2493
01:45:15,671 --> 01:45:18,161
beginning and I'm looking down the line 
at some madmax situation where I'm 

2494
01:45:18,161 --> 01:45:21,020
walking around town with a fucking one 
of those Chinese facemask things on,

2495
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:22,160
you know,
like you always see the Chinese people,

2496
01:45:22,161 --> 01:45:23,570
the airports.
I'm like,

2497
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:25,130
what the fuck man?
Is this really gonna Happen?

2498
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:30,131
Like everyone's just gonna start 
dropping like flies and then it just 

2499
01:45:30,131 --> 01:45:30,131
stopped.
Yeah.

2500
01:45:30,131 --> 01:45:30,450
And you're like,
what the fuck was easy?

2501
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,430
He wasn't magic.
Johnson was.

2502
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:35,590
It was not fucking the fleshlight.
It's weird man.

2503
01:45:35,591 --> 01:45:36,490
It's weird,
right?

2504
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,370
What the fuck's up with Magic Johnson?
Like I'm Kinda freaked out.

2505
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:40,480
It's,
it's crazy.

2506
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,560
I've heard a bunch of different stories.
I can't really comment.

2507
01:45:43,561 --> 01:45:48,561
I've heard stories about him taking 
medication and I've heard stories that 

2508
01:45:48,561 --> 01:45:49,170
he doesn't need the medication anymore.
And then I heard he started,

2509
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,140
stopped taking the medication.
His symptoms started reoccurring.

2510
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,320
The weird thing is that he's.
He tests a negative.

2511
01:45:55,321 --> 01:46:00,321
Apparently he taste tests HIV negative 
because the way HIV works is what you 

2512
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:02,760
can really test is you can test for the 
antibodies.

2513
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:07,910
I don't think they can accurately test 
for the actual virus inside you.

2514
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,340
Very tricky.

2515
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:13,470
Well the first guy ever,
they kind of the who was HIV positive,

2516
01:46:13,471 --> 01:46:16,110
like through like,
it's not clear how it happened,

2517
01:46:16,111 --> 01:46:21,111
but I'm the first HIV positive.
They cured it somewhere in

2518
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,660
Sweden or something.
Oh,

2519
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:24,800
with stem cells,
right?

2520
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:25,940
Yeah.
With the stem cells,

2521
01:46:25,941 --> 01:46:26,630
right?
Yeah.

2522
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:27,590
Yeah.
That was recently.

2523
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:29,780
Yeah.
Like a month ago or so.

2524
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,060
How much should they get accomplished 
with stem cells?

2525
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:34,790
They have to dance around stuff and they
have to like,

2526
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,380
like,
like the skin gun.

2527
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:37,730
Have you heard about this thing that 
they've got?

2528
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,920
There's a new thing that they've figured
out how to do,

2529
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:42,830
where they can actually take cultures 
from your skin.

2530
01:46:42,831 --> 01:46:47,831
They reproduced with your own stem cells
and then they spray it in sort of a gun 

2531
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:49,440
on your,
um,

2532
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:53,610
on your skin where it's burned and it 
only takes like a certain amount of time

2533
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:55,500
to cultivate like an hour two to 
cultivate.

2534
01:46:55,620 --> 01:47:00,620
They can do it really quickly.
They reproduce this stuff and then they 

2535
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,340
spray it on you and it radically cuts 
down healing time radically.

2536
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:07,490
Like they showed this one guy who had 
been burnt in a fire and then he looked 

2537
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:07,490
like he didn't have a fucking scratch on
them.

2538
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:12,030
They showed images of this guy,
giant blistering second degree burns big

2539
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:13,880
welts all over his hand and shit.
Well,

2540
01:47:13,881 --> 01:47:18,881
they spray this shit on him man.
And it builds within four days you've 

2541
01:47:18,881 --> 01:47:22,440
got like Nu skin and it looks healed.
It's a trip and it's all stem cells.

2542
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,180
But people say

2543
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:25,840
hell though.
It's from his own body though.

2544
01:47:25,841 --> 01:47:27,700
This is what people don't understand.
You don't have to kill babies.

2545
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:32,710
Get stem cells there.
Everyone thinks that everything comes 

2546
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:32,710
from the fetus,
but you don't have to.

2547
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:37,130
And now they have a way to reverse it.
Like to take your own and reverse it to 

2548
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:37,130
like,
it's,

2549
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:42,350
I've fucking done what people thought 
they were going to encourage abortion 

2550
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:42,350
because

2551
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:44,320
babies,
they needed stem cells from fetuses.

2552
01:47:44,321 --> 01:47:46,560
Yeah.
You know a god damn man.

2553
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:47,260
You know,
let him,

2554
01:47:47,261 --> 01:47:52,261
let him work with Shit.
It's like these nutty Christians and 

2555
01:47:52,261 --> 01:47:55,021
have these Kooky ideas about what they 
should and shouldn't do with tissue and 

2556
01:47:55,021 --> 01:47:55,021
cells.
Like what the fuck,

2557
01:47:55,021 --> 01:47:59,881
man,
what should you do if a girl has an 

2558
01:47:59,881 --> 01:47:59,881
abortion,
she just flush it.

2559
01:47:59,881 --> 01:48:03,450
You're telling me if there's something 
that you can learn in there that can 

2560
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:05,470
unlock the secret to immortality or cure
cancer or whatever the fuck it can do,

2561
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:10,650
you're telling me you should just throw 
it away because it's dead and it's 

2562
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:10,650
immoral and that Nina,
somehow none of the.

2563
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,600
You're profiting off of abortion,
but the reality is people are so creepy.

2564
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,450
They probably would start doing 
abortion,

2565
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:17,590
right?
They would start encouraging them.

2566
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:21,190
You want a fucking baby shit.
They yell,

2567
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:23,560
Dude.
How long before there is abortion porn?

2568
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:28,860
Think about that.
People like just how long before they 

2569
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,210
would start paying for abortions.
We had this fucked up with porn.

2570
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,960
Sex probably already is.
Listen to this.

2571
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:38,170
We had a porn star on that 90 show 
podcasts I did yesterday that was eating

2572
01:48:38,171 --> 01:48:40,360
out a girl and started bleeding and they
were like,

2573
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:45,370
you know,
she started her period and found out it 

2574
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:46,390
was a miscarriage into her mouth.
So it was he,

2575
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:51,440
she was eating a pussy probably if 
somewhere like guys would pay a lot of 

2576
01:48:52,331 --> 01:48:57,331
money and I'm so sad right now.
Right now.

2577
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,750
Well that's not anybody's fault there.
No,

2578
01:49:05,751 --> 01:49:07,360
no that,
that was Kayla page.

2579
01:49:07,361 --> 01:49:10,030
So support Caleb Patriot.
You were telling me about her.

2580
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:10,870
Right.
So you,

2581
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:12,760
you've been doing these naughty show 
podcasts.

2582
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:17,820
Are you going to keep doing those to 
everybody about the other podcasts you 

2583
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:18,670
have because you have a website,
[inaudible] dot TV.

2584
01:49:18,671 --> 01:49:20,900
Right.
And all of the podcasts are there.

2585
01:49:20,901 --> 01:49:22,310
They're all in it.
Ask

2586
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:23,500
us like,
what is his desk was shit,

2587
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:24,290
what?
Are you guys bad as?

2588
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:25,670
No,
it's totally not that.

2589
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:29,540
Does it opium from opium.
Anthony nicknamed us the desk for a long

2590
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:34,541
time ago because I came onto the opiod 
anthony show and at the time it was my 

2591
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:38,981
friend Tate Fletcher,
who was on the ultimate fighter and he 

2592
01:49:38,981 --> 01:49:38,981
was on the show at the time.
He came with me and Eddie Bravo,

2593
01:49:38,981 --> 01:49:40,460
who's the Jujitsu guy,
so they're just my friends.

2594
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:45,500
We were just traveling together and so 
they came into the studio and a cop 

2595
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:45,500
goes,
oh,

2596
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,210
Joe Rogan brought into the death squad 
and then we just started like,

2597
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,220
that's right with a desktop,

2598
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:52,930
so juvenile and ridiculous and so over 
the top and retarded.

2599
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,720
So we decided to keep it.
So we did this naughty show podcasts.

2600
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:59,410
It's usually a porn star and Sam 
Tripoli's 90 show and Sam,

2601
01:49:59,411 --> 01:50:04,411
who's our buddy who's been on the 
podcast a bunch of times and I did a 

2602
01:50:04,411 --> 01:50:04,411
bunch of touring with Sam up and up in 
Canada.

2603
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:07,930
We did Toronto together.
Sam's awesome Jason Team.

2604
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,500
Uh,
and so anyways,

2605
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,750
it's once a week.
Jason Tubes.

2606
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:11,950
Austin too.
I won't leave you out there,

2607
01:50:11,951 --> 01:50:12,390
dude.
Yeah.

2608
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,420
You know,
I love you anyway.

2609
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,810
Three squad that TV.
And so as all the pilots,

2610
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:18,430
we do a lot of fun,
they also do,

2611
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:22,240
whenever there's a ufc they get hammered
and they watched the UFC together and do

2612
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:27,241
their own coinciding podcasts,
like talking shit about fights as they 

2613
01:50:27,241 --> 01:50:30,661
go down.
And sometimes you even had joey on that 

2614
01:50:30,661 --> 01:50:30,661
one.
One we have Joe fucking fun was,

2615
01:50:30,661 --> 01:50:30,970
it was great.

2616
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:36,710
Got to go watch the UFC with Joey.
I have to accommodate and he sits next 

2617
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:37,750
to joe ideas,
you know,

2618
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:44,100
you can't get any better entertainment.
And Joey Diaz last the last UFC hung on 

2619
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:48,850
acid drops two tabs of acid and watching
cage fights and they all,

2620
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,870
I mean,
what was that like?

2621
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:51,490
What was that like sitting there with 
him for six hours?

2622
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:54,310
Well it's like you're in bed with them 
because the seats are so small.

2623
01:50:54,311 --> 01:50:57,340
So you kind of like on his lap like 
holding like a,

2624
01:50:57,341 --> 01:50:59,750
like a big stuffed animal so that you've
got you,

2625
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:05,190
you got that.
But then you've got like the most 

2626
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:05,190
hilarious commentary ever.
What's cool is that,

2627
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,220
that that's what we do on the UFC drunk 
as we pretty much,

2628
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:08,680
you know,
we'll have some people like that,

2629
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:13,681
Joey Diaz and stuff like that and just 
getting drunk and watching us sees and 

2630
01:51:13,681 --> 01:51:14,280
it's kind of like a commentary,
see a lot of people,

2631
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,360
lot of your fans like to rewatch the 
UFC.

2632
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:17,420
So it's like,
hey no,

2633
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:20,960
turn it on with our commentary this time
and it says a bunch of other comics just

2634
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,150
doing your job.
But,

2635
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:25,540
but drinking and smoking way do it the 
right way.

2636
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:30,541
Yeah.
Well I could never do it the right way 

2637
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:32,071
to.
Because a lot of things you say when 

2638
01:51:32,071 --> 01:51:32,071
you're fucking around with your friends 
are very disrespectful,

2639
01:51:32,071 --> 01:51:32,071
you know,
you say good,

2640
01:51:32,071 --> 01:51:33,160
I bitch,
what the fuck?

2641
01:51:33,161 --> 01:51:34,570
I tell you,
you know,

2642
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,600
hope you brought your jammies.
Guys will sit when they're drunk and 

2643
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:42,211
they're stone and they're talking shit.
But they would never say that to the 

2644
01:51:42,211 --> 01:51:42,211
fighter.
A fighter to hear that,

2645
01:51:42,211 --> 01:51:42,211
uh,
one.

2646
01:51:42,211 --> 01:51:46,651
Anybody else,
even if it's only between friends as a 

2647
01:51:46,651 --> 01:51:49,411
goof.
So you know what Joey could say is so 

2648
01:51:49,411 --> 01:51:49,411
much different than anything I could 
say.

2649
01:51:49,411 --> 01:51:51,740
Jerry says crazy shit sometimes.
Som on the year,

2650
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:52,500
Alex,
Alex.

2651
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:55,100
Oh my God.
It's so fucking.

2652
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:57,120
He's the funniest guy that's ever lived.
We did

2653
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:58,350
Vegas two weeks ago,
dude.

2654
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:03,440
He came up and he opens up the show,
which is the perfect way to do it 

2655
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,030
because Joe is not like an act election.
Do look in our.

2656
01:52:04,110 --> 01:52:05,910
He doesn't have time to do an hour and 
it's not.

2657
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:07,380
He doesn't the,
his pace.

2658
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,610
He's got this destructo 15 minute pace 
and that's what he does.

2659
01:52:11,611 --> 01:52:14,940
He doesn't want to do a 45 minute set.
So when I take Joey on the road with me,

2660
01:52:14,941 --> 01:52:19,941
it's like I'm taking another headliner.
I mean he's a fucking headline or any 

2661
01:52:19,941 --> 01:52:22,680
opens and it goes up and just some it 
dude he was,

2662
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:25,560
he made me laugh so hard.
I literally fell down.

2663
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:28,140
I was leaning against a wall.
We were all back there.

2664
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:33,410
We were on,
like Joey was onstage and we were in 

2665
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:34,350
like the alleyway that leads to the 
stage where the curtains are at the,

2666
01:52:34,351 --> 01:52:37,020
uh,
the Lion King Theater and Amanda Lee,

2667
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:42,030
Bang,
big giant ass fucking place and we're 

2668
01:52:42,030 --> 01:52:42,030
leaning up against the wall and joey's 
killing so hard.

2669
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,240
We're all rocking back and forth and 
dudes are bending.

2670
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,370
People are slapping their legs were all 
like moving around.

2671
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:51,950
We're standing still,
but nobody was standing still.

2672
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:52,930
You're laughing.
I,

2673
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,010
I literally fell down.
I fell down.

2674
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:58,430
I drop to a knee and that's all just 
crushes.

2675
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,900
Just get this bit about.
This.

2676
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:04,100
Yoga is taken yoga lately and he's a 68 
year old lady and his yoga class.

2677
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,810
I'm going to fuck that old bitch.
I swear to God.

2678
01:53:05,811 --> 01:53:08,360
Joe Rogan is.
Get this bit about it and it's.

2679
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:13,810
We were crying laughing man.
He said we had just been about getting 

2680
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:17,231
in a fight,
a true story about a fight that he got 

2681
01:53:17,231 --> 01:53:17,231
in with a nun when he was a kid.
Oh,

2682
01:53:17,231 --> 01:53:18,260
you got to fucking see it,
man.

2683
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:19,820
Is that the funniest shit you've ever 
seen?

2684
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Anything he says is hilarious.
He's such a fucking treats in Arizona 

2685
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:25,020
this weekend too.

2686
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:25,730
Yeah.
Where's he at?

2687
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,170
The new club,
I believe.

2688
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,200
No,
no,

2689
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:30,250
no.
He's on some completely different thing.

2690
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:31,550
Yeah,
because they got upset with him,

2691
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:32,930
but he wasn't doing the new club and 
he's like,

2692
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,040
you're not even open yet.
Stupid.

2693
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:36,860
Danny murders with them.
Damer.

2694
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:38,740
But a joey is a,
he's a,

2695
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:39,890
he's one of those guys,
man.

2696
01:53:39,891 --> 01:53:42,230
It just makes you.
There's him back then when he was really

2697
01:53:42,231 --> 01:53:43,550
young.
That's what I met Joey.

2698
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:48,700
Grab that picture man.
Grab that picture for the folks on 

2699
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,090
Ustream.
You'll be able to see this for folks.

2700
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,770
Um,
it on itunes.

2701
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,750
I don't know if it's available online 
anymore.

2702
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:59,680
I have to upload it.
But this was Joey Diaz when I first met 

2703
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,780
him and joey only weighed like,
you know,

2704
01:54:00,781 --> 01:54:02,180
like fucking 200,
10,

2705
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:07,181
215 pounds up bay guy.
So He's been on like a big football 

2706
01:54:07,181 --> 01:54:07,181
player looking guy.

2707
01:54:07,181 --> 01:54:08,780
And this is him right after he started 
doing comedy.

2708
01:54:08,781 --> 01:54:12,470
I met him like a couple of years after 
he started when he moved from Seattle to

2709
01:54:12,471 --> 01:54:14,670
La because the economy store guy.
Yeah,

2710
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:15,190
yeah,
yeah,

2711
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:18,350
yeah.
He's just such a fun fucking guy.

2712
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:23,500
There's people that you meet in your 
life and they're just the life of the 

2713
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:23,500
party,
you know?

2714
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:24,890
No one in my life has ever been the life
of the party.

2715
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:26,460
Like Joey Diaz,
you know,

2716
01:54:26,461 --> 01:54:31,461
I've,
I've met a couple of crazy people that 

2717
01:54:31,461 --> 01:54:31,461
are cool to hang around with every now 
and then,

2718
01:54:31,461 --> 01:54:35,140
but no one just gets shit jumping.
Like Joey Diaz when he goes on stage 

2719
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:36,650
dancing and the right away just sets the
tone and the,

2720
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:37,490
you know,
he's,

2721
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:39,110
he's the fucking man.
Dude.

2722
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,020
He's so fun.
So important man.

2723
01:54:42,021 --> 01:54:44,390
Have Fun.
Fucking cool people in your life.

2724
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:50,040
You know?
Is that the most important thing in 

2725
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:50,040
life?
It really is,

2726
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:50,040
right?
Yeah.

2727
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:50,040
Yeah.
More than anything else.

2728
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:53,990
Being some rich Khan who's no friends,
that's gotta suck bad man.

2729
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:59,520
You know,
being some dude living in some giant 

2730
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,381
fucking mansion,
14 Ferrari's movies in sweatshops and 

2731
01:55:02,381 --> 01:55:04,220
shit like,
and the social network.

2732
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:08,590
It sucks to be rich and by yourself.
It's got to be.

2733
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:11,860
But how would a dumb thing to say isn't 
important?

2734
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:17,420
Runes,
you love me.

2735
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:25,370
You see things when you have kids,
you see everything through the eyes of 

2736
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:27,701
children's shows.
My daughter took all fucking log or a 

2737
01:55:27,701 --> 01:55:28,550
log and her party the other day.
I swear to God,

2738
01:55:28,551 --> 01:55:29,910
look like Joey Diaz.
Shit in there.

2739
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:33,350
I couldn't believe how big it is.
It's shocking.

2740
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:36,080
I almost took a picture of it,
but I just thought that's disrespectful,

2741
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:39,740
but my daughter's shits on twitter.
I just wanted everybody to see it.

2742
01:55:39,741 --> 01:55:42,340
Like you need to take a look at this.
This doesn't even seem normal.

2743
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:45,270
I need to go to a doctor.
Her shit was like my forearm.

2744
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,600
Was that her first big shit?
Now she takes logs.

2745
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:50,040
She's my daughter.
She's a little savage.

2746
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:53,250
Savage eaten meat and shit.
Shit.

2747
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:57,300
I bought Venison Jerky and she has tears
into this shit.

2748
01:55:57,370 --> 01:55:59,850
Just chewing up venison jerky.
It's really weird.

2749
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,770
Then you look at little babies.

2750
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:04,650
I got the newest baby baby Rogan number 
two is only.

2751
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:09,740
She's almost nine months old.
And when when she gets food like it 

2752
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:11,280
doesn't matter like she can eat like 
solid food,

2753
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:13,050
but you've got to watch her.
You gotta be careful.

2754
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:18,170
You know,
you've got to make sure that she can't 

2755
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:18,170
get anything she could choke on.
So,

2756
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:21,141
uh,
but she always screams for food and one 

2757
01:56:21,141 --> 01:56:21,141
of the things she likes to do is get 
bones,

2758
01:56:21,141 --> 01:56:24,150
so I still like put bones in her mouth 
and lick the bones and it's like a big,

2759
01:56:24,151 --> 01:56:25,020
like a,
like a,

2760
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:26,640
um,
like a rib bone,

2761
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:31,670
you know,
and it's just so weird to watch this 

2762
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:34,341
little baby with a bone from a dead 
animal completely transfixed on this 

2763
01:56:36,211 --> 01:56:38,970
thing.
She has one fucking tooth man.

2764
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:42,630
She's got one tooth and she's non at 
this bone with meat on it.

2765
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:43,920
And like if you tried to take it from 
her,

2766
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:48,410
she will fucking scream.
I mean screamed the baby wants to murder

2767
01:56:48,411 --> 01:56:53,411
the animal and you know,
just instinctual nature more than 

2768
01:56:53,411 --> 01:56:53,910
anything else.
I've given our apples.

2769
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:59,060
I've given her bananas.
I've given her a bunch of shit before 

2770
01:56:59,060 --> 01:56:59,060
and she likes him.
It's all good.

2771
01:56:59,060 --> 01:56:59,430
It's all nice,
but nothing like that bone.

2772
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:01,740
You give her a bone.
It's just like giving a dog a bone,

2773
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:02,800
you know,
you give a ball,

2774
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:04,350
a dog dog food,
like,

2775
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:05,730
Hey,
thanks for the dog food.

2776
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:09,570
You give a dog a bone and you test how,
what your relationship is with him,

2777
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:10,920
you know,
because you want.

2778
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,570
Might want to take that back.
I want that bond back.

2779
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:15,030
Oh,
what's up bitch?

2780
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:16,560
Oh,
I found your line.

2781
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:18,140
This is the line.
You know,

2782
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:21,850
my dad gave me a few times,
taken his bone really well.

2783
01:57:21,851 --> 01:57:23,050
Here's a biter.
I got him at the,

2784
01:57:23,051 --> 01:57:24,220
uh,
the shelter.

2785
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:25,150
Oh,
right away.

2786
01:57:25,151 --> 01:57:26,200
He was fighting.
I was like,

2787
01:57:26,201 --> 01:57:27,090
fuck,
I got to.

2788
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:29,640
Is a year and a half.
Well,

2789
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:30,160
uh,
yeah.

2790
01:57:30,161 --> 01:57:31,670
He was like,
no,

2791
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:32,350
no.
Small.

2792
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:34,050
What kind?
Twenty five.

2793
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:39,210
He,
I'm a fuck a Boston terrier and a cocker

2794
01:57:40,991 --> 01:57:45,991
spaniel.
So it kind of looked like a baby lab 

2795
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:46,360
kind of.
But he was fucked up in the head man.

2796
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:49,570
And like a young young boys like teenage
boys,

2797
01:57:49,571 --> 01:57:52,180
he did not like,
he hasn't fucked up owners for sure.

2798
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:53,920
Like he did not.
He couldn't sit,

2799
01:57:54,130 --> 01:57:56,290
give the par.
I taught them that 15 minutes,

2800
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:58,510
but the,
he was clueless when I got him.

2801
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:00,010
So he was like,
Kinda fucked up.

2802
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,550
How long have you had them now?
Uh,

2803
01:58:01,551 --> 01:58:02,590
you know,
he's dead.

2804
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,290
He died like last year.
But uh,

2805
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,010
sorry.
No,

2806
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:06,610
no,
not at all.

2807
01:58:06,611 --> 01:58:07,620
And he say,
sorry,

2808
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:10,490
I'm not really sure.
I don't like that dog.

2809
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:14,740
My Dog's died to all right.
You're like,

2810
01:58:14,741 --> 01:58:15,790
yeah,
you only one bro.

2811
01:58:15,791 --> 01:58:17,520
Fucking dead de one.
One one bro.

2812
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:20,020
Uh,
but yeah,

2813
01:58:20,021 --> 01:58:24,040
he'd bite mother fucking little bone.
The bone and the weed man.

2814
01:58:24,041 --> 01:58:29,041
He like,
and I wouldn't get my dogs so I'm not 

2815
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:29,041
one of those guys.
I during,

2816
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:30,850
I'm to get my dog stone,
but I'd see him and all of a sudden he's

2817
01:58:30,851 --> 01:58:31,990
stoned and I'm like,
fuck,

2818
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:33,780
I had a piece of cookie.
No.

2819
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:34,170
And he

2820
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:36,430
good.
I had a dog that was um,

2821
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:39,230
she was a rescue dog too.
And we got her high accidentally wants,

2822
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:43,900
me and Joey were in my office and old 
house just hitting a bong and this is my

2823
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:48,930
early.
We'd days I was just learning how to 

2824
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:50,971
smoke weed and I couldn't believe that 
I'd gone 30 years of my life without 

2825
01:58:50,971 --> 01:58:55,141
knowing about weed and I was just going 
to overboard so we me and joey got ball 

2826
01:58:55,141 --> 01:58:58,150
lasted in my office and the dog was so 
paranoid.

2827
01:58:58,151 --> 01:59:03,151
It was so crazy.
She was running from everything and 

2828
01:59:03,151 --> 01:59:03,151
hiding under furniture.
I couldn't get it to come out.

2829
01:59:03,151 --> 01:59:03,880
It was weird.
I was like,

2830
01:59:03,881 --> 01:59:05,020
why are you hiding?
I'm like,

2831
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,330
oh,
she's high as fuck at the dog.

2832
01:59:07,331 --> 01:59:10,060
Got a contact time hanging out with us.
It's weird.

2833
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:11,980
It was a rescue dog too.
So her,

2834
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:13,480
her,
her being high.

2835
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,210
It was not like a happy puppy that you 
raised being high.

2836
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:18,910
Like if I got high with Johnny.
Johnny doesn't have any fears.

2837
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:20,650
Johnny's happy dog.
He's got a good life,

2838
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:21,990
you know,
but you get a rescue dog.

2839
01:59:21,991 --> 01:59:26,991
That dog was like three or four years 
old before I got her nose and she was 

2840
01:59:26,991 --> 01:59:30,481
living on the street in la,
eating out of garbage cans and they 

2841
01:59:30,481 --> 01:59:31,630
caught her and she had to change her 
bodies covered in mange when I first got

2842
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:33,940
her.
So I had to treat her with chemicals,

2843
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:39,450
had it with some sort of medicine.
I had a washer and I ended up like just 

2844
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:40,260
feed her.
She ate like insane amounts of foods.

2845
01:59:40,261 --> 01:59:41,740
You could not eat enough.
She was.

2846
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:43,930
She was a voracious appetite.
So voracious.

2847
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,750
She was sneaking out of my house.
Okay.

2848
01:59:46,751 --> 01:59:48,280
Even though I fed her,
she's a fat pig.

2849
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:50,370
She was sneaking out of my house.
She would call.

2850
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:53,740
She had a hole that she found wish you'd
go under the fence.

2851
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:56,260
So you go to the neighbor's house,
tip over the garbage,

2852
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:58,600
eat their garbage and then sneak back in
the yard.

2853
01:59:58,601 --> 02:00:00,760
And I had no idea she was doing it and 
she was doing it forever.

2854
02:00:00,761 --> 02:00:01,870
I'm like,
this dog's fat as fuck.

2855
02:00:01,871 --> 02:00:04,060
I'm giving her diet dog food.
She's fatter,

2856
02:00:04,061 --> 02:00:05,320
man.
What the fuck is happening?

2857
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:06,120
She just kept

2858
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:07,780
clever duck.

2859
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:12,870
Well they have this thing where they 
feel like they're never going to have 

2860
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:12,870
enough food.
You know,

2861
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:12,970
they can't stop eating.
They just,

2862
02:00:13,010 --> 02:00:14,800
they will keep eating until they get 
sick.

2863
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:20,010
Like she got into a bag once,
she had like a bag of dog food and just 

2864
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:22,060
ate so much that like her,
her whole body was hard.

2865
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:25,750
Like it was the weirdest thing ever.
It's like her stomach was hard.

2866
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:28,630
I was worried about her and she threw up
and then she would eat the throw up.

2867
02:00:28,631 --> 02:00:31,510
I mean it's like she couldn't,
she was never satisfied.

2868
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:36,620
Yeah.
And I think it's the same kind of thing 

2869
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:36,990
is happening when you leave and when you
come back,

2870
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:42,020
like you walk in literally they're so 
happy that you came here because they 

2871
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:42,020
can't.
They're like,

2872
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:42,020
they're,
they're eating like,

2873
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:42,600
oh,
I don't know.

2874
02:00:42,601 --> 02:00:44,640
Tomorrow may not eat.
He just left.

2875
02:00:44,641 --> 02:00:46,320
He's probably not coming back.
Fuck,

2876
02:00:46,321 --> 02:00:47,550
I'm fucked.
I'm alone again.

2877
02:00:47,551 --> 02:00:50,820
And then all of a sudden you come back.
What the fuck you came back,

2878
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:51,160
you know,

2879
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:53,730
what do you think about some dogs where 
they've done tests,

2880
02:00:53,731 --> 02:00:58,731
where they show that when owners are 
coming home that the dogs respond even 

2881
02:00:58,731 --> 02:01:00,030
when they're coming home and not normal 
hours,

2882
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:05,060
you know,
unusual hours that through hidden 

2883
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:05,060
cameras they found that dogs can 
anticipate when their,

2884
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:06,300
when their masters are coming home.

2885
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:13,030
I believe it's driving,
driving in their car on the way over 

2886
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:13,030
there.
Yeah.

2887
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:13,370
And it's not like a lot of dogs.
I don't think it's,

2888
02:01:13,371 --> 02:01:15,230
but it's enough that you know,
you have to go,

2889
02:01:15,231 --> 02:01:17,270
well what is this?
What's going on here?

2890
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:22,420
How they smelling it,
copies to let be sleeping on the couch 

2891
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:26,140
and then like immediately wake up and 
then just sit by the door in like 10 

2892
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:27,620
minutes later my girlfriend would walk 
in the door.

2893
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:28,670
It was,
oh,

2894
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:32,030
it was always so weird and I always 
thought it was just that the time,

2895
02:01:32,031 --> 02:01:34,370
because the time was always kind of 
around the same time.

2896
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:39,010
He doesn't have a fucking watch,
ridiculous dog like looks around.

2897
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:39,620
He goes,
okay.

2898
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:41,080
When it starts,
the delight,

2899
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:46,120
the big rock that is bright outside goes
down and then he starts playing with 

2900
02:01:46,341 --> 02:01:48,440
that machine over there that makes the 
food,

2901
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:50,750
that kind of proud.
That means like in,

2902
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:52,850
you know,
figures out its own way.

2903
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,330
Maybe,
I don't know,

2904
02:01:54,331 --> 02:01:59,331
because with these people,
what they showed was hidden camera 

2905
02:01:59,331 --> 02:02:02,511
footage when they had the dog would like
respond and we'd get up and start 

2906
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:03,870
walking around like as the owner was 
coming home.

2907
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:05,460
It's a trip,
man.

2908
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:06,270
You wonder.
I mean,

2909
02:02:06,271 --> 02:02:08,070
what kind of a weird connection isn't 
with dogs?

2910
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:09,630
You know,
they're just always so happy.

2911
02:02:09,631 --> 02:02:14,631
Always excited to see you.
This weird fucking relationship you 

2912
02:02:14,631 --> 02:02:14,631
have,
you know,

2913
02:02:14,631 --> 02:02:19,401
they require food from you.
And like what a weird psychic 

2914
02:02:19,401 --> 02:02:19,710
connection.
You have this strange animal.

2915
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:22,920
They know when you're coming home.
The fuck is going on,

2916
02:02:22,921 --> 02:02:23,460
man.
Yeah.

2917
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,200
Well who's to say there isn't,
you know,

2918
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:28,560
who's to say,
who knows?

2919
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:30,120
All right.
That's about it,

2920
02:02:30,121 --> 02:02:31,710
right?
I guess so.

2921
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:33,500
That's good.
So what it ended up,

2922
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:34,410
where you at,
man,

2923
02:02:34,411 --> 02:02:35,850
when's the next time someone could see 
you?

2924
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:41,290
And uh,
I'm going to be in Minneapolis some 

2925
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:41,290
theater,
some theater.

2926
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:41,890
You don't know where it is.
Fuck,

2927
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:46,900
I don't go to a John Lewis Joie dot 
[inaudible] dot com or go to my youtube 

2928
02:02:47,421 --> 02:02:52,421
page which is youtube.com/j
o n l a j o e dot and they're all there 

2929
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,850
and I'm going as Jon Jon.
Yeah.

2930
02:02:56,890 --> 02:02:58,490
H,
um,

2931
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:01,400
and check it out.
And I have a new video I'm working on.

2932
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:04,070
She'll be out Monday.
Can give us a sneak.

2933
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:05,780
It's guy.
It's called.

2934
02:03:05,781 --> 02:03:09,110
I am very super famous.
And is from EMC Vagina.

2935
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:14,111
The guy who brought you,
show me your genitals and I killed 

2936
02:03:14,111 --> 02:03:16,951
people.
What is this going to be a like Monday 

2937
02:03:16,951 --> 02:03:19,040
morning.

02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:33,330
going to be at Sal's comedy whole on 
Melrose.

2946
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:34,840
It's a little tiny spot.
It's only like 80 people.

2947
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:36,710
We're just going to go there and fuck

Who else?
Same Tripoli I called already today.

2951
02:03:43,541 --> 02:03:48,541

Awesome.
Jason Tebow.

2954
02:03:48,541 --> 02:03:49,180
Very funny.
Um,

2955
02:03:49,181 --> 02:03:54,181
so that's it.
Next weekend we're doing Braya the 

2956
02:03:54,181 --> 02:03:54,210

it will sell out.
So get tickets if you want to get them 

2958
02:03:59,290 --> 02:04:01,060
in advance.
And then in Australia at Rudy Hill,

2959
02:04:01,061 --> 02:04:02,400
that place that I'm doing,
it's a,

2960
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,120
it's called an RSL club.

2961
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:06,730
Whatever the fuck that is.
I don't know what that is.

2962
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,720
It's like an Italian club or something 
like.

2963
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:09,130
Well,
no,

2964
02:04:09,131 --> 02:04:11,000
it's like a veterans thing,
like um,

2965
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:13,510
but they just added a second show.
There was a,

2966
02:04:13,511 --> 02:04:15,310

show is sold out.

2967
02:04:15,311 --> 02:04:20,080
So now there's a 10:00
show and that is Saturday the 26th which

2968
02:04:20,081 --> 02:04:24,040
will be like the 25th year or something 
like that.

2969
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:26,650
It's real weird.
Like they're like a whole day ahead.

2970
02:04:27,010 --> 02:04:28,870
Have you done shows in Australia?
It's fun.

2971
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,800
Yeah.
I'm now.

2972
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:32,010

2973
02:04:32,011 --> 02:04:34,570
And Sydney's fun.
They don't give a fuck.

2974
02:04:34,571 --> 02:04:36,220
The men are men.
The women are women.

2975
02:04:36,221 --> 02:04:38,340
It's fucking dangerous animals 
everywhere.

2976
02:04:38,341 --> 02:04:41,100
There's crocodiles and shit and I love 
it there man.

2977
02:04:41,101 --> 02:04:43,830
It's a great time when the people are 
friendly as fuck.

2978
02:04:43,831 --> 02:04:45,420
I,
I enjoy the shit out of it.

2979
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:46,560
Yeah.
So uh,

2980
02:04:46,561 --> 02:04:47,680

Thank you everybody for everything.
Next week we're going to have a pto.

2986
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,420
Hanson,
a very funny comedian from Canada.

2987
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,580
Do you know Pete?
I know of him.

2988
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:09,290
I don't know him,
but he's.

2989
02:05:09,291 --> 02:05:09,990
Yeah,
he's very funny.

2990
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,050
He's,
he'll be here and who knows who else.

2991
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:16,290
And eventually I get Dave Foley and I 
got to call boss Rutan and.

2992
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:18,150
Alright bitches.
Um,

2993
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:23,070
that's the end of the show.
Oh thank you.

2994
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:25,710
Fleshlight sponsoring us and keeping the
lights on.

2995
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:29,340
We love you and you love us.
And that's how it should be.

2996
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:32,820
Good to just go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the leg.

2997
02:05:32,821 --> 02:05:36,030
It sounds like my mom just let you keep 
me in line.

2998
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:41,510
Go to Joe Rogan.net.

3001
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,450
Nice.

3002
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:47,120
Joie.
You are the man.

3003
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:58,430
Hi.
It's Bob random room near a dog into 

3004
02:06:02,250 --> 02:06:05,740
yourself.
Then your dog's looking at you like.

3005
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:11,720
Have you ever been?
Then you can feel your heart fast and 

3006
02:06:17,041 --> 02:06:20,010
you're convinced that you don't have a 
heart attack.

3007
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:31,640
Close Your eyes and you're gonna bomb 
the only problems.

3008
02:06:31,641 --> 02:06:35,100
And then chicken,
salmon smoked up.

3009
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:40,120
Why did the chicken sandwich thing that 
they will know?

3010
02:06:46,781 --> 02:06:50,460
You're high.
So you walk around the block time,

3011
02:06:56,250 --> 02:07:01,250
go in the store,
but just so you don't know why you're 

3012
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:04,841
there.
So you just buy a pack of Gum and get 

3013
02:07:04,841 --> 02:07:08,381
the hell out of there.
Can Try.

3014
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:16,970
Should have bought some juice and 
snacks,

3015
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:18,870
but you too.
Bye.
