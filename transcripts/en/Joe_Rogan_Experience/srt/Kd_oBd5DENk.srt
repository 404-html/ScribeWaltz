1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,200
The joe rogan experience of Decorah.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,230
I did a karate Guy Story
to street karate guy.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,880
What happened?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,790
This is a funny story.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,580
Okay.

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,111
We're at,

7
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:10,920
um,

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,161
at,

9
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:11,994
um,

10
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,260
Kimbo has to fight and um,

11
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,920
before the fight would go to a tap
out party and those people are there.

12
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:21,030
And then these guys,

13
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,470
he stuff guys that they're one of us,

14
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:25,450
I think selling jewelry or something
and he was with a bunch of guys and,

15
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,560
and from the guys,

16
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,320
I think he was the toughest guy.

17
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,281
So,

18
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:29,670
um,

19
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,430
we're talking and of course you know it,

20
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,700
but he didn't know who I was.

21
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:33,660
So that was the best thing.

22
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,860
And that people were
talking about finding a,

23
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,650
suddenly he comes to fourth and he goes,

24
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,023
yeah,

25
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,740
I used to do a karate.

26
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,251
He says,

27
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:43,710
but not a normal cardiac
goes to do street karate.

28
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,101
I go,

29
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:44,880
wow,

30
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,810
street karate was,

31
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:46,620
or what is that?

32
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:46,850
So,

33
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,580
well,

34
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,580
I can tell you one thing that my
routine has saved me like six,

35
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,550
seven times.

36
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,510
And I go,

37
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,343
you're a teen.

38
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,250
Yeah,

39
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,611
I got,

40
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,240
okay.

41
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,591
You,

42
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,220
you got to show me their routine.

43
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,641
And you know,

44
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,430
because I would,

45
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,290
I would love to learn.

46
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,950
So the guy comes to me and I
actually put us in a movie,

47
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,850
here comes the boom,

48
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,630
you know,

49
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,980
that was a true story.

50
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,470
I an eye,

51
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,710
there's a long story.

52
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,320
But anyway,

53
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,090
yeah.

54
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,110
So the guy comes to me,

55
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,531
he says,

56
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,101
first of all,

57
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:15,990
I would stand there
and an out of the blue,

58
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,130
I will go and eat.

59
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:17,681
No,

60
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:17,791
no,

61
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,310
no.

62
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,781
He got his,

63
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,890
God's first with his elbow.

64
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,910
He goes to me,

65
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,840
he does it to me,

66
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,800
disclose,

67
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,633
right,

68
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,260
blah blah.

69
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,094
And then he goes,

70
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,830
and he was shaking in front of my face.

71
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,664
He's serious,

72
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,390
he's serious.

73
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,530
He's this close to my face.

74
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,630
Why I shaking like this
close and my friends,

75
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,670
everybody is already like almost dying,

76
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,450
laughing.

77
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,111
And then he says,

78
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,330
and then a moment he's
perplexed by and I go,

79
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,110
I go to the neck and then he,

80
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,081
they always do this.

81
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,914
He said,

82
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,621
it says in there,

83
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,454
grab him.

84
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,020
And now he kept eye contact with me,

85
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:46,320
right.

86
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,841
And he grabbed,

87
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,230
she says,

88
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,063
I got

89
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,090
and you get through knees,

90
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,580
he gets back to contact
with me and it stops,

91
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,414
you know,

92
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,981
so I look at him,

93
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:02,814
I go,

94
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,770
Nah,

95
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,670
you never did that.

96
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,450
Don't have all it.

97
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,370
I said,

98
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,610
you practiced this in the
mirror and it looks really cool,

99
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,320
but you never did this.

100
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,900
You don't know.

101
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,000
His friends were like,

102
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,240
they were waiting for my reaction
because they were in our,

103
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:18,511
you know,

104
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:18,751
this,

105
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,060
this guy was ha.

106
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,510
It was his glory.

107
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
And then when at the moment I said,

108
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:23,994
total bullshit.

109
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,370
I started talking and there's
not a guy came to see,

110
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:26,701
you know,

111
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,240
he is,

112
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,820
he always actually professional fighters.

113
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,000
So the whole group left.

114
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,510
But the fact the,

115
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,790
the face,

116
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,520
the facial expression from all those guys,

117
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,720
they're all dressed the same.

118
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,910
Like these Khakis,

119
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,300
which shirt over the top,

120
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,560
all jewelry everywhere,

121
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,280
you know the,

122
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,590
those guys exactly.

123
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,910
Express the streets.

124
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:45,721
Karate guy.

125
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,080
His routine saves his life seven times,

126
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,711
you know,

127
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,010
and they tell me they extreme
that you believe that crap.

128
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,810
It was the most insane
thing I've ever seen.

129
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,530
And I did it.

130
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,530
And then here comes the boom you remember
had but need to the face throwaway

131
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,364
stub,

132
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,540
victory dance.

133
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:01,871
You know,

134
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,610
and I that I told that the
backstage camera for here,

135
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,110
it goes to them.

136
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,471
I said,

137
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,730
this is a true story.

138
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,620
Somebody told me this technique,

139
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
there's a lot of those knuckleheads,

140
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,301
right?

141
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,650
They'll street defense guys.

142
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,230
They're like fake karate guys.

143
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:13,630
And you know,

144
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,190
the worst part is they say,

145
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:15,701
yeah,

146
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,950
we cannot use it in the ring
because it's way too dangerous.

147
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:18,791
I said,

148
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,290
well if you could kill somebody like this,

149
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,520
she can also not kill him.

150
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,230
Right.

151
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,240
I mean what?

152
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,490
I mean they kind of control that
kind of control or you just,

153
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,230
a techniques are too lethal boss.

154
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,750
You know what I'm standing there like
it's like dropping a nuclear explosion on

155
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,140
you.

156
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,860
You know what I'm saying?

157
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,120
The one inspiring shoulder.

158
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,441
Yeah.

159
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,850
I love those videos.

160
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,180
Like Kung Fu videos or grass
at demonstrating techniques
and how they're going

161
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,630
to work.

162
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,550
And have you seen the one where the old
man who's got this class where he throws

163
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,800
like people and then a karate guy,

164
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,190
Pankratz guy comes in and beats the
shit out of all the shit out of him.

165
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,680
Right,

166
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:51,920
right.

167
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,180
I mean,

168
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,140
you see him bleed.

169
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,381
He's,

170
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,370
he's seeing himself.

171
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,450
He cannot believe it.

172
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,373
It doesn't work.

173
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,940
He's trying.

174
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,321
The one guy,

175
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,550
he does take it to get
to get the guy goes,

176
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,400
yeah.

177
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,320
He goes and he makes a somersault
and he falls under ground.

178
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,210
It's almost like he
believed his own bullshit.

179
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:07,530
Right.

180
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,590
What are these guys doing?

181
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,520
They're all faking it.

182
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,810
They know they are,

183
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,980
but they're probably,

184
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,980
it's like mass hypnosis or mass hysteria,

185
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,491
you know,

186
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,110
like cult behavior.

187
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,790
They get locked into believing.

188
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,480
Like I remember when I was in my,

189
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,340
my taekwondo school was not
like cultish in the sense,

190
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,061
like they,

191
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,590
nobody had to do anything crazy.

192
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,560
They didn't try to get your money or
get you to leave your family or anything

193
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:29,921
like that.

194
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:34,720
But the devotion that some people had
towards the instructor was a pretty crazy,

195
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,610
it's amazing and they didn't exploit it,

196
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,320
but if someone did exploited,

197
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,220
you could see that how they could get
some weak people that would really fall

198
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:42,641
into it.

199
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:43,160
It's,

200
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,810
it's sort of a disturbing
aspect of martial arts that I,

201
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,060
one of the things that I really loved
about Brazilian Jujitsu was that you

202
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,180
didn't kind of see that you
didn't see like all the bowing.

203
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,350
It was more like friendly.

204
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,940
Like when I trained
with the Machados like,

205
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:55,840
hey my friend,

206
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:56,674
how are you?

207
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,800
And it was much once they
show you the techniques,

208
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,450
but they're very friendly and more,

209
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,433
more like,

210
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,130
like,

211
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,431
you know,

212
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:06,160
they don't try to place
themselves above anyone.

213
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,390
There's no master though,

214
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,233
because

215
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,760
they're going to let you know that it is
really effective right there and there

216
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,920
on the respect that you get from them.

217
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,461
You'll,

218
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,260
they'll earn it just by being amazing.

219
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,940
But it's because they're good.

220
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,791
All the other guys,

221
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,370
she'll preach and talk about it like that.

222
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,061
They're not good.

223
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:22,870
They suck.

224
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,200
Like every guy who tells
me that he is unbelievable,

225
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,280
but he never fought.

226
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,570
It's full of Shit.

227
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:28,691
Well,

228
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,990
you know how many times
indeed it's not possible.

229
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:32,740
You never,

230
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,410
he will not know if he
can do it under pressure.

231
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,244
He will not.

232
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,150
It's amazing.

233
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,430
Do you know when you guys have told
me though that they could never lose?

234
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,680
I never lose money.

235
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:41,990
You don't know about my mentality.

236
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,640
I'm in Palatine yelling,

237
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,410
get choked.

238
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,250
I'm like an animal,

239
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:45,671
Bro.

240
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,730
I'm a go my go blank and then yeah,

241
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:49,241
that's fine.

242
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,280
It's done dropping.

243
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,181
I go blank.

244
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:52,490
Get A,

245
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,130
she'd only anything,

246
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,620
right?

247
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,580
That's the easiest.

248
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,590
I hadn't named Jess coming
into my class one time.

249
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,030
I,

250
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,840
I'm no kidding.

251
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,840
There's a guy walking in with the stash
glasses and a big belly and a blue blue

252
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:10,880
chemo knows and they came in my
NGO in Holland and he walked in,

253
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,710
there was six girls following him.

254
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,670
It was like a cult.

255
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,880
It was the weirdest thing ever.

256
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,320
And later on we find out he
could even like a pushups.

257
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,440
It was like bizarre.

258
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,110
And every time when I was show something,

259
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,510
they would say something like one time,

260
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,171
you know,

261
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:24,590
uh,

262
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,360
I had an arm bar and this girl says,

263
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,481
oh,

264
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,710
we would bite and the leg,

265
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,011
you know,

266
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,050
so I started slowly but surely,

267
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,550
I figure I'm not gonna say anything,

268
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,601
but then,

269
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:32,901
you know,

270
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,560
it kept going,

271
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,750
kept going and have somebody
in a rear naked choke.

272
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,560
And I said,

273
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,040
what's up and explaining as
she goes to somebody else.

274
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,820
She says,

275
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,530
we were Boogie.

276
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:41,901
I said,

277
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,141
no.

278
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:42,610
And I go,

279
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:42,950
oh,

280
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,550
excuse me,

281
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,383
what was that?

282
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,090
And she said,

283
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,060
we will poke your eyes out right now.

284
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,571
I said,

285
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,404
wow,

286
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,480
let's find out.

287
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,111
I mean,

288
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,250
I'm going to try this with you.

289
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:52,820
Is that cool?

290
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,300
Yeah.

291
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,721
She goes,

292
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,560
let's go sit down.

293
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,311
I said,

294
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:56,420
put my arm around her neck.

295
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,781
I said,

296
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,614
okay.

297
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,420
In three seconds I'm going to go,

298
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,381
if you touch my,

299
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm going to break your neck.

300
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:01,641
Okay,

301
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,474
let's go.

302
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,440
She goes,

303
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,561
well,

304
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:03,741
what?

305
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:03,891
Well,

306
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,401
what did she say?

307
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,000
I said,

308
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,070
in three seconds we're going
to go and we'll count down.

309
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,671
You come,

310
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:08,720
come near to my fucking,

311
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm going to break your neck.

312
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,360
Okay.

313
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,040
I should have been there.

314
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,360
What do you,

315
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,141
what do you mean?

316
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,420
I said,

317
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,150
okay.

318
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,871
You know what?

319
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:14,704
Uh,

320
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,280
normally when somebody touches my eye,

321
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,010
you think I'm going to go,

322
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,330
oh no,

323
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,510
I'm going to go to just of
my idol and I'm going to go.

324
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,660
Then my eye hurts.

325
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,100
That faith's was awesome.

326
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,000
Never,

327
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,790
never fuck with somebody who has
a dominant position over you.

328
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,470
Can I have you in an arm
bar and you buy my calf gas?

329
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:38,310
What's going to break at that moment
is the most idiot thing that people

330
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,420
actually believe that if
you put a finger in my oven,

331
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,760
even of life and death situation,

332
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,110
I'm going to let go of to choke.

333
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,320
Yeah.

334
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,010
Really.

335
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,720
You know are going to snap the neck
first and I'm going to let go to choke.

336
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,180
People don't understand how quick you go.

337
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:50,590
Unconscious like,

338
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:50,701
well,

339
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,290
if someone has a rear naked choke on you,

340
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,200
especially if you don't
really know defense.

341
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,530
He haven't been choked a lot before.

342
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:56,640
You don't know how to relax.

343
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,960
You don't know how to talk and do,

344
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,770
you know all hard.

345
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,000
It is to poke and I

346
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,050
get very hard.

347
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,901
It's very hard.

348
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,491
I squeezed my,

349
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:06,324
I put my,

350
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,350
my I against your,

351
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,370
the back of your neck,

352
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,450
back of your head.

353
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,450
Now when you're used to doing boss Wooten
is fighting in a sport type situation

354
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,710
where you got rules,

355
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,830
see out in the street there are no rules,

356
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,080
you know,

357
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,880
and like I cannot fight without
rules to I guess to have,

358
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,440
I still only I can do it better,

359
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,610
more accurate as well.

360
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,000
I used to do this,

361
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,250
well I do this radio show,

362
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,510
I won't name the guy,

363
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,540
but there was a guy that they had as
their body guard and he's a fucking total

364
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:38,541
bullshit artist and he was fucking dude
with videos doing nunchucks and shit.

365
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:44,331
It was so stupid bastard poke opie and
Anthony Show and we were on the show once

366
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,321
and this,

367
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,250
I mean I'm fine,

368
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:47,461
you know,

369
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,690
you do whatever you want,

370
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:51,140
but as soon as you're on the
air and you're represented,

371
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:51,461
you know,

372
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:51,661
you,

373
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,310
I gotta I gotta tell the truth.

374
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,250
You're on the fucking radio now and people
are going listen to you and if I let

375
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,150
you get away with some
nonsense and not a not me man,

376
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:04,260
some young kid could be listening to
that and they want to start a martial art

377
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,400
and they get sucked into doing a stupid
fucking cretes street karate classes.

378
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:08,850
Cause,

379
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,481
and I go,

380
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:09,960
listen,

381
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,920
it's real simple.

382
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,820
The shit that works on trained
killers is the best shit.

383
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,300
Yeah.

384
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,860
You don't see Anderson Silva,

385
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,251
you know,

386
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:17,910
practicing.

387
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,250
I pokes and fucking,

388
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,670
although I pokes a pretty
fucking successful,

389
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,840
you don't see him doing the,

390
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:25,431
you know,

391
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,660
a death touch and fucking,

392
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,171
you know,

393
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,004
pressure point.

394
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,460
Yup.

395
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:29,680
Uh,

396
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,481
attacks.

397
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:31,314
That shit doesn't work.

398
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,163
It doesn't work.

399
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,030
I said on an on camera,

400
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:39,010
we had an email from somebody who
said that his monster could put point

401
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,580
pressures.

402
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,080
They could knock you out.

403
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,100
I got a great story,

404
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:43,150
but there's also with Amir,

405
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,931
anyway,

406
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:44,830
I'd looked into gamma.

407
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,271
I said,

408
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:45,670
okay,

409
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,670
anybody in America you're
watching right now,

410
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,710
if you have a person who gets,

411
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,360
who says that he can knock me out with
a punch like it just pressing somewhere.

412
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,710
We invite him,

413
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:57,610
we pay him,

414
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,570
we pay his trip,

415
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,560
he can come on the show,

416
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:01,690
he can do it on camera on me.

417
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,920
He can knock me out.

418
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,341
I said,

419
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,650
it's a no lose situation
for me because if it works,

420
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,130
I'm signing up to do that stuff.

421
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,750
But I tell you it's not going to work.

422
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,220
We had this guy but a,

423
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:13,500
you know a mirror Pareto.

424
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,770
You know most of where my buddy,

425
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,870
we see these guys on
stage and the touch guys,

426
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:20,530
right?

427
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,370
So one guy goes,

428
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,160
this,

429
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,790
this,

430
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,171
this was,

431
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,004
the person has this.

432
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,050
They just fall back.

433
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,370
And then the guy said,

434
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:29,260
did you see his eyes
roll back in his skill?

435
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,420
That means you was out for real.

436
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,100
So I'd go to America.

437
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,360
This is going to be fun.

438
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,040
Why is this so these guys,

439
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,760
they come walking down after the set.

440
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,051
I said,

441
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:38,291
okay,

442
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,760
do it do to me.

443
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,320
I want you to do it to me.

444
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:42,154
You wanted him to know couch.

445
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,850
He said,

446
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,690
are you sure about that?

447
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:45,250
I still do it to me.

448
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:45,461
I,

449
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:45,640
I,

450
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:45,941
you know,

451
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:46,111
I,

452
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:46,944
I want to know how to feel.

453
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,651
And he goes,

454
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:48,041
you know what,

455
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,821
I could actually,

456
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:49,090
uh,

457
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,020
I got something better.

458
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:51,370
So we already steered away from it,

459
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:52,090
right?

460
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,601
So he says,

461
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:53,380
uh,

462
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,250
let me show you this.

463
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,690
And he walks over to his body,

464
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,080
they start talking to each other and
then he walks away and in the corner he

465
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:01,751
stands like this.

466
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,584
Huh?

467
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,470
I mean crazy.

468
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,850
Hiney run stores,

469
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:11,510
his friend,

470
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,480
and he goes like this fuck.

471
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,810
And a midair.

472
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,000
He stops and he flies on the ground.

473
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,970
So he threw like Kung Fu console,

474
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,150
hence I didn't touch him,

475
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,043
doesn't touch him.

476
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,630
I go,

477
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,463
dude,

478
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm sold.

479
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,040
Do that to me.

480
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,490
Right.

481
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,960
I'm going to attack you right now.

482
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,400
So I'm going to the Kona.

483
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,180
And he goes,

484
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,391
yeah,

485
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,130
but you have to be a really angry.

486
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,360
I said,

487
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,830
excuse me,

488
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,400
you really angry or
otherwise it won't work.

489
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,060
I say,

490
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,230
your friend just did it right?

491
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,070
I said,

492
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,630
I think I can better act then your friend.

493
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,051
Don't worry.

494
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:39,980
I'll be in the zone,

495
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,660
you know,

496
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,151
will he says,

497
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:41,271
no,

498
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:41,421
no,

499
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:41,920
because if,

500
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,000
if you're not real angry,

501
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,990
it doesn't work.

502
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,220
It needs to be that balance.

503
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,480
So I know it was this way out.

504
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,700
So I walked over to him
and I'm standing like this.

505
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,190
I say kick me into pills and he says,

506
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,410
what?

507
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,243
I say kick me.

508
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,830
I'm going to go really fucking pissed.

509
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,360
He did want to do it.

510
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,203
Needless to say,

511
00:11:59,410 --> 00:11:59,741
I mean,

512
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,800
but they're idiots that
truly believe that is true.

513
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,311
Well,

514
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,790
it's so easy to take someone who doesn't
know anything like it was a student and

515
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,780
trick them like that and
be a con man like that.

516
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
And you know what the worst thing is?

517
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,100
There's teachers out there,

518
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,630
they give you a false sense
of security and then you,

519
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,210
they teach you how to defend a knife,

520
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:16,451
you know,

521
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:17,231
grabbing the wrist.

522
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:17,680
I mean,

523
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,160
never did.

524
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,420
I mean it's so dangerous.

525
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,400
Knife is dangerous than a
gun on a short distance.

526
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,130
At least they teach them the wrong way.

527
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,960
And then something happens on the street.

528
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,910
Somebody pulls a knife
and he goes to his buddy,

529
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:28,141
dude,

530
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:28,780
it's that bag.

531
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,560
I got it.

532
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:29,811
Yeah.

533
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:30,310
You know,

534
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,143
and they get killed.

535
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,000
Eddie Bravo has a crazy
story about that guy's fault.

536
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,834
It's theirs.

537
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:42,560
Okay.
