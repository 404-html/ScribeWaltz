1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ha freaks and free gets we're back.
We're back with lots of stories because 

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,960
the internet is filled with a 
pleasurable news items.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
It's been a fun weekend.
It's been a fun weekend for you.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,030
Brian loves,
uh,

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:20,031
cause I know Brian is sometimes a bit 
aimless and when he finds a cause boys 

6
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:23,070
he'd get excited and his cause was this 
gentleman across himself,

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,180
the fat Jewish or fat Jew depending on 
who you ask.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,560
And I,
you know,

9
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,561
what's really fucked up?
I was telling people to check out his 

10
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,931
instagram because I'm like,
guys always get some funny stuff on 

11
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,841
there.
I didn't even think about where it came 

12
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:39,270
from because to me as a comic,
I guess it's like a self centered thing.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,850
Like I think of like stealing jokes is 
like stealing.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,940
Like someone stand up and they do jokes.
I never thought of like memes as jokes,

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,370
but they really are.
And a lot of them are from like an 

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,580
individual page.
Like there's a girl that he stole from.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,910
It's really funny.
And I went to her page and it's all her 

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,910
own shit.
And she's wizard name.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,620
Uh,
which one are you talking about?

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,070
Um,
I've,

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,080
I've actually gone through the last 24 
hours and have checked over almost 100 

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,230
different people.
I've been researching

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,240
ones that you retweeted.
One of the ones that I retweeted that 

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,640
you put up,
it was a girl,

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,250
attractive young lady with dark brown 
hair.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,320
Find it real quick,
but a point being these people,

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,160
they,
they,

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,250
you know,
before Brian was a standup comic when I 

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,811
met Brian,
Brian do like really funny videos and 

30
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:33,850
there was a time where you,
what is her name?

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,690
God dammit.
Princess of Wifi.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,280
Yeah.
Yeah,

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,390
yeah.
Hilarious.

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Yeah.
And it's super funny because I'd never 

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,531
even realized it's a smart one where she
posts a bunch of emojis and it's this 

36
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:47,130
shout out to the snail for facing the 
other way.

37
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:51,170
And because the one emoji animal that's 
not facing the same way as the snail,

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,840
and so he pretty much just copied every 
single thing she did and put it on a,

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,430
on his thing and didn't credit her.
Yeah.

40
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,360
And it's time stamped.
And that's another thing.

41
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,950
Nowadays,
everything's timestamped.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,560
And so when I've been researching all 
these,

43
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,710
a lot of people have already researched 
this guy because he's been doing this 

44
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,471
for awhile.
It's just never caught fire so fast as 

45
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:14,471
it did this weekend.

46
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:16,910
Well,
we were talking about you before you,

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,140
before I met you,
you were kind of like a comedian on the 

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,910
Internet before the Internet was like 
that popular,

49
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:26,450
like you'd make funny videos and that's 
how we became friends.

50
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,750
Um,
but like that thing that people don't 

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,451
think of that as being a comedian,
like you think of a comedian has to go 

52
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:34,451
on stage.
Not really,

53
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,830
because if you're this girl or this guy 
right here,

54
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,470
Devin,

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,600
that's actually an original person I 
found out this has been reported as 

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,370
Davin Magwood being the one that 
originally wrote this lion tweet,

57
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,570
which is going to start dressing like a 
lion.

58
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:51,250
So the cops know that if they kill me,
white people will avenge me.

59
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,230
Uh,
that was actually written by something.

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,610
Somebody completely different,
uh,

61
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,500
and uh,
that persons are gay on twitter.

62
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,000
Roxane gay.
And

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,480
I retweet this guy,
stole it from her,

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,720
from her,
and he was complaining that he wasn't 

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:08,720
getting credit.
Yeah.

66
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,060
No really.
I mean this just happened.

67
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,550
I don't know though.
We don't know the.

68
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,600
Is that what the timestamp true.

69
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,560
The timestamp on our gay is July 29th.
Two Thousand 15.

70
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,561
And devins is July 29th at nine.
Oh,

71
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,530
four.
Nine.

72
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,220
Oh,
5:00

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,340
PM is his in 11:44
AM is hers.

74
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,670
Oh,
so he saw that day and stole it?

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Yeah.
Allegedly.

76
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,830
Unless,
although she reads minds time traveling 

77
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,400
north or that's what I was going to say.
Or is she like,

78
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:45,401
lives in Japan and he lives in Hawaii or
something because the timestamp work 

79
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,010
locally though,
doesn't it work locally?

80
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,480
It was going to work in.
Yeah,

81
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,320
it does.
Yeah.

82
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,750
It doesn't work like that.
I'm just kidding.

83
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,980
Yeah.
Well that's fucked up that people are 

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,511
claiming they got stolen from.
And how do people not know that this is 

85
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:58,511
going to get out?

86
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,200
Well,
the thing I,

87
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:03,040
I've heard of fat Jew for a bit and uh,
he's been thrown on Tmz a lot.

88
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:08,041
He's been thrown on all these shows.
He's one of those guys that I've always 

89
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,591
got like,
how is this guy here whose mom and dad 

90
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:10,591
is,
you know,

91
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:11,170
this guy.
But then,

92
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,290
uh,
then somebody,

93
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,300
he got signed to ca,
which is one of the biggest talent 

94
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,791
agencies here in Los Angeles.
And that immediately all the comedians 

95
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,310
came out of the woodwork,
like,

96
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,040
wait a second,
I can't even pay my rent,

97
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,010
and this guy's just got signed a comedy 
central deal,

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,910
a book,
a music deal with apple.

99
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,410
He has his own show on apple beats one,
which is their new radio station.

100
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,760
So they have a dj who's just a 
plagiarist on,

101
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,750
on their brand new fresh station.
Uh,

102
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,270
yeah.
So,

103
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:48,271
uh,
there's actually been so many reports 

104
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,120
like from like New York News,
Washington Post,

105
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,720
all these places have actually reported 
about him being a plagiarist for awhile.

106
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,080
But it's,
it's been one of those things where 

107
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,080
everyone kind of knew,
but it never,

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,621
the Internet never caught on.
And so this is amazing because there's 

109
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,280
one report,
uh,

110
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,320
which is,
you have to check out this website.

111
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,050
I sent it to you.
Uh,

112
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,630
it's on storify,
it's top 50 jokes,

113
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,960
the fat Jewish bogarted from the 
Internet and this was written,

114
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,770
it's just 50 joke now again,

115
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,060
there's 19 hours ago.
So this is new to.

116
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,170
This was all coming out while this was 
all going down.

117
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah.
And now the first one is obviously wrong

118
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:30,441
that they have on there.
And this is one thing that I've been 

119
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:30,470
doing the last couple of days I've 
actually been taking these,

120
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,010
uh,

121
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,880
if you just put this much energy in your
own life,

122
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,900
he would be so much healthier.
Everything would be great.

123
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:42,901
You wouldn't be totally off smoke and 
you'd be going to the gym on a regular 

124
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:42,901
basis.
Your drinking water.

125
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:43,590
Right.
But you know,

126
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:48,591
with the car lisman see a video.
I did that overnight when that happened 

127
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:48,591
and it's,
it's an obsession when,

128
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,220
when it's something that's unique and,
and,

129
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:55,221
and I feel like people need to know 
about and this to me is something I 

130
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:55,860
can't believe has been going on for so 
long.

131
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,790
And when I went to the store last night 
and everyone goes,

132
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,960
oh yeah,
I know about that guy.

133
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:00,610
Yeah,
he sucks.

134
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,070
I'm like,
wait,

135
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,600
you haven't heard what's been going on 
lately?

136
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,040
Sandy,
Dan toe,

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,620
he who's a comedian,
a comedy store comic,

138
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,650
a paid regular.
He actually had a bit of his that,

139
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,670
his standup bit that he had taken and 
made it a meme and then he called him 

140
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,650
out on it in the comments and like a 
couple hours later he deleted it.

141
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,910
And the same thing happened to Amir Kay,
who is another comedian.

142
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,080
Uh,
so it's,

143
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,450
it's a lot of comics.
I know about this.

144
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,710
What he does have a bunch of interns or 
writer or a bunch of employees.

145
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,480
Well,
that's what he's been claiming for about

146
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,980
the last,
I think five years.

147
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,380
Uh,
he's been claiming that he has employees

148
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:36,880
and,
and,

149
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,890
and,
and all these people working on his 

150
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:41,890
website,
but you know,

151
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,740
that's,
that excuse might happen once or twice,

152
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,720
but you know what,
look,

153
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,920
this is literally here is 50 of them and
I've already found them

154
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,660
could happen.
It could happen more than that.

155
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,310
The thing about saying it once or twice,
it's like,

156
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,100
no,
I'm not trying to stick up for this guy.

157
00:06:56,101 --> 00:07:00,510
But the reality of like Sitcom writers,
like Seinfeld stole,

158
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,570
not Seinfeld the man,
but the show stole one of Kevin James 

159
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,040
Bits and did it on their episode.
And this is when Kevin James was not 

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,040
known.
Kevin was a friend of mine.

161
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,350
Still is,
but it was back then and Kevin hadn't 

162
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,350
made it yet.
He hadn't,

163
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,920
it wasn't.
He had an uncanny queens.

164
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,970
He'd won star search,
you know,

165
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,010
and he'd been like on a couple of 
different TV shows.

166
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,770
Um,
and he had a big deal with NBC,

167
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:25,410
like a development deal dues on sitcoms.
So I was there,

168
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:30,411
I went with them,
he did the showcase for all these NBC 

169
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:30,411
writers.
So,

170
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:34,581
but these showcases are like,
they do these sitcoms things where they 

171
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,540
would sit down and they would bring,
you know,

172
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,550
all the show runners from very shows 
that have deals with them and they say,

173
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,140
Hey,
we got this guy,

174
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,110
his name's Kevin James.

175
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,580
We just signed.
And it was really funny.

176
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,550
We want you guys to watch him do stand 
up and tell us what you think.

177
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,550
So they watched him do standup and then 
they stole his bit.

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,750
And use it as an episode of Seinfeld,
the bit about Muffin tops.

179
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,730
Oh yeah.
Kevin James.

180
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,760
It was one of his signature bits and 
this was a long ass time ago and it was 

181
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,510
before the show and it's not the first 
time that happened.

182
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:08,511
That happened a gang of times.
It happened a bunch of times with a 

183
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:08,511
bunch of different comics on a bunch of 
different shows.

184
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:12,240
They would have their signature bits 
turned into m,

185
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,590
two M plotlines on sitcoms or gags on in
living color was a big one.

186
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,250
Like a lot of guys claim that some of 
the writers from in living color would 

187
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,311
come down to the comedy store.
Watch guys do stand up like handyman 

188
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,220
someone.
Someone said that handyman was something

189
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:32,580
that was stolen from.
Not the Damon had stolen it,

190
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:35,220
but some writer it stolen it.
I don't know if that's true or not,

191
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,450
but there's a lot of those things that 
happen when they think they can get away

192
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:44,451
with it.
Especially if they can go down to the 

193
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:44,451
comedy store on open mic night.

194
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,260
Yeah.
That's what a lot of people there.

195
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,680
So many random people that come to these
open mic,

196
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,810
uh,
places that just sit there with their 

197
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,601
notepads,
just writing everything down or writing 

198
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:55,601
math.
You should be smacked.

199
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,070
You want to sit in the back

200
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,300
of the comedy store?
Let me look.

201
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,840
They could always record it and then you
know,

202
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,630
people do that on their phones.
Anyway,

203
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,070
there was going to record sets.
Just got to,

204
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,670
in this day and age you got to assume 
and when I was first starting out,

205
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,220
you have to have a fucking actual tape 
recorder.

206
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Couldn't just sit in your pocket.
Like you could have your phone in your 

207
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,590
jacket pocket and no one would know and 
it could be recording.

208
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,630
As long as the mic is up,
it comes out crystal clear.

209
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I've done it in my back pocket like I've
done sets and just record it and stuff 

210
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,180
that in my back pocket to see what it 
would sound like.

211
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,550
I can hear everything.
Everything.

212
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,950
Did anyone ever used to take the old 
like radio shack,

213
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,080
box interview,
private investigator,

214
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,310
tape recorder like that,
you know,

215
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,470
the huge microphone and just sit it on 
the stool.

216
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,170
Oh yeah,
yeah,

217
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,740
I definitely saw people do that.
Um,

218
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,980
I actually used to have one that was a,
a mini disc recorder.

219
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,550
Who will fuck taught me how to do that.
Somebody,

220
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,080
somebody taught me about it.
He had it clipped to his belt.

221
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,630
Uh,
I'll try to remember who the dude is and

222
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:50,631
give them credit,
but he had a mini district porter 

223
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,560
clipped his belt and then he had a line 
that ran up to like a little lapel mic 

224
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,950
and he would do all the sets like that 
and then store them all in many disks.

225
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,400
So I had a mini disc recorder installed 
in the comedy store so I could just 

226
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,330
record the sets and listened to on me 
desk and then we switched over to dat 

227
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,460
and then we switched over to cd when you
could burn cds and now I don't even know

228
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:13,461
if that's still there.
So they still have that CD setup where 

229
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:14,100
you can burn your copy of it.
I don't even know anymore.

230
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,650
Is it even necessary at all anymore?

231
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,850
Nah,
Nah.

232
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,560
Phones are just as good.
I mean,

233
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:23,340
unless you want to get something that's 
the quality that you could release as an

234
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,100
album because you could get it.
Definitely have it set up.

235
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,100
You just have the microphone.
Um,

236
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,200
some parts of the audience mic like a 
couple spots might.

237
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,200
But um,
what was my point?

238
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,210
Point being?
How the fuck did we get here?

239
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,990
Oh,
about how uh,

240
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,390
Kevin James.

241
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,220
So they steal.
So if he had employees,

242
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,710
if the fat Jew had,
I feel weird calling them that

243
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,610
I actually enjoy it.
And this particular only time

244
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,640
you're allowed to say the fat Jew,
but I feel like someone's going to take 

245
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
this shit out of context.
It's kind of a hack though.

246
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,090
I'll just going to call them the fat 
Jewish.

247
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,120
It seems like less overall statement.
It seems like a superhero.

248
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,970
The Fat Jewish,
but he could easily have employees but 

249
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,420
hasn't even been proven that he has an 
employee's.

250
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,800
And where's this guy getting the money 
to hire employees?

251
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,130
The other thing I was looking at on his 
page was he would talk about how much 

252
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,560
money he's making off of it.
Instagram.

253
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,980
I saw Katie Kirk and he was doing this 
interview and I was like,

254
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,040
that's weird.
I go out because I don't see like a lot 

255
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,351
of product placement,
so I went to his inner instagram to try 

256
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:29,351
to find product placement.

257
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:32,580
I can tell you everything and it's funny
that you said how you didn't say,

258
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:34,950
why is Katie couric interviewing this 
guy,

259
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:36,540
the fat Jew.
How'd that even happen?

260
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,980
Because he has so many instagram 
followers.

261
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,700
Yeah,
that's why.

262
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,400
But I was thinking he has his own wine 
company,

263
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,180
so like the famous picture of him 
pouring two bottles of his own wine on 

264
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,420
his chest.
That's his own wine is a.

265
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,550
This is independent of his instagram,
right?

266
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,730
Yes,
but so what he does is he mixes all 

267
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,380
these into it and then he's also done 
burger king,

268
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,410
chicken fries and ads and he also 
reportedly has done ads where he can 

269
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:08,341
delete them within a certain amount of 
time so he can just post a picture of 

270
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:08,341
him,
you know,

271
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:12,901
enjoying a delicious white castle burger
and then they deleted in 20 minutes.

272
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,840
That's pretty smart.
Most of them don't leave those ads up.

273
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,420
They'll delete them within a week or so.
They're up on their feed and what's 

274
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,421
interesting and what's really 
interesting is that his wife slash 

275
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:27,330
girlfriend or whatever,
she's works at tinder as their head of a

276
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,500
publicist,
a publicist for tender.

277
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,850
When she she is trained to do.
When I dated a publicist,

278
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,010
all she did was like telling me all 
these secrets,

279
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,400
like,
no,

280
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:41,401
you can do this and do that and do that.
Their whole life is how to make money 

281
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,810
off of social media and get noticed on 
social media.

282
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,420
So he has not only a wine company s 
somebody said he has a,

283
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,440
a,
a tee shirt company a and he's got a 

284
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,451
bunch of different little companies that
he just intertwines into his instagram 

285
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:02,611
to make it look like he's just doing so.
He's like the Ryan seacrest of like just

286
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,760
joke thievery and getting shit right.

287
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,490
Promoted his.
His one's constantly got a bunch of toes

288
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,300
in the game.
Yeah.

289
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:15,301
He has another famous picture which has 
him laying in a pool drinking out of a 

290
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,950
pool that has his own wine in it.
Kind of a copy of that.

291
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,350
A kind of a copy of that show will get 
us pulled down here,

292
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,220
right?
Last Man on earth is a from that movie,

293
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:30,970
so he's even stealing his ideas for 
pitchers to sell his wind from TV shows.

294
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,580
He's using Reddit,
he's going on websites.

295
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:38,581
What his formula is,
and there's a couple people that 

296
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:38,581
actually do that.
This.

297
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:42,350
He's not the only one.
There's another guy a fuck jerry who was

298
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:47,351
another almost as bad if not worse,
a guy and what they do is they just go 

299
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:49,180
to reddit or they just go to any of 
these websites,

300
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,880
find the number one trending thing at 
that second,

301
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,980
try to find the meat in it,
take the meat,

302
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,200
throw it on a picture of a black 
cheeseburger,

303
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,120
and then you,
you go,

304
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,290
you have it.

305
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,510
Well,
I'm glad.

306
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,400
That's pretty much what the formula like
if you.

307
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,090
You look for the funniest thing,
a thread at different websites.

308
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,820
What has most fused most posts with that
day they take out,

309
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,210
steal that idea and then mix it with 
something else is what he does the most 

310
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,440
where he'll just take a photo of a fat 
chick or something like that,

311
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,230
but or whatever and put,
put the two together or.

312
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:24,580
But what he's mostly he does is somebody
else does that exact same thing and then

313
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,950
he just takes it word from word and the 
pitcher crops,

314
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,100
the name out doesn't give any credit and
just throws it up there.

315
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,260
I've seen that and that's,
that's like one of those things where 

316
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,491
you could say like maybe somebody sent 
it to him and he just didn't know who 

317
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:38,560
made it,
so he just posted it,

318
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,090
but not if you change all the words and 
put them in your own handwriting or your

319
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,430
own font rather because he's done that 
before too.

320
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,750
Yeah.
Well it's,

321
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:51,751
it's interesting because what I was 
getting at earlier is that I never 

322
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:52,280
thought of like an internet

323
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,360
comedian.
Whoops.

324
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,500
I never thought of an internet comedian 
as being the same as a comedian,

325
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,700
but you clearly are like the young lady 
that we talked about.

326
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,540
What the fuck's her name again?

327
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,810
Well,
it's,

328
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,310
it's,
it's,

329
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,830
it's the same as your audience.
Uh,

330
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,710
I have to go back.

331
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,570
We've got to shoot name deep and now so 
we know.

332
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,260
Uh,
but drew drew,

333
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,360
drew to do,
what is it one of the ones that I 

334
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,360
retweeted from you.
Oh,

335
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,820
princess wifey,
princess of Wifi.

336
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,020
Um,
that these,

337
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,820
you know,
these people are working,

338
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
they're creating these things like this 
and then they get a lot of like our 

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,361
friend slash lien from up in Canada.
Hilarious and got famous just from 

340
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:40,911
writing funny shit on twitter and then 
got a gang of like organically got a 

341
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:46,491
gang of twitter followers just because 
she writes funny stuff and I'm sure 

342
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:49,500
she's been ripped off.
I can't even tell you people have.

343
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,720
She's,
I think she tried doing stand up at one 

344
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:54,720
point in time,
but she didn't for a long time.

345
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,730
There's a lot of people that would read 
her shit and go,

346
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,880
this could be a really funny bit.
I could take this and turn into a bit,

347
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,770
so I guarantee you that's happened.

348
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,230
Yeah.
And it's happened in a ton of time with 

349
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,480
just normal people.
I think we've probably all done it 

350
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,551
before.
Even my mom's probably posted a photo 

351
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:11,560
that she didn't make,
have some quote that she didn't write of

352
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,580
footsteps from Jesus or something.
But like the big difference between this

353
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,370
and us doing it is this,
he's directly getting paid to do this.

354
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,990
He's directly,
uh,

355
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,080
creating a business and an empire based 
on only plagiarism.

356
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:28,860
Well,
he's,

357
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,410
what he's doing is he's taking a lot of 
us think of as innocent,

358
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,220
which is,
you know,

359
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:34,810
you send me something.
I retweeted,

360
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:39,811
we all do that,
but he's doing it like in a creepy way 

361
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:43,201
too,
because I used the repost app so it 

362
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,511
shows I repost things.
Like every time I repost something it's 

363
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:46,810
with a repost app unless someone sends 
it to me and I can't figure out where it

364
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:51,811
came from.
And then I had one of those and I 

365
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:51,811
deleted it.
I deleted recently.

366
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,170
Well,
what if black people have been gold this

367
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,940
whole time?
I was like,

368
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:56,470
that's not mine.
It's funny,

369
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,120
it's a funny meme,
but I'm like,

370
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,310
I have to delete it now because we're 
doing this whole thing.

371
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,110
Like I never trying to profit off of 
that,

372
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,280
but I thought about it.
I was like,

373
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,270
that's somebody else's work and I don't 
want to get it twisted with me.

374
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:09,730
So I deleted that.
Now that all this was going on,

375
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:10,330
I was like,
well,

376
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,960
I can't be a hipper.

377
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,030
Right.
It's interesting how sensitive every 

378
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,030
single thing is getting.

379
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,100
What's the difference though?
I mean,

380
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,250
it's really all about intent.
I mean,

381
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,040
that's what it is,
right?

382
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,950
Yeah.
It's really interesting.

383
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,130
I've been doing so much research on this
guy that I didn't.

384
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,470
One thing I know it,
uh,

385
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,040
that episode of workaholics where he's a
pod at forward,

386
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,440
the one that they talked about Joe Rogan
Isms in it.

387
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,310
A lot fat Jew has a cameo in that for no
apparent reason at all.

388
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:41,540
They look over and he's like doing 
pushups on the ground and that's it.

389
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,330
So He's been working his way into 
Hollywood.

390
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,820
He has a video that's on youtube.
It's called fat Jew nude on shrooms in 

391
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,700
Mexico where he's just shooting guns,
uh,

392
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,690
and running around naked on mushrooms 
and then driving at the end.

393
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,500
But it's,
there's a lot of interesting videos.

394
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:03,501
There's another video,
this news morning news place had him on 

395
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:07,911
the morning news and he was,
this was right before his instagram was 

396
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:11,001
starting to take off a little and he was
with his manager and some other person 

397
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,440
all being interviewed and I wish I could
find.

398
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,150
I've been looking for it if I find I can
show it,

399
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,180
send it to you.
But it's interesting because he kind of 

400
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180
put it down like yes,
no,

401
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,191
they,
the secret to what I'm doing is just 

402
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:26,250
posting a bunch of funny stuff or buts 
and then getting tons of money from it.

403
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,310
And then like he just broke it down.
So like if I ever make a video of this 

404
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,181
guy,
I put that aside at my house because 

405
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:35,340
there's so many amazing quotes from the 
interview and it's really weird.

406
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,860
Is his manager,
whoever was sitting next to him.

407
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,610
She's like,
yeah,

408
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,920
we're going to make all this money out 
and we're going to make all this money,

409
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,090
and then there's a guy the black at the 
end go.

410
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,180
What still good.
I don't think this is what.

411
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,280
I think instagram is good for our health
and fitness and a lot of things,

412
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,670
not just buckets.
There's one of those morning news guys.

413
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,520
Those guys are always wrong.
That's where their morning news guys.

414
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,180
But it was an interesting interview.
So much interesting thing I've been 

415
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,460
looking through for the last couple of 
days on this guy.

416
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,860
So his comedy central pilot got canceled
so that,

417
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,900
that was announced,
uh,

418
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,160
that comedy central confirmed that they 
have to.

419
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,860
How did they,
not if they're after them and see a 

420
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:11,860
thing.
Yeah,

421
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:11,860
because they kept men Sia on after that 
show.

422
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,750
And his ratings dropped by more than 50 
percent instantly.

423
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,220
And then like,
oh Christ.

424
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,700
And then also they knew,
they knew what the fuck he did,

425
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,750
you know,
and then they have a show on and they 

426
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:24,750
also knew,
and this was a big one,

427
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,690
that the fucking show was responsible 
for plagiarism.

428
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,630
I'll a lot of it,
a lot of it,

429
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,930
and Lewis black was fucking furious 
because Lewis Black was on comedy 

430
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,891
central,
so he was on the Jon Stewart show and 

431
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:40,940
while he's on the Jon Stewart show,
he's been stealing is doing his shit and

432
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:45,941
not only just doing it but doing it like
this with the fingers the way that told 

433
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:50,420
a bit like Lewis,
I mean he's literally doing Louis Shit 

434
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,990
on the same network loses on,
so they.

435
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:59,010
They took a fuck load of heat for that.
Plus there's a new regime at comedy 

436
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,580
central now and they're way smarter and 
they're just there.

437
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,690
They're on the ball as far as like their
choices.

438
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,020
That's why you seen shows like Amy 
Schumer's show like Hannibal Burress,

439
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,260
like Ari there,
you're seeing good show and taking 

440
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,350
chances from real comedians for once.
It's.

441
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,720
Yeah,
it's still have their online platform,

442
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:17,120
which they've been really smart about 
developing too though,

443
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:20,630
like this is not happening.
They started out as an online platform.

444
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:23,360
Then they brought it to a television 
after they work it out that way.

445
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,880
So there's very little pressure on it.
It's smart.

446
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,160
They're doing everything the right way,
so they're like,

447
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,290
fuck this dude,
you know this,

448
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,450
you just can't do that.
You can't do it.

449
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,300
I don't know if it was him or if it was 
as employees.

450
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,560
We don't really don't know.

451
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,910
He's asked to take responsibility for 
it,

452
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:43,230
especially if it's happened in large 
institutions writing about it.

453
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,050
You know what I mean?
You

454
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,740
know?
Yeah.

455
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,740
No,
keep going like that.

456
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,980
He

457
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
has to take responsibility for that 
because he is the one getting the 

458
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,740
paychecks for all this.
Even if his interns,

459
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,250
which are probably unpaid interns is 
what I'm guessing a.

460
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,790
You have to do it.
What I thought was interesting as Brian 

461
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,980
[inaudible],
Hennie Hennigan a wrote something 

462
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,080
interesting because he has a book coming
out and he goes,

463
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:11,020
did fat Jew sign an affidavit for grand 
central pub,

464
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,710
hatchet us that his new book is all his 
own work.

465
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,740
Wonder why they're helping a plagiarist.
I mean that comes different to when it 

466
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,180
comes to authors and books and stuff 
like that because you,

467
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,140
you're selling words and

468
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,380
on the ball as your manager.
I know he won't do it.

469
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,840
You can only have one client,
especially,

470
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:32,270
it's Doug Stanhope,
he's got holes in his stomach,

471
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:37,271
was intestines poke through,
he can lay on his back and forces 

472
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,140
intestines through holes in his 
abdominal wall that I love him,

473
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:40,220
but he's not going to make it.
Well,

474
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,750
I told,
I told Brian that I had alive.

475
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,330
I mean,
he's obviously made it as a comedian.

476
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,060
Brian I call shotgun.
All right.

477
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Here's the thing.
This fat Jewish guy has not posted 

478
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,060
anything in many hours,
which is very rare.

479
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,380
Like his last one is 18 hours ago.
So while this is all going down,

480
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,930
he's a,
he's sworn off of the,

481
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,070
uh,
the instagram.

482
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,310
The other thing is you look at it,
the recent posts,

483
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:06,500
like one of them that he stole from 
that,

484
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,420
a princess of Wifi or.

485
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,470
No,
that's the other one.

486
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,770
This is another girl who's hilarious.
This is the one I was actually thinking 

487
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,801
of.
Pistol Sherman is her name a s c h u r 

488
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,360
a.
she's fucking hilarious.

489
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,170
Her,
her,

490
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,470
all.
Her instagram feed is shit that she's 

491
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,470
made.
I assume.

492
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,470
I mean,
I'm not,

493
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,330
I'm not 100 percent sure,
but I'm pretty sure it's all her work 

494
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,470
and it's really fucking funny.
Like she's just a funny comic like,

495
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:36,920
or funny at writing this stuff.
Whatever it is,

496
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,390
you know,
whatever you want to call her.

497
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,720
Um,
so he's got a bit that he took from her,

498
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,140
the international hand symbol for what 
the hell is this guy doing?

499
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,170
She's got this thing like what w,
which is true.

500
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,380
So he takes that.
He puts it up and then he just writes 

501
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,960
her name on the bottom.
That's it.

502
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,370
See it,
see that he's got it here.

503
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,840
That's her.
That's her.

504
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,200
But if you go to his,
all he does is he took,

505
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,870
he took it and he put,
he puts his own bullshit in it.

506
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,480
Um,

507
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,300
and when he puts his own bullshit in it,
he puts her name at the bottom.

508
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,690
He doesn't even say created by.
He just tags her.

509
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,290
Yeah.

510
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,680
And he supposedly has been adding tags 
to all his last week.

511
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,660
It's the fat Jewish story.
There's so much going on.

512
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,870
It's not the fat Jew is the fat Jewish.
Yeah.

513
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,200
Yeah.
See that one down there?

514
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,280
The Middle One?
Yeah.

515
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,300
Okay,
so you click on that.

516
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:39,250
It's got 209,000
likes.

517
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,160
By the way,
the most I've ever gotten.

518
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,990
I think maybe I got like 25,000
likes ever.

519
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,640
Well he's got over $5 million on 
instagram.

520
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,380
I know it's incredible.
But look what he did there.

521
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,140
So he takes this and look at.
He wrote you guys,

522
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:56,141
this is funny because it's relatable and
we all share these types of human 

523
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,650
experiences in parentheses.
Sorry I'm on molly.

524
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,580
No you're not.
And then at Pistol Sherman.

525
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,610
So he stole her thing and then he sorta 
just sorta tags her but it doesn't say 

526
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:13,421
created by and then under the theory say
posting stolen joke from the person you 

527
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,170
credit also clearly stole it.
Oh,

528
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,340
what the person you credit also clearly 
stole it.

529
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,070
Really?
See that's the problem and it's,

530
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,550
it's,
it's,

531
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,810
I've been noticed when I've been doing 
is as I've taken the photo and cropped 

532
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,291
it out and then re uploaded it to google
images and tried to find the first time 

533
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:38,350
stamped that you.
Cause they can search by photo and 

534
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:38,350
Colin's trait,
FBI,

535
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,560
I mean one,
one of these took me over an hour just 

536
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,120
to find out who really made it and it 
turned out at the gym.

537
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,410
You can stare machine.
It's true.

538
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,910
I'll help and I know what's wrong with 
me.

539
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,240
I need to stop.
And you do upset.

540
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,480
It's funny though.
I started,

541
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:58,481
I had a big smile on my face when I 
started getting texts from you and then 

542
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,240
when I saw the patent was retweeting 
your stuff and I said all right,

543
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,410
I'm in.
I started retweeting it too.

544
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm like fuck it,
let's just,

545
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,550
let's pile on.
So he doesn't even say this is what bugs

546
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,180
me.
Sorry,

547
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:09,560
I'm on Molly,
whatever.

548
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,550
And then at Pistol Sherman.
So I don't know whether or not this girl

549
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,730
didn't write it or did write it.
But the point is he thinks she wrote it 

550
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,720
and instead of crediting her,
he just writes her name.

551
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,890
It doesn't even like write original by 
got this from,

552
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,450
you know,
this is hilarious.

553
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:28,520
I found it on her page.

554
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,890
She just has her name there.
That doesn't mean anything,

555
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,070
like I put people's names at the bottom 
of their list so they'll see it or 

556
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,070
something.
I mean,

557
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,460
I don't.
It gets deeper than enough.

558
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,490
It gets deeper than the Nacho.
I got deep into this one thread I got.

559
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,180
I got deepen this one thread that even 
had proof of him making fake twitter 

560
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,471
accounts and just taking jokes and 
having that fake person tweet them and 

561
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:57,620
then him crediting the fake twitter 
account that he owns.

562
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,340
Oh,
oh no.

563
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,600
You sure?
How do you know that,

564
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,910
man?
It's a lot.

565
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,990
It's a whole message board page or 
Reddit page or something like that.

566
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,850
Read it.
Read.

567
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,700
It's been on this for a while though.
So that's what's great about that.

568
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,440
Uh,
that it's now finally,

569
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,800
I think the Internet is now catching 
onto this whole thing.

570
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,130
Wow.

571
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,130
They definitely are today.
And the fact that he hasn't made a post 

572
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,150
in 18 hours and if you look before that,
he was making like five,

573
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,680
six of them a day.
They were like rapid fire.

574
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,870
That was the thing that was funny about 
us page.

575
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:29,750
You would constantly see some pretty 
silly shit.

576
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,940
I got to stop following them on 
instagram.

577
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:33,320
I think I'm still following them right 
now.

578
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,320
Somebody told me that already.
Then I'm still following.

579
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:39,230
Yeah,
fucking tattle tales.

580
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,260
And it was really weird as he steals 
from people that if he had any common 

581
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,260
sense that you

582
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,040
would not steal from Matt Besser.
I don't know if you know Matt Besser 

583
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,770
from back in the days.
He's old school.

584
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:54,771
He,
I think he's one of the founders of UCB 

585
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:54,890
or if not the founder of UCB.
Uh,

586
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,060
he stole from him.
He put it.

587
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,350
How many potheads does it take to screw 
in a light bulb?

588
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,240
None.
We're trying to keep it mellow here.

589
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,210
Funny Little Joke.
Fat Jews stole it.

590
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,350
And that's like in the comedy world,
that's like insane.

591
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:08,580
If you steal from Matt,
that's.

592
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,900
Yeah,
well there's a lot of people out there 

593
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,300
that don't know who he is and they think
that they can get away with it.

594
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,600
That's what he's doing.
I mean,

595
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,700
what he's doing,
he got away with up until now when you 

596
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,140
get away with something for that long 
and it's that profitable.

597
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,810
You know,
how many people have been mad at him for

598
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:27,210
that or you're stealing money from 
people really see what you're doing.

599
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,400
Yeah,
I mean the.

600
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,280
Or are they making money?
It's a weird situation because it's like

601
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,200
some people just doing it for fun and 
then you're profiting off of their fun.

602
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,560
But that's Kinda like there was um,
there was an artist once that was taking

603
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:48,101
photos of other people's are and then 
drawing like pretty much exact 

604
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:52,481
duplicates of it.
It was like a cartoon and it's happened 

605
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:53,140
many times.
But uh,

606
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,710
there was one story that was on this one
cartoon that this guy was doing where he

607
00:27:57,711 --> 00:28:00,570
had stolen like so many of,
uh,

608
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,280
this guy's images and just put his own 
version of it,

609
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:09,281
but like so similar and some people were
trying to figure out how this guy can 

610
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:13,130
get away with this for so long,
but I think there's just too much to pay

611
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:18,080
attention to for you to connect the dots
on two different images like that.

612
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Like,
and he probably was dumb or ridiculous 

613
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,300
or thought he can get away with it.
This is his last post right here.

614
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,200
Yes.
It's actually watermarked with that name

615
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,120
at Burt Bondi.
It's funny you say that,

616
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:34,121
Jamie,
because this is the one that took me in 

617
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,060
one of the ones that took me over half 
hour to research that you think is the,

618
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,590
the,
the,

619
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,090
the original line was looking at his 
page too and yeah,

620
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,420
it seems like the guy has his twitter 
name is actually in the pitcher Joe and,

621
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,790
but he didn't credit the guy even though
his name is actually in there.

622
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,770
Uh,
so that's one of the fake ones.

623
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,830
Well,
that's one that I researched and found 

624
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,830
out that there was actually somebody 
before that person.

625
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,490
So that person tagged his name in it,
saying it was his,

626
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,550
when it wasn't even his.
And that could be one of the ones where 

627
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,100
he,
he banked it.

628
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,570
What is this right now?
What are you looking at?

629
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,500
Oh,
Bert bonded from supposedly,

630
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,040
yeah,
supposedly.

631
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,070
But this guy,
somebody else had it before him.

632
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,680
That's what it looks like.
It was weird.

633
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,450
I was my point.
I was going to bring up on this.

634
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:19,451
It's kind of weird because this is where
you get into like parody law and 

635
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:20,720
copyright,
like they're taking photographers photos

636
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:23,060
and making money off of them without 
paying the photographer,

637
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,510
but because it's parody you're actually 
allowed to do that to a certain extent.

638
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,490
So at what point are you allowed to 
parody a joke and that's okay.

639
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah,
but you can't word for word it,

640
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,020
but I know.
See I'm torn here.

641
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,600
Here's why I'm torn.
I love memes.

642
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,070
I think these are fucking hilarious.
Like I enjoy them

643
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,070
when when someone sends me a funny one 
or when I get a funny one on instagram 

644
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,320
and I scroll through it and I laugh with
them.

645
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,840
I like them.
That's all I have to,

646
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,100
but I want people to keep but I don't 
know.

647
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,140
I don't want to necessarily like.
I don't want to discredit the fact that 

648
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,921
someone made it,
but I don't really give a fuck that 

649
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:04,921
someone made it like I do now.

650
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:07,290
Even as book cover fat Jew as a stupid 
book.

651
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,530
Even as far as look cover is a copy of 
the Steve Jobs Book.

652
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,030
Well,
I think that's on pop on appropriate.

653
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,060
I know,
but it's just funny that everything he 

654
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,080
does is completely unoriginal and fake.
Who the hairstyle was?

655
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Hairstyle.
That's like a kung po from the 

656
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,160
kickboxer.
Moving Tong Po.

657
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,660
Remember that guy?
John Claude van Damme before I'd spend 

658
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:28,660
the end,
got the crazy haircut.

659
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,800
I just got to kind of a tongue po thing 
going on.

660
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,420
Was there?
Yeah.

661
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,440
So,
um,

662
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,010
you're not his friend,
is that what you're trying to say?

663
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,380
Do you know what?
I just,

664
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,100
I,
I'm just amazed by it.

665
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:44,860
I'm just shocked by.
I don't like it when I see my friends of

666
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:46,720
mine that he's stolen from it and I'm 
just like,

667
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,180
why am I just finding out about this guy
now?

668
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,540
And then I remember when I heard his 
name around on TMZ and twitter and all 

669
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,711
that,
I just didn't want to ever click on the 

670
00:30:58,711 --> 00:30:58,711
link because I'm just like,
I don't care about this fat Jew guy,

671
00:30:58,711 --> 00:30:58,711
you know,
like I don't give a shit.

672
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,050
But then now I kind of want to stop it 
so I don't have to see more of him,

673
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:02,950
you know,
in the future.

674
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:08,270
Well,
it didn't bother me when I saw him 

675
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,270
before.
I thought,

676
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,311
well this is interesting.
This guy's figuring out how to profit 

677
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:10,311
off of these memes.
And I was saying,

678
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:12,150
I'm wonder if this is going to be like 
something that happens in the future.

679
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,390
And then I thought,
well what he's doing is just going 

680
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:17,670
finding pictures and then they say funny
shit and put it on the picture.

681
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,740
It was he,
that's how he was describing it.

682
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,610
And he was saying it to Katie couric 
that he has a staff and they go,

683
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,630
they comb the Internet for funny things,
but really they're just ganking memes 

684
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,480
and he's doing it as a corporation.
He's doing it like as a business.

685
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,850
One of the ones that he did,
it went the farthest back as being the 

686
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,901
oldest joke I could find.
He found off of a 2001 a website that 

687
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:46,591
still existed.
And this might not even be the first 

688
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:46,591
one,
but it was one of those news mail,

689
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:48,520
email newsletters that you would send,
like,

690
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,210
here's Alicia funny jokes,
ha.

691
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,190
And it's just a list of like 50 jokes.
And he just started taking from that

692
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,420
list as one of them.
I can't say I'm shocked.

693
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,470
Right?
I mean,

694
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:02,580
now that you know his modus operandi,
the other thing that I've,

695
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,680
I've heard him talk and they never seems
funny.

696
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,290
You know,
like when I'm hearing him talk,

697
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm like,
this guys doesn't seem like a funny guy.

698
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,390
You know,
like if you,

699
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,530
you know,
Kevin Pereira,

700
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:16,120
let's use him as an example.
You know,

701
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:21,121
if Kevin was on some show there,
you would listen to him talk and you'd 

702
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:22,750
go,
even if he wasn't trying to be funny,

703
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:23,260
he would say,
well,

704
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:25,370
here's a guy that I,
I could see that I'd be funny.

705
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,000
I could see him have a clever point on 
something.

706
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,880
Like if someone presented him with an 
ecological point of view,

707
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,070
he would be like,
that's,

708
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,440
that doesn't make any sense.
You started making fun of it.

709
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,360
That's his instinct.
That is,

710
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:37,990
uh,
you know,

711
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,490
your instinct comics instincts and he 
did.

712
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,510
Anybody that you have on,
that's a funny person would say funny 

713
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:45,510
shit.
He never seemed funny.

714
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,050
It seems like this like corporate guy or
something,

715
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,890
you know,
this wacky haircut.

716
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,950
It's like a tall package.
Well,

717
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:56,951
I mean,
what people are telling me is that he 

718
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:56,990
was one of those.
He grew up in a super rich family.

719
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,360
It's been kind of just thrown and given 
favors and that's one of those guys,

720
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,260
one of those motherfuckers.
I guess the problem is I could make that

721
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:08,360
argument about myself not being funny 
sometimes too,

722
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,260
if I'm doing something serious,
like if I do a conversation,

723
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,270
especially if it's about mma.
Right?

724
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,860
But then I would,
I'm doing it about that I guess.

725
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,070
Yeah.
But if you listen to a lot of his 

726
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,070
interviews,
because I've watched a lot,

727
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,630
he pretty much repeats the same stuff.
Like I just need to get a guacamole and 

728
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,270
a in a bathtub and a wine.

729
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,690
Well,
let's see what happened.

730
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,840
Ca,
right?

731
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,560
You're the folks who signed mints,
Delia,

732
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,690
after all that shit went down.
They are.

733
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,250
Yeah.
They took them from Gersh,

734
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,530
they ganged them from grocery at the 
worst moment ever.

735
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,790
Wow.
Yeah.

736
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,670
Right.
When the shit was hitting the fan,

737
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,130
they jumped in with a dick in their 
hand.

738
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,140
That's insane.
But who knows.

739
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:50,141
I mean they probably,
I don't think they were aware in the 

740
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:53,801
entirety of the situation that you're 
dealing with that and I think there 

741
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,250
probably weren't aware about this guy 
either because,

742
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,270
look,
I wasn't aware.

743
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,320
I didn't even think of it.
I ignorantly,

744
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:58,910
it was like,
ah,

745
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,530
I just takes beams,
puts them up there.

746
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,900
I didn't even think about it as 
plagiarism,

747
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,480
but when pat and wrote it and then when 
you had.

748
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,340
And then I saw the actual instances,
I was like,

749
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,510
oh,
okay.

750
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,740
I see what's going on here.
Yeah,

751
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:10,670
he is.
He's definitely.

752
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,830
And it wasn't just reposting.
See,

753
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,950
he could have got the same success by 
reposting,

754
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,840
you know,
I repost stuff.

755
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,260
If you post something funny and I want 
to repost it,

756
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I go to the repost APP.
I repost that and I do it specifically 

757
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,041
so that people will know that it came 
from you and hopefully they'll click on 

758
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,390
your link and sign up and be one of your
followers or whatever.

759
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,200
That's what you're supposed to do.
That's kind of the spirit of the 

760
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Internet.
You know,

761
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,890
when someone says something funny,
I always retweet stuff.

762
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,870
I never copy and paste someone's tweet,
you know,

763
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I just don't unless,
unless you have their name in the tweet 

764
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:48,880
as well,
you know,

765
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,080
and then you put in the quote marks,
but other than that,

766
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,150
but then then you know,
everybody knows it comes from them.

767
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,960
But other than that I use a retweet or 
repost app or quote tweet,

768
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:02,230
you know,
you quoted if you using the APP on the 

769
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,230
phone,
this is a,

770
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,660
you know,
it's just unethical.

771
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,200
It's unethical and it's against the 
spirit of what the Internet is supposed 

772
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,200
to be.
All about.

773
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,981
The free exchange of information.
Somebody comes in and just fucking 

774
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:14,840
sticks a syringe in this pipeline of 
information.

775
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:17,450
Just starts pulling it out and then 
profiting,

776
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,840
you know,
that's what they're doing instead of 

777
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,071
contributing,
instead of like jumping into this free 

778
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:24,950
exchange and then offering up a 
successful pipeline.

779
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,190
See,
because this guy could have been a 

780
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,830
successful pipeline for all these people
and I bet he would have still got nearly

781
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:35,831
the same amount of tweets,
are nearly the same amount of likes and 

782
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:36,350
followers and all that jazz.
If he was just a,

783
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,160
you know,
if you just gave everybody

784
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,500
credit and then people would like you,
they wouldn't be mad.

785
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,650
What's interesting is both twitter and 
Instagram,

786
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:48,480
I've heard hire a band him in the past 
and with instagram they,

787
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,960
he tied his.
He tied himself up to their headquarters

788
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,900
until they let him back in.
What?

789
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,070
Yeah.
Supposedly I mean bag.

790
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,230
Yeah,
probably.

791
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:03,030
But it worked and a lot of people have 
been trying to tell people to.

792
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,150
Twitter has that new copyright thing 
where you can copyright tweets or 

793
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,291
whatever and.
But you have to be the originator of 

794
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:15,081
that joke in order to do it.
So there's only people if these people 

795
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:15,480
stood up and go,
no,

796
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,970
I thought that.
And made that and read,

797
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,220
wrote that.
Would they have any,

798
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:20,850
you know,
they,

799
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,780
you know,

800
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:27,370
to do that or whatever.
Do you remember when that guy was 

801
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:27,370
stealing patrice o'neal's material and 
do it as Youtube rants?

802
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,890
And then he was trying to say that he 
did it because it was an homage to 

803
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,980
portray.
Was trying to pretend he did it like all

804
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:36,680
angry too.
It was like so gross and fake the way he

805
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:37,650
did it,
you know,

806
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,760
he's like channeling patrice or 
something while he did it and trying to 

807
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:42,760
be smart.
And everybody's like,

808
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,320
oh you fuck,
you're a thief.

809
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,660
You know you,
you're a liar too.

810
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:52,661
Like the way you're doing it.
You're lying to all these people that 

811
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:53,540
thought you came up with these ideas.
These are not your ideas at all.

812
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,940
It's hard to come back from that.
From that.

813
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:57,620
You can come back for that.
You can't.

814
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,620
The only way you can come back from that
is to admit that you did that.

815
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,010
Talk about how you did it and then you 
got to reestablish yourself as being 

816
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,560
completely original.
Good fucking luck.

817
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,720
We've talked about this before with joke
thieves.

818
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:13,721
It's like there's a bunch of guys that 
were joke thieves and one of the things 

819
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:18,041
that you could clearly see,
you could see the difference between 

820
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:18,230
their material and other people's 
material.

821
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,530
The other people's material was funny 
and then in between there like this 

822
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,910
funny shit,
they would have their shit and like 

823
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,090
stand out like a sore thumb.
Like there's a guy,

824
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:31,400
I don't need to mention his name,
everybody knows who the fuck I'm talking

825
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:36,401
about who stole a lot of shit from Bill 
Hicks and he had one good special and 

826
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,320
then his second special was hot dog 
shit.

827
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:44,530
I mean it was terrible.
It was like a parody of his first 

828
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,761
special is because there was no content 
in it because he had burned all these 

829
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:48,890
bridges,
stole all this content,

830
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,480
was scared and sad.

831
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,770
You know,
I'll do it myself,

832
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:54,170
I'll make my own shit.
But he couldn't make his own shit.

833
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:59,370
His new shit was terrible.
And there's like this really clear 

834
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,310
difference between the two of them.
And I maintained.

835
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:05,311
It's because the mindset of creativity 
is the exact opposite of the mindset of 

836
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,510
plagiarism because plagiarism is like,
I want to pretend that this is all my 

837
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,621
idea.
I want to pretend to take this and I'm 

838
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:14,621
going to go get all the love for it.
I'm going to get.

839
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:17,530
Whereas like a comic,
like a hilarious person is like,

840
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,800
what?
What's funny?

841
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,150
Where's the funny?
What is it?

842
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,980
Is it this?
Is it that like you've got.

843
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,130
You're not thinking about you like what 
all you are.

844
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,360
You're this vessel for getting the idea 
in its best form.

845
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,360
You're like a a boat that carries the 
joke to the people.

846
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:34,190
You got to figure out how the fuck do I 
do this?

847
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,220
Like how many times have any of us

848
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,340
had been sitting around going,
I gotta figure out a better way to set 

849
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,310
this up or there's a better way to do 
this or do you got to figure out this?

850
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:47,311
Or if someone comes along and just yanks
that and just doesn't have any of the 

851
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:49,360
process,
they don't know how to do that.

852
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,570
They don't know how to do it.
Like that process of creating is like 

853
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,960
learning a language and when those 
fucking joke,

854
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,440
these have to go out and relearn the 
language.

855
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,620
They're essentially like open minker's 
and we've seen a couple guys that we 

856
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,660
know of that are like that,
that got hot from stealing stuff.

857
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,950
But then if you see him now you're like,
where did the fucking creativity go?

858
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,010
Or they don't stop.
Like our old friend who I found out the 

859
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,170
other day that a steel steel's I can't 
say.

860
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:21,530
I'm shocked.
I can't say.

861
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,030
I'm sure.
I don't know.

862
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,160
Tosh.
Yeah,

863
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,200
I don't think he knows how to write.
I don't think he does it and I think 

864
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,570
he's scared to bomb as one of the things
that he had always said.

865
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,300
He's like a lot of comics.
Talk about Hubby bummed.

866
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,550
I never bombed.
I bombed all the time,

867
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,870
you know?
You know why?

868
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,330
Because I write stuff.
I try shit out.

869
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,620
Like I,
when you,

870
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,420
when you're writing all the time,
man,

871
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,210
you,
you're gonna fucking have some duds.

872
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,940
You're going to throw them out there and
you gotta go fuck.

873
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,840
And it might,
it's,

874
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,450
you know,
it's not going to be all of them,

875
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,610
but it might be one out of 10 you just 
to cut off and throw it into the ocean.

876
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,000
So there's no good.
It's never working.

877
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,240
But there's a lot of people are gonna.
See you do that bit until you decide 

878
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,271
that it sucks,
you know you're going to fuck around 

879
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:03,271
with it.

880
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:03,420
You going to try because sometimes I 
don't know if you do those,

881
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
but I do.
I know doc does it.

882
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,500
A lot of guys do this where you kind of 
like set yourself up in a position where

883
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,000
you really don't know where this bit's 
going to go.

884
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,380
You know,
something funny in it.

885
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,540
So you hope that it comes out on stage.
And so there's ways of writing where you

886
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:21,541
sit down,
smoke a joint suit in front of a 

887
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,560
computer or your notebook.
Just fucking trying to figure out how to

888
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:24,230
do it.
Like I'll,

889
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,380
I'll,
I'll play little games with myself.

890
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,040
I'll say like brian red band is to 
Jamie,

891
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,730
like a Walrus is

892
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,640
two.

893
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,730
No peacock.
Let's try to find ways that this subject

894
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,440
interacts with it,
trying to find,

895
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,570
not because of fashion years peacock,
because I'm pretty cocked,

896
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,630
but you know what I'm saying.
Like I'll,

897
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:46,140
I'll,
I'll,

898
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,860
I'll do little tricks.
I'll set up lists.

899
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:55,070
This is like that and I'll do like a 
list of different things because I want 

900
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,821
to try to find out what the best bit is,
but sometimes you just got to go on 

901
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:02,121
stage and sometimes you go on stage with
this premise and you're pretty sure 

902
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:02,490
there's something funny about this 
premise,

903
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,920
but you don't know where it's going to 
lead and then boom,

904
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,940
when you're on stage,
the jokes like the punchline will reveal

905
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:12,290
itself to you or the angle will reveal 
itself to you and then you record.

906
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,310
It's like you take this little ember 
ticket back to the lab and you fucking 

907
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,420
put some tinder.
Tinder on it.

908
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,280
Kindling.
What does it kill?

909
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,200
What's tinder?
Tinder is that APP,

910
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,450
but is it.
But it's a thing too,

911
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,460
right?
Publicist chick doesn't have something 

912
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:28,460
to do with fire tender.
Yeah,

913
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:28,460
that's what it is.
Tinder,

914
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:28,740
I think.
Tinder box.

915
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,370
Yeah,
it is.

916
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,990
Oh sorry,
Jesus Christ,

917
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:35,400
you don't know shit.
Cindy Archer

918
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,780
for fires.
We're talking about fires.

919
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:43,010
You fuck the point being that that's a 
whole process.

920
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:46,750
You have to learn how to do and if you 
don't learn how to create like you,

921
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,860
your video editing,
if you you have to,

922
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,980
you gotta learn how to do that.
You have to do some that you didn't 

923
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:53,980
like.
You got to do something like you.

924
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,260
If you go back and look at your earlier 
videos like they weren't as good as your

925
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:58,820
later videos.
You got better at it.

926
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:00,440
As time went on,
especially when you start doing it,

927
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:04,310
you know all the time,
you just get smoother.

928
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:09,430
It's the same with everything.
Those guys are fucked because their 

929
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,220
mind,
it's a wrong mindset,

930
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,640
so they become superstars,
but they're not good.

931
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,510
They're not real.
They live.

932
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,380
It's like being a superstar track and 
field athlete,

933
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,330
but you really don't run fast at all.

934
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,760
Like everybody thinks like,
God damn,

935
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,730
this guy's like the fastest guy ever.
But you know,

936
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,880
you've been just been like teleporting 
down the fucking down the path and 

937
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:33,980
stealing people's spots and pretending 
that you're in first place,

938
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,160
you know,
and just running through the ribbon I 

939
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,160
will on.
And they was like,

940
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,160
damn,
that dude's fast.

941
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,890
He won again.
But you didn't really want.

942
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:44,891
You can't really run fast.
It's almost the exact same thing with 

943
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:44,930
people who are plagiarists.
They lose,

944
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,210
they literally don't have the 
creativity.

945
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,640
They've never developed it.
It's Kinda fucked.

946
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:53,060
It's got to be terrifying.
It's got to be fucking really terrifying

947
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,260
because like Charlie Murphy,
one of the ballsiest things that Charlie

948
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,130
Murphy did was Charlie Murphy was famous
first of all,

949
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:04,670
for being the brother of a really 
fucking famous comedian.

950
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,300
And second of all for being on the 
greatest sketch comedy show,

951
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:11,090
the world's ever known and being a big 
part of it.

952
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,270
He was huge on the Chappelle show.
Charlie Murphy stories or stories that 

953
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,180
he would tell,
like the prince story.

954
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,110
Like,
dude,

955
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:23,111
he was famous for telling hilarious 
stories and people would like look 

956
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:27,491
forward to it.
He would be on the stage or on the 

957
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:30,941
screen and you know,
just just waist up telling a story and 

958
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,500
then you'd see like it be playing out 
with Dave Chappelle being prince and all

959
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,870
the crazy shit that it would be a part 
of those stories.

960
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,930
And then Charlie started doing stand up 
after that.

961
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,570
So after that,
and you know,

962
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:43,700
there's some legendary bad sets that 
he's had.

963
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,760
He had some bad sets like that were 
captured on video where one of them we 

964
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,421
did a college,
they're booing him and he went back and 

965
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,030
got the check and tore it up in front of
them and threw it out to him left.

966
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,800
You know,
he's,

967
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:00,130
he took fucking crazy chances because 
he's a famous open miker and you know as

968
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:03,650
well as I know that process cannot be 
duplicated.

969
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,470
The process of becoming good at doing 
standup,

970
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,910
going from an open miker to being like 
a,

971
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,750
a,
an established professional is a fucking

972
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:14,510
bloody grind and it's filled with dead 
bodies.

973
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,880
Some people that just don't make it,
they don't make it.

974
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:18,590
It's rough.
It's,

975
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,120
it's like any kind of bootcamp,
but it lasts even longer than it's going

976
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:24,100
to high school,
you know?

977
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah,
like four years and then you graduate,

978
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:29,020
but some people don't graduate.
They get held back and killed,

979
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,280
killed by terrorists.
And along the way,

980
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,790
Charlie is famous so long this way he's 
fucking famous for being hilarious and 

981
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:42,720
he's just starting out or just starting 
out and he's headlining.

982
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,120
Remember when we did that,
a maximum real men,

983
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:46,530
a comedy tour,
dude,

984
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,860
he had only been doing comedy like two 
or three years,

985
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:55,310
you know,
and he's doing 45 minutes in front of 

986
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,670
theaters.
Thousands of people balls,

987
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:58,260
man.
He's got balls.

988
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,440
But that's what it's like.
It's like being a famous,

989
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:02,630
open miker.
Well,

990
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,640
that's what it's like for these guys 
that are plagiarists and then all of a 

991
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:07,640
sudden they start trying to write their 
own material.

992
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,310
It's like this dark man,
so dark place to be.

993
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,730
There's a guy named Freddy,
uh,

994
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:15,830
who,
uh,

995
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,240
Carerra,
uh,

996
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,180
he's going to be opening up for Joey 
Diaz,

997
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,150
uh,
uh,

998
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,430
later this month in Reno,
seven to 25 and seven,

999
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,840
26.
He posted a video,

1000
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:30,841
he sent me a video the other day.
Have you seen the heckler spartacus 

1001
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,920
kick?
What do you feel about this?

1002
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:35,920
Because a lot of people actually got mad
at this video.

1003
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:36,660
Uh,
and,

1004
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,410
but then I think it makes complete sense
if you watched that guy.

1005
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:41,840
Yeah.

1006
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,470
If you haven't seen the video,
this dude is on stage.

1007
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,540
This guy comes over to him and touches 
him.

1008
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:51,541
He says something to her,
it pushes them or touching them 

1009
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:51,541
physically.
And he says,

1010
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:51,880
don't fucking touch me.
Get your fucking hands off me.

1011
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:55,420
The guy leaves and it's a tiny ass 
little crowd.

1012
00:45:55,421 --> 00:46:00,421
There's a very small amount of people 
and some people apparently like this 

1013
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:00,490
heckler guy.
So the heckler guy,

1014
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,450
um,
and this comic get into it again and the

1015
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,640
comic says,
don't fucking come anywhere near.

1016
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:11,641
It says like raids zone was given a 
warning several times to not put his 

1017
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:16,531
hand.
So he goes running up to the stage in 

1018
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:19,321
full stride.
And this dude just front kicks right in 

1019
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:19,321
the chest.
Yeah.

1020
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:20,870
300 style.
Yeah.

1021
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:22,760
I guess the guys in front kick.
Good technique.

1022
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:24,170
By the way,
this guy's named red zone,

1023
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:26,120
I guess he's a local comic.
This,

1024
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:28,190
this guy that has the aluminum foil on 
his head.

1025
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,780
He's a local comic that just one of 
those guys that you know doesn't work.

1026
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,710
It's not working out really for him and 
he never gets off stage.

1027
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,790
He always does is he won't get off stage
the whole time.

1028
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,290
He had called

1029
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,430
people in the audience,
so he's one of those guys that is like a

1030
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:49,431
social retard that wants attention.
So he goes to these comedy clubs and 

1031
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,930
becomes a part of the show.
So as this guy's back in a way,

1032
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,230
by the way,
I'm torn because I love the fact that 

1033
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,500
Vegas has a comedy scene and open mics 
even though there's no one in it.

1034
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,580
I'm like,
ah,

1035
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:04,581
that's cool.
Vegas got a little funky little open 

1036
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:04,581
mics because vegas is a weird place.

1037
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:05,620
Yeah.
Can you turn this up because it's.

1038
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,420
Audio is great.
Just kind of making fun of me.

1039
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:13,690
Says my room.
He sits down and some woman is like,

1040
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:22,760
all right,
love your way.

1041
00:47:22,761 --> 00:47:25,220
She's trying to get some Dick Right?
Here it comes.

1042
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,000
What I tell you

1043
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,140
what telling you call an ambulance 
should call an ambulance when the guy 

1044
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:42,331
goes down like that.
He never know because he could have hit 

1045
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:42,400
his head and he could die.
I mean,

1046
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,020
I'm not exaggerating,
you know,

1047
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:45,280
so I would say,
oh,

1048
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:50,281
you're being melodramatic note.
When someone front kicks you in the 

1049
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:52,621
chest like that,
you fall back easily can hit your head 

1050
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:52,621
and it.
I didn't see if he hit his head or not.

1051
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:53,800
We could watch it again.
You got way back again?

1052
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,480
Fell off.
So it didn't protect them as unlimited.

1053
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,660
What's not real?
What's that?

1054
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,420
Jamie?
Let me see it and back it up.

1055
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,920
Back it up so I can see it.

1056
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,040
Oh yeah.
He could easily hit his head.

1057
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,480
Well,
you know what?

1058
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,520
We're playing one more time.
It his legs though.

1059
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,450
He's balanced as you guys go unconscious
to legs like that.

1060
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,720
See,
I felt back like that and it's kind of 

1061
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:36,910
like he was doing a pushup.
Know Brian,

1062
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,230
you don't know what you're talking 
about.

1063
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:39,970
That guy got kicked really hard in the 
chest.

1064
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:42,490
He fell back.
He's lucky that his feet are planted.

1065
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:47,491
Dairy's not unconscious,
but he definitely could have banged his 

1066
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:47,491
head,
so I would not.

1067
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:50,080
I would not say that he's faking it in 
any stretch of the imagination.

1068
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:52,810
Does a hard kick to the chest and by the
way,

1069
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:55,710
the kid is through the kick,
knows how to kick and like go,

1070
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,070
go do it one more time.
Just take it to the kid.

1071
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,160
The kid who threw the kick.
Just go.

1072
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,870
Just go there to slow motion.

1073
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,700
I don't want to say it.
I want to see it like this.

1074
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,610
That's a guys kicked.
People before guaranteed.

1075
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,700
He didn't even bother taking his hand 
off of the mic stand.

1076
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,430
Noticed that death.
Guys know how he knows how to kick.

1077
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:17,431
He's got some martial arts experience.
One hundred percent or someone taught 

1078
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:19,720
them how to throw a nasty front kick and
he knows how to do it because the way he

1079
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:22,750
timed it and the way you hit that guy,
he hit him fucking hard.

1080
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:28,620
I'm torn because first of all,
that guy is the guy on the ground is 

1081
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:28,660
obviously a con.
You know,

1082
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,360
he's annoying.
He's probably terrible.

1083
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:35,361
If you're a comedian,
you got to work with this guy and he 

1084
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:36,150
gets in the way,
but you know,

1085
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,780
does it mean that he should have been 
kicked in the chest like that?

1086
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,530
Man,
I don't know.

1087
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,680
But the other thing is he was in full 
stride to get in that guy's face and if 

1088
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:47,880
the guy didn't want to grapple with 
them,

1089
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,870
you get two options.
That guy ran right up to him.

1090
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,950
Like,
you look at him,

1091
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,410
he's,
he's walking like he's.

1092
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,250
He got stopped by that kick.
He was going to get right to that guy.

1093
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:01,380
Look,
he's in mid stride,

1094
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,890
not slowing down at all.
He could have pushed that guy.

1095
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,170
He could look.
He's reaching out to them.

1096
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,930
Look,
fuck that guy.

1097
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,670
That guy.
I see.

1098
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,960
I,
you know what I mean?

1099
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,730
I,
I don't like the fact that he banged his

1100
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:18,870
head and literally he could get really 
badly hurt in a situation like that.

1101
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,230
But

1102
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,570
at the end,
the beginning of the video also,

1103
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:23,640
the guy had already grabbed him like 
he's like,

1104
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:28,641
don't grab me.
And then the beginning of the video is 

1105
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:28,641
him,
like,

1106
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:28,641
I'm warning,
do not come up here.

1107
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,860
So it's,
there's,

1108
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:30,830
yeah,
I,

1109
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:31,790
I'm,
I'm for it.

1110
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,110
I definitely think the guy's a cunt.
But the reality is the club should have 

1111
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,171
got rid of that dude.
You can't let somebody grab people like 

1112
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:41,171
that.
You can't.

1113
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:41,960
Someone run up the stage like that.
They,

1114
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,300
you know,
they probably can't afford security.

1115
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,710
There's only five people in the 
audience.

1116
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:50,711
We're going to hire some guy was going 
to eat up your profits to stand around 

1117
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:53,090
there looking big.
So it's fucked.

1118
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:58,330
You know,
Greg Fitzsimmons gotten a scrap once it 

1119
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:58,490
stitches comedy Club in Boston where I 
was,

1120
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,900
I missed the show.
Fuck,

1121
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,490
I wish I was there.
But uh,

1122
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,850
some guy was in the audience,
some guy was heckling greg tool them.

1123
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,120
And then the guy ran up onto the stage 
and grab greg and they fucking scuffled 

1124
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,340
like they literally got into a 
fistfight.

1125
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,400
The bouncers came up,
dragged guy offstage.

1126
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,770
Greg stood up,
brushed himself off and goes,

1127
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,930
alright,
anybody else wants some of this?

1128
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,130
And then went back with his act.
He was like,

1129
00:51:22,131 --> 00:51:23,750
who's next?
It was,

1130
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,640
it was,
uh,

1131
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,820
it was really funny.
Yeah.

1132
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:30,821
The fights are interesting except that 
easily at the comedy store anywhere on 

1133
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,601
sunset,
it's easily more like he's going to gun 

1134
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:37,451
like that.
There's been so many of those nights 

1135
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:37,451
there.
You've heard,

1136
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:38,360
uh,
someone have a gun in the audience.

1137
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,160
Well,
on a certain night.

1138
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:40,950
Oh,
the Black Knight.

1139
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,670
Yeah.
So going to say,

1140
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,630
yeah,
that has happened.

1141
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,450
It wasn't there.
A shots fired once when Tupac was at the

1142
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:48,300
comedy store.
Yeah.

1143
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,390
Yeah.
Well,

1144
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,700
what are you who,
who would've figure who saw that coming?

1145
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,730
I've got killed by gunfire.
Who had been shot twice.

1146
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,670
Somehow another would be involved in 
some sort of a shooting things that me,

1147
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,290
this crazy story on my let you read it.

1148
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,830
Is it about them hanging out at the 
comedy store with Mitzi?

1149
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,270
No.
Japanese boxer.

1150
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,990
Twenty four burst into lawyers.
Lawyer's office cuts off the 42 year old

1151
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:11,130
man's penis with a garden sheers.
Whoosh.

1152
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,930
Flushes the Oregon down the toilet after
discovering wife's affair.

1153
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,500
Wow.
Oh,

1154
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,610
he carried out the horrifying attack in 
Tokyo earlier this morning.

1155
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,240
He punched the unnamed lawyer repeatedly
before severing his genitals,

1156
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,210
flushed a peanutella toil,
and waited for the police.

1157
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:29,270
The skilled boxers taught to have 
carried out the attack after finding out

1158
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,770
the Lord had been sleeping with his 
wife.

1159
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,950
Damn saying girl.
No you don't.

1160
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,210
Well,
he has to blame the girl.

1161
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:43,211
Yes,
but you can't blame a girl for this guy 

1162
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:43,211
coming in and cutting off that guy's 
Dick.

1163
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:43,211
No,
no,

1164
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:43,211
no.
He should have.

1165
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:45,050
I never understand why they go after the
guy.

1166
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,530
You should go out the curl your wife.
Well,

1167
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,110
Japanese guy might not even be a 
different culture,

1168
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,430
you know,
maybe in their culture.

1169
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:54,500
You got to attack the man with garden 
shears.

1170
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,240
Yeah,
that's fucked.

1171
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:01,390
Do you remember when there was a real 
bad story where a lady did that to her 

1172
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,890
husband cut his dick off and threw it in
a garbage disposal?

1173
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,390
Bobbitt and.
No,

1174
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:05,720
no,
no.

1175
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,580
She threw it.
She threw it out the window.

1176
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:13,350
Um,
while she was driving her car and they 

1177
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:13,700
found it and stitch it back on this lady
through it in the garbage disposal.

1178
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:18,701
And Sharon Osborne,
Ozzy's wife was on one of those dumb 

1179
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:23,381
chick shows and was mocking it,
laughing about how it must've looked 

1180
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:23,720
like spinning around in a circle.

1181
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,600
You never heard that dude.
It's awful.

1182
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,780
It's awful.
Play a jam because it's really awful 

1183
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,870
because imagine if there was a show like
a man's show and it's,

1184
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,540
this is the guy network,
you know,

1185
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:38,940
whatever.
And on that show,

1186
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:43,830
a guy had cut his wife's clit off and 
throw it in a garbage disposal,

1187
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,390
you know,
Egyptian style,

1188
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:46,710
you know,
they do that,

1189
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:48,070
uh,
that,

1190
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,890
that horrible genital mutilation they do
on a young lady's.

1191
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,380
Imagine someone who was on TV marketing 
that like,

1192
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,010
imagine what the Luke Luke just spinning
around in circles.

1193
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,070
This guy's life is ruined.
I don't know the circumstances.

1194
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:07,071
I don't know why he filed the divorce.
I don't know what was going on between 

1195
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:07,200
them.
However,

1196
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,800
I do think it's quite fabulous.

1197
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:15,820
I mean,
I think it's quite fabulous.

1198
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
Cool.

1199
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,590
Wow,
that's awful.

1200
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,100
Fuck men,
Joe,

1201
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:32,550
fuck them.
It's awful that someone would say 

1202
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:32,550
something like that.
You know,

1203
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:32,980
what is going on here?
Something else,

1204
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,440
why she cut it off.
I mean,

1205
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:39,400
it does depend on the reasons why does 
it fuck her.

1206
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,900
Poor Ozzie married to that monster.
That's a terrible thing to think.

1207
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,140
Like why?
Why would anybody think that unless the 

1208
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,410
guy had done something horrible like 
that to her and she got a hold of him,

1209
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:58,411
you know,
like he cut her clit off and she waited 

1210
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:58,411
until he went to bed and cut his dick 
off.

1211
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:02,580
You know,
that's an eye for an eye and they're 

1212
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:02,580
both blind now,
but that's not what happened.

1213
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,510
Whenever the fuck he did,
you know,

1214
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:06,940
Jesus Christ.
The fact that she could mark that.

1215
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,430
I don't know what my original point was.

1216
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,020
What do you think are those explosions 
in China?

1217
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,140
Do you think that's just what they're 
saying it is?

1218
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:17,600
Or do you think that's like a secret 
nuclear underground,

1219
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,250
you know,
nuclear base that there.

1220
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,340
Fuck you talking about nuclear.
Well,

1221
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,150
it,
you know,

1222
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,870
we recently found out that China,
supposedly it was,

1223
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:28,820
it China that hack the Pentagon and it 
just seems like,

1224
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:33,821
you know,
a couple of weeks later now there's 

1225
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:35,280
nuclear size explosions in their cities.
There was a conspiracy theory.

1226
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,190
China is enormous,
right?

1227
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,690
Okay.
So you're saying China is.

1228
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:38,840
If

1229
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,580
it's like this fucking one block,
right?

1230
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,640
Like we're attacking compton,
like China's an enormous spot and 

1231
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,630
China's a big industrial spot.
So there's constantly a bunch of shit 

1232
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,420
that can go wrong and blow up.
I mean,

1233
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:52,100
that's just what happens when you're 
building things.

1234
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:57,101
You're using engines and fire and 
gasoline compression and it easily.

1235
00:55:57,331 --> 00:55:59,150
It can be what they said.
A chemical plant blew up.

1236
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,160
They blow up all the time when they blow
up,

1237
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:03,650
it's God damn terrifying.
I've just never seen it that bad.

1238
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,010
It looks like some of the new angles 
know,

1239
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:06,840
show some.
Uh,

1240
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:11,850
I sent one of them.
I think this is the same one that I was 

1241
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:12,220
talking about where it literally goes,
there's three explosions.

1242
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:13,150
The first one's like,
wow,

1243
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:14,230
that's crazy.
They're saying like,

1244
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,260
hey,
it looks like a gas station maybe blew 

1245
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,260
up.
Then the second one,

1246
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,260
it's huge.
And it's like,

1247
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,741
all right,
this is starting to look like a 

1248
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:22,741
transformers the movie.
And then the third one just like,

1249
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:24,600
that's the end of rural explosion.
Uh,

1250
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:29,610
and this,
a video that I think it's the right one 

1251
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,680
is literally,
it seems like it's across the street 

1252
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:34,680
almost and it's a great angle.

1253
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,680
Well,
I've seen the one where the guys inside 

1254
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,090
the convenience store and the blast hits
him and the wall just knocks him back.

1255
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:44,800
The windows knock him back and he looks 
like he got fucked up.

1256
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,570
I don't know what happened to the dude 
in that picture,

1257
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,370
but the blast from it.

1258
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,580
Yeah.
This is it.

1259
00:56:49,581 --> 00:56:52,070
Now this is cool because the 
conversation in it,

1260
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,140
the people talking and it is awesome.

1261
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,500
White People Canadian.

1262
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,570
That sounds like Harland Williams.

1263
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,910
Watch the second one.

1264
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,760
Oh.
Oh my God.

1265
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,340
That's not even the worst one.
Dangerous here.

1266
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,060
The fire in the sky.
Yeah,

1267
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,070
let's go.
It went from fun,

1268
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:01,320
Fun Times.
Yeah.

1269
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,360
Well that looks.
That looks exactly like what they said 

1270
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:06,360
in his.
Yeah.

1271
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,201
I don't think that's any terrorist shit 
that looks like a bomb blew up a 

1272
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,870
gigantic chemical factory at bomb blew 
up.

1273
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:14,800
I mean,
you know,

1274
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,270
whatever.
An explosion.

1275
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,160
Not a bomb,
but I mean,

1276
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,820
same thing was just an explosion.

1277
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,500
Have you seen the photos of the cars on 
the right side of cdot?

1278
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,920
There's cars that are parked there.

1279
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,200
What is this sodium side?
Night on site might have been 70 times a

1280
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,870
loud amount.
Oh yeah.

1281
00:58:31,871 --> 00:58:33,490
They only have rules in China.
They just,

1282
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,660
it's a lot of chemicals that shouldn't 
have been there,

1283
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,540
but I think they're saying.
Oh,

1284
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,270
that makes sense.
That was amazing though.

1285
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,730
That was beautiful too.
It's fucked up,

1286
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:45,400
but beautiful at the same time.
Like there's something cool about that.

1287
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:51,950
Um,
if they can show us just the trail 

1288
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:51,950
destruction,
what it's done to buildings.

1289
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:56,550
If you can find the one where the guys 
inside the store and the blast hits him 

1290
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,690
because that one is insane.
What are you doing over there?

1291
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:04,580
Prime a tune out on me.

1292
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,140
Oh,
it's just finding a new video,

1293
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,940
uh,
that uh,

1294
00:59:07,941 --> 00:59:11,810
have a house from erosion falling into 
the ocean that I wanted to show you.

1295
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,690
I was one of those stilt houses.
Uh,

1296
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,420
it's.
Yeah,

1297
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:19,421
I guess it's like in poor countries they
don't have the right foundations and a 

1298
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:22,991
lot of their houses.
So they just fall into the ocean in 

1299
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:22,991
Malibu.
Yeah,

1300
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:22,991
exactly.

1301
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:27,370
Shit happens there.
They have all these crazy walls and 

1302
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:27,440
stuff they build up in Malborough.
Here's the security camera footage.

1303
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:29,540
This is the guy right in front of the 
door,

1304
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,120
like wash this.
Boom Dude,

1305
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:35,330
you got jacked.
I mean,

1306
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:40,331
who knows what happened to that dude,
but when he gets knocked back he is 

1307
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:42,080
fucked because everything exploded.
Like,

1308
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:47,081
look how it goes back.
He's looking at his phone to look 

1309
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:49,160
homeboys looking at his fucking phone.
He's standing by the window.

1310
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:50,240
Watch that again.
Look,

1311
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,120
this bitch hasn't even text me back,
man.

1312
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,250
I mean he literally didn't even see it 
coming.

1313
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,200
Now it looks like a hits his head first 
and goes,

1314
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:01,930
look,
duck heck.

1315
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,650
And then the whole house or the side 
just follows on them.

1316
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,540
I like your bad accent.
So that's the most harsh.

1317
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,430
Ha ha ha.
Okay Dad.

1318
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,320
But there was a,
um,

1319
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,010
a guy who set up an explosion in his 
house.

1320
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:17,730
He,
uh,

1321
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,760
left the gas on and set like some sort 
of a timer and set some sort of a device

1322
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,850
to ignite it.
And it blew the house up,

1323
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,880
he was doing it for an insurance scam 
and he went to jail for murder because 

1324
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,820
you wind up killing his neighbor.
Remember that?

1325
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,840
Yeah.
He,

1326
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:35,400
um,
see if you find that story,

1327
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:40,580
but the fucking damage that just got 
done from a line inside a person's house

1328
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,420
and it makes you think it's crazy that 
you're,

1329
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:45,990
you could just do that.

1330
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,320
Like if you were a nut and you just 
wanted to turn your gas on and sit 

1331
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:51,320
there,
look,

1332
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,910
look at this as leveled.
Wow.

1333
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:57,980
Fucking two houses on this block.
And this was all done with gas.

1334
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,700
This makes sure that this is the right 
one because there have been like 

1335
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,240
explosions that were accidental that did
happen,

1336
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:09,870
that caused some pretty significant with
murder in this.

1337
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:10,410
Yeah,
that's it.

1338
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,340
Wow.
Yeah,

1339
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,440
it's Indiana too.
That's,

1340
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,150
that's where it happened at famous 
video.

1341
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,520
The house blowing up at that came out a 
couple of years ago where,

1342
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,090
uh,
you,

1343
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:23,091
you know what I'm talking about Jamie,
that Nice house where the helicopter 

1344
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:23,091
going around the house.
Yeah.

1345
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:23,790
It was a fire.
There was a fire going on,

1346
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:28,791
right?
And then the house exploded in the 

1347
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:28,791
middle of this.
So this guy just left the fucking gas on

1348
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:31,050
and then said we're going to make some 
money,

1349
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:36,380
but just look at these three.
They get caught at the guy on the far 

1350
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,230
right.
You almost don't blame him.

1351
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,170
Right whenever that chicken in the 
middle says,

1352
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,300
I'll do.
How hard was that guy's life?

1353
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,430
The guy in the far right with the 
glasses.

1354
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,760
How hard must have his life had been his
life.

1355
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:52,110
We're looking at this guy who looks like
William h macy,

1356
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,050
um,
had sex with

1357
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,990
somebody to the left and somebody to the
right.

1358
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:02,110
Now it looks like William h macy and 
vandelay Silva is,

1359
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:07,120
knows postsurgery with a one wonky I 
poor bastard.

1360
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,090
Look at them.
They,

1361
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:14,020
I think was just a mess.
That guys just lived a life of misery,

1362
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,150
misery,
and very little love.

1363
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:21,540
It's just got this feel about them.
And so they decided they were going to 

1364
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,990
make some money from a insurance money 
when you have a sideways.

1365
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:29,991
I like that.
Do you actually have better vision than 

1366
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:30,600
print it from.
You know what I mean?

1367
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:32,610
Like maybe you have a way better vision 
that way.

1368
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:37,820
I don't think so.
I think actually fucks up your straight 

1369
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:37,950
vision because you're always getting a 
little bit of this side stuff in there.

1370
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,460
It's probably.
I mean it's probably fucks with your.

1371
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,570
Your straight ahead vision.
Hmm.

1372
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,200
Yeah,
I guess it would.

1373
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,330
Yeah,
but if you can move them independently,

1374
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,780
like some sort of a chameleon.
We're supposed to have eyes in front of 

1375
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,210
us.
Right?

1376
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,720
The idea being that's one of the main 
indicators that were predators.

1377
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,750
We have eyes in front of us because 
we're looking forward to killing things 

1378
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:06,231
were not looking on our sides like deer,
like the reason why deer have on the 

1379
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:06,231
side of their head because they're 
terrified.

1380
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,130
They have to look at what's over there.
What's over there.

1381
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,900
You know they have to.
They can look.

1382
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,960
They can be going sideways like this.
Their head can be totally facing 

1383
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:14,960
sideways,
can look right at you.

1384
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,390
We can't do that because we don't need 
to worry as much about getting flanked.

1385
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,920
We're usually the pursuers and not to 
pursue.

1386
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:23,230
He's speaking of pursuers and not 
pursuing.

1387
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,880
He's running with the Bulls was 
particularly successful this season.

1388
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,650
The bowls scored seven kills.
Wow.

1389
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,140
Yeah,
that's the highest risk is a big one.

1390
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,360
It's a big year for them.
They're very excited.

1391
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:37,290
They,
uh,

1392
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:42,291
they went back to the,
to the slaughterhouse and we're pretty 

1393
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:42,630
pumped before they got killed because 
they,

1394
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,800
I think they killed them.
I mean,

1395
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:48,801
I don't,
I don't know what happens with the 

1396
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:48,801
bowls.
What happens with the Bulls and they run

1397
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:49,230
with the Bulls.
It's not like bullfighting,

1398
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,260
right?
I think they just fight and fight and 

1399
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:54,260
fight and fight.
We're going to have to talk.

1400
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:58,520
We can't just only look at laptops here 
because otherwise I'm only talking to 

1401
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,730
you.
I'm listening and interacting.

1402
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,570
Sending new links.
Oh,

1403
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,200
well let's just talk about the bowl 
thing because it's so ridiculous.

1404
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:05,100
Pull that up.
Champion,

1405
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:07,140
because it's incredible.
It's seven people died.

1406
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,880
Why the fuck do they do it?
I just,

1407
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:11,250
that's what I guess it's a thrill.

1408
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,430
Is that the idea behind it?
It's a tradition.

1409
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,230
It's,
you know what I mean?

1410
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,680
So slavery.
Should we go back to that tradition?

1411
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,680
The inquisition was kind of a tradition.
Slavery still exists,

1412
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,590
you just get paid for it.
10 people died at 10 now.

1413
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,660
Three more for this weekend.
Oh,

1414
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,100
it's been this really good week.
The bowls are and pull it up,

1415
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,030
put,
put some shit up.

1416
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:39,020
Look at this for more gored to death 
across Spain as surge and bull run 

1417
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:44,751
casualties continue.
I hope the bowls are just getting 

1418
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:47,511
smarter.
Look how fucking big they are and look 

1419
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:47,511
how many people there are.
That's what's fucked up.

1420
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:49,800
There's way too many people to get out 
of the way.

1421
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:55,040
You just can't get out of the way.
She got these bowls and they're real 

1422
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,241
bowls with full on horns and these real 
bowls are just running into these packed

1423
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,880
avenues of people and just knowing them 
over and killing them fucking 

1424
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,810
ridiculously stupid has got to be one of
the dumbest ways to die.

1425
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:14,670
I wrote this article about this long 
time ago joking around about how dumb it

1426
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:19,671
was and this guy got really mad at me.
It's like my teacher,

1427
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:23,770
my professor did that and it's all about
appreciating the culture and like,

1428
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,530
how come you can't just go to the 
country?

1429
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:29,560
Why do you have to run from a fucking 
animal to appreciate the culture?

1430
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:32,410
Did you say thing burt was doing this 
week and I've seen it before.

1431
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:35,770
They chase cheese down a hill and these 
guys run down a hill and get hurt.

1432
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,900
Similar done thing.
Well,

1433
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,450
you don't have to chase the cheese 
cheeses and trying to kill you.

1434
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,840
This is totally different.
I mean this is so gross,

1435
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:48,841
man.
Spain's economic crisis is forced to 

1436
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:50,620
sharp drop in the number of bull fights 
in the country with about 300 fewer bull

1437
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:54,070
fights scheduled for this year as 
compared to the years before the crisis.

1438
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:59,250
Yet the number of ranchers who are 
raising fighting bowles has stayed the 

1439
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,761
same.
The only way out for these ranchers 

1440
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:05,761
would be in the festivals and these 
municipalities so suggests that many of 

1441
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,860
the bowls that would have been destined 
for bull fights or instead running along

1442
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:13,861
the streets of the country.
That's fucking crazy because those are 

1443
01:06:13,861 --> 01:06:18,210
really big bowls and they're really 
ferocious and they come from a long line

1444
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:22,180
of Bulls that have been almost bred for 
that shit.

1445
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,880
They're doing it in the United States 
now.

1446
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:28,120
I'm pretty sure Kevin,
like little set of bull runs and you can

1447
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:30,640
go run through these things right there.
It says right there,

1448
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:35,290
these are bulls with more power,
more capacity to charge a said Lorca,

1449
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:38,050
whoever that is,
a of the bowls being used for small town

1450
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:43,051
bull runs.
He said that an encounter with one of 

1451
01:06:43,051 --> 01:06:45,001
those,
one of these would likely do more harm 

1452
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:45,001
than the bowls of previous years.

1453
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,290
Obviously you've got fucking 11 deaths 
this year.

1454
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,560
What a cluster fuck.
And in the US they're using them to 

1455
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,830
clean out homeless populations by 
putting them downtown at night.

1456
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:00,380
Can you imagine if they did that though?
They had like a bull run every once a 

1457
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,450
week and they just play almost like a 
home was like,

1458
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:02,620
oh,
I'll get this bolt.

1459
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,590
Well,
the real problem is not the fatality.

1460
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,750
It's the homeless people that survive.
It's going to be even worse.

1461
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,820
You're going to take care of those 
people for the rest of their lives.

1462
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,020
This is the whole thing is fucking 
gross.

1463
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:19,350
The whole thing is completely ridiculous
as well as the bull fights are fucking 

1464
01:07:19,481 --> 01:07:21,740
ridiculous too,
because first of all there,

1465
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:23,890
you're not really fighting that bowl,
right?

1466
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:26,710
You're stabbing it with spears and 
you're running around.

1467
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:29,610
Other people get to stab it and some of 
the spears are.

1468
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:34,830
They have a poisoning them man gored to 
death filming bull run in Spain on 

1469
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:37,800
mobile phone.
World store.

1470
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:46,170
Yeah.
There's a great video of a guy getting 

1471
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:46,780
one up the asshole.
I don't mean great really,

1472
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:47,890
but I mean like,
whoa.

1473
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,840
You seen that one where the guy gets the
horns right up the ass hole.

1474
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:52,810
So horrible.
It's like Jesus Christ.

1475
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:57,730
He got his fingers torn open.
His rectum was torn apart.

1476
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,020
Rectum nearly killed him,
right?

1477
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,520
Yeah.
I think that was when the first animated

1478
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:05,440
gifs I ever saw and I was like,
what?

1479
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,110
What's going on?
That horns going into twentieths,

1480
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,190
but you just from it loading so slow.
It's ugly.

1481
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:17,191
Dude.
These people know that this guy's got 

1482
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:17,191
one in the face.

1483
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:19,250
Let's go through all these.
Let's go through all these please,

1484
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,080
please visit.
Visit the image.

1485
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,570
Um,
let's get the first one again.

1486
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:28,690
Closing on that first one because it 
seems like it's going right through his 

1487
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:28,690
cheek.
Is that what's happening here?

1488
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,570
Yes,
it is.

1489
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:31,130
Look,
it's right through his cheek.

1490
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:34,070
Look at the fucking impact through that.
Oh my God.

1491
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:35,900
It's going through his eyeball.
Look at that.

1492
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:39,950
Brian will get it through his eyeball.
Now,

1493
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:45,430
as a confirmed member of team people,
I cannot say that I'm happy about this,

1494
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,110
but there are too many people in the 
four or five and I think the only way to

1495
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:56,111
stop that is to kill off a few retards.
You don't want to kill off the good 

1496
01:08:56,111 --> 01:08:57,740
people and they're not saying this guy 
was retarded,

1497
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,190
but his occupation most certainly was.
You know,

1498
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,940
maybe just as a hard way out,
man.

1499
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:04,770
It's hard to get out.
Get off that photo.

1500
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,770
He was a bull fighter and his family's 
bullfighters like,

1501
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,140
don't be a pussy.
Me.

1502
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:09,700
Whoa.
Oh,

1503
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:14,701
this is a different guy.
Get one of the face is a different one 

1504
01:09:14,701 --> 01:09:14,701
though.
It's a different dude,

1505
01:09:14,701 --> 01:09:15,260
right?
Isn't it?

1506
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,160
Is it because the horns look different 
because the other one,

1507
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:22,070
the horns were black and this one 
they're white.

1508
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:26,390
See the tips are white and black and 
there's a blue thing sticking out of his

1509
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:27,410
net.
Go to the first one again.

1510
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,370
Yeah.
Maybe it's the same guy.

1511
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:34,360
Might be the same guy.
It might just be the resolution.

1512
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,600
Picked up the actual cover color of the 
forms better.

1513
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,220
That's dark shit,
dude.

1514
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,830
Having horns go through your fucking eye
and that's his eyeball.

1515
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,890
Blown out like that.
No shoe either.

1516
01:09:44,891 --> 01:09:46,180
Lost a shoe.
Poor bastard.

1517
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,370
I got something better than that.
That will clean the palate of seeing all

1518
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:57,371
that disgusting shit.
Have you seen that little Asian girl 

1519
01:09:57,371 --> 01:09:57,371
that can hypnotize animals?
She puts.

1520
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,030
She puts like seven different animals 
on,

1521
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:03,140
on this table and at first it's like a 
lizard and she's like.

1522
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:09,440
And then the lizard just passes out and 
then she goes to a dog and that dog 

1523
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,130
passes out and then a frog.
See this?

1524
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:14,780
This involves two things for you.
It involves Asian girls.

1525
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,020
Now I'm talking about,
like I said,

1526
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:18,590
the baby might not be real.
No,

1527
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:20,630
this is on a game show.
Oh.

1528
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:21,920
And it's definitely real.
Right?

1529
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,540
Well,
I mean it's,

1530
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,020
it's pretty interesting because at one 
point she's like,

1531
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,960
she has like a certain time limit to go 
down all these animals.

1532
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:34,010
At one point the dog wakes up was like,
what the fuck happened?

1533
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,900
I just sent you.
It is amazing though.

1534
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:36,280
And

1535
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,560
like it would make sense.
Like how,

1536
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:42,100
how can someone hypnotize a dog?
Okay.

1537
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:46,390
So here's the girl.
That's what does the sky ladder.

1538
01:10:46,391 --> 01:10:47,320
What is all that?
I don't know.

1539
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:52,390
The Chinese Americans,
the dog lays down

1540
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:57,090
and then the guys pretending that he's 
falling asleep too.

1541
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,580
Yeah.
And so the dog just.

1542
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,970
She just hear this.
That's a puppy that's lying down.

1543
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:03,320
Yeah.

1544
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,220
Okay.
So the dog

1545
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,030
is just good at laying down like that 
cute lizard though.

1546
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:23,510
[inaudible] ad lizards awake by the way.
She flips the lizard upside down and 

1547
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:26,100
then just starts rubbing the belly and.
Okay,

1548
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,590
well do you know that that's actually a 
way to put lizards asleep.

1549
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,690
That's why you do that with crocodiles 
and alligators.

1550
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:35,691
You put them on their back and rub their
belly and they pass out and I didn't 

1551
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:35,691
fight.
It's kind of cool.

1552
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,950
I like seeing her do this,
especially.

1553
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:42,030
Sure that that's the case with lizards 
to that.

1554
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,440
Some of them,
when you lay on their back,

1555
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:48,470
it's the way they're designed.
Like I think that's what I read about a 

1556
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,110
sharks as well.
Like sharks,

1557
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:54,111
if you flip them upside down,
there's something about the way they're 

1558
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,841
designed,
the way they're designed by the big guy 

1559
01:11:56,841 --> 01:11:59,091
upstairs that uh,
when you do that to them for whatever 

1560
01:11:59,091 --> 01:11:59,130
reason,
they can't stay conscious.

1561
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,710
It makes sense.
And there's something about structure to

1562
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:04,950
like push them if they get stopped,
like they can't move or something.

1563
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:10,180
Do you know I'm talking about what do 
you mean they can't move like a few 

1564
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:14,330
reinserted shark in the water.
You kind of have to give it a little 

1565
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:14,330
scoot or it won't be able to swim.
I don't know.

1566
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:19,890
That kind of makes sense because they're
always constantly in motion in some ways

1567
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:21,780
that make sense.
Like they might not know what to do.

1568
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,550
[inaudible] I'm bill Nye.
Factors entered my brain.

1569
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,080
That's all I was asking.
That might be true.

1570
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:31,070
So I'm not impressed with the lizard.
Is fraud figured out that it was on its 

1571
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:31,470
back?
You flipped back over.

1572
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,500
Why is it so interesting too?
Because she,

1573
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,010
she does it to a bunny rabbit.
She does it to a bird.

1574
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,970
She does it to a dog and she covered the
birds face.

1575
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,130
That's what you do if you cover the face
with a,

1576
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:46,980
like a blanket like that.
The verge freaks out and just lays there

1577
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,380
like I was just trying to get off of the
discussing bowl.

1578
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,960
Yeah.
This is stupid as fuck.

1579
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:57,050
I can't believe you made me watch.
How about the truck crashing into a 

1580
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:59,570
highway sign.
This truck was driving down the highway 

1581
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:00,270
and somebody dashboard cam catches the 
truck.

1582
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:05,271
Hit one of those overpass signs that say
like up ahead I five and stuff like 

1583
01:13:05,271 --> 01:13:05,730
that.
Uh,

1584
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:09,540
it was too tall for the overpass and 
it's very scary.

1585
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,400
Yeah,
it's,

1586
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:13,860
it's a very scary video that to uh,
why is it scary?

1587
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,150
I don't know.
It just,

1588
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,880
it hit.
It's a car accident.

1589
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:20,520
Scary.
Like if you were behind that and here it

1590
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,250
is,
boom.

1591
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,620
And that's this,
you know,

1592
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,380
didn't even tip over.
That's fucking impressive as shit.

1593
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,770
So what did they had to load up and 
they've forgotten the loader was up and 

1594
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:33,770
they were driving.
Yeah.

1595
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,860
It's kind of like a dump truck thing and
it was up and they didn't know.

1596
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,410
I was just like,
I worked for you,

1597
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,290
you know,
like you fucking dope.

1598
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,440
You can even just look before you drive 
on the highway,

1599
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,930
you fucking idiot.
Jesus Christ.

1600
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,560
That's probably a big problem with 
running a company though,

1601
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:51,210
right?
That you have idiots.

1602
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,440
Yeah,
absolutely.

1603
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:55,140
If you have people drive and shit around
for you like rocks,

1604
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:59,520
you've got a bucket of rocks in the back
of that thing or you know,

1605
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,650
tractor trailer full of rocks,
whatever.

1606
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,520
And you have these dummies that are 
working for you dumping these rocks off.

1607
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,810
And then we dropped it off with Dr.
I think we should lower that thing.

1608
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,040
The time

1609
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:17,970
I do it all the time.
He just takes on the highway like that 

1610
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:17,970
destroys that sign.
Flux.

1611
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:18,980
You got to pay for that sign too.
Yeah.

1612
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,590
I'm sure that company has to pay for the
sign.

1613
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,640
We used to have employees because they 
used to be a manager for a long time.

1614
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:29,660
You still have two gentlemen,
one of those people out there with an 

1615
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,270
actual job,
but we them Brian being your boss.

1616
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,410
The worst though is that when you hire 
somebody and then you realized,

1617
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,020
Oh shit,
that was such a mistake and you can't.

1618
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:41,440
It's really hard just to fire somebody.
You have to go through like certain,

1619
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,450
you know,
laws and stuff like that.

1620
01:14:43,451 --> 01:14:44,110
Yeah.
They're were like,

1621
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,780
especially the government jobs,
government jobs is real hard,

1622
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:47,890
you know,
we learned that.

1623
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,930
Um,
well I kind of always knew it,

1624
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:54,931
but we really learned that when it came 
to Nevada and referees and judges for 

1625
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:58,180
mma really hard to get a judge fired 
really hard.

1626
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:03,270
Like they can,
they could prove to be absolutely 

1627
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,430
totally incompetent.
But it's like working at the DMV,

1628
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,620
like once you have one of those 
government jobs,

1629
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,830
like you're a government official,
official officiator a someone who judges

1630
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:14,890
fights like that.
You might as well have a job working for

1631
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:18,190
any other government agency.
Like it's super difficult to fire you.

1632
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,860
Especially with something like like 
fights,

1633
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:23,650
because if you watch a fight and you've 
seen a bunch of fights,

1634
01:15:23,651 --> 01:15:25,270
you kind of know who won,
who doesn't want,

1635
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:30,271
but it's subjective.
Like you might decide that one person 

1636
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:33,361
one,
but Jamie might decide that another 

1637
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:35,161
person one,
and there are fights where people 

1638
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:36,580
adamantly like argue one way or the 
other,

1639
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,760
but there's some that are just 
undeniable.

1640
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,430
And when you get those undeniable ones,
they're like,

1641
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,600
what the fuck were you watching?
How did this guy win?

1642
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:45,820
And those undeniable ones,
you got to step in,

1643
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,660
you've got to fire people.

1644
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,010
And they can't.
They just can't.

1645
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,880
You can't because it's a subjective.
All this person has to do is say,

1646
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:52,310
Hey,
I,

1647
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:56,530
I officiated 100,
a hundred different fighting shows and I

1648
01:15:56,531 --> 01:16:00,760
was a never criticized for any of those.
Most time you don't get criticized.

1649
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:03,430
It has to be completely egregious before
you get criticized.

1650
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,280
But it's fucking hard as shit to fire 
one of those people,

1651
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,540
they just,
uh,

1652
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:12,590
they dig their heels in,
especially if they're a part of a 

1653
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:12,590
minority group,
you know,

1654
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,140
then they can get people behind them.
And you know,

1655
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:19,160
I've,
I've literally heard that conversation 

1656
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:19,160
before,
like someone say,

1657
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,940
well there'd be two different problems,
one of firing someone is hard and then 

1658
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:28,150
firing someone who might be black or a 
woman they go is even harder.

1659
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,440
And I went,
you got to be kidding me.

1660
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,660
Like when you,
if you fire a judge,

1661
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,840
it's not based on their competency,
like some of it has to be considered 

1662
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:36,840
whether or not they're black or a woman.

1663
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,840
And he goes,
absolutely,

1664
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,040
absolutely.
He goes,

1665
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,780
you might as well be,
like I said,

1666
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,700
firing someone who works for any other 
government,

1667
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:44,590
government agency,
you have to treat it like that.

1668
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:47,920
Whereas like you would just like,
it was like roast battle.

1669
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,690
Okay,
let's put roast battle and contexts,

1670
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:54,691
which is an awesome show that people 
judge and it's very rare that anybody 

1671
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:56,410
disagrees on who won the roast battle.
But it can get close,

1672
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:57,460
right?
It can get closed.

1673
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:58,990
It gets weird.
It gets weird.

1674
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,970
Sometimes people are biased,
right?

1675
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,530
Yeah.
They get biased or they're just doing it

1676
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:04,910
because they want to see another round,
like the scoring part.

1677
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:08,140
Not really even real.
I know sometimes that does happen,

1678
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:11,570
that definitely happens,
but when a guy gets trounced,

1679
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,630
it's pretty obvious.
Right?

1680
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:18,620
But in fights guys have gotten trounced 
and still lost or still one,

1681
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,210
I think I got his ass kicked.

1682
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,100
It's still want a decision that has 
happened.

1683
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:27,190
Not just once a gang of times.
There was a lady that was doing that in 

1684
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:30,980
Vegas and she was responsible for like 
two or three really bad decisions.

1685
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,550
One of them was packy out,
um,

1686
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,360
uh,
Timothy Bradley and uh,

1687
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,410
there was another,
there was another big fight.

1688
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,500
I forget what the other one was.
Her.

1689
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,460
She had a,
like an initial name,

1690
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:45,940
like a tj something or another 
instrument.

1691
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,140
Tired Blonde.
Oh,

1692
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:49,550
remember?
I remember what she looked like,

1693
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:54,551
but I remember people saying that it 
very well could have been that she was 

1694
01:17:54,551 --> 01:17:55,980
paid off by people.
Yeah.

1695
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,680
That was the one she,
I think she's retired.

1696
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,480
She just took so much heat because 
people can gamble on those fights.

1697
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,010
Especially a packing.
I'll fight.

1698
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,160
You're talking about millions of dollars
being exchanged.

1699
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,260
Millions.
I mean,

1700
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:11,300
how many fucking people bet on a pack?

1701
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,700
I'll fight.
That gets pretty nutty,

1702
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:19,030
so who knows who came up to that lady 
and told her look like a fucking draw.

1703
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,900
It was a close.
It was a close.

1704
01:18:21,901 --> 01:18:22,580
It's close,
right?

1705
01:18:22,581 --> 01:18:24,320
It's cold sweat.
It's draw.

1706
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:28,460
So judges in like an appointed elected 
or not elected or appointed official.

1707
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,780
Yeah.
Can't be replaced.

1708
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,030
It's very hard in a system be changed at
all.

1709
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,230
Like the way the very hard is happening.
No,

1710
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,630
very hard to change it.
You know,

1711
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:38,310
he's got a great judging idea.
Is Anthony Hard?

1712
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:41,030
Donk who used to fight for the UFC now 
he's a.

1713
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:44,990
I'm a trainer.
Transit Dynamics in Santa Monica.

1714
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,991
Trains a lot of UFC fighters but he's 
out a great idea for scoring system and 

1715
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,710
his idea first coding scoring system is 
totally different than the one they have

1716
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:53,450
now.
What they have now is it's called the 10

1717
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:55,790
point must system and that's what boxing
uses.

1718
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:00,020
So everybody starts out with 10 points,
but if say you knocked me down,

1719
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:04,370
then you get like you have 10 and I have
eight because you're knocked me down.

1720
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:09,400
If I lost the round and it's nine,
but 10 nines can guide and go either 

1721
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:09,770
way,
like 10,

1722
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:11,780
nine,
like I might think you won ten nine,

1723
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:14,120
but somebody else might think Brian,
1:10,

1724
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:15,440
nine.
It says real subjective.

1725
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:16,670
But once I got,
gets knocked down,

1726
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:18,200
it's pretty universally 10,
eight.

1727
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:22,160
Unless a guy was dominating the whole 
round and then got knocked down,

1728
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:23,270
then it will be nine,
nine,

1729
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,910
then it'd be a draw.
But that's,

1730
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,630
that's usually not what happens.
Usually when the guy gets knocked down,

1731
01:19:27,631 --> 01:19:30,140
it's tonight would hard dog is saying is
that,

1732
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:33,380
that doesn't make any sense.
And that all of the scores,

1733
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:36,290
I know his name,
but he's from Holland.

1734
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,000
Um,
all of the scores for all the techniques

1735
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:41,600
should count.

1736
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,900
So like the first round might be six.
You might have six and he might have to 

1737
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,120
because like you beat him up.
He did a bunch of things to um,

1738
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:54,560
and all those things count as points.
And then the next round it might be a,

1739
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:59,120
you have four and you have three.
So even though there's two rounds in the

1740
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:01,370
books and you won the first round and he
wanted the second round,

1741
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:03,470
he only won the second round by one 
point.

1742
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:08,740
Whereas you were on the first round by a
bunch of points because you're counting 

1743
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:08,740
up all the different things that you did
during that

1744
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,720
round.
So it's accumulative.

1745
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,390
So instead of this 10,
nine system where you can have two,

1746
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,410
10,
nine rounds,

1747
01:20:13,411 --> 01:20:14,700
but 1:10,
nine round,

1748
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,730
you totally kick Jamie's ass.
But the next 10,

1749
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:18,630
nine,
nine round,

1750
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,630
Jamie barely,
barely squeaks by you.

1751
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:26,690
Barely.
Almost like a roast battle situation 

1752
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:28,761
where you give it to him because he came
back from that first round and then 

1753
01:20:28,761 --> 01:20:29,610
you're even going into this third and 
final round,

1754
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:34,700
but you're not even.
The reality is you fucked him up way 

1755
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,401
more than he fucked you up.
And he's got a really good point with 

1756
01:20:37,401 --> 01:20:40,641
that because the idea of having to 10,
nine rounds and one of them is just 

1757
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:42,480
vastly different.
There's 10,

1758
01:20:42,481 --> 01:20:45,300
nine rounds where a guy literally does 
nothing to the other guy,

1759
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:47,730
just gets his ass kicked all over the 
place and just survives,

1760
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,490
still loses 10,
nine and then in the other one,

1761
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:55,680
two guys go toe to toe and it's almost 
in site indiscernible who won and that's

1762
01:20:55,681 --> 01:20:57,480
also ten nine stupid.

1763
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,720
He's totally right.
And what his idea is a score shouldn't 

1764
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,150
be like 49,
48,

1765
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:08,180
49,
47 and the third Georgia judge scores 

1766
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:08,180
it.
He's like,

1767
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:13,130
it really should be a number like 30 and
12 or 37 and six or 45 and 13 or 45 and 

1768
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:24,600
40 like where there's a big numbers.
If the fight has a lot of action,

1769
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,630
like a lot of Schutz shit's going on.
It's not just ten nine.

1770
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,780
There's head kicks and take downs and or
there could be a 10,

1771
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:34,130
nine round where both guys like Anderson
Silva versus tonsillitis.

1772
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:39,140
Here's a perfect example.
Anderson Silva fought tirelessly and 

1773
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,050
neither one exchanged.
Neither one did anything.

1774
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:45,140
There was many times in that fight it 
was boring as fuck because Anderson's 

1775
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:45,660
counter striker and Talus is a Jujitsu 
fighter.

1776
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,460
So Anderson knew that he could pick them
apart on the outside and not do much and

1777
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:55,010
Talis knew that if he ran at Anderson 
it's like running into a meat chipper or

1778
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:55,770
a wood chipper.

1779
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,920
So he had to figure out which way to 
which way to to to play the fight out.

1780
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,750
So there was very little action.
It was a really boring fight.

1781
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,850
Well that's still 10,
nine,

1782
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,290
10,
nine round.

1783
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,020
I mean that these are 10,
nine rounds.

1784
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:15,170
How could that be a 10,
nine round when you come up with 

1785
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,410
something fucking completely crazy and 
chaotic.

1786
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:21,590
That could also be a 10,
nine round like shogun versus Dan 

1787
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,030
Henderson.
They beat the fuck out of each other and

1788
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,720
that could also be a 10,
nine round,

1789
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,370
you know,
that's crazy.

1790
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:31,371
It doesn't make any sense.
The fights where there's a lot of 

1791
01:22:31,371 --> 01:22:34,671
action,
the score should be higher and I think 

1792
01:22:34,671 --> 01:22:37,401
that would also.
It would also show like how exciting 

1793
01:22:37,401 --> 01:22:38,170
fighters are,
you know,

1794
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:43,190
you could say like Michael Jordan scored
50 points playing for the Chicago Bulls 

1795
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:43,560
and everybody's like,
Holy Shit,

1796
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:44,220
Jordan here.

1797
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:49,220
Jordan scored 50 last night.
We'll have Ronda rousey flights a batch 

1798
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:53,280
Kohala again and beat the fucking shit 
out of her for the first round,

1799
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:58,281
but somehow or another batch makes it 
into the second round and you look at 

1800
01:22:58,281 --> 01:23:01,431
the score.
Her score for the first round was a 

1801
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:01,431
hundred and 62 co.
Hey,

1802
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:06,160
I had one.
You know like if you see sometHing like 

1803
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,160
that,
like that's like holy shit.

1804
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,400
I actually think it makes it better.
How would you say you do it though?

1805
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:14,401
Would you just break the round up into 
quarters and each each quarter you get 

1806
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:15,070
like 10 points or.
No,

1807
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:20,100
you,
you would have to be just lIke scoring 

1808
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:20,100
and basketball and have to be the 
techniques that land.

1809
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,570
So like say if you and jamie are 
fighting and you hit him with a like 

1810
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:25,720
five leg kicks in a row,
you'd have to.

1811
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,200
You'd have to figure out a way to 
quantify those leg kicks.

1812
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:34,201
Like what is worth more is a leg kick 
worth two points and a jab worth one 

1813
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:38,971
point is a right hand that rocks you 
worth five points and one that grazes 

1814
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:42,160
off you worth one point.
You'd have to figure out,

1815
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:47,750
and it have to be at least partially 
subjective because the real quiet,

1816
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:53,100
like the real undeniable measurable 
thing and a fight is the knockout.

1817
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:58,890
In the submission.
The tko even is problematic because 

1818
01:23:58,890 --> 01:23:59,820
there's fights there stopped.
We're like,

1819
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,620
ah,
just the guy was fucking that guy up,

1820
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:05,950
but I would have liked to see the guy 
had a chance to survive and then there's

1821
01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:10,180
other referees were the guy could get 
fucked up way worse,

1822
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,100
and the referee,
that's a go on.

1823
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:15,130
The guy winds up winning the fight.
Frankie edgar versus gray maynard,

1824
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:16,690
one or two and three.

1825
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,210
The first time they fought edgar beaten 
by decision.

1826
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:23,320
The second time they fought,
edgar almost knocked him out or a gray.

1827
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:26,740
Maynard almost knocked first fight gray.
Maynard won a decision.

1828
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,380
Second fight.
I'm gray,

1829
01:24:29,381 --> 01:24:33,220
almost knocked him out and then frankie 
wound up making it to the end and it was

1830
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:35,410
a draw.
And then the third fight,

1831
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:41,070
gray almost knocked him out again in the
first round and frankie wound up 

1832
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:43,600
knocking him out later in the fight.
So in fights like that,

1833
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:48,810
like a worse referee would have called 
that fight in the first round and gray 

1834
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,290
maynard would have knocked them out and 
won the title.

1835
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:53,290
So it's one of those weird things where 
you just got to.

1836
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:58,890
There's a certain amount of subjective 
decision making that's going to be 

1837
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:03,391
involved in fights.
But I think if the score was based on 

1838
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:07,381
the actual damage that was done,
he'd have to figure out what it's worth 

1839
01:25:07,381 --> 01:25:07,381
though.

1840
01:25:07,381 --> 01:25:09,190
What's it worth to have someone's back,
what's it worth to mount someone.

1841
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,560
But I don't think it's a bad thing to 
figure that out.

1842
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:16,770
I think it would be worth a lot for the 
sport to get outside of this boxing 

1843
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:17,950
system isn't damaged subjective to the 
yes.

1844
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,920
Because totally one hit from,
you know what I mean?

1845
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:24,930
You could hit me and brian both the same
way and it's going to hurt us a 

1846
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,010
different way and counted the same way 
at all.

1847
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:31,210
And some guys can take a shot away 
better than other guys can In the same 

1848
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:31,930
shot.
Like you hit Mark Hunt with it and he'll

1849
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:34,360
eat it and smile at you.
And same shot,

1850
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:36,620
you hit another guy with it and his leg 
go out and he,

1851
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:37,600
he,
he's done.

1852
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,550
Yeah.
It's hard to say,

1853
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,760
but it's,
you,

1854
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,160
you base it on how hard her hurt the guy
was,

1855
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,890
what the impact was,
how clear the impact was.

1856
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:50,980
There'd be a lot of factors.
There's a lot of factors that would play

1857
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,450
in when you would deal with,
uh,

1858
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:56,410
with scoring a fight.
But it's got.

1859
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:59,080
It's got to be way better than what 
they're doing right now.

1860
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,210
What they're doing right now.
It's just terrible.

1861
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,040
There's just,
there's so many.

1862
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:08,300
Like I'm a ramsey and a gym.
the gym he hates when I say new gym,

1863
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,920
I always fuck it up.
Ramsey nejame,

1864
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,970
he got robbed in his last fight.
The gentleman who he fought,

1865
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,770
I forget his name,
doesn't matter,

1866
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,940
but ran.
I thought ramsey,

1867
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:19,280
clearly one of the fight and they gave 
it to the other dude.

1868
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:20,810
And I was like,
tHat's bullshit.

1869
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,420
That guy did what he was supposed to do.
won the fight.

1870
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,000
And he didn't win the fight.
Why?

1871
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,660
Because the judges were incompetent.
Everybody ringside.

1872
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:29,900
That was with me.
Quayside.

1873
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,450
Joe silva.
Sean shelby rather,

1874
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:34,610
we're looking at each other,
shaking her head like,

1875
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:35,660
what the fuck?

1876
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,490
you know?
Dana was shaking his head.

1877
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:39,620
A lot of people shaking their head like,
this is ridiculous.

1878
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:41,600
How the fuck did this happen?
This is terrible.

1879
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:46,601
This is god damn terrible decision.
There was another one recently where 

1880
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:47,780
I'm.
Dana was on record talking about it.

1881
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:49,730
There was a.
It was a big.

1882
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:50,960
Oh,
Michael Johnson.

1883
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:56,170
Michael johnson and biennials are huge.
A lot of people thought Michael Johnson 

1884
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:59,801
won that fight.
I thought it was a little closer than a 

1885
01:26:59,801 --> 01:27:02,621
lot of people were thinking.
I thought she did a lot of stuff that 

1886
01:27:02,621 --> 01:27:02,621
for whatever reason people weren't 
giving them credit for,

1887
01:27:02,621 --> 01:27:06,440
but I still thought johnson,
it was real fucking clothes thought.

1888
01:27:06,441 --> 01:27:11,441
Johnson probably got the nod.
I'd have to go over it again with the 

1889
01:27:11,441 --> 01:27:12,800
sound off maybe and really trying to 
analyze it point by point,

1890
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:15,980
but a lot of people were pissed.
A lot of people watched it live.

1891
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:20,980
We're really pissed and it'd be cool in 
the future at the technology would be 

1892
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:25,421
there to be able to act accurately,
find out how strong each punch is and 

1893
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:26,990
like every,
you know,

1894
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:32,200
it's almost like you could wear a 
bracelet that can detect that almost in 

1895
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,321
the future or something like really 
detect the amount of damage you 

1896
01:27:35,321 --> 01:27:35,540
sustained.
So if video games right?

1897
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:40,120
So like one big punch is Worth like 
three or four week ones,

1898
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:40,700
you know,
like being,

1899
01:27:40,701 --> 01:27:41,930
being,
being or boom.

1900
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,850
Right.
Yeah.

1901
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,820
That's all done by pressure and 
vibration of the actual hit.

1902
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,890
I think also the idea of having three 
judges is not necessarily.

1903
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,780
I think there's more than three judges.
Mind,

1904
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,140
nose.
I think they would probably.

1905
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:56,840
If you get five experts and it's not 
hard to find judges,

1906
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:00,020
you could go on the underground,
you go out and mixed martial arts.com

1907
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:05,021
and find a hundred people there are way 
more competent than anybody's working 

1908
01:28:05,021 --> 01:28:06,640
today or as competent as the best people
working today.

1909
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,880
I really stand by that.
I really think fans like really big time

1910
01:28:10,881 --> 01:28:15,881
fans that are.
They probably know more about mma than 

1911
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:17,240
most referees are.
Most judges rather because most judges,

1912
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:22,510
I think there's a good percentage of 
them that really don't even give a fuck 

1913
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:22,510
about the sport.
That's just they're doing it.

1914
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:24,920
Some of them are fans of the sport,
but some of them definitely aren't.

1915
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:30,190
So I think that having more judges would
be good and I think another thing would 

1916
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:31,370
be good is allowing the people at home 
devote,

1917
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:36,590
allowing them to vote online.
So maybe draws would be broken up by the

1918
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,210
online score.
Absolutely.

1919
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,850
It's not a bad idea.
They should totally be more interactive.

1920
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,750
Why not?
The technology's there and that's.

1921
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:45,920
That would make more sense to know how 
dope that would be if they went,

1922
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:47,090
okay,
we're going to go to the internet,

1923
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:52,300
you know,
it's a draw so we're going to go to the 

1924
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,200
internet or just have a score based on 
internet and a score based on reality.

1925
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,620
So the internet score I won by a 
landslide,

1926
01:28:57,621 --> 01:29:00,260
but gets really biased that way.
Of course it does.

1927
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:04,110
It's part of the funding.
All star games get ruined in some sports

1928
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,160
because of those fans.
Can vote stuff like baseball,

1929
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,410
the whole american thing to do one team 
this year.

1930
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,520
You're right.
I take ticket back,

1931
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,490
take it back.
Plus some fighters that people hate.

1932
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,960
Everybody hates,
you know,

1933
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:21,200
they like to hate them to goes to cocky.
Like there's a lot of people that would 

1934
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,521
like try to like vote against conor 
mcgregor just because he's doing too 

1935
01:29:25,521 --> 01:29:27,300
well.
I'm hoping that guy falls on his face.

1936
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:30,660
If you're up in the third round in a 
scenario where you can score that way in

1937
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:31,510
your app,
like I don't know,

1938
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,340
35 to 15 and you kind of just stopped 
because you're up.

1939
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,360
Right?
Like what,

1940
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:37,410
how do you prevent that?

1941
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:39,760
Or can you not?
Or is that just a project to deal with?

1942
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,600
I mean that's just part of the game,
but the guy who's down,

1943
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:45,570
it's his job to go after you now and try
to score and win.

1944
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,490
Try to knock you out.
Try to stop the fight.

1945
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,920
And there's some.
Sometimes we're a guy,

1946
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:55,070
we all know this,
where guys going into the third round 

1947
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:56,010
and he got his ass kicked the first two 
rounds in this corner says,

1948
01:29:56,011 --> 01:29:58,350
you've got to stop him.
You got to finish this fight.

1949
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,870
He knows it.
He knows and the other guy knows it.

1950
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,090
If he's,
if someone is clearly one,

1951
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:08,091
two rounds in a row,
all you have to do is fucking dance 

1952
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:11,181
around in that third round.
Guys have done that before and it wound 

1953
01:30:11,181 --> 01:30:11,650
up fucking them over.
True.

1954
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,370
I don't know.
I think the system sucks.

1955
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,910
The system is terrible but hard.
Onx ideas the best I've ever heard.

1956
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,800
Doc hamilton who's a very good judge and
uh,

1957
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:26,810
a long time martial arts practitioner,
he had a good system and his system was 

1958
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:30,300
a half point system.
His system was instead of 10 points,

1959
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:35,330
you use half points too.
So like in cases where it's like real 

1960
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,330
close,
he could say,

1961
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:39,681
well that guy won,
but he only won by half a point or he 

1962
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:42,681
won by a point where it's really clear 
or he won by two points if he's really 

1963
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:47,061
got his ass kicked.
Like utilize the point system and make 

1964
01:30:47,061 --> 01:30:49,851
it a bit more obvious that there was a 
gap and that'll accumulative that we'll 

1965
01:30:49,851 --> 01:30:54,820
uh,
that'll add up towards the end of a 

1966
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:54,820
third round.
You would be able to add that like,

1967
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,950
well the first round he won by half a 
point,

1968
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,800
but the second round he won by two 
points and then we'll all like,

1969
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:00,270
it would show up better.

1970
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:03,120
I just think the 10 point system as they
use it right now,

1971
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:08,040
really lame and it comes from boxing,
just not a good system for mma.

1972
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:12,690
It's a good system for boxing because 
boxing is pretty much boxing and mma has

1973
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:17,691
so many different kinds of scoring that 
you could be on the ground and hadn't 

1974
01:31:17,691 --> 01:31:20,010
been choked out the whole entire round.
And that has to mean something.

1975
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:22,440
Yeah.
And it's also like,

1976
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:24,090
who decides?
Like if you say,

1977
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:29,091
if you beat a guy upstanding you,
you beat them up for like the first 

1978
01:31:29,091 --> 01:31:30,090
minute,
hit him with a ton of punches,

1979
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:35,270
but then it takes you down and gets on 
top of you for four minutes but doesn't 

1980
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:38,901
do anything,
hits you with like a few pitty pat 

1981
01:31:38,901 --> 01:31:41,091
punches,
but most of the time you defend 

1982
01:31:41,091 --> 01:31:42,441
yourself.
A lot of times people will think that 

1983
01:31:42,441 --> 01:31:44,330
that guy who was on the bottom getting 
hit with a pitty pat punches by the guy 

1984
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:45,060
was on top of them,
lost the round.

1985
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:47,640
Even though he beat the shit out of that
guy for the first minute.

1986
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,220
Like he did way more damage that first 
minute.

1987
01:31:50,221 --> 01:31:53,490
That guy's cut.
He's beat up his eyes swelling.

1988
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:58,610
He got hit with bombs,
but he survived enough to get the take 

1989
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:01,000
down and then because he was on top for 
more people would give him that round.

1990
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,740
So it's goofy as fuck,
man.

1991
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:07,720
It's really hard to figure out how to do
a better job of scoring it.

1992
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,960
But I think the doc has the best idea 
I've ever heard and I'm going to have 

1993
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,520
him on the podcast someday,
someday,

1994
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,970
soon because he's out here.
He's out near woodland hills,

1995
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:21,390
so I'm going to have him on soon and 
have them talk about it and talk about 

1996
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:21,720
training and stuff like that too.
But I think his,

1997
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:27,060
his system is way better.
Here's something I wanted to bring up 

1998
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:27,060
because it's pretty fucking crazy.

1999
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:31,400
Um,
there was a new study that was out in a 

2000
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:31,400
reset.
Me,

2001
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,650
you know,
Amber Lyons company.

2002
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:34,140
She,
by the way,

2003
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:36,400
it's become a complete drawing around 
it.

2004
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,490
Serious.
She's a total.

2005
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,210
No,
just kidding,

2006
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,000
kidding.
I mean that in the nicest way.

2007
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:45,060
Amber common.
She's a calling.

2008
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,120
He's got the shit.
She's become like a complete psychedelic

2009
01:32:49,121 --> 01:32:49,970
head.
She just,

2010
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:54,990
all she does,
she's just traveled around the world 

2011
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:54,990
doing psychedelics.
But she wrote this,

2012
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:59,050
she's got this new website,
it's called reset.me

2013
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:04,590
obviously to a sort of signify the,
the profound effects of psychedelics.

2014
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,680
And that's the,
uh,

2015
01:33:07,681 --> 01:33:12,681
the name of the website and what many 
people think that psychedelics do.

2016
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,030
And so this guy,
professor david nutt,

2017
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,830
had this,
uh,

2018
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:20,380
that's his name too,
not as funny as hard dog,

2019
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:23,140
but it's pretty close.
Both guys three,

2020
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:28,290
we had a three day conference.
It's called breaking convention that's 

2021
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:28,750
held in london and basically what 
they're saying,

2022
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:31,330
it's to explore the benefits of 
psychedelics,

2023
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:36,331
but they're saying this psilocybin 
switches off part of the brain that 

2024
01:33:36,331 --> 01:33:38,530
causes depression,
which is insane.

2025
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:39,550
That's,
uh,

2026
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:41,530
that's amazing.
Like go to that story.

2027
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:45,610
Um,
so,

2028
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
you know,
there's all these problems that they 

2029
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,260
have with trying to legalize different 
things that are beneficial,

2030
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:58,261
like legalized for soldiers with ptsd,
but they found a lot of different drugs 

2031
01:33:58,261 --> 01:34:01,150
that can help people that have been 
through traumatic situations.

2032
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,480
Psilocybin is one of them.
Mtma is a big one.

2033
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:11,120
Mtma apparently has profound effects 
where people have seen horrific things 

2034
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:15,780
and profound in the fact that it lets 
them change their perspective on it and 

2035
01:34:16,061 --> 01:34:21,061
literally changed their memory,
changed what it beans to them to have 

2036
01:34:21,061 --> 01:34:25,321
had this experience and allows 
forgiveness in a way that's really 

2037
01:34:25,321 --> 01:34:27,400
unprecedented.
So,

2038
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:29,350
um,
this guy,

2039
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,390
professor nut,
it's a really interesting article.

2040
01:34:31,391 --> 01:34:33,610
There's a lot of different talk about 
psychedelics in it,

2041
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,880
but about,
uh,

2042
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:39,710
the potential for drugs like psilocybin 
lsd and a,

2043
01:34:39,711 --> 01:34:44,711
and cannabis too,
and that he's talking about how because 

2044
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:46,330
these drugs are illegal,
uh,

2045
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:51,390
patients are suffering,
committing suicide because they're not 

2046
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:53,770
getting treated for their depressions as
pain or their pain rather.

2047
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:58,880
It's interesting because I think more 
and more as time's going on,

2048
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:01,760
you're seeing these things become 
mainstream.

2049
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:06,170
These subjects become mainstream.
The John Hopkins psilocybin study,

2050
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:11,410
there's been quite a few different 
studies that have come out that have 

2051
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:14,831
shown the benefits of a lot of different
drugs to dealing with things that are 

2052
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,230
conventionally.
What do they give you for depression?

2053
01:35:18,231 --> 01:35:20,630
They give you an ssri or they give you 
something else,

2054
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:25,631
but this is a completely different 
effect and that's actually what ari 

2055
01:35:25,631 --> 01:35:29,870
said.
Arias said that psilocybin was what 

2056
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:30,170
really helped his depression,
helped it in a big way.

2057
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:31,790
It's interesting.
When I was in toronto,

2058
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:36,230
I allegedly maybe have eight,
some shrooms both nights.

2059
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,720
I was there because it illegal to say 
you hate shrooms and I,

2060
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:40,710
I don't know.
Nowadays they,

2061
01:35:40,711 --> 01:35:44,010
they check your twitter when you're 
going through the airport wides.

2062
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

2063
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:50,400
Every time I go travel now me and tony 
both get put into a room and they check 

2064
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:52,670
your twitter to see like,
where are you working tonight?

2065
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:53,240
Huh?
Oh,

2066
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,290
okay.
Here we go.

2067
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:58,780
Tony uncle tony actually got caught.
Allegedly what?

2068
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:04,270
Um,
because I think they recently passed 

2069
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:04,760
this law where you don't have to do this
anymore,

2070
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:09,761
but when you work in Canada as a 
comedian you have to get a work permit 

2071
01:36:09,761 --> 01:36:12,581
and that causes the place.
But if it's like a really small little 

2072
01:36:12,581 --> 01:36:13,130
show,
it's like a lot of places like,

2073
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:13,580
ah,
just,

2074
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:15,500
you know,
you're here on vacation or whatever.

2075
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,340
And I think who said that?
The people that are booking the shell.

2076
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:20,810
Yeah,
I can't do that.

2077
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:25,811
We found this out.
This is like early on eddie bravo to 

2078
01:36:25,811 --> 01:36:25,811
that too.
Yeah.

2079
01:36:25,811 --> 01:36:25,970
And so,
uh,

2080
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,060
but tony said that they,
uh,

2081
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,970
just went on his twitter page and just 
as like where,

2082
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:36,240
where are you at?
And they grounded him and made him fly 

2083
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:36,240
back.
Should've told me those number.

2084
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:36,650
Twitter was retarded.
No,

2085
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,300
they just googled his name.
Oh,

2086
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,900
well.
Uh,

2087
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,680
so that's one thing that's good about 
having a fake last name.

2088
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,280
Um,
but yeah,

2089
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,880
what we're talking about right before 
that,

2090
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,360
mushrooms,
mushrooms.

2091
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:52,460
This was the first time where I actually
never,

2092
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:55,160
I didn't eat to try to trip hard.
I was just like,

2093
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:56,870
you know what,
I'm going to take a little bit while I'm

2094
01:36:56,871 --> 01:37:01,871
at this bar.
And so it was just enough that I 

2095
01:37:01,871 --> 01:37:04,871
immediately felt insane amounts of 
happiness and I wasn't seeing anything 

2096
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:07,910
or,
or like it wasn't like,

2097
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,590
like a trippy experience.

2098
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,120
Uh,
but uh,

2099
01:37:11,121 --> 01:37:16,121
I know a lot of people that do that 
thing where you eat a little bit of 

2100
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:16,121
mushrooms every day.
Have you heard about that?

2101
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:21,570
And I wonder if that has something to 
that because that could be almost like a

2102
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,210
imagine being prescribed like a happy 
pill every day and it was just ground up

2103
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:29,390
mushrooms,
but it was just a smaller amount a where

2104
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:33,260
you're not seeing anything but you still
feel happy because that's how I felt and

2105
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:35,240
it caused me to eat more when I was 
like,

2106
01:37:35,241 --> 01:37:36,590
oh,
this is great mushroom.

2107
01:37:36,591 --> 01:37:41,591
So,
but then I got out of that just 

2108
01:37:41,591 --> 01:37:41,591
happiness and then I start tripping and 
seeing things.

2109
01:37:41,591 --> 01:37:44,630
But the small amount that I originally 
eight made me feel really happy.

2110
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:46,300
I was bouncing off the walls.
That's it.

2111
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:51,510
Common thing that people do,
they microdose and they'd take it all 

2112
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,510
day.
Yeah.

2113
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:54,950
That's real common.
People do that and it definitely has an 

2114
01:37:54,950 --> 01:37:57,180
interesting effect.
I've small doses before and it makes you

2115
01:37:57,181 --> 01:38:02,181
just feel relaxed.
It also makes the things that you 

2116
01:38:02,181 --> 01:38:02,400
thought were super important seems so 
silly.

2117
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,200
Like things that were bothering you and 
you're like,

2118
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:05,640
who cares?
Like whatever.

2119
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:08,250
Like you feel like if someone was mad at
you and like,

2120
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:13,320
oh as that person mad at me to take a 
little micro dose of mushrooms and 

2121
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,601
you're like,
I feel almost feel bad for them being 

2122
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:17,601
mad at me,
you know,

2123
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:18,840
like people talking shit about you.
Whereas it would hurt your feelings.

2124
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,510
You take a little mushrooms,
you're like,

2125
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:25,520
feel bad for them.
Like this person is lashing out in this 

2126
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,370
ridiculous way.
Mushrooms are beautiful man.

2127
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:29,280
They're so important.
So gross that they're illegal.

2128
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:33,120
It's so bizarre that after all these 
different years,

2129
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:35,700
all these different studies,
there's never been one that's shown that

2130
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:40,701
it kills people.
Never been one that's shown that it 

2131
01:38:40,701 --> 01:38:40,800
causes you to lose your brain or even 
get diarrhea.

2132
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,180
I mean,
there's just nothing.

2133
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:44,400
There's no reason why it should be 
illegal.

2134
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:49,401
There's no like glaring health issue and
yet still you could go to jail as much 

2135
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:55,380
as you would go to jail if yet had.
Probably more so than heroin isn't.

2136
01:38:55,381 --> 01:39:00,381
Heroin is scheduled today.
We've gone over this before like 

2137
01:39:00,381 --> 01:39:03,051
marijuana and mushrooms.
The schedule ones like a lot of the 

2138
01:39:03,051 --> 01:39:05,760
schedule ones are like super beneficial 
and they're the most illegal.

2139
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,730
If you look at the schedule one versus 
scheduled to chart,

2140
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:12,870
I think scheduled to his cocaine because
they have medical cocaine.

2141
01:39:12,871 --> 01:39:15,570
It's like schedule.
The idea of scheduled one is no medical,

2142
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:20,610
no known medical use and to have 
marijuana and mill psilocybin to have 

2143
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:26,301
the most beneficial plants of all time 
in the no known medical use category 

2144
01:39:26,301 --> 01:39:30,090
just shows how corrupt these criminals 
are because that's just a lie.

2145
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:33,600
Like anybody could go to them with a 
series of links,

2146
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,880
like I can email them to tell me who it 
is.

2147
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:39,300
It's the head of the drug czar guy.
I'll email you just a gang of links.

2148
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:42,390
You click on those links and then tell 
me if you think it's still scheduled one

2149
01:39:42,391 --> 01:39:45,060
after it's over and if you do think that
you're a crook.

2150
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:49,560
I think the only difference between like
a cocaine or psychedelic is that it will

2151
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:54,561
speed up schizophrenia and crazy people 
and then we'll just have way too much 

2152
01:39:54,561 --> 01:39:55,960
crazy people in this world if mushrooms,
yeah,

2153
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:58,590
maybe or maybe they're going to be crazy
anyway.

2154
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:03,790
I mean there is an argument for that.
That's there's a certain amount of 

2155
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:06,621
people.
That was the what was in the culture 

2156
01:40:06,621 --> 01:40:08,691
high where they talked about it 
accelerating psychosis and paranoia and 

2157
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:11,430
all the different issues and they were 
saying there's no jump.

2158
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,380
Even though more people are smoking pot 
than ever.

2159
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:18,530
There's no statistical jump in the 
amount of people that are psychotic for 

2160
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:22,311
weed but.
But mushrooms I think will definitely 

2161
01:40:22,311 --> 01:40:25,251
break you.
If you have mild schizophrenia and 

2162
01:40:25,251 --> 01:40:27,051
you're going to get it later in life,
you'll probably speed it up by twice 

2163
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:30,630
your scientists throwing that around.
But I do think that pot,

2164
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:35,660
if you eat it,
is just as likely to do a un maybe even 

2165
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:36,750
more so because pot if you eat it,
is not reassuring.

2166
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:41,070
Like there's no sweetness to the,
to the overdose when you're,

2167
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,230
when you're eating pot,
it's just fear,

2168
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:48,330
fear and death and spiral and I don't 
know what you trip out about when you,

2169
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:53,331
um,
when you take my shrimps heart or not 

2170
01:40:53,331 --> 01:40:53,331
mushrooms,
edible pot,

2171
01:40:53,331 --> 01:40:57,651
but for it's always like mortality and 
the death of friends and people getting 

2172
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:01,330
sick around you and the body ceasing to 
work properly.

2173
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:06,990
Especially people that I know like you 
that smoke cigarettes and shit like 

2174
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:06,990
that.
I freak out about you when I eat pot.

2175
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,870
I do because I feel like there's people 
around me that are poisoning themselves.

2176
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:12,370
They don't see it.
I'm like,

2177
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,990
oh jesus,
what is he doing?

2178
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:17,650
Fuck they eating pot is.
That's the.

2179
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:22,890
For me,
it was like one of the big paranoia 

2180
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:22,890
inducers of all the different

2181
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:25,500
secretarial part anymore.
Don't be a pussy,

2182
01:41:25,501 --> 01:41:30,501
get back in their head of the dea.
Tried to highlight this statement so you

2183
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:32,760
can read it.
This was like two weeks ago.

2184
01:41:32,761 --> 01:41:35,160
He said this in a report with conference
call.

2185
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,710
If you want me to say that marijuana is 
not dangerous.

2186
01:41:37,711 --> 01:41:39,780
I'm not going to say that because I 
think it is.

2187
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,240
Do I think it's as dangerous as heroin?
Probably not.

2188
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:44,850
I'm not an expert or who's the fucking 
expert.

2189
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:50,250
It's hilarious.
That's the head of the dea and he's not 

2190
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,280
an expert and saying stupid shit.
That marijuana is dangerous.

2191
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,160
I think it is.
You think it's dangerous?

2192
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:56,350
Chuck rosenberg,
you fucking dunce.

2193
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:59,350
That's so goofy.
You know it's not dangerous.

2194
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:01,090
You know what's dangerous?
Idiots.

2195
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,320
Idiots.
Dangerous.

2196
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:07,321
If you give them wiffle ball bats,
if you give them spoons and electrical 

2197
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:07,321
sockets,
you know,

2198
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:09,040
give him a fork and a toaster.
They're dangerous.

2199
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:10,420
People are dumb,
man.

2200
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,450
Heroin is clearly more dangerous than 
marijuana.

2201
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,580
Okay.
He said that.

2202
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,470
Hold on.
Then this week,

2203
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:22,590
rosenberg evolved further after a press 
briefing on wednesday where people's 

2204
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:26,440
shit in his mouth,
he told reporters that heroin is clearly

2205
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:28,810
more dangerous than marijuana.
According to huffington post.

2206
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:32,260
Rosenberg said he's still considers 
marijuana to be harmful and dangerous,

2207
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:37,440
but was willing to make a firm 
distinction between it and other 

2208
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:37,440
substances.
While he's a fool,

2209
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,970
you can't say harmful and dangerous 
unless you have data.

2210
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:43,810
You are a dea agent.
You're the head guy.

2211
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,660
You should have data,
you know.

2212
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:46,900
That's the whole idea.
Like,

2213
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:49,660
can you say that aspirin is dangerous?
Yes,

2214
01:42:49,661 --> 01:42:50,650
you can.
You know why?

2215
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:55,770
Because aspirin,
regular old aspen kills a fuckload of 

2216
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:56,350
people every year a lot.
Thousands.

2217
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,900
They die from it.
He overdosed from aspirin.

2218
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,520
If you take too much as like,
okay,

2219
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:05,760
let's guess what,
guess how many do you think die every 

2220
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:05,760
year from aspirin?

2221
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,450
Now that you know that people die from 
asthma,

2222
01:43:07,451 --> 01:43:07,570
right?

2223
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:11,840
I'd probably say 70,000
people.

2224
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:12,950
30,000
people here.

2225
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,930
Brilliant.
I was going to say a few hundred.

2226
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:19,990
Well,
now I'm just thinking that a lot of 

2227
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:19,990
people have aspirin and that's probably 
something that people try to overdose to

2228
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:24,200
kill himself on a.
I know aspirin also saves people's lives

2229
01:43:24,201 --> 01:43:26,180
because that's what you're supposed to 
take if you're feeling like you're going

2230
01:43:26,181 --> 01:43:29,180
to have a heart attack and also they say
as a preventative measure,

2231
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:34,470
taken a little bit of aspirin because 
aspirin is an antiinflammatory and taken

2232
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:39,691
anti-inflammatory.
The big issue with health or one of the 

2233
01:43:39,691 --> 01:43:42,751
big issues I should say is inflammation.
It's a big cars or have a lot of 

2234
01:43:42,751 --> 01:43:44,290
different diseases and that's why they 
say that if you clean up your diet,

2235
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:46,540
your body becomes less inflamed.
You have.

2236
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:49,750
That's one of the benefits of cryogenic 
chamber to.

2237
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:51,500
They think that the cryo

2238
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:57,070
cryo treatments provide those cold shock
proteins and anti inflammation responses

2239
01:43:57,801 --> 01:44:01,730
and they clean up inflammation inside 
the body leading to less disease.

2240
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,060
That's one of the theories behind it.
How long do you do that at a time.

2241
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:07,370
Three minutes.
Is it like torture?

2242
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:08,810
Three minutes or it says like,
okay,

2243
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:09,860
all right,
this is fun.

2244
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:11,780
Almost too long.
It's cold as fuck dude.

2245
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:15,410
Fda reverses its position on daily 
aspirin.

2246
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:20,411
Use this man they used to tell you,
you need to take aspirin if you haven't 

2247
01:44:20,411 --> 01:44:23,390
had a heart attack,
step away from the asprin bottle.

2248
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:25,040
If you're one of the 40 million 
americans,

2249
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:26,630
take aspirin every day.
Wow.

2250
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,280
40 million.
The fda says,

2251
01:44:28,281 --> 01:44:33,281
look,
see how many people have you had a 

2252
01:44:33,281 --> 01:44:33,281
guest?
Jamie,

2253
01:44:33,281 --> 01:44:36,041
how many people do you think died?
Seven hundred 50.

2254
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:38,630
Okay.
I said,

2255
01:44:38,631 --> 01:44:39,480
what?
40,000

2256
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,620
each year.
All right,

2257
01:44:42,621 --> 01:44:46,130
here we go.
I'm saying 200 animal causes.

2258
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:50,560
Oh,
15,000,

2259
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,700
15,000.
Oh my god.

2260
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:54,340
Look at this.
Each year,

2261
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,780
15,000
people die in 100,000

2262
01:44:56,781 --> 01:45:01,781
people are hospitalized as a result of 
aspirin and other n s a nonsteroidal 

2263
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:08,030
antiinflammatories.
Wow.

2264
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:10,700
That's not supposed to give kids and 
they have a fever.

2265
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,410
Is that tylenol?
Dude,

2266
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,940
listen to this.
I don't know,

2267
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:19,120
but listen to this crazy statistic.
Aspirin kills 400 percent more people 

2268
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:21,950
than the swine flu.
Nearly 100,000

2269
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:26,951
americans die every year from his 
adverse reactions to fda approved 

2270
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:28,610
prescription drugs.

2271
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,950
What?
That's insane.

2272
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:37,520
Did you know that?
God damn.

2273
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,380
Yeah,
these numbers are nuts.

2274
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:44,240
This.
That's incredible,

2275
01:45:44,241 --> 01:45:46,280
man.
One hundred and 7,000

2276
01:45:46,281 --> 01:45:51,281
patients are hospitalized annually for 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatories,

2277
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,390
which also includes,
by the way,

2278
01:45:53,391 --> 01:45:58,391
ibuprofen.
Ibuprofen is also a nonsteroidal anti 

2279
01:45:58,391 --> 01:45:59,570
inflammatory.
That's the period one,

2280
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:00,650
right?
No,

2281
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:02,210
no.
Ibuprofen,

2282
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:03,650
advil,
headache stuff.

2283
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:04,970
Oh,
advils the best.

2284
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,150
So best for headaches and anything you'd
like muscle aches,

2285
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:09,910
torn muscles or anything.
Why do you,

2286
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:14,950
why do you like advil or ibuprofen?
Tylenol sorta like I think if I had to 

2287
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,770
guess,
I think dulls the pain more,

2288
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:21,590
whereas ibuprofen gets the source of the
pain more,

2289
01:46:21,591 --> 01:46:24,430
which is inflammation,
but uh,

2290
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,920
most athletes prefer ibuprofen.
I think it was like less risk factors 

2291
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,691
too,
but apparently a lot of people get 

2292
01:46:34,691 --> 01:46:35,810
fucked up by antiinflammatories.
I just can't believe it's that high.

2293
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,340
The numbers are nuts,
man.

2294
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,760
Swine flu is safer than aspirin.
A 16,500

2295
01:46:44,661 --> 01:46:49,661
nonsteroidal anti inflammatory deaths 
occur among patients with rheumatoid 

2296
01:46:49,661 --> 01:46:50,160
arthritis

2297
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,490
or osteoarthritis each year in the 
United States.

2298
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:56,160
Whoa.
That's a nutty number,

2299
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:59,370
man.
Sixteen thousand 500 deaths

2300
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:06,200
from,
from anti-inflammatory pills from 

2301
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:06,600
ibuprofen and aspirin.
Wow.

2302
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:10,290
So those,
those drugs are 1000 percent more deadly

2303
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,690
than swine flu.
It was accidental deaths.

2304
01:47:12,691 --> 01:47:15,130
Does it say that like does anyone use 
note to commit suicide?

2305
01:47:15,131 --> 01:47:16,830
And people definitely use to commit 
suicide,

2306
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,350
but it's hard.
That's all bad suicide apparently.

2307
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,480
That's a rough one.
It takes a long time.

2308
01:47:21,481 --> 01:47:23,850
Then to my headaches gone.
I feel great.

2309
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,030
I feel too.
Okay.

2310
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:28,110
What do you think is the number one 
method of suicide?

2311
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:30,770
Right.
Definitely.

2312
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:33,090
Or cutting.
Cutting.

2313
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:38,180
Cutting your nanny.
I know girls cut in their name and 

2314
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:38,500
trying to kill themselves,
so I would imagine cutting it after they

2315
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:39,390
fuck you.
They're like,

2316
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:40,800
what am I doing?
Something.

2317
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,240
I've known a lot of cutters.
It's weird.

2318
01:47:42,241 --> 01:47:44,880
How many cutters are out in los angeles 
and I've done many cutters.

2319
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:47,820
It's all the girls you're dating.
It's the pool you're drawing from.

2320
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,380
Most guys are like,
what the fuck is he talking about?

2321
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,320
People are listening to this right now 
going,

2322
01:47:52,321 --> 01:47:53,760
dude,
most people don't cut themselves.

2323
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:56,190
Most people don't cut themselves.
Brian,

2324
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:00,510
have you seen that new?
A three d projector display?

2325
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:03,470
It's one of the most change.
The subject dying.

2326
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:05,760
I would just want.
Before we get into that,

2327
01:48:05,761 --> 01:48:10,761
I just really wanted to.
What do you think the number one method 

2328
01:48:10,761 --> 01:48:11,100
for suicide is or to see if you had a 
gas cutting,

2329
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:13,890
cutting,
cutting risks.

2330
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:15,600
Really cutting throat.
Jumping off.

2331
01:48:15,601 --> 01:48:16,530
Something.
Jumping off.

2332
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:19,190
So I'm going to say overdose.
I would say overdose,

2333
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,090
but gunshots got to be in there 
somewhere.

2334
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,030
All right,
let's let's google the number one method

2335
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,880
of suicide.
Number one,

2336
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:30,850
death by chocolate.
No,

2337
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:35,930
it's funny.
When you write number one method in 

2338
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:36,780
google,
homicide comes up first.

2339
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,990
That's what the google suggestion to 
fill in the blank.

2340
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:43,790
Number one,
method of homicide.

2341
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:48,970
How many people just google them because
they fucking hate their wife or their 

2342
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:49,280
husband like kesha?
Shit.

2343
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,740
What's the best motor?
That's your own personal cash,

2344
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:53,240
joe.
No,

2345
01:48:53,241 --> 01:48:54,180
it's not.
Yeah,

2346
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,850
because I asked.
I have two different things.

2347
01:48:55,851 --> 01:48:57,630
When I type in stuff at different things
come up,

2348
01:48:57,631 --> 01:49:01,430
but then you have your stuff please in 
google if you never googled that before,

2349
01:49:01,431 --> 01:49:02,840
I've never googled that before.
Wait,

2350
01:49:02,841 --> 01:49:04,490
what?
You put type in number one.

2351
01:49:04,491 --> 01:49:09,491
Method of for one method of time.
I say I see fuck off.

2352
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:12,940
Do you know though,
if you're logged in,

2353
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:13,670
you're logged in?
No.

2354
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:16,730
Sometimes it comes up different because 
I said something like,

2355
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:18,380
we're wrong,
we're way wrong.

2356
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,390
What were really wrong?
Number one,

2357
01:49:20,391 --> 01:49:23,790
his firearm,
so shooting 50 percent makes sense.

2358
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:26,510
Fifty percent,
they shoot themselves 24 percent.

2359
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:30,080
They hang themselves or suffocate 
poisoning,

2360
01:49:30,081 --> 01:49:32,150
which I thought was number one is only 
16 percent.

2361
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:37,930
Jumping off shit,
jamie thought two point three percent 

2362
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:38,210
cut one percent.
One point,

2363
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:42,260
one point eight percent drowning is one 
point.

2364
01:49:42,261 --> 01:49:47,060
One percent fire is zero point four 
percent.

2365
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,100
Woo.
Who would do

2366
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,840
that?
That's crazy.

2367
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:55,110
Transporter related.
That means you jump in front of a truck 

2368
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:59,640
transporter.
What a weird euphemism transporter 

2369
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,180
related.
That's zero point four percent.

2370
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:03,810
I'm going to die by transporting.
Yeah.

2371
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,960
How weird men firearms 50.
That's America though as America shall 

2372
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:11,350
we do.
When in doubt,

2373
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:17,130
take it out so we scary way to die 
knowing that you're gonna pull that 

2374
01:50:18,701 --> 01:50:23,701
trigger and it's all going to go blank,
but I've known more than one person 

2375
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:27,901
that's done it in my lifetime.
I've known several people that have 

2376
01:50:27,901 --> 01:50:27,901
killed themselves with guns.

2377
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:32,370
The are the weird article.
It's like when someone doesn't like that

2378
01:50:32,371 --> 01:50:32,970
they go,
you know,

2379
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:38,040
we need to change the gun laws.
Like when someone kills someone with a 

2380
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:38,850
gun,
we need to change gun laws.

2381
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:42,330
Well I guess it's kind of easier to kill
someone if you have a gun,

2382
01:50:42,331 --> 01:50:44,940
but if somebody wants to kill you,
it's because they want to kill you.

2383
01:50:44,941 --> 01:50:49,941
It's not because they have a gun.
It's not like you have a gun and go 

2384
01:50:49,941 --> 01:50:49,941
talking about fucking killing somebody.
Now that I got this gun.

2385
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:55,250
No you don't.
You only use a gun to kill somebody 

2386
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:56,430
because you want to kill them unless 
it's an accidental gun shooting and then

2387
01:50:56,431 --> 01:50:58,170
you're dealing with a totally different 
situation.

2388
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:02,730
But the idea that giving someone a gun 
makes them more likely to kill people.

2389
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:03,930
I'm not sure if I buy that.

2390
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:11,550
When the la riots were going on,
a lot of people had their own personal 

2391
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:15,481
firearms and uh,
this guy I know he said he had to like 

2392
01:51:15,481 --> 01:51:19,710
go on the roof of his apartment with a 
gun because they were trying to break 

2393
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:23,311
into his house and stuff like that.
And he actually had to shoot somebody 

2394
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:24,940
shot somebody that in like the arm or 
something like that.

2395
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:27,010
I think he said,
who is this guy?

2396
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:29,410
I don't want to say.
It might be a bullshitter.

2397
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,920
I can tell you off air is a bullshitter.
No,

2398
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,430
absolutely not.
Occasionally.

2399
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:35,170
Never.
Yeah.

2400
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:40,500
No.
What's it dictates like a popcorn.

2401
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:41,620
Your poop.

2402
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,800
I think that um,
anthony bordain covered that on one of 

2403
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:51,800
his shows.
Um,

2404
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:55,800
the riots in Korea town where the 
koreans had to arm themselves,

2405
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:58,950
get on top of their buildings because 
all the cops were in beverly hills.

2406
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:02,250
Remember that shit?
Korea town just sorta got ransacked.

2407
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:05,010
And these guys were on top of their 
roofs with rifles.

2408
01:52:05,011 --> 01:52:06,930
They were getting in trouble for having 
guns out.

2409
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:08,850
But um,
if you look,

2410
01:52:08,851 --> 01:52:12,510
there was like this giant wall of cars 
that guarded beverly hills.

2411
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:15,840
It was really kind of fucked up and 
racist and creepy.

2412
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:21,300
There was a creepy moment the way that 
police shielded parts of los angeles for

2413
01:52:21,301 --> 01:52:24,330
the riots and didn't do anything to 
protect other parts.

2414
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:29,660
And obviously they were given mandates.
Obviously there was someone that was 

2415
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,080
telling them what they're supposed to do
and not supposed to do,

2416
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,610
but the weird choice.

2417
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:36,780
It was just so openly and clearly defend
wealthy people.

2418
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:42,110
There's a lot to lose in the wealthy 
people's houses and worth millions and 

2419
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:43,990
billions of dollars in light of you.
Total stories and.

2420
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:44,580
Yeah,
but,

2421
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:49,650
but so the poor people and their stores 
aren't worth as much as I can get 

2422
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:54,311
replaced.
Easier than like a painting that was 

2423
01:52:54,311 --> 01:52:54,311
made by the vinci.
No,

2424
01:52:54,311 --> 01:52:54,311
no,
no,

2425
01:52:54,311 --> 01:52:54,311
no,
no.

2426
01:52:54,311 --> 01:52:56,630
You're not looking at it right there.
They're talking about businesses.

2427
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:58,640
The talk there was these people were on 
businesses.

2428
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:01,620
These businesses probably got a million 
dollars worth of merchandise and their.

2429
01:53:01,621 --> 01:53:06,621
Their business is getting broken into.
It's really not that much different than

2430
01:53:06,921 --> 01:53:11,921
a rich person's house.
It's just the fact that it's a business 

2431
01:53:11,921 --> 01:53:14,291
in Korea town that was in new nwa movie 
was cool seeing them remake that riot.

2432
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:18,520
Yeah.
No.

2433
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:24,160
There's an article about art thieves and
about how little do you read that today 

2434
01:53:25,950 --> 01:53:30,950
was out today about how few works of art
ever get recovered when there's art 

2435
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:33,680
theft is really interesting.

2436
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:38,980
There's,
when I lived in boston about 25 years 

2437
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:38,980
ago,
there was this big art,

2438
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:44,460
a big stolen art event where these 
people broke into the.

2439
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:47,510
I think it was.
I don't remember which I want to say the

2440
01:53:47,511 --> 01:53:47,960
getty,
but um,

2441
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:48,560
no,
I'm wrong.

2442
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:50,650
It's not the getty museum.
There was a.

2443
01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:51,530
No,
no,

2444
01:53:51,531 --> 01:53:56,531
no.
It was a museum in boston and it was a 

2445
01:53:56,531 --> 01:53:58,751
big time museum and these guys broke 
into a 25 years ago and stole a shitload

2446
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,710
of rembrandt's.
And like,

2447
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:04,910
here it is.
What is the two suspects?

2448
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:06,830
Is that what you're talking about?
I guess 25 years ago.

2449
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:08,540
These guys are dead now though.
But they are.

2450
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,940
When did this come out?
Just recently.

2451
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:13,250
This articles recently,
August 7th.

2452
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:14,960
Ha.
Um,

2453
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:20,050
the two men suspected to masquerading as
police officers to robin art museum of 

2454
01:54:20,050 --> 01:54:21,560
$500,000,000
with the masterpieces in 1990 or dead.

2455
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:26,561
The fbi say two years ago,
investigators announced they knew who 

2456
01:54:26,561 --> 01:54:30,701
stole 13 works,
including paintings by rembrandt and 

2457
01:54:30,701 --> 01:54:30,701
vermeer.

2458
01:54:30,701 --> 01:54:31,520
I don't know who that dude is from 
boston,

2459
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:34,220
isabella stewart gardner museum.
That's where it is,

2460
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:39,730
but they refused to elaborate saying 
only the investigator was investigation 

2461
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:43,280
was focused on recovering the artwork so
this the suspects are dead.

2462
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:48,310
What's butts interested in $500,
million dollars worth of art and no 

2463
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:50,360
one's ever recovered the art.
So someone's got the art.

2464
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:55,130
Do you think it's just like North Korea?
They just have like a bunch of galleries

2465
01:54:55,131 --> 01:55:00,131
like yes,
we have all the most famous american 

2466
01:55:00,131 --> 01:55:00,131
paintings and you know what I mean?
Like I think it's rich people.

2467
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:05,460
I think it's really,
really rich people that don't give a 

2468
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:07,511
fuck where that art came from and they 
have a private collection and they walk 

2469
01:55:07,511 --> 01:55:08,720
by it and they laugh.
You kNow that they bought a rembrandt,

2470
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:13,580
that they have a picasso,
but I think that it's dangerous for them

2471
01:55:13,581 --> 01:55:16,400
because if they get caught,
they know what that fucking thing is.

2472
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:18,060
It's like if you,
if you have a ram brand,

2473
01:55:18,061 --> 01:55:19,400
your wall,
I don't know about you but me,

2474
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:22,190
I would have no idea what it is.
Someone to have to tell me,

2475
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:27,520
you know,
but as someone who's like a serious art 

2476
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,700
collector enough that they're willing to
spend millions of dollars on a painting,

2477
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:30,470
they're going to know exactly what that 
thing is,

2478
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:35,820
but people are creepy man.
People that are collectors and 

2479
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:38,481
collectors of things.
People get real creepy about real 

2480
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:40,070
specifics like they want it picasso.
They have a rim brand.

2481
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,320
They have a this guy or that guy and 
they've needed picasso,

2482
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:48,620
picasso,
but nothing is on the market and then 

2483
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:50,781
some guy comes up to you and says,
I know something that's about to go on 

2484
01:55:50,781 --> 01:55:54,351
the market and right now it is in a 
collection that is public and it will no

2485
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:59,310
longer be public and someone will own it
and it could be you.

2486
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,050
Would you be interested in this?
And you're like,

2487
01:56:01,051 --> 01:56:02,190
well,
when are we talking here?

2488
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:03,840
Like what are we saying?
Well,

2489
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:07,230
we'll show you a photograph and I'll 
show you what it is.

2490
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:08,400
And they'll go,
well,

2491
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:11,580
maybe what are we talking here and what?
We talked about $2,000,000.

2492
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,470
Oh,
okay.

2493
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:18,471
I think we could work something out and 
then they have to figure out how to 

2494
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:21,081
exchange money or it doesn't get traced 
and then have it looked at a praise to 

2495
01:56:21,081 --> 01:56:21,740
make sure it's real.
I mean that's,

2496
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:22,860
that's,
that's tough.

2497
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:26,100
That whole black market thing where 
people have been busted doing that,

2498
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,350
they'd been busted doing that with 
statues.

2499
01:56:28,351 --> 01:56:31,080
There was a rome roman statue that they 
brought.

2500
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:36,081
This guy in.
Bryan county told me the story and then 

2501
01:56:36,081 --> 01:56:38,601
I went and listened to it on something 
else where this guy had this statue and 

2502
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:44,900
all day had spent so much money at 
praising it and they bought it and they 

2503
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:47,190
brought in this expert and the expert 
literally looked at it for a few minutes

2504
01:56:47,191 --> 01:56:48,600
and goes,
can you get your money back?

2505
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:50,190
And he was like,
what are you talking about?

2506
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,330
He goes,
can you get your money back?

2507
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,400
This is fake.
You need to get your money back.

2508
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:58,430
It's like why?
And apparently he had bought it from a 

2509
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:00,651
legitimate source,
but the legitimate source had been 

2510
01:57:00,651 --> 01:57:03,141
swindled.
It's like they can figure out a way to 

2511
01:57:03,141 --> 01:57:05,880
actually add mold shit to make it look 
super old.

2512
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:09,570
They burry things underground and add 
mold to them.

2513
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:14,490
Like they figure out a way to have.
Because if you can find something like,

2514
01:57:14,491 --> 01:57:19,491
um,
something that's like really old like 

2515
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:19,491
that.
Somebody gave me a coin mark.

2516
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:23,250
Gordon gave me a coin.
It's an 1800 year old coin from rome,

2517
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,050
but it is a fuck load of them.
Like,

2518
01:57:25,051 --> 01:57:26,060
you know,
they made a bunch of them.

2519
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:31,150
This guy,
whoever the guy was at the time had a 

2520
01:57:31,150 --> 01:57:32,400
shitload of his coins made.

2521
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:34,080
You can get ahold of them.
They're not cheap,

2522
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:37,080
but you can get them.
But a statue from back then,

2523
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:42,470
like a,
just a really complex well worked piece 

2524
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:46,251
of sculpture is probably worth insane 
amounts of money if there's only one of 

2525
01:57:46,251 --> 01:57:48,360
them.
And it's 1800 years old,

2526
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:51,030
2000 years old,
it's probably worth millions of dollars.

2527
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:53,520
So if someone could sit around and 
figure out how to fake it.

2528
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,250
so you make one,
you make it real close,

2529
01:57:56,270 --> 01:58:01,270
then you slowly chip away at it and add 
to it and then figure out a way to 

2530
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:05,610
simulate erosion and then figure out a 
way to get this,

2531
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:07,230
uh,
this mold in it.

2532
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:10,920
And this mold was apparently the right 
mold for the area,

2533
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:16,100
so it had a lot of people fooled.
but this one art expert just looked at 

2534
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:16,100
it and say like,
this is,

2535
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:17,760
this is not right.
This is not real.

2536
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:21,630
Like he just knew you could just tell 
because he'd just seen so many of them.

2537
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,390
Whereas most people,
I mean if you're a guy who's your,

2538
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:28,410
your expertise is in appraising ancient 
statues,

2539
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,550
you develop a finely honed sense of what
an ancient statue it looks like.

2540
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:35,730
So for him it was like really obvious,
like right away,

2541
01:58:35,731 --> 01:58:38,460
like the hue is off.
Something's off,

2542
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:40,050
this can't be real.
Holy shit.

2543
01:58:40,051 --> 01:58:42,010
You got to get your money back quick.
Whereas,

2544
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,610
you know,
uri,

2545
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:43,360
be like,
whoa,

2546
01:58:43,361 --> 01:58:45,760
do you dislike 3000 years old?
I heard it's 5,000

2547
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:48,280
years old.
We'd both be retarded fucking staring at

2548
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:49,470
the stupid thing.
Meanwhile,

2549
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:52,380
mike from calabasas made it fat jermaine

2550
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:57,690
jew and it doesn't make anything,
doesn't mean what does this movie 

2551
01:58:57,690 --> 01:59:01,551
documentary tim's vermeer that for me or
just came up on here and it made me 

2552
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:05,331
think of it someone.
I don't remember which guest brought it 

2553
01:59:05,331 --> 01:59:05,331
up,
but this is a really,

2554
01:59:05,331 --> 01:59:08,340
really great documentary.
Pendula made a millionaire guy.

2555
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:12,930
He actually runs the company that makes 
the newtek tricaster we use here.

2556
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:18,150
He figured out this really long process 
of how to recreate a.

2557
01:59:18,270 --> 01:59:23,270
He made a forgery but no one knew how to
make the forgery and he spent years 

2558
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:27,830
figuring out how this guy,
vermeer actually was making these photo 

2559
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:30,111
realistic paintings and then figured out
how to do it himself and was making 

2560
01:59:30,111 --> 01:59:34,431
paintings.
I like a factory almost that we're 

2561
01:59:34,431 --> 01:59:36,750
indecipherable from actual vermeer 
distinguishable.

2562
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:38,030
Yeah.
Oh wow.

2563
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:40,680
Amazing art guys.
It's a really cool documentary.

2564
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:43,470
Really worth checking out.
I heard good things about this.

2565
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:46,110
It's awesome.
I'm like,

2566
01:59:46,111 --> 01:59:51,111
I'd really like to watch it again just 
to get inspired to the amount of work 

2567
01:59:51,111 --> 01:59:51,111
this guy put in.

2568
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:56,240
Anytime penn jillette gets involved in 
something that's always going to kick 

2569
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:56,240
his ass.
He's a smart dude.

2570
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,420
He looks weird now though.
He's lost a lot of weight.

2571
01:59:58,110 --> 02:00:03,110
I never say that it's bad for someone to
be healthy or unhealthy for so long and 

2572
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:07,791
kind of recognize them as being this big
fat guy and now all of a sudden he's 

2573
02:00:07,791 --> 02:00:07,791
like super thin.
It's actually.

2574
02:00:07,791 --> 02:00:10,220
Norton is like really thin right now.
It's really weird.

2575
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:15,980
Se folks healthiest.
He texted me the other day about cryo 

2576
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:19,611
chambers wants to start freezing that I 
sent you guys that link a three new 

2577
02:00:20,641 --> 02:00:22,800
three d display that doesn't require 
glasses.

2578
02:00:22,801 --> 02:00:25,060
We've talked about it in the past.
A lot of uh,

2579
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,010
what would be so cool.
It was not three d tvs but not having to

2580
02:00:29,011 --> 02:00:34,011
wear glasses and watch a tv and stuff.
And gizmodo actually had a pretty good 

2581
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:39,410
article uSing care santa maria as an 
example of the three d technology and 

2582
02:00:39,781 --> 02:00:43,470
it's using a whole bunch of different 
projectors and screens.

2583
02:00:43,470 --> 02:00:48,470
But I guess it's really realistic,
like if you're staring at and you walk 

2584
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,470
around her,
it,

2585
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:53,270
it looks like her standing right in 
front of you and then they have a low.

2586
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:56,210
So it's a hologram.
It kind of is a hologram.

2587
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:59,230
But I think the goal of fullscreen and 
the young Jamey.

2588
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:01,320
Um,
so here's,

2589
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,030
that's a fake dude or real dude.
No,

2590
02:01:03,031 --> 02:01:08,031
this is a real dude.
This is how they're actually showing 

2591
02:01:08,031 --> 02:01:08,820
they make it.
Those are all cameras around him.

2592
02:01:08,821 --> 02:01:11,250
I believe her lights,
it said 30 cameras.

2593
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:16,380
So those are just lights.
So the 30 cameras are capturing 30 

2594
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:16,380
different images.
Right?

2595
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:18,150
And so the three rows of 10 images.
Yeah.

2596
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:21,330
So they're recording all of him and all 
the different angles.

2597
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:25,920
A morgan spurlock.
That's the supersize me guy.

2598
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:31,530
And so they're recording him moving and 
all sorts of different ways.

2599
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:34,950
And then they,
what do they do with it?

2600
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:40,240
Oh,
see now this is showing what their 

2601
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:40,240
feeling

2602
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:42,020
of filming,
like if you were to walk around.

2603
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:45,810
Wow.
And then,

2604
02:01:45,811 --> 02:01:50,811
uh,
so they can take this w what we're 

2605
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:53,030
looking at and somehow or another 
project it in front of you,

2606
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:54,050
like a hologram,
right?

2607
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:59,110
Yeah.
If you like that magic leap technology 

2608
02:01:59,110 --> 02:01:59,350
server thing kind of a.
Hold on.

2609
02:01:59,351 --> 02:02:04,351
Let's see.
Let's turn this up a little so we can 

2610
02:02:04,351 --> 02:02:04,351
hear what's going on.

2611
02:02:04,351 --> 02:02:07,570
6,000
led lights and 50 high definition 

2612
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:09,300
cameras.
After they captured all this data,

2613
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:12,810
they put it together to make a three d 
model of me.

2614
02:02:12,811 --> 02:02:17,730
And then they were able to project that 
onto this screen as you see me now.

2615
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:22,010
Wow.
So it looks like it is a screen,

2616
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:24,230
but it's a three d screens.
If you were to stare at it,

2617
02:02:24,231 --> 02:02:26,540
you would be able to walk to the side,
to the left,

2618
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:27,020
to the right,

2619
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:29,380
the hit this guy who was a holocaust 
survivor.

2620
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:35,820
Imagine going through the holocaust all 
the way to 2015 and they turned you into

2621
02:02:36,221 --> 02:02:41,221
a crazy three d animated thing.
What series of generational jumps that 

2622
02:02:42,911 --> 02:02:44,100
guys pass through?

2623
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:49,620
Just think how cool it's going to be 
when this gets a little bit better in 

2624
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:52,291
the future.
Like the hall of presidents at 

2625
02:02:52,291 --> 02:02:52,291
disneyland,
you know,

2626
02:02:52,291 --> 02:02:52,291
and stuff like that where you're 
actually,

2627
02:02:52,291 --> 02:02:57,001
holy shit,
abraham lincoln sitting right in front 

2628
02:02:57,001 --> 02:02:57,001
of me.

2629
02:02:57,001 --> 02:02:58,030
Yeah,
you're going to get real holographs real

2630
02:02:58,031 --> 02:03:03,031
holograms rather that are just,
you probably be shocked when your hand 

2631
02:03:03,031 --> 02:03:05,050
goes through them and they're going to 
get to a point,

2632
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:10,080
especially if this magic leap is in any 
way indicative of what it's going to 

2633
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,270
really look like when it's done because 
right now you're looking at it and it's 

2634
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:13,930
like,
how much of that is proof of concept?

2635
02:03:13,931 --> 02:03:16,060
How much of that is the actual video of 
magic leap?

2636
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,220
If you don't know what magic leap is?
Google.

2637
02:03:18,221 --> 02:03:23,221
It's a wild new hologram thing that 
they're doing where they have like a,

2638
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:27,130
an elephant dancing inside a person's 
palm.

2639
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:32,170
TheY had a um,
a little ballerina that was on a girl's 

2640
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:32,860
bed.
It was like a four inch ballerina,

2641
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,410
but I don't know.
do you know like how much of that is?

2642
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:38,970
That was a demo.
Like I think that's not real.

2643
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:41,520
I think that just saying what in the 
future will look like.

2644
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:44,940
I remember reading someone has tried it,
but he had to be very careful about what

2645
02:03:44,941 --> 02:03:47,950
he was allowed to say.
You actually experienced it.

2646
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:50,220
You had a very,
very rudimentary,

2647
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,650
very early version of as a giant 
football house,

2648
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:54,390
how helmet,
size thing you had to wear.

2649
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:58,620
It was projecting things in front of his
eyes on it to us screen like thing,

2650
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:03,300
but they're doing some called light 
field augmentation.

2651
02:04:03,301 --> 02:04:08,301
It's there make.
It's like brand new technology that no 

2652
02:04:08,301 --> 02:04:08,840
one else has used,
so we can't compare it to you.

2653
02:04:08,930 --> 02:04:11,310
I wonder what,
how they're projecting it.

2654
02:04:11,550 --> 02:04:16,550
Like if.
So right now he's got to wear this 

2655
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:18,531
helmet thing and then eventually they'll
break it down to like a google glass 

2656
02:04:18,531 --> 02:04:19,260
type size or sunglasses or something 
like that,

2657
02:04:19,261 --> 02:04:22,380
but I wonder how they're projecting it 
in front of you.

2658
02:04:22,381 --> 02:04:26,460
Like how is it just a.
Is it a recreation of three d?

2659
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,150
Yeah.
They're

2660
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:32,150
putting.
They're actually projecting light into 

2661
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:32,150
your eye.
Like we're,

2662
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:32,260
we're,
we're expecting,

2663
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,740
excuse me,
accepting light into our eyes right now.

2664
02:04:34,741 --> 02:04:39,741
Like throw irises,
but they're going to shoot light your 

2665
02:04:39,741 --> 02:04:39,741
eye,
like lasers

2666
02:04:39,741 --> 02:04:41,040
stuff.
How long before someone goes blind or as

2667
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:46,041
I cancer,
they're saying now that cell phones 

2668
02:04:46,041 --> 02:04:46,900
absolutely cause cancer was serious.
Yeah.

2669
02:04:46,990 --> 02:04:51,990
There's a study that says that they're 
pretty positive that cellphones cause 

2670
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:51,990
cancer.

2671
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:56,690
It's going to good to.
Or most people's is there a such thing 

2672
02:04:56,690 --> 02:04:57,900
as hand cancer because that's what would
be the most right from texting all day.

2673
02:04:57,960 --> 02:04:59,790
I don't think people get hand cancer 
that much.

2674
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:00,810
Hands are pretty durable.

2675
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:04,590
Um,
but uh,

2676
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:10,310
let's see.
This cell phones cause cancer cell 

2677
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:12,010
phones in the cancer risk.
Yeah.

2678
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,690
There was a recent article about it 
where they were talking about.

2679
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:16,450
I'm trying to find the recent version of
it.

2680
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:19,480
Don't smoke yourself.
Own berkeley.

2681
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:24,540
Berkeley says cell phones cause tumors.
This is from a just a couple months ago.

2682
02:05:26,570 --> 02:05:28,230
Yeah.
Berkeley is the first city to,

2683
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:32,470
of the park is filled with hippies 
firstly to mandate cell phone carriers,

2684
02:05:32,471 --> 02:05:35,170
informed buyers of potential radiation 
exposure.

2685
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:39,760
A neuroscientist on why it's premature 
to claim co phones costing answer.

2686
02:05:40,090 --> 02:05:43,030
That might've been when I left read from
the daily beast.

2687
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:44,570
Hmm.

2688
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:49,210
I mean it makes sense though.
I think that is probably.

2689
02:05:49,570 --> 02:05:53,860
It's probably not good to have all these
wifi signals running through our fucking

2690
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:56,020
houses constantly.
I mean,

2691
02:05:56,021 --> 02:06:01,021
how could it be good that you're 
throwing hundreds of megabytes around 

2692
02:06:01,021 --> 02:06:02,230
the room in the air?
Right?

2693
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:03,250
I mean,
this phone is.

2694
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:08,280
I mean this,
this laptop's downloading shit right 

2695
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:08,890
now.
It's completely unconnected by wires.

2696
02:06:08,891 --> 02:06:09,760
Yours is as well.

2697
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:14,980
We there is.
There's movies in the air right now 

2698
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:17,650
around us.
There's like dick pics right next to 

2699
02:06:17,650 --> 02:06:17,650
your team

2700
02:06:17,650 --> 02:06:17,700
radios,
radio signals in the air,

2701
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:20,340
cell phones,
signals or signals or in the air?

2702
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:23,340
Yeah.
Well they say that fucks with bees.

2703
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:26,340
That bs apparently they hear it like a 
jackhammer,

2704
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:30,150
like the ways the way bees communicate.
They're.

2705
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:35,810
I think they're pretty positive that 
bees are negatively impacted by the 

2706
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:37,950
sounds and the signals that are flying 
around them all the time.

2707
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:40,680
Why fi cell phone radio,
all that jazz.

2708
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,230
That it's fucking with their peace.
See,

2709
02:06:43,231 --> 02:06:47,820
I don't know how much we feel or how 
much it impacts us,

2710
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:53,120
but what I do know is every time I go 
somewhere where there's no cell phone 

2711
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:57,250
was like Alaska or Montana or something 
like that where you're out in the real 

2712
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:58,020
wilderness.
It seems different.

2713
02:06:58,410 --> 02:07:01,950
Like the actual physical environment of 
the air seems different.

2714
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:05,070
Like when you're standing out there 
you're like,

2715
02:07:05,071 --> 02:07:06,390
what is this is a different kind of.

2716
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:10,440
Solitude is a different kind of silence.
It's just like real silence.

2717
02:07:10,441 --> 02:07:13,710
It's not like there's.
There's something missing in the air and

2718
02:07:13,711 --> 02:07:17,130
it could be just totally bullshit.
It could be a placebo.

2719
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:22,370
It could be just the fact that you know 
that you can't get a cell phone signal 

2720
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:25,671
and there's no one for miles.
You can't see anybody that it just like 

2721
02:07:25,671 --> 02:07:26,760
gives you this feeling of solitude that 
sort of accentuates the,

2722
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,150
you know,
the quiet of the environment,

2723
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:31,890
but it might not be.
It might be.

2724
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:36,900
There might be an actual physical thing 
that you're feeling in your brain that 

2725
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,820
you can't quite put your finger on,
but it's there all the time.

2726
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:44,870
It just makes me wonder though,
if we could look at it like something 

2727
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,870
like a nap though and be like,
well,

2728
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:46,230
day would feel it first.
You know,

2729
02:07:46,231 --> 02:07:51,231
they're so small that just a tiny gnat 
or what are those little red dots that 

2730
02:07:51,231 --> 02:07:54,630
are insects that are always like walking
around on bricks and stuff.

2731
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:57,420
Even though I'm taLking about like a 
bright orange dot and you're like,

2732
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,370
I'll just accept that.
That's a bug.

2733
02:07:59,430 --> 02:08:01,000
That orange dot.
No,

2734
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:01,280
no,
no.

2735
02:08:01,281 --> 02:08:03,390
we in talk to him about this little 
dots.

2736
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:08,510
No,
they're like these little insects that 

2737
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:08,510
looks like a little red dot and it's 
like a pixel,

2738
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:13,390
but they're super small.
I don't know if they haven't been 

2739
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:13,390
California.
Maybe

2740
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:15,060
there's two articles in a row here.
It's official.

2741
02:08:15,061 --> 02:08:17,790
Cellphones are killing bees and then 
right below it,

2742
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:22,230
cell phones don't kill bees.
One of them is from 2011,

2743
02:08:22,231 --> 02:08:25,910
May 21st.
The other one is may 20,

2744
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:27,630
May 19th,
2011.

2745
02:08:28,980 --> 02:08:31,110
So hilarious.
How's the fuck?

2746
02:08:31,111 --> 02:08:33,690
His sermon is supposed to figure it out 
to be squirt.

2747
02:08:34,830 --> 02:08:37,690
I think they were saying that interferes
with them.

2748
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:42,660
So let's see.
Bees and still a cell phones interfere.

2749
02:08:42,661 --> 02:08:47,661
Let's do this turn.
Fear study links.

2750
02:08:48,751 --> 02:08:52,920
Bees declined to cell phones.
This was on cnn.

2751
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:58,990
Yeah,
and they're saying the cell phone 

2752
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:01,730
signals somehow or another cell phone 
radiation may be contributing to the 

2753
02:09:01,730 --> 02:09:03,720
decline in bee populations in some areas
of the world.

2754
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:04,920
You know,
radiolab.

2755
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:09,330
I had this interesting story about bees 
were in China.

2756
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,150
They because of what?
What are you.

2757
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:15,720
What are you pulling up here?
Jamie says it doesn't say the government

2758
02:09:15,721 --> 02:09:15,960
though.

2759
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:18,630
Those are criminals.
this is a criminal website.

2760
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,270
This is.
Might be.

2761
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:22,610
Might as well be isis.
Who knows?

2762
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:25,710
They're telling you the truth.
I'm a.

2763
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:28,650
But this is the huffington post,
bro says it's real.

2764
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:30,840
What was I just saying?
Oh,

2765
02:09:30,841 --> 02:09:35,841
decline and bs in China.
They did this study where they found out

2766
02:09:36,331 --> 02:09:40,020
that they had rapidly declining bee 
populations for whatever reasons,

2767
02:09:40,021 --> 02:09:40,860
pollution,
whatever.

2768
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:46,220
And so they decided that they were going
to have to figure out another way to 

2769
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:48,060
pollinate some of their plants.
So these apple trees,

2770
02:09:48,330 --> 02:09:53,330
so they hand pollinated the apple trees 
and their yield went through the roof 

2771
02:09:53,670 --> 02:09:56,730
because apparently when you have bees do
it,

2772
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,130
bees are sloppy fucks.
They don't even know what they're doing.

2773
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:04,350
It's like you're asking someone to do 
something and they don't even know what 

2774
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:04,350
they're doing and they're idiots.
You know,

2775
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,280
bees are just little robots,
little insect robots,

2776
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:07,340
they just run around and they,
they,

2777
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,010
they get this pollen and they 
accidentally spread it.

2778
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:16,310
They're not doing it on purpose.
but when you have people do it on 

2779
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:18,711
purpose,
they had people doing it with paint 

2780
02:10:18,711 --> 02:10:18,900
brushes and when they had the people 
doing it with paint brushes,

2781
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:24,170
like significant increase in yield.
But then people wanted more money and 

2782
02:10:24,961 --> 02:10:26,310
then they realized that,
you know,

2783
02:10:26,311 --> 02:10:31,311
in China,
like the more lucrative the business 

2784
02:10:31,311 --> 02:10:35,061
became,
the more people organized and said we 

2785
02:10:35,061 --> 02:10:37,191
want more money.
The more they decided it was cost 

2786
02:10:37,191 --> 02:10:37,191
prohibitive.
But they tried.

2787
02:10:37,191 --> 02:10:39,020
This is all from a radio lab,
podcasts call,

2788
02:10:39,021 --> 02:10:41,690
I think it was called worth.
Don't quote me on that though,

2789
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:43,910
but it was all about how much are things
worth.

2790
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:46,370
And one of the things that they were 
talking about were how much,

2791
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:52,330
how much is it worth to have bees 
pollinate these plants that you don't 

2792
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:53,720
think about it that way.
You think about it like,

2793
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:54,920
oh,
it's just a part of nature,

2794
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:57,050
but if you had to put a monetary value 
on it,

2795
02:10:57,051 --> 02:11:02,051
then maybe you would think more 
carefully about maintaining healthy bee 

2796
02:11:02,091 --> 02:11:07,091
populations.
And I think the number they were using 

2797
02:11:07,091 --> 02:11:09,881
was in the billions that having healthy 
bee populations that pollinate plants is

2798
02:11:10,101 --> 02:11:12,170
worth x amount of billions of dollars in
labor.

2799
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:15,870
Whether or not that's true.
Yeah.

2800
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:19,020
It seems like you could eat like those 
little robot drone things.

2801
02:11:19,021 --> 02:11:21,330
We could almost make her own robot bees 
in the future.

2802
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:22,370
Well,
they have done that.

2803
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:23,500
Yeah,
they have done that.

2804
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:26,030
Monsanto did that.
Monsanto has drone bees.

2805
02:11:26,031 --> 02:11:27,680
You're seeing them now.
pull them up.

2806
02:11:27,681 --> 02:11:29,870
Jamie.
Monsanto drone bees.

2807
02:11:29,871 --> 02:11:34,871
Where you see this.
This is the idea I think is once we 

2808
02:11:34,871 --> 02:11:36,710
pollute the atmosphere to the point 
where bees can't live anymore,

2809
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:41,060
they're going to release these fucking 
insect hordes traveling to the field.

2810
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,620
He's horrible little monster

2811
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:47,660
spice and dynamics just released a new 
robot video running through a forest and

2812
02:11:49,131 --> 02:11:53,540
it's very creepy looking.
It looks like an army soldier.

2813
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:57,920
Those fucking things are terrifying man.
Boston dynamics or they make some of the

2814
02:11:57,921 --> 02:12:02,921
scariest shit.
Did you find any monsanto bs drone be I 

2815
02:12:03,591 --> 02:12:06,140
sent you the link of the other robot 
when they're going to look at that while

2816
02:12:06,141 --> 02:12:08,120
you're looking at.
I'm trying to.

2817
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:13,300
The only stuff.
I'm fine on this monsanto or sites that 

2818
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:13,300
don't look legit.
Yeah.

2819
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:17,410
Robotic bees to pollinate monsanto 
crops.

2820
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:20,730
It sounds like a troll.
First news that wordpress dot jude.

2821
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:22,480
That's it though.
Go to it and they'll show you the.

2822
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:23,330
The b.
No,

2823
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:24,920
but that's where I'm at.
Is it fake?

2824
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:29,060
Go to snopes is word press.
It's from harvard.

2825
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:33,620
Says the harvard monolithic be harvard.
Yeah.

2826
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:39,760
Microbiotics lab had been working with 
its micro air vehicles projects since 

2827
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,550
2009 working on.
It's borrowing from the biomechanics and

2828
02:12:43,551 --> 02:12:48,551
social organization of bees.
That team of researches is undergoing 

2829
02:12:48,551 --> 02:12:51,170
the creation of a tiny wing robot.

2830
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:53,040
Look at this fucking thing,
man.

2831
02:12:53,670 --> 02:12:57,750
Is that real?
Seems real so size of a penny.

2832
02:12:58,830 --> 02:12:59,280
whoa.

2833
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:01,610
So they cut that.
Be out of that thing.

2834
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:05,460
The little circuit board publish 
reports.

2835
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:08,180
no lab also described potential military
uses,

2836
02:13:08,181 --> 02:13:10,490
surveillance and mapping,
but the dime size,

2837
02:13:10,491 --> 02:13:13,770
cyber bees have yet to be outfitted with
neuro

2838
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:15,490
hacks and tips.
Stingers.

2839
02:13:15,491 --> 02:13:16,150
Yuck.
Yuck.

2840
02:13:16,151 --> 02:13:18,040
Yuck.
This looks real as fuck.

2841
02:13:18,041 --> 02:13:19,000
Dude.
This is fake.

2842
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:22,240
This is a really elaborate sort of a 
hoax that are.

2843
02:13:22,241 --> 02:13:25,160
It's like final at some college,
you know,

2844
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:27,280
some engineers.
I say that was my final.

2845
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:28,420
Yeah,
it could be,

2846
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:32,610
but I don't think it's anything of the 
realm of possibility.

2847
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:33,900
Oh,
look at this.

2848
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:37,560
It is real.
Oh my god.

2849
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:42,150
Look at this fucking thing.
This is the little tiny fake bug.

2850
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,400
So how's this thing fly?
See you.

2851
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:53,090
Oh wow.
Those things go so fast you can't even 

2852
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:54,480
see it.
So they move just like a real bug,

2853
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,830
like the same sort of thing.

2854
02:13:56,170 --> 02:14:01,170
Printed circuit madness,
a versatile process for creating 

2855
02:14:01,170 --> 02:14:04,390
machines at the millimeter scale.
They can't create complex electrical and

2856
02:14:04,391 --> 02:14:07,660
mechanical systems using a variety of 
techniques.

2857
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:08,960
I don't see it flying

2858
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:14,030
process well suited to mass production.
It seems like some parallel 

2859
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:16,470
manufacturing,
large numbers of robotic device

2860
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:19,820
sounds like an idea again.
Yeah.

2861
02:14:19,821 --> 02:14:24,821
they didn't fly.
They just showed the wings buzzing when 

2862
02:14:24,821 --> 02:14:25,190
she could've just hooked up to a 
battery.

2863
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:30,540
Fine bitch.
Why would you show us something that 

2864
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:31,940
flies but not have it fly?
That seems silly,

2865
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:32,660
right?
Yeah.

2866
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:37,670
It doesn't seem right,
but that boston dynamics robot is real 

2867
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:42,520
and it looks like a soldier.
It looks like star wars running through 

2868
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:43,490
a look at that thing.
It's so awful.

2869
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:46,940
There's a video also have it.
This is just an animated gif,

2870
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:50,790
but it's terrifying.
It's a.

2871
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:56,210
It's weird because it's hooked up right 
now to a giant tube in the back of it,

2872
02:14:56,211 --> 02:15:01,211
but that's just for now is aren't they 
owned by google now or something like 

2873
02:15:01,211 --> 02:15:01,850
that?
Prostitute dynamics.

2874
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:07,270
Skynet.
You mean that they're showing all their 

2875
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:08,450
different robots right now in this 
video.

2876
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:11,000
My friend who worked for google doesn't 
work for google anymore,

2877
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:12,950
so now I can't find out when they're 
going to attack.

2878
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:18,270
I don't know.
I was hoping that she could at least 

2879
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:19,961
send me the batsignal skynet's going to 
go live and these robots are going to 

2880
02:15:19,961 --> 02:15:20,900
start attacking,
but does she,

2881
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,780
does she works somewhere better like 
apple or something like that?

2882
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:26,030
She moved to another corporation that 
I'll tell you about later.

2883
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:27,260
But look at this,
um,

2884
02:15:27,470 --> 02:15:29,480
this thing,
walking on those uneven rocks.

2885
02:15:29,570 --> 02:15:30,500
Oh shit.
Look,

2886
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:35,620
it gets hit.
It lifts his leg up and check the leg 

2887
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:37,880
kick balance.
That's a 20 pound ball that slammed into

2888
02:15:37,881 --> 02:15:41,750
it at 20 pound piece of metal or 20 
kilograms.

2889
02:15:41,751 --> 02:15:44,240
We don't know.
Imagining these things during riots.

2890
02:15:44,330 --> 02:15:46,280
They're just going to throw these robots
out there.

2891
02:15:46,281 --> 02:15:48,620
They're not going to have any real 
judgment skills.

2892
02:15:48,621 --> 02:15:50,600
Just grab,
you know,

2893
02:15:51,110 --> 02:15:55,610
keep out the real worries that this is 
how we're going to do our wars,

2894
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:58,070
that these things are going to go into 
cities and just kill people.

2895
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:03,440
And this is a robot versus robot until 
robots get to people and they decimate 

2896
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:05,630
human populations.
And then we,

2897
02:16:05,631 --> 02:16:07,550
uh,
that's the wars we have.

2898
02:16:07,551 --> 02:16:10,510
We send robots to kill people and then 
we sell,

2899
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:15,580
send robots to kill robots that are 
trying to kill people and then we send 

2900
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:17,200
our robots to kill the people that 
created a robot to kill the people.

2901
02:16:17,201 --> 02:16:18,570
Know we got robot wars.
Yeah,

2902
02:16:18,710 --> 02:16:19,880
that's possible,
man.

2903
02:16:19,881 --> 02:16:21,320
One hundred percent.
It's gonna start off.

2904
02:16:21,321 --> 02:16:22,220
Pretty cool though.
Like,

2905
02:16:22,221 --> 02:16:23,420
oh my god,
we're getting attacked,

2906
02:16:23,510 --> 02:16:27,230
but it's a robot attack and we have 
robots and we're just watching robots on

2907
02:16:27,410 --> 02:16:30,010
tv here.
Yeah,

2908
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,900
for a little bit.
So jamie,

2909
02:16:31,901 --> 02:16:36,901
there is a video of it.
Just look up robotic bees could change 

2910
02:16:36,901 --> 02:16:40,111
the world and then go to a.
It's pretty far down like maybe seven 

2911
02:16:40,661 --> 02:16:45,661
eighth into the video.
You'll see this thing is attached with a

2912
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:49,300
very small wire,
but it actually is flying.

2913
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:54,930
It's fucking crazy to look at man.
That's really weird.

2914
02:16:55,100 --> 02:17:00,100
It's a three minute videos.
Go to bella to 40 something and you can 

2915
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:03,210
see the actual,
a fake bug flying,

2916
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:05,860
but it's connected just like that robot 
is,

2917
02:17:06,370 --> 02:17:11,370
you know,
the road was connected with a hose in 

2918
02:17:11,370 --> 02:17:13,251
the back with wires.
This is connected with a very small 

2919
02:17:13,251 --> 02:17:13,251
wire,
but it's real.

2920
02:17:13,251 --> 02:17:18,110
So it's not just a proof concept.
They just have to figure out a power 

2921
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:21,621
source that makes sense,
but they're not as the robot bees are 

2922
02:17:24,111 --> 02:17:29,111
fucking crazy and creepy.
But what's really creepy is see that 

2923
02:17:29,571 --> 02:17:31,490
thing will get that thing flying when 
it's real.

2924
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:34,340
I mean it's mimicking a hummingbird or a
b.

2925
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,040
But look at it.
We'll see.

2926
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:37,790
This is an actual baby,
but look at it right there.

2927
02:17:38,630 --> 02:17:39,560
I mean,
that is flying.

2928
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:41,000
That's nuts man.

2929
02:17:42,510 --> 02:17:42,910
Um,

2930
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:45,790
here's what's scarier though.
Go to 10.

2931
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:49,930
Incredible micro robots.
This is fucking nuts,

2932
02:17:49,931 --> 02:17:52,180
man.
What way do you see this video?

2933
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:54,910
Ten.
Incredible micro robots.

2934
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:00,700
Micro and then dash robots.
Top one.

2935
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:01,330
Yeah,
that's it.

2936
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:07,020
Check this shit out.
This is one style that flies around like

2937
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:09,700
little helicopters.
Look at these fucking things,

2938
02:18:09,701 --> 02:18:11,470
man.
They come out of these boxes.

2939
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:14,290
So imagine that you're sitting in your 
office.

2940
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:14,990
This is fake,
right?

2941
02:18:15,090 --> 02:18:17,830
This is proof of context.
So yeah,

2942
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:20,830
but look at some of these ones that 
they're creating.

2943
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,800
These are all the different.
Um,

2944
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,990
so this is self organizing systems,
research lab from harvard,

2945
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:30,230
these things organized and they can 
figure out where to go look,

2946
02:18:30,231 --> 02:18:33,100
look at this elapsed time,
11 hours elapsed time,

2947
02:18:33,101 --> 02:18:35,440
five hours,
and they form shapes.

2948
02:18:36,130 --> 02:18:37,660
They go into certain positions like 
this,

2949
02:18:37,661 --> 02:18:42,661
one of them climb up a wall.
So some of these are prototypes,

2950
02:18:43,091 --> 02:18:46,630
some of these proof of concepts.
Some of these are just theories,

2951
02:18:46,631 --> 02:18:49,570
but these eggheads work on this stuff.
Right?

2952
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:52,570
So awesome.
Did you see the video of the,

2953
02:18:52,571 --> 02:18:57,571
uh,
where they downloaded the brain of a 

2954
02:18:57,571 --> 02:18:59,971
worm and put it into a,
like a little lego robot thing and it's 

2955
02:18:59,971 --> 02:19:01,280
just like running around hitting walls 
and going up.

2956
02:19:01,310 --> 02:19:03,350
So I thought this,
I've watched it,

2957
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:09,150
I watched it twice in the first time.
I thought it was a woman's brain and I 

2958
02:19:09,150 --> 02:19:09,370
was like,
oh my god,

2959
02:19:09,371 --> 02:19:14,371
did you see that?
They download a woman's brain into a 

2960
02:19:14,371 --> 02:19:14,371
machine to my friend.
I'm like,

2961
02:19:14,371 --> 02:19:14,371
no,
they did.

2962
02:19:14,371 --> 02:19:14,371
I'm like,
yeah.

2963
02:19:14,371 --> 02:19:18,391
And I like put them like this worm.
But the whole time I thought this woman 

2964
02:19:19,691 --> 02:19:20,430
is,
she's just getting here.

2965
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:27,030
Well she's a worm.
She can't think she's a lego or 

2966
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:29,731
whatever,
but that's funny when you think they 

2967
02:19:29,731 --> 02:19:29,731
would do,
if you put your brand a lego,

2968
02:19:29,731 --> 02:19:31,490
definitely probably go in circles and 
hit a wall.

2969
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:36,580
It would just run over to a laptop and 
just research fat jew all day just 

2970
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:40,730
hanging out on mfc.
There's a bunch more in that,

2971
02:19:40,731 --> 02:19:43,070
uh,
that video to one of them is a typer.

2972
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:48,340
One of them is typing with the top 10 
organizing ones.

2973
02:19:48,351 --> 02:19:53,200
One of them is this little thing that 
goes over a piece of paper and a,

2974
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:56,270
like a typewriter would do,
but types it.

2975
02:19:56,330 --> 02:20:01,250
So like you put a message in this little
thing and then you put this little thing

2976
02:20:01,251 --> 02:20:06,251
on a piece of paper and it will print 
out like a typewriter would what your 

2977
02:20:06,251 --> 02:20:07,310
message is,
which is really weird.

2978
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:10,460
Yeah.
You could see that one at like,

2979
02:20:10,461 --> 02:20:12,530
um,
let's see here.

2980
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:14,240
Yeah,
check it out jamie.

2981
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:16,610
Oh wow.
For labs.

2982
02:20:16,611 --> 02:20:19,210
How hilarious.
I don't think it's the same info,

2983
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:22,970
but it's like a 2:25
go to 2:25.

2984
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:26,310
Look at this fucking thing brian.
I mean,

2985
02:20:26,311 --> 02:20:30,680
I think that typing's kind of the idea 
of a typewriter is kind of outdated.

2986
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:32,960
There it is.
Cool.

2987
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:38,020
Look at that.
It just floats across a piece of paper 

2988
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:40,550
and writes what you wanted to say was 
fucking very strange.

2989
02:20:40,551 --> 02:20:42,200
Right?
Zuta labs,

2990
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:44,290
ufa.
Look at that.

2991
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:49,360
It's really neat,
but it seems like that's old technology 

2992
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:52,811
that's just not even created yet.
He ain't know that seems like I had 

2993
02:20:52,811 --> 02:20:52,811
already been made.
Like they like it seems.

2994
02:20:52,811 --> 02:20:57,161
What would be more like having paper 
that you could just take a flash and 

2995
02:20:57,161 --> 02:21:00,941
print it by just doing like a xerox 
machine on nights where you're just 

2996
02:21:00,941 --> 02:21:02,720
flashing some paper,
like a negative photo or something,

2997
02:21:02,810 --> 02:21:04,390
but that's 100 percent going to happen.

2998
02:21:04,390 --> 02:21:09,390
Yeah.
I think also what we were looking at 

2999
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:09,390
earlier,
the cara santa marina thing,

3000
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:13,601
the three d,
they're gonna be able to do that with 

3001
02:21:13,601 --> 02:21:15,641
just going to take a video,
something when your cell phone and be 

3002
02:21:15,641 --> 02:21:19,001
able to send it to jamie and jamie will 
watch like princess leia help will be 

3003
02:21:19,001 --> 02:21:19,190
one.
You're my only hope.

3004
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:20,900
Yeah,
that's going to happen.

3005
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:26,160
It's just,
it's just a matter of us staying alive 

3006
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:26,160
long enough to see things that we'd 
never thought could be real.

3007
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:30,890
It's not that far away.
This is people that we don't even know.

3008
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:32,780
You don't even know they're working on 
these things.

3009
02:21:32,781 --> 02:21:37,781
Nobody knows of them,
but yet they are like that close to 

3010
02:21:37,781 --> 02:21:40,991
going public on their fucking.
Everybody has to swipe key cards before 

3011
02:21:40,991 --> 02:21:42,290
they go into the building.
They check your bag.

3012
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:44,000
They make sure you don't bring your 
phone.

3013
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,870
Your phone has to go into a bucket when 
you go into the,

3014
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:48,650
into the laboratory,
because this is all propriety.

3015
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:50,980
Proprietary shit.
They're checking their.

3016
02:21:51,130 --> 02:21:54,680
They probably have those fucking fake 
buttons that are cameras and shit.

3017
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:57,380
I guess your glasses,
fucking glasses.

3018
02:21:57,950 --> 02:22:02,950
Glasses.
Now they have glasses with little tiny 

3019
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:02,950
cameras and I'm literally like so hard 
to see.

3020
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:07,270
If you look at yourself,
he camera look a little that goddamn 

3021
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:09,380
lenses like the selfie one,
like the one on the back is tiny,

3022
02:22:09,381 --> 02:22:10,550
right?
Look at my iphone here,

3023
02:22:10,730 --> 02:22:13,730
but the one the front is fucking stupid.
Tiny.

3024
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:17,900
It's so little and it's good.
It's really good.

3025
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:20,690
I mean,
look how good a selfie camera is.

3026
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:25,900
I mean they,
they do a fucking incredible job of 

3027
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:25,950
capturing your,
like,

3028
02:22:25,951 --> 02:22:28,320
look at this,
look at that.

3029
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:31,470
Yeah.
That's a tiny ass little little pinpoint

3030
02:22:31,471 --> 02:22:36,471
camera and it's got everyone in this 
room to the point where you could 

3031
02:22:36,471 --> 02:22:39,861
broadcast periscope from this thing 
that's like a sharpie if you took a 

3032
02:22:40,351 --> 02:22:42,240
sharpie and dotted a page with it.

3033
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:46,170
Just that's how big that camera is.
And yet it's crystal clear.

3034
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:49,170
So that could be in your button.
That could be in any.

3035
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:54,220
They're not physically patting you down.
You could easily have something like 

3036
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:54,220
that going on.
Yeah.

3037
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:55,680
The one I used in massage parlors,
it looks like a car.

3038
02:22:55,681 --> 02:22:58,460
A car alarm.
See you're on the air kitchen.

3039
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:01,620
Oh the fuck man.
But it's a video.

3040
02:23:01,621 --> 02:23:06,390
I filmed a 10 80 film massage parlors.
Do you?

3041
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:07,920
No.
Good.

3042
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:11,940
I mean,
the one right now,

3043
02:23:11,970 --> 02:23:12,940
it's uh,
it's like,

3044
02:23:12,941 --> 02:23:17,941
uh,
actually just looks like a little key 

3045
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:17,941
chain,
but if it does,

3046
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:17,941
it does 10,
80 p,

3047
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:21,861
like you had little memory card,
just put it in your computer and next 

3048
02:23:21,861 --> 02:23:21,861
thing you know,
it's just like,

3049
02:23:21,861 --> 02:23:22,520
oh,
you got full video.

3050
02:23:22,580 --> 02:23:24,270
You just put it on the nightstand next 
to it,

3051
02:23:24,271 --> 02:23:28,230
pointed towards the girl hats.
Anything that's really illegal though.

3052
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:29,520
I'm kidding.
I don't do it.

3053
02:23:29,521 --> 02:23:34,521
That's the only way.
But you think about what you could do 

3054
02:23:34,521 --> 02:23:36,990
that with me.
Belts would be an easy one,

3055
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:42,050
right?
Because you could actually hide the 

3056
02:23:42,050 --> 02:23:43,590
battery and everything in the belt.
You could literally hide the whole thing

3057
02:23:43,591 --> 02:23:48,591
and a belt,
they would have to give you your own 

3058
02:23:48,591 --> 02:23:51,171
outfit.
They would have to make you come into 

3059
02:23:51,171 --> 02:23:51,171
the lab.
You have to take off all your clothes,

3060
02:23:51,171 --> 02:23:54,890
put them in a locker,
and then were some scrub suit that they 

3061
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:55,080
provide.
You remember that movie?

3062
02:23:55,081 --> 02:23:58,060
A new jack city where they're making 
cocaine naked titties.

3063
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:04,520
That's how they had to do it because 
they didn't trust anybody and people 

3064
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:04,880
would leave with the product.
That's the same thing with these,

3065
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:08,310
these laboratories that are about to go 
live with all this crazy technology.

3066
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:13,580
They have to take every precaution 
possible to make sure that people don't 

3067
02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:16,851
go public with their stuff because for 
every one of the things about big 

3068
02:24:16,851 --> 02:24:21,531
inventions,
whether it's the light bulb or the 

3069
02:24:21,531 --> 02:24:21,720
telephone,
when these things are being worked on,

3070
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:26,810
there's usually a bunch of other people 
working on the exact same thing like 

3071
02:24:26,810 --> 02:24:27,000
scientific minds.

3072
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:30,240
Here's the thing about like innovative 
minds are brilliant people.

3073
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:35,390
They don't work in a vacuum for every 
nicola tesla who comes up with shit 

3074
02:24:35,390 --> 02:24:36,240
completely independent of other people's
thoughts.

3075
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:40,020
There's most people what their ideas are
based on.

3076
02:24:40,021 --> 02:24:45,021
It's based on the ideas of a bunch of 
other people that are sort of like 

3077
02:24:45,021 --> 02:24:48,120
extrapolated to a point that maybe a few
people saw coming.

3078
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:49,230
You know,
whether it's,

3079
02:24:49,231 --> 02:24:54,231
uh,
the idea of a telephone or the idea of 

3080
02:24:54,231 --> 02:24:54,380
holograms or three d printers are all 
these different things.

3081
02:24:54,381 --> 02:24:57,630
It's like people kind of see it common 
and they're all working on it.

3082
02:24:57,631 --> 02:25:02,631
And then this one,
thomas edison motherfucker comes out 

3083
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:02,631
with that light bulb and everybody's 
like,

3084
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:03,090
wow,
he's a genius.

3085
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:06,750
Thomas edison invented the light bulb 
and America was changed.

3086
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:09,690
Where would we be for not the work of 
this great man?

3087
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:15,260
Well there's probably about five other 
dudes who were working on exactly the 

3088
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:18,321
same time.
That's sort of what always happens with 

3089
02:25:18,321 --> 02:25:18,930
this stuff.
So a lot of it becomes a rush to getting

3090
02:25:18,931 --> 02:25:23,931
the funding and getting the patents and 
then figuring out how to get it 

3091
02:25:23,931 --> 02:25:24,310
produced.
But there's usually

3092
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,680
probably a bunch of people working on 
similar shit.

3093
02:25:27,370 --> 02:25:31,180
So like right now when you see this 
stuff like these little micro robots,

3094
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:36,181
when you see those big crazy boston 
dynamic robots and you see artificial 

3095
02:25:36,181 --> 02:25:40,030
intelligence and this is all stuff that 
they're going public with their probably

3096
02:25:40,031 --> 02:25:43,950
so close and so many different labs 
developing something that's really gonna

3097
02:25:43,970 --> 02:25:46,630
make you shit your pants.
Right?

3098
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:51,750
I got one I thought today.
Would you say some researchers have got 

3099
02:25:52,961 --> 02:25:57,961
a pig heart to work inside of a primate 
for 945 days and it's something they 

3100
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:00,400
didn't think was actually possible 
before.

3101
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:06,520
They've got a kidney working for 136 
days and it says that they're probably 

3102
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:11,400
geo engineering some of these pigs to be
better to suit human organ transplants.

3103
02:26:12,170 --> 02:26:13,580
Whoa.
Well,

3104
02:26:13,581 --> 02:26:15,450
here's something that,
uh,

3105
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,430
Dr.
Gordon,

3106
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:18,820
Mark Gordon told me about the,
um,

3107
02:26:18,830 --> 02:26:23,830
I was telling him about the success that
I had with getting stem cell shot in my 

3108
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:25,640
shoulder.
It's kind of creeping me out,

3109
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:29,300
like my shoulders still makes kinda some
clicks.

3110
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:32,150
It does some weird clicking stuff and 
um,

3111
02:26:32,870 --> 02:26:33,530
you know,
I kinda,

3112
02:26:33,531 --> 02:26:36,380
I kinda feel it,
but I can't say there's any pain.

3113
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:39,290
And um,
I'm practicing archery everyday,

3114
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:41,900
so I'm shooting arrows with.
It's on pulling back.

3115
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:47,320
This new bowl I have is only 70 pounds,
but I'm pulling back 70 pounds 100 times

3116
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:52,840
a day every day and it's not hurting 
like the next day it feels like a 

3117
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:54,050
little,
like something's going on with it,

3118
02:26:54,230 --> 02:26:59,230
but it doesn't hurt.
Whereas it would definitely be hurting 

3119
02:26:59,230 --> 02:27:01,331
before,
before the stem cells and like lifting 

3120
02:27:01,331 --> 02:27:02,900
weights doesn't bother it.
Like chin ups,

3121
02:27:02,901 --> 02:27:05,090
don't bother it rose,
don't bother it.

3122
02:27:05,090 --> 02:27:07,850
All these pushups don't bother it.
All these different things that bothered

3123
02:27:07,851 --> 02:27:09,920
it used to bother and it's only been 
four weeks,

3124
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,110
which freaking me out is how quick it 
is.

3125
02:27:12,590 --> 02:27:14,750
I talked to daniel cormier,
he's ufc light,

3126
02:27:14,751 --> 02:27:19,751
heavyweight champ.
Same shit with the asterisks next to 

3127
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:20,450
champ,
but I'm the same shit.

3128
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:23,810
He had an mcl tear,
got some stem cell shot in there.

3129
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:25,430
Bam.
No more swelling.

3130
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:27,800
Feels great and they don't even know how
it works.

3131
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:32,980
They have ideas of how it works,
but they're not really sure how it's 

3132
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:35,471
working.
These are nonspecific cells and these 

3133
02:27:35,471 --> 02:27:38,621
cells go to the injured area and they 
somehow or another know what's injured 

3134
02:27:38,621 --> 02:27:42,850
through the immune system or something.
The utilization of these stem cells 

3135
02:27:43,070 --> 02:27:46,910
causes injuries to heal way quicker than
it ever did before.

3136
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:52,350
And Dr.
Gordon was telling me about this guy 

3137
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:52,350
have gotten a car accident,
gets his chest crushed,

3138
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,540
okay,
on the steering wheel,

3139
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:56,390
down to 30 percent heart capacity and 
he's fucked.

3140
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:59,030
Can't have sex anymore,
can barely walk.

3141
02:27:59,150 --> 02:28:01,130
I mean he just severely,
severely diminished.

3142
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:03,320
Get some stem cells,
shot into his heart,

3143
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:04,910
bam.
Back to 100 percent,

3144
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:08,090
just a few months.
Like what?

3145
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:13,630
A few months,
a few months and it's fucking hard to 

3146
02:28:13,630 --> 02:28:14,900
work 100 percent now and this is like 
apparently this is going on all over the

3147
02:28:14,901 --> 02:28:16,670
world.
Like they're just going,

3148
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:17,080
wait,
what?

3149
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:17,900
What,
what?

3150
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:19,970
Like they're just starting to 
experiment,

3151
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:22,640
but that's really happening.
It's experiments

3152
02:28:22,910 --> 02:28:25,730
because they don't exactly know why this
shit works.

3153
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:28,280
They have some theories and they're 
trying it out,

3154
02:28:28,281 --> 02:28:30,200
but a lot of people are real cautious 
about it,

3155
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:36,250
but they're having some pretty 
incredible results with stem cells to 

3156
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:40,661
the point where it makes you wonder like
what are they going to have in five 

3157
02:28:40,661 --> 02:28:44,351
years from now?
Because they didn't even have this 10 

3158
02:28:44,351 --> 02:28:44,351
years ago,
10 years ago.

3159
02:28:44,351 --> 02:28:47,981
Someone,
if you told someone you got stem cells 

3160
02:28:47,981 --> 02:28:47,981
shot and injury,
they'd be like,

3161
02:28:47,981 --> 02:28:51,281
what are you from the future?
But I wonder if there's also because 

3162
02:28:51,281 --> 02:28:52,220
you're adding something new to the body 
that's kind of foreign.

3163
02:28:52,221 --> 02:28:54,660
If that passes on through dna or you 
know,

3164
02:28:55,020 --> 02:29:00,020
like in the future with a clever 
question like you have like a baby that 

3165
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:03,551
has an external face or something to it 
or only works like that,

3166
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:09,010
it's just,
it's their cells that are natural to 

3167
02:29:09,010 --> 02:29:09,010
your body.

3168
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:11,600
They can do It that way or they can do 
it with placenta.

3169
02:29:11,601 --> 02:29:12,780
That's how I did it.
Mine.

3170
02:29:12,781 --> 02:29:17,781
Mine was from human placenta,
from chicks of vets and sarah and 

3171
02:29:17,781 --> 02:29:19,310
sections.
They take their placenta in.

3172
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:20,930
Did you get to choose the girl?
No,

3173
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:24,350
I did not.
I don't think they would let you creep,

3174
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:26,840
but they also can take it out of your 
fat.

3175
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:28,960
You can have some of my.
No,

3176
02:29:29,050 --> 02:29:30,860
I don't want your fat.
My fat.

3177
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:34,280
The idea is you use your own.
Would you get lipo?

3178
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:39,370
Yeah.
What if a guy was like a light post 

3179
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:39,370
origin and contacted the show and said,
uh,

3180
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:40,730
I would like to get brian red bands and 
free light bulbs.

3181
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,470
You know,
I would Totally do it because,

3182
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:43,730
uh,
I,

3183
02:29:43,731 --> 02:29:45,020
uh,
am lazy.

3184
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:50,290
Now I've noticed that get the more,
the round a muffin top thing has nothing

3185
02:29:52,941 --> 02:29:53,990
to do with you drinking every night.

3186
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:57,270
Now I'm excited.
Diet coke,

3187
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:04,460
diet coke called sodium,
uh,

3188
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:06,420
bothered me.
Yeah,

3189
02:30:07,060 --> 02:30:09,950
I mean there's something going.
I know I only eat once a day,

3190
02:30:09,951 --> 02:30:12,260
so it's so weird that I even have any 
issue at all,

3191
02:30:12,261 --> 02:30:17,261
but I want,
I really wonder if I just quit drinking 

3192
02:30:17,261 --> 02:30:17,261
100 percent.
Yeah.

3193
02:30:17,261 --> 02:30:21,100
Well it's weird because I only drink 
diet sodas and so it's like a Jack 

3194
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:23,300
Daniels,
whatever calories isn't Jack Daniels I'm

3195
02:30:23,301 --> 02:30:25,010
having,
but if you want to eat one a day,

3196
02:30:25,011 --> 02:30:29,240
you have calories to burn.
It's not like I'm eating hot dogs.

3197
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:33,290
You have a sedentary lifestyle.
You like sitting and not doing anything?

3198
02:30:33,370 --> 02:30:34,500
Laying.
Yeah,

3199
02:30:35,790 --> 02:30:36,920
ross.
Too hard.

3200
02:30:36,921 --> 02:30:37,680
You get to say,
yeah,

3201
02:30:37,681 --> 02:30:40,880
I'd stay sit on friday that we can just 
lay sideways.

3202
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:44,270
You went when you broke up with one of 
your girlfriends back in the day,

3203
02:30:44,271 --> 02:30:47,400
the one where you went on this rampage 
and lost all the weight like you,

3204
02:30:47,430 --> 02:30:50,420
you were like fucking determined to look
good.

3205
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:55,750
You decided this is it.
I'm tired of being fat and waddling 

3206
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:55,750
around everywhere I was 10 years ago 
too.

3207
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:56,120
Yeah.
Awesome.

3208
02:30:56,270 --> 02:30:57,060
Yeah.
Well.

3209
02:30:57,061 --> 02:30:58,940
Oh,
so you feel like it's harder now because

3210
02:30:58,941 --> 02:31:03,941
you're 41,
31 that changed like maybe five years 

3211
02:31:03,941 --> 02:31:04,700
ago where I'm just like,
holy shit.

3212
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:07,610
Like the energy was already low to begin
with.

3213
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:12,640
Now I wake up tired.
so that's where I have a sleep nap,

3214
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:16,180
sleep apnea because I really do wake up,
just go like,

3215
02:31:16,210 --> 02:31:21,210
okay,
I just need to stay awake enough to go 

3216
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:21,210
to starbucks and then starbucks

3217
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:22,710
doesn't seem like it works.
The problem with finding out if you have

3218
02:31:22,711 --> 02:31:25,380
sleep apnea and you got to go through 
one of those sleep studies and those are

3219
02:31:25,381 --> 02:31:26,020
annoying.
Right?

3220
02:31:26,110 --> 02:31:28,740
I just saW that picture of me.
We have all those electrodes stuck to my

3221
02:31:28,741 --> 02:31:30,570
head.
I had it on my blog somewhere.

3222
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,520
It's probably still up there,
but it was a.

3223
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:37,750
I had these electrodes stuck all over my
head and like,

3224
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:40,700
like around my eyes and shit.
And then you,

3225
02:31:40,701 --> 02:31:45,701
uh,
you try to sleep and this fucking weird 

3226
02:31:45,701 --> 02:31:45,701
bed and some weird room.
I had the hardest time sleeping,

3227
02:31:45,701 --> 02:31:50,270
but once I did I was choking like 
clearly they can tell like when your,

3228
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:51,480
when you.
There it is,

3229
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:55,620
there's me covered up with a c.
I did the home version of that.

3230
02:31:55,621 --> 02:32:00,621
I just put a drop cam next to my bed and
I had it tell me anytime it hears noises

3231
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:05,190
a or movement and then it would record 
it in the clouds.

3232
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:06,480
Then I can just go back and be like,
oh,

3233
02:32:06,481 --> 02:32:10,020
there's a noise here.
That's me snoring or that's me moving.

3234
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:15,350
And I noticed that I,
I mean I've been doing it for like a 

3235
02:32:15,350 --> 02:32:15,350
couple months that,
uh,

3236
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:20,540
that it's mostly I'll snore on nights 
that I heavily drink or something like 

3237
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:21,600
that.
But it's always at,

3238
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:23,640
at the beginning of my sleep and then I 
just,

3239
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:28,730
it's only for like a half hour or so.
So it's not the whole night going like 

3240
02:32:28,730 --> 02:32:32,271
that or anything like that.
But well heavily when you're drunk and 

3241
02:32:32,271 --> 02:32:32,700
really exhausted when I'm really 
exhausted,

3242
02:32:32,701 --> 02:32:35,940
I snore horrible.
Like the worst,

3243
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:38,400
like a one of these hunting trips that I
went on,

3244
02:32:38,670 --> 02:32:41,550
me and steven rinella had a hall.
This pig down the sun.

3245
02:32:41,670 --> 02:32:46,670
Well I shot this pig and it rolled down 
the side of a hill and it was really far

3246
02:32:46,831 --> 02:32:50,040
down the hill and the hill was 
ridiculously steep like this.

3247
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:53,460
I mean like you couldn't walk up.
It had to crawl up the hill.

3248
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:55,290
You could,
you could crawl up it,

3249
02:32:55,650 --> 02:32:57,270
but you literally couldn't stand up 
straight.

3250
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:00,390
I mean it was just that steep and it was
a big pig.

3251
02:33:00,391 --> 02:33:04,470
It was like 200 plus pound pigs.
So the pig goes rolling down the side of

3252
02:33:04,471 --> 02:33:07,710
this hill and we had to figure out how 
to get it up the hill so we attach it to

3253
02:33:07,711 --> 02:33:10,470
these cables and we had this truck pull 
it,

3254
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:14,910
but the cables were rubbing on the rocks
on the hill and they kept snapping.

3255
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:20,180
The cable snapped twice and the pig came
rolling back down and then we had to 

3256
02:33:20,180 --> 02:33:23,571
stop the pig from rolling down.
So then the guide from the home ranch 

3257
02:33:24,211 --> 02:33:24,690
said,
all right,

3258
02:33:24,691 --> 02:33:27,920
this is what we're gonna do.
We're gonna roll the pig downhill,

3259
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:33,240
going to roll the pig downhill and uh,
I think if you just roll it downhill 

3260
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:38,750
you'll get down to the road at the 
bottom and I'll just drIve around and 

3261
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:38,750
pick you up the road.

3262
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:43,520
So we figured okay,
probably won't be that far and he 

3263
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:44,510
totally misjudged.
So um,

3264
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:49,940
not only that,
I shot this pig with like five minutes 

3265
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:51,750
left of light.
So it was like if it gets dark at 6:00,

3266
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:55,770
I shot the picket 5:55.
So all this stuff we're doing at in dark

3267
02:33:56,160 --> 02:34:00,270
and this is a place that to hone ranch 
that has a,

3268
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:03,570
they have a trail camera that picks up 
movement,

3269
02:34:03,571 --> 02:34:05,850
takes photographs.
So they have this waterhole,

3270
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:11,180
they got pictures of 16 different 
mountain lions in this one waterhole and

3271
02:34:12,421 --> 02:34:16,230
it's just me and rinella with one gun.
He doesn't even,

3272
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:17,620
I don't think he even had a gun with 
them.

3273
02:34:17,621 --> 02:34:17,980
I think it

3274
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,840
was just me and him.
One gun,

3275
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:25,260
16 mountain lions and a dead pig.
And we're rolling it down this hill.

3276
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:30,450
But you can only go so far because we 
got to this point where it's just like 

3277
02:34:30,450 --> 02:34:32,710
so heavily wooded.
We had to cut up the pig and then we had

3278
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:35,070
to carry it out.
So we have to,

3279
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:38,980
we had to gut this pig would take out 
the heart because you eat the heart.

3280
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:42,130
And um,
we got rid of the rest of the organs and

3281
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:47,160
he put one half on his shoulder.
I put one half on my shoulder and then 

3282
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:48,130
we had to carry this thing the rest of 
the way.

3283
02:34:48,131 --> 02:34:51,010
So we're carrying it for miles through 
the woods.

3284
02:34:51,220 --> 02:34:53,680
And the woods alert gets super steep 
hills.

3285
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:58,920
He gets to the bottom.
You're trying to climb over logs mean 

3286
02:34:58,920 --> 02:34:58,960
it's fucked and it takes hours.

3287
02:34:59,230 --> 02:35:01,930
So from 6:00
PM to midnight,

3288
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:04,270
this is what we did.
We just carried this.

3289
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:09,280
You each had 100 pounds on her back,
climbing over woods and trying to figure

3290
02:35:09,281 --> 02:35:12,010
out how to get to the fucking where this
truck is.

3291
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:17,340
We finally get to where this truck as we
got back to the cabin and just conked 

3292
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:21,541
out.
And apparently I snored so bad that 

3293
02:35:21,541 --> 02:35:21,541
everybody else in the building didn't 
sleep.

3294
02:35:21,541 --> 02:35:23,830
I went out there,
got shot with a tranquilizer dart.

3295
02:35:24,070 --> 02:35:26,500
Even I even had a mouthpiece and I had a
shitty one at the time.

3296
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:29,470
So you have a better one now you have.
Have you ever tried this new strips,

3297
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:33,160
those work or that's not,
that's not gonna help that I had already

3298
02:35:33,161 --> 02:35:34,990
had my nose fixed by then.
It wasn't that.

3299
02:35:34,991 --> 02:35:36,370
It's just my.
When you,

3300
02:35:36,371 --> 02:35:38,980
uh,
it's a big issue with a weight lifters.

3301
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:42,460
Your neck gets big,
your hole gets smaller,

3302
02:35:42,630 --> 02:35:45,940
like the air hole actually gets smaller 
and have a big ton.

3303
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:48,390
And so my tongue,
I don't mean to brag,

3304
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:53,090
so you've got a tight thrill and a nice 
fat tongue.

3305
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:57,370
And my fat tongue would fall if I'm 
lying on my back,

3306
02:35:57,371 --> 02:36:02,230
especially falls over the whole,
the air hole and it just chokes.

3307
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:07,470
And so apparently that's what it sounds 
like.

3308
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:10,060
I never listened to my snore,
but I've heard you start before.

3309
02:36:10,090 --> 02:36:10,990
It's bad.
Yeah.

3310
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:13,180
I remember you snored only.
We went to Japan,

3311
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:17,140
my mouthpiece,
and when I went to sleep,

3312
02:36:17,141 --> 02:36:19,000
I don't remember.
I just remember on the plane.

3313
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:19,850
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3314
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:20,930
That'll happen.
Yeah.

3315
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:23,710
They killed a mountain lion on the five 
freeway the other day.

3316
02:36:23,810 --> 02:36:28,810
good.
Kill them all from the santa monica 

3317
02:36:28,810 --> 02:36:28,810
mountains.
Cons.

3318
02:36:28,810 --> 02:36:29,860
People are too happy about those things 
being around.

3319
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:32,740
They're cute though.
There's cool looking.

3320
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:38,040
They just shouldn't be around.
People believe you shouldn't be around 

3321
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:38,040
with your.
Shut up.

3322
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:40,560
I hate that fucking line of thinking 
that,

3323
02:36:40,590 --> 02:36:43,630
that isn't annoying line of thinking.
They're dangerous.

3324
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:48,660
Mountain lions will fuck you up if you 
never seen a picture of someone who got 

3325
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:52,141
bit by a mountain lion.
There was some poor lady who was on one 

3326
02:36:52,141 --> 02:36:54,520
of the new shows and uh,
it was so graphic.

3327
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,800
She'd been attacked by a mountain lion 
on a bike,

3328
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:00,370
pulled her off of her bike.
Someone else tried to beat the thing off

3329
02:37:00,371 --> 02:37:03,850
of her and it just had a hold of her 
head and just tore face apart.

3330
02:37:04,210 --> 02:37:04,770
I mean,
it was just,

3331
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:09,400
it was awful.
There was a video on huff post of a,

3332
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:14,610
a woman's beautiful lullaby to her sick 
pig and I don't know if you saw it or 

3333
02:37:14,610 --> 02:37:16,070
not,
but it's one of those videos that

3334
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:21,080
I'm just cutest,
like human looking eyes,

3335
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:23,210
uh,
I've ever seen in my life.

3336
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:24,320
do you.
Well,

3337
02:37:24,321 --> 02:37:29,321
that's the thing about pigs.
I mean this is coming from someone who 

3338
02:37:29,321 --> 02:37:29,321
just shot one

3339
02:37:29,321 --> 02:37:29,400
or just told you about a time I shot 
one.

3340
02:37:29,430 --> 02:37:31,590
Yeah.
Pigs are really smart man.

3341
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:36,180
They're smart and they kill him.
Like vermin in Texas,

3342
02:37:37,550 --> 02:37:40,060
in Texas.
They shoot them out of airplanes there.

3343
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:42,420
They're constantly fucking shoot no 
matter airplanes.

3344
02:37:42,450 --> 02:37:43,750
There's.
Yeah.

3345
02:37:44,230 --> 02:37:44,860
Oh,
this.

3346
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:49,900
I mean if you play this poor pig is 
blind and she rescued this pig and so it

3347
02:37:53,901 --> 02:37:57,710
has to stay in this hospital.
And I guess jamie have two things at the

3348
02:37:57,711 --> 02:37:59,510
same time.
It has to stay in this hospital.

3349
02:37:59,511 --> 02:38:02,230
And I guess that one of the things is,
is that uh,

3350
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:07,780
there's so many loud noises at the 
hospital that it gets scared and she 

3351
02:38:07,780 --> 02:38:09,380
comes there when she can and sings to 
it.

3352
02:38:09,710 --> 02:38:11,560
And it's just one of those videos you 
just sit there going,

3353
02:38:12,110 --> 02:38:14,610
I don't want to eat bacon or nevermind.
And iT's still,

3354
02:38:14,630 --> 02:38:16,460
you begin.
But it was hard to.

3355
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:18,830
Bacon's good is good,
but it was good.

3356
02:38:18,831 --> 02:38:21,020
But it is.
It's just weird,

3357
02:38:21,021 --> 02:38:26,021
man.
It looks like an old noise in the 

3358
02:38:27,001 --> 02:38:27,750
background.
Her.

3359
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:29,400
yeah,
this is at a hospital.

3360
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:30,910
Oh,
okay.

3361
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:37,020
I mean that looks like a human

3362
02:38:49,890 --> 02:38:52,160
stopped up.
It's almost like a joke.

3363
02:38:52,490 --> 02:38:57,490
Let's see if you listen to the song 
sound of tractor trailers falling off 

3364
02:38:57,711 --> 02:38:58,730
cliffs in the background.

3365
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:01,080
It's an old irish lullaby.
She's singing,

3366
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:03,390
but it's a,
it's a nine month old.

3367
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:05,040
A 14 pound piglet.

3368
02:39:05,390 --> 02:39:06,790
Yes.
To a million views.

3369
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:09,550
if that was an african baby.
50 views,

3370
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:12,210
right?
Man,

3371
02:39:12,670 --> 02:39:17,670
people were brutal.
There was a picture of this fucking 

3372
02:39:17,670 --> 02:39:17,740
vulture that someone posted.
It was a meme,

3373
02:39:17,890 --> 02:39:20,890
I don't think it wasn't funny.
So fat jewish didn't use it,

3374
02:39:20,891 --> 02:39:25,891
but it was a meme of a vulture hovering 
over a black baby in africa waiting for 

3375
02:39:26,171 --> 02:39:28,240
this kid to die.
And,

3376
02:39:28,241 --> 02:39:31,390
uh,
it was about how many people cared about

3377
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:33,760
this lion,
but how few people care about the amount

3378
02:39:33,761 --> 02:39:37,330
of people that starve to death every 
year in africa.

3379
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:43,640
Yeah.
Justin wren is going to be on the 

3380
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:43,640
podcast again soon.
He's fighting for bella tour now.

3381
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:48,840
And uh,
he's back on the podcast I think in a 

3382
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:50,470
week or so.
I gotta I gotta go check the calendar,

3383
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:54,170
but he's back soon to talk about his,
uh,

3384
02:39:54,220 --> 02:39:59,220
yeah,
that's the 20 Fourth a week from today 

3385
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:01,180
to talk about black widow babies 
fighting for bella tour.

3386
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:02,710
And one of the reasons why he's doing 
this,

3387
02:40:02,711 --> 02:40:04,720
to try to raise awareness for the 
pygmies.

3388
02:40:05,110 --> 02:40:07,120
He's such an amazing dude.
He's like,

3389
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:09,380
he's a real deal.
Like I always look for likE,

3390
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:14,640
people like that.
I always think like maybe somewhere 

3391
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,801
along the line he'll reveal and it turns
out that he was really just doing this 

3392
02:40:16,801 --> 02:40:18,510
for his own profit than these.
But he's not,

3393
02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:21,780
I don't think that about him.
But you think that about someone usually

3394
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:26,370
when they have some big car.
Remember kony 2012,

3395
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:30,420
one of my favorite times wagon,
a wagon.

3396
02:40:30,490 --> 02:40:35,220
And the guy was a will explain why you 
say why can it because the guy was in,

3397
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:40,820
he was putting together this ridiculous 
thing to go after joseph kony and you 

3398
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:45,771
know,
letting everybody know what a horrible 

3399
02:40:45,771 --> 02:40:46,230
person kony was.
And then something happened to homeboy,

3400
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:51,000
ilana ballou's in his mind and was in 
his underwear running around and traffic

3401
02:40:51,001 --> 02:40:53,490
and san diego beaten off in front of 
people.

3402
02:40:53,491 --> 02:40:57,300
And that was the annacone like you,
you can't,

3403
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:01,410
you have to be a perfect person.
You can't have a great cause.

3404
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:05,220
And also be a nut because then people 
just immediately dismiss your cars.

3405
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:10,430
we never heard a peep out of joseph kony
ever since it was 2012 areas.

3406
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:15,540
he's totally naked.
Crank this up so we could hear this guy.

3407
02:41:22,980 --> 02:41:25,570
He's running around naked and he's 
clapping.

3408
02:41:26,050 --> 02:41:29,000
WhaT do you think it was on that?

3409
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:31,520
Oh,
he's,

3410
02:41:31,570 --> 02:41:34,930
first of all,
he's gay or then the day is long.

3411
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:37,870
There's no way you could even pretend to
be that gay.

3412
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:39,390
Like faking it.
Yeah.

3413
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:43,270
I don't know.
That seems like alcohol and molly maybe.

3414
02:41:44,010 --> 02:41:47,170
I think that's like some serious drugs.
I think that's like a meth move.

3415
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:47,860
yeah.
Yeah.

3416
02:41:47,861 --> 02:41:52,861
That's like a mifi sort of behavior and 
running around slapping concrete and 

3417
02:41:52,861 --> 02:41:53,000
angry at everybody.
That's all methy.

3418
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:53,750
Yeah,
matthew,

3419
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:55,270
it's,
it's,

3420
02:41:55,570 --> 02:41:59,950
it seems method.
It's more popular than I ever thought it

3421
02:41:59,951 --> 02:42:04,951
would.
Was it seen as I learned more about 

3422
02:42:04,951 --> 02:42:06,460
people doing meth and heroin in this 
city than I've ever.

3423
02:42:06,670 --> 02:42:10,030
Five was actually real life.
Math is super popular.

3424
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:14,020
Math is real popular and an adderalls 
real popular too.

3425
02:42:14,410 --> 02:42:17,620
And do you talk to doctors and they say 
there's not that much difference?

3426
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:23,320
Depends on how much you're taking,
but math in we associate meth with 

3427
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:25,810
addiction and we associate math with 
addiction.

3428
02:42:25,810 --> 02:42:27,700
That shitty behavior,
like you're going to take math,

3429
02:42:27,910 --> 02:42:30,130
you're definitely going to go out and 
get whacked out and do a bunch of stupid

3430
02:42:30,131 --> 02:42:32,650
shit.
That's not necessarily the case.

3431
02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:37,680
Some people do maTh and they're fine.
I think it cranked up and then the next 

3432
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:38,710
day they feel like shit,
but they don't do it every day.

3433
02:42:39,220 --> 02:42:42,940
Whereas we only think of math by the 
people that quote unquote abused math.

3434
02:42:43,330 --> 02:42:47,470
Imagine if meth became something like 
alcohol where you could just go buy it.

3435
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:52,680
Like if you run into someone,
like if you're at a park and you run 

3436
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:52,680
into some dude,
he's hammered like,

3437
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,520
oh great,
a fucking drunk as annoying.

3438
02:42:55,450 --> 02:42:57,670
Why is that any different than running 
someone who's left out?

3439
02:42:57,940 --> 02:43:01,270
Like there's people that can drink like 
you jamie,

3440
02:43:01,271 --> 02:43:06,271
you can drink and you're fine.
I've seen you a little silly but you 

3441
02:43:06,271 --> 02:43:07,010
don't get crazy.
But we all know someone any.

3442
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:09,550
I mean,
every group of people knows at least one

3443
02:43:09,551 --> 02:43:11,960
person that can't.
They turned this

3444
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,320
office,
whoEver it is,

3445
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:19,470
they go off the rails,
they get crazy and if you ran into that 

3446
02:43:19,470 --> 02:43:22,240
person in a park and they'll man,
fuck these bitches,

3447
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:23,560
you know,
running around drunk,

3448
02:43:23,561 --> 02:43:24,580
he'd be like,
oh great.

3449
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:27,490
A drunk.
Maybe that's the same thing with math.

3450
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:32,760
Maybe you do math and you'd be like all 
fucking speedy and you clean your house 

3451
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:33,550
up,
but you'd be the same guy.

3452
02:43:33,551 --> 02:43:34,830
The next day you'd be like,
ah,

3453
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:36,970
I did some good math last night.
I got a little fucked up.

3454
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:39,100
You know what I mean?
Like we associate,

3455
02:43:39,101 --> 02:43:42,580
like if you do math,
you're off the rails out of your fucking

3456
02:43:42,581 --> 02:43:44,070
mind.
Done like jesus,

3457
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:46,480
brian's doing meth.
oh no.

3458
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:51,340
But what if alcohol was illegal?
But meth was legal and you know,

3459
02:43:51,341 --> 02:43:53,590
you know what brian didn't last line.
He got drunk,

3460
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:56,560
no fucking way.
He was drinking alcohol.

3461
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:57,580
What an idiot.

3462
02:43:57,880 --> 02:44:00,280
And you're out there drinking booze,
getting fucked up,

3463
02:44:00,281 --> 02:44:05,281
which is totally norMal to us,
but it's only normal because it's a 

3464
02:44:05,281 --> 02:44:08,491
society sanctioned drug would have math 
is just as good or bad for you or just 

3465
02:44:09,071 --> 02:44:13,030
as just as problematic as alcoholism.
It's just not sanctioned.

3466
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:18,180
So we don't think about that way.
We only associated with those people 

3467
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:19,360
fucking claw their face off and lose 
their teeth and shit.

3468
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:22,750
Is that what people were referring to?
A speed and like the eighties.

3469
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:23,860
Is that something else?
Yeah,

3470
02:44:24,340 --> 02:44:25,300
that's all.
It means.

3471
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:30,480
Different types and schedule,
different classifications of 

3472
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:33,721
amphetamines.
But like that was a big thing in 

3473
02:44:33,721 --> 02:44:35,130
professional pool was guys would uh,
play on amphetamines.

3474
02:44:35,150 --> 02:44:37,300
They'd play for 24,
48 hours.

3475
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:40,870
They would play until the other guy 
dropped and they would,

3476
02:44:40,871 --> 02:44:42,370
uh,
they would gamble the entire time.

3477
02:44:42,371 --> 02:44:45,430
And apparently when you're on 
aMphetamines you can see things better.

3478
02:44:45,610 --> 02:44:48,250
Like you see like the path of the balls 
better.

3479
02:44:48,490 --> 02:44:50,320
You see like where the ball's going to 
go.

3480
02:44:50,550 --> 02:44:53,890
Like someone described it to me that 
they used to do meth and he said,

3481
02:44:54,700 --> 02:44:56,560
when you play pool on meth,
you know,

3482
02:44:56,561 --> 02:44:59,020
you look at a ball and the ball looks 
circular.

3483
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:03,910
When I would play on meth,
he said I would see flat surfaces.

3484
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:09,180
So it seemed like a series of flat 
surfaces around the ball and I wouldn't 

3485
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:12,430
know exactly what flat surface to hit.
So the ball collisions,

3486
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:17,640
like when you play pool,
if you look at a ball and trying to cut 

3487
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:18,430
a ball on the side pocket,
you're just kind of estimating where the

3488
02:45:18,431 --> 02:45:20,200
ball's going to collide with the other 
ball.

3489
02:45:20,201 --> 02:45:24,880
And that collIsion point you have to 
assume there's going to be like a little

3490
02:45:24,881 --> 02:45:29,881
bit of friction.
It's gonna move the ball off the line a 

3491
02:45:29,881 --> 02:45:29,881
little bit,
especially if you're cutting a ball.

3492
02:45:29,881 --> 02:45:31,480
So you've got to kind of compensate 
that.

3493
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:35,500
And you add a little spin to it to try 
to compensate for the deflection.

3494
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:38,440
So there's all these variables that you 
have to kinda like play on feel.

3495
02:45:38,650 --> 02:45:41,440
He said it wasn't on feel.
He said when he was on meth he would see

3496
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:46,441
like flat surfaces.
So we knew at this flat surface had to 

3497
02:45:46,441 --> 02:45:49,490
collide with that flat surface and it 
would make like a direct tangent line 

3498
02:45:49,490 --> 02:45:50,140
that would go into the pocket.
And I was like,

3499
02:45:50,141 --> 02:45:51,370
how come you can't see that when you're 
sober?

3500
02:45:51,371 --> 02:45:56,371
He's like,
I can't even describe to you what it's 

3501
02:45:56,371 --> 02:45:56,371
like.
He's like,

3502
02:45:56,371 --> 02:45:56,371
but when I'm,
when I'm fucked up on meth,

3503
02:45:56,371 --> 02:46:01,020
I would see like flat surfaces instead 
of a curve was probably a way to mimic 

3504
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:03,370
that using some kind of eyewear,
you know?

3505
02:46:03,400 --> 02:46:04,210
Yeah.
Probably.

3506
02:46:04,510 --> 02:46:07,480
But maybe not because I think what he's 
seen as a hallucination,

3507
02:46:07,870 --> 02:46:09,020
what he's seen and he's like,
hey,

3508
02:46:10,370 --> 02:46:14,780
you get confident in their heads.
It's been big in baseball for ever.

3509
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:15,950
Yeah.
Forever.

3510
02:46:15,951 --> 02:46:17,180
Forever.
make sense?

3511
02:46:17,181 --> 02:46:22,181
Right.
Like you would be able to see the ball 

3512
02:46:22,181 --> 02:46:22,400
coming at you quicker and you maybe will
see the edges of the ball better.

3513
02:46:23,150 --> 02:46:24,860
Somebody.
Somebody did say that,

3514
02:46:25,060 --> 02:46:26,810
um,
when they were on meth,

3515
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:29,780
like someone was talking about adderall 
not on meth,

3516
02:46:29,781 --> 02:46:34,781
but adderall,
that they could see the stitches of the 

3517
02:46:34,781 --> 02:46:36,580
ball as it's coming towards them.
What?

3518
02:46:37,620 --> 02:46:42,620
Well,
all that stuff was invented to make 

3519
02:46:42,620 --> 02:46:42,620
people better.
So that's weird.

3520
02:46:42,620 --> 02:46:43,340
All,
all these things that,

3521
02:46:43,590 --> 02:46:48,590
you know,
like math and infect means they're all 

3522
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:49,460
designed to give you more energy and 
make you better at certain tasks.

3523
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:52,550
But we just associated with abuse 
because they're illegal.

3524
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:54,950
Weird.
Look,

3525
02:46:55,100 --> 02:47:00,100
if adderall and meth really are that 
close and no one in this room are smart 

3526
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:00,940
enough to understand whether that's 
there.

3527
02:47:01,850 --> 02:47:03,800
But if they really are and no one in 
this room's done math.

3528
02:47:03,801 --> 02:47:05,460
Right.
Is that true bro?

3529
02:47:06,050 --> 02:47:08,810
And I don't think so.
But you've done adderall,

3530
02:47:08,811 --> 02:47:09,440
right?
Yeah.

3531
02:47:09,441 --> 02:47:10,580
Yeah.
I wish it did both.

3532
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:14,740
Wait.
Matthew snort might've.

3533
02:47:15,050 --> 02:47:16,910
I think.
I feel like I've done it before.

3534
02:47:16,970 --> 02:47:18,080
Well,
you can smoke it,

3535
02:47:18,230 --> 02:47:19,550
you can smoke it,
snort it.

3536
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:21,410
The idea is to get it directly into your
bloodstream,

3537
02:47:21,411 --> 02:47:26,411
right?
If you're taking the adderall as you're 

3538
02:47:26,411 --> 02:47:26,411
taking them as a pill so it has to go 
through,

3539
02:47:26,411 --> 02:47:28,010
your body will start to.
Yeah.

3540
02:47:28,011 --> 02:47:28,820
Oh yeah,
they do.

3541
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:34,390
Well,
that was one of the things that the 

3542
02:47:34,390 --> 02:47:34,390
bigger,
stronger,

3543
02:47:34,390 --> 02:47:36,011
faster guy had said that when they.
They changed oxycontin's and made them 

3544
02:47:36,011 --> 02:47:37,640
to where you couldn't smoke them or 
snort them.

3545
02:47:37,820 --> 02:47:39,380
When you crush them and turn them into a
pill,

3546
02:47:39,381 --> 02:47:42,830
their profit margin jumped or dropped by
like 80 percent of you said,

3547
02:47:42,831 --> 02:47:46,420
I think it happened after they were here
that it's been approved for 11 year olds

3548
02:47:46,970 --> 02:47:51,470
did however know oxycontin's for eight 
to 11 year olds.

3549
02:47:51,710 --> 02:47:54,560
Cool.
Because everybody knows.

3550
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:57,110
That's why sesame street's on hbo now.
Man.

3551
02:47:57,111 --> 02:47:59,030
Shit's changing.
Quick.

3552
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:02,750
Let me do some math and he says to have 
aaron and it.

3553
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:04,880
Muppets are gonna.
Fuck.

3554
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:10,330
Finally burton.
Ernie are taking a bath together burden 

3555
02:48:10,330 --> 02:48:14,190
earning different.
How long those guys been hiding their 

3556
02:48:14,190 --> 02:48:14,190
true love?
Totally.

3557
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:18,710
Like in those shows like you could have 
like two dudes that are obviously adults

3558
02:48:18,890 --> 02:48:21,770
live together and nobody questions.
where's the girls?

3559
02:48:22,150 --> 02:48:27,150
They don't.
These guys Aren't into girls like bert 

3560
02:48:27,150 --> 02:48:29,711
and ernie never talked about chicks.
They just hung out together and 

3561
02:48:29,711 --> 02:48:34,070
practiced with each other.
I'm surprised we don't like homeless 

3562
02:48:34,070 --> 02:48:34,070
people more because we all loved oscar 
the grouch,

3563
02:48:34,070 --> 02:48:35,330
you know,
and we kind of grew up as a young kid.

3564
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:38,750
Real loving oscar the grouch.
But then we got older like,

3565
02:48:38,830 --> 02:48:39,920
eh,
it's oscar.

3566
02:48:39,921 --> 02:48:42,770
get out of here.
What the fuck?

3567
02:48:43,010 --> 02:48:47,710
Talking by the way,
that's of red velvet mites.

3568
02:48:47,720 --> 02:48:51,580
What I was talking about earlier,
those dots that are around,

3569
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:53,660
they're very small.
Yeah.

3570
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:55,730
You were saying orange.
I was getting confused.

3571
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:57,170
All right,
we'll wrap this bitch up.

3572
02:48:57,350 --> 02:49:01,190
We're out of time here.
I'm be back tomorrow with jeff novitsky.

3573
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:06,220
Jeff novitsky vicky's ago,
busted lance armstrong and he now works 

3574
02:49:06,220 --> 02:49:07,800
for the ufc.
He's a ufc drug guy.

3575
02:49:07,801 --> 02:49:08,080
He's going

3576
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:10,650
to clean up the sport.
We're going to find out how,

3577
02:49:11,230 --> 02:49:12,900
uh,
Jeff Ross will be here on wednesday.

3578
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:17,950
Should be fun.
Jeff ross is a documentary or his comedy

3579
02:49:17,951 --> 02:49:20,810
special comedy central special where he 
roasts prisoners.

3580
02:49:20,890 --> 02:49:22,000
Awesome.
It's amazing.

3581
02:49:22,090 --> 02:49:24,910
And he really did go right into prison 
and you know,

3582
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:29,920
and,
and he wrote a really interesting thing 

3583
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:29,920
that I re tweeted about it,
that he wrote,

3584
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:33,480
I think he wrote it for huff post about 
like how crazy the prison system is and 

3585
02:49:34,330 --> 02:49:36,220
we'll let him talk about it.
I don't want to go into it.

3586
02:49:36,610 --> 02:49:39,120
Uh,
wednesday will be at the ice house.

3587
02:49:39,121 --> 02:49:41,600
Brian redman will be there.
Brian count will be there.

I'll be there.
More people to come.

3589
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:48,680

during the show that those tickets will 

3590
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:49,760
be available soon.
I'll put them up on twitter and about 20

3591
02:49:49,761 --> 02:49:50,180

3601
02:50:16,860 --> 02:50:19,500
I'm doing a show there at the Hong Kong

3602
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:21,380
in ventura,
California.

3603
02:50:21,381 --> 02:50:24,950
You tickets are on sale right now and

tee shirts and shit all sent through 

3605
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:31,550
stamps.com
with his own greasy little hands.

3606
02:50:31,880 --> 02:50:35,180
If you want to frame him for murder,
you can get some dna off of the packages

3607
02:50:35,570 --> 02:50:38,770
and he actually licks each and every one
of those books.

3608
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:44,430
It's funny.
Sometimes I like to throw a shirt in 

3609
02:50:44,430 --> 02:50:46,931
there and I.
Something else goes into package by 

3610
02:50:46,931 --> 02:50:46,931
mistake.
Fuck you.

3611
02:50:46,931 --> 02:50:47,960
Fat jew.
That's it.

3612
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:50,510
Anything else?
Right?

3613
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:55,540
Amazon and all the people that fat jew 
gets money from and tell them what you 

3614
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:57,080
think about that.
You get it together.

3615
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:58,670
Fellow.
You don't have to live like this.

3616
02:50:58,820 --> 02:51:01,870
You could come up with your own stuff.
Um,

3617
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:03,080
that's it,
right?

3618
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:05,810
Anything else we are going on?
It's basically it.

3619
02:51:05,930 --> 02:51:07,850
All right,
we'll see you guys soon.

3620
02:51:08,030 --> 02:51:08,930
That's it.
Goodnight.

3621
02:51:08,990 --> 02:51:09,530
Bye.
Bye.

3622
02:51:09,830 --> 02:51:10,400
Big kiss.
