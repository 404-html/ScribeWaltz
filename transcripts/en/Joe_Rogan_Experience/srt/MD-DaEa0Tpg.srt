1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,870
Five four, three, two, one,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,690
boom. And we're live. Mr Bisbing, how
are you sir? What's up Joe? I'm good.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,900
Finally did this, man, I know if
it sounds good about it for years.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,800
Feels like a lifetime. It's been quite
a while, man. Yeah, yeah. But yeah,

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,770
happy to be here.
Quite the setup you have as an Englishman.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,350
Please explain to me the Hawaiian flag.
What the fuck is the Hawaiian vibe?

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,340
I'm like confused. I was looking at it
the other day when Max Holloway one.

8
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,350
I was like, if I didn't, if you didn't
know any better and you looked at that,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,940
you'd like, this isn't some strange
flag by off the bar. I'm like,

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,420
girls are smart guy. I've seen the
podcast. He goes deep and I'm like,

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,540
do I need to reach some
encyclopedias before I come on here?

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,650
And the first thing you say is explain the
British flag. Sorry, the Hawaiian flag.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,270
What is that?
Well,

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
it's like claim to be an expert
on the history of Hawaii.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,630
I failed that class,
funnily enough.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,310
But I would say that we kind of organized
it at one point much like America.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,810
I don't know if you know this much,
like, you know you're going to Australia,

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,870
India,
Australia has got a funky flavor.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,330
We like to insert the Union Jack in,
in lots of things.

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,370
And you think about the size of England,

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,780
how much of the world you guys kicked
ass on? It's pretty God damn impressive.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,590
It really is. But again, I'm no
historian. No, but yeah, but no, it is.

23
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,980
I'm a proud Englishman. I guess our
ancestors were not my ancestors.

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,110
My ancestors are Polish and Irish. But
uh, but yeah, the British, they did okay.

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,000
Did a lot of shit, got a lot done or
they did. They did. You know, I was at a,

26
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,260
they get a lot of terrible things,
I'm sure over the years. But yeah,

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,950
I remember once I was in there in
Canada at a, at a party of all things,

28
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:47,310
about three o'clock in the morning
as well, you know, as one does.

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,850
And I walk in and some guy
starts going crazy at me.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,400
The things that the British
have done over the years,

31
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,950
you should be ashamed of yourself.
And he was causing a huge scene,

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,850
really screaming at me. Right. And I
mean going crazy. And I'm like, dude,

33
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:03,120
what the fuck? Nothing to do with me is
that you should be ashamed. So in the end,

34
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:06,290
I said, well, where's your family from?
And you're not gonna believe this is,

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,890
he said Mongolian Germany. I'm
like, fuck you. You're a German,

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,120
you're German and you're giving
me shit about my heritage. Okay.

37
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,680
But I suggest you shut the fuck up.
That's pretty hilarious about the history.

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,860
The Germans way more reason.
Oh yeah. Just a little bit.

39
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:26,410
Just a little bit of English
stuff isn't the past. Come on.

40
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,600
It's like with swords and arrows and
Shag Robinhood towns. Come on, come on.

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,580
You know? Do you like living over here?
Yeah, very much so. You know what I mean?

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,870
Of course. You know, you miss, you
miss home, you miss friends and family.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,570
Certainly. Um, you know, as you get older
and your parents get older, you know, you,

44
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,790
you do think about those things. But yeah,
it's great. It's great place to live.

45
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,570
You got to, your accent has
teamed it's Oh a bit. Well,

46
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,750
when you go back home to they give you
shit about it. I get shit all the time.

47
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:58,570
Yeah. All the time. And then like,
what's this weird accent, Mike? Um,

48
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,040
and he's like

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
this,

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,920
I'm intelligent enough to adapt to the
surroundings that I'm in. You know, a,

51
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,010
I'll now say tomatoes instead of tomato
because I don't want a cute little back

52
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,730
and forth to five minutes with the
fucking waitress. Do you know what I mean?

53
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,510
I just want to order my
breakfast. He called bomb with,
oh my God, you're English.

54
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,850
You know what I mean?
So I'll say tomorrow I'll say coffee,

55
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,550
but when I go back home, it
kind of, you know, and then
working on Fox, um, they did,

56
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,190
they worked on me for a while until
that Mike, we like what we think.

57
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:34,000
We like what you're saying. The problem
is we, I understand what you're saying.

58
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,310
It seems like it's good stuff.
There's lots of energy there, but, uh,

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,410
you to slow down while for pronounce
your words. So, uh, so yeah,

60
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,540
it is a little bastardized.

61
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,570
Have you thought about doing
commentary on UFC cards?

62
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,710
Have you done any of those yet?

63
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,010
I've just done the, what is it? The
content is here is that's it. Yeah,

64
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,970
that's it. But, but, but I think it's,
well, I know it well. It should be coming.

65
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,630
Ups just negotiated a deal for a child
with Zach, so yeah. That's good to hear.

66
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:04,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, cause
you're really excellent as an analyst.

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,180
Well thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,200
Joy, your insight when you're on
the panel, that panel is great.

69
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,710
That that is one of the best things
UFC has done is do that post fight show

70
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,760
because when the fights are over, you
sitting around going, Fuck Holy Shit.

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,210
And then to have you guys break it down
and then break it down beforehand as

72
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,880
well, but break it down
afterwards. I really do enjoy that.

73
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,730
Well thank you very much. He had the
guys do a good job. Um, yeah, it's fun,

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,631
you know,
I mean it's,

75
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:31,230
it's nice to be involved with the
sport obviously as a martial artist,

76
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,230
as a fighter and then now
retired. He's still, you know,

77
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,360
still have a little hand in there
and it's, it's, it's nice. Yeah.

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,020
Made a smooth transition
from being a fighter to,

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,920
to retired seems at least from the
outside looking in that it seems fairly

80
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:48,830
smooth. It's like some guys have
a rocky road. It's hard for them.

81
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,030
Well it's because, um, you know, I mean,

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,100
I, I want to tell the truth while I'm on
here, so, so I will tell the truth, but,

83
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,370
you know, I had eye injuries,
you know, so, you know,

84
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,420
every form from when the eye
injuries happened in 2013,

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,400
I always felt like I was on borrowed time.

86
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,600
So I was conscious of trying to set myself
up outside of the octagon where a lot

87
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,990
of fires don't have that luxury. You know,
I'm thinking he could end at any mom.

88
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:15,824
And so I was

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,460
actively pursuing a life outside of the
octagon, a career outside the octagon.

90
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:25,490
So then when that day came, I
was good. You know, excuse me.

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,870
Some carbonated energy during
that shall remain nameless,

92
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,490
but, uh, but yeah, so, uh, so yeah, no, I,

93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,870
I was working on that for a while and
yeah, you know, things are going well.

94
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,550
You know,
there's quite a lot of things going on.

95
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:44,570
So when you do that podcast with Louis
Gomez, got the podcast, believe you me,

96
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,220
I've got a company called play
lime. It's a a, it's a gambling.

97
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,760
It's fancy sports, but it's fancy
sports simplified. Basically.

98
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:56,240
It's kind of like a sports lottery.
So if we were focusing on the UFC,

99
00:05:56,241 --> 00:06:00,170
who's going to win? What round? How
many take downs? We do five stars.

100
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,000
He hid them buying and
you've got $1 billion.

101
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,260
We had the analytics groups at Harvard
and Yale come up with a s a league.

102
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,590
So the top 50 people split
away everything. You've got
a billion and $1 billion.

103
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,090
One Ba ba boom, billion dollars, baby.

104
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,790
I'm gonna give away $1 million every
single day of play. land.com boom.

105
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,650
There it is. It is available in
our first year. It's blowing up.

106
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,820
It's blowing up big town.

107
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,480
We're just about to sign a deal with a
couple of major sports franchises to be

108
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,010
their official game. So, uh, so
that's going really well. Um,

109
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,040
so it's a essentially like a fantasy, a
martial arts thing. Like you just know it.

110
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,880
It's NASCAR, football, MMA.

111
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,750
The beauty of play land is you can set a
play land to anything and like we could

112
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:45,190
set a play land how many times he's
Bisping gonna burb how many times you're

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,050
going to get up and have
a pice of many tangents.

114
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,880
Rock are going to roll his eyes at Mike.
Do you know what I mean?

115
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:53,270
You can set it for anything. So he's
very applicable. Uh, how many times,

116
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,960
how many likes is Kim Kardashian
going to get in a next past?

117
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,630
You know what I mean? So it's um,
yeah, we're getting a lot of traction.

118
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,150
It's doing really, really well.
Very proud of it. I would think

119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,750
if it's $1 billion,

120
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,050
I would think it'd be like some Guy
Ritchie movie where the sum mobsters would

121
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,884
get together with some fighters.

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,310
Yeah. This is how we're going
to do it. See, try and fix
it down three times. Yeah,

123
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,400
I've never heard it.
An English gangs to sound loud.

124
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:20,490
The from like 1920 Chicago she shoes.
This is what we're going to do. We'll see.

125
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,580
But yeah, I guess no is that
hasn't nobody's cheated yet.

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,030
But you know the reason why I say this
totally undermining the system, Joe,

127
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:32,680
really appreciate it. The reason why
I say this is because this happened

128
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,990
then with professional pool,

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,160
professional pool had a line at one point
in time in Vegas casinos and the pool

130
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,750
players all got together and said,
listen,

131
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,990
what's fucking put all our money on this
guy who was at the 10 to one favorite

132
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:45,900
to win it or tend to one underdog
to win it and we'll make money.

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,930
And so they all dumped in this one guy,
I think his name's Mike Lebron.

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,250
He won the whole thing.

135
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,860
The only way he could do that as
if there was no stats now stats.

136
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,510
So if it was game of basketball,

137
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,320
everyone would just have to stand
there and do nothing. Right.

138
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,830
Which I would assume. I mean, I don't
know too much about basketball, but I was,

139
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,820
I was Shem athletic commissions referees.
People getting,

140
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,920
somebody would say something if everyone
was just standing there doing nothing.

141
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,650
Well they did with pool. They can
gamble on porn anymore. Oh really?

142
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,200
Cool players are too shady. Yeah, they do.
They are. They are shady. The shady guys.

143
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,550
Anyone that plays pool in England, it's
because they spend so much time in pubs.

144
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,560
Exactly. He spent so
much time in pubs. Yeah.

145
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,500
Hanging out with some
interesting characters, you know,

146
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,380
unsavory characters. Dude, you,

147
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:37,310
you started at UFC ultimate
fighter season two. How crazy.

148
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,310
Three season three what? What season
to the end now or some shit. Like what?

149
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:46,340
What are they on? I think they
just did 28 28 but that's crazy.

150
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,980
But that's all in the US.
They have to the Brazilian one,

151
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,080
they have the Australian Diego
Sanchez and still fucking going at it.

152
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:56,100
That's what's insane. That's impressive.
Season One. He's a, he's a, God bless

153
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,830
him. You know, good for him. Good for
him. And he fucking one reasonably,

154
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,570
which is impressive. No, I know.

155
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,460
Any fights in a way that isn't
conducive to a long career? No,

156
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,750
but he's had one my word. It's
incredible. It really is. He really,

157
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:09,480
is he warrior such a fucking
character too. Oh Dude.

158
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,410
He's out of his mind in a
good way. I mean, you know,

159
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,450
I mean that's a compliment I do as well.
Yeah. Yeah. No, he's a maniac. But uh,

160
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:20,130
I mean Darcar season one and still
still going strong. I know, I know.

161
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,730
Crazy. Crazy. It's been a long
ride for myself as well, but uh,

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,240
enjoyed it and enjoyed every minute
of it. It was great. Nice to,

163
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,300
nice to leave everyone the title though,
right? Oh, 100%. How Nice is that?

164
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,830
The cap it off because you had
such a long career man. I mean,

165
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,950
you fought the best of the
best and for you to cap it off,

166
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,550
knocking out Luke Rockhold
and then having that, oh,

167
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,310
no one could take that away from you
for now. For sure. You know what I mean?

168
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,690
I was talking about this recently.

169
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,740
I'm filming a documentary called built
for this and it's about my career.

170
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,920
And they were asking about that, you
know, how would you feel? Excuse me.

171
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,940
This carbonating Eddie's drink shall
remain nameless energy drink and a cock

172
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,680
creature or something like that.
Creature Demon. Something lie.

173
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:09,240
That mythological, scary,
scary, scary monster.

174
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,350
There you go. Um, no, no. They
were asking about my fight career.

175
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:18,000
How would I have felt had I
not won the belt? And you know,

176
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:21,480
I mean, it would have felt like
it was unfinished business.

177
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,560
I wouldn't have been quiet as content
is walking away. When I did had a,

178
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,850
had I not won the belt,

179
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,720
other than winning the belt Wa and
winning the ultimate fighter, I'm sure.

180
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,500
But what was your most satisfying
victory? Was it Conley? No, no, no.

181
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,930
I don't know. I'm the most satisfying
victory. My word. Oh, Anderson Silva.

182
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,930
Anderson Silva. Yeah. That was a big one
for me. Yeah, that was a big one too,

183
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:47,700
because of the cheap knee. It was cheap.
It was, she said that it was cheap.

184
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,210
I mean, I'm a giant Anderson
Silva Fan. Yeah, everybody is.

185
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
You don't get any bigger
interest in a feeling than me,

186
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,910
but you didn't have your mouthpiece.
You were pointing to the mouth piece,

187
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,900
you were separated and you took a pause
and he thought the referee was going to

188
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,730
separate you and give
you back your mouthpiece.

189
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,040
And Anderson comes in with the
knee. Well, I know the rules.

190
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,430
There has to be a lull in the action
for the referee to step in, you know,

191
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,700
and I'm backing up and we're
not engaged in blows. To me,

192
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,810
that's a little in the action.

193
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,100
So I take that moment to point down
over here and say my mouthpiece,

194
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,480
and as I'm down there, boom, he throws
a beautiful knee. It was beautiful.

195
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,800
It really was good for him. You know,
I don't hold it against the guy.

196
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,350
It is what, it fucking came
back, eh. It wasn't fucking easy.

197
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll tell you that.
Every part of my will to our continue.

198
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,010
But yeah,
you came back and won the next round.

199
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,290
That was what spectacularly
impressive. What, that's what you said.

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,520
What is the most satisfying? When I had
said that was one of them. Of course,

201
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,610
you know, beating Rockhold and
winning the belt. Nothing tops that.

202
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,830
But the big one too because you came
in on short notice as well. Sure, sure.

203
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,990
But the uh, yeah, the answer
one because of that, you know,

204
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:59,820
it just made the storyline
so much better, you know, to,

205
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:03,550
to fight through that
adversity to, um, you know,

206
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,530
I have to dig deep after winning it on,
you know,

207
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,980
I won the first drop Tim
drops when the second round,

208
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:12,100
third round I was winning then that
happened. So yeah, no, it felt good.

209
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,600
It felt good. Yeah. That was,
uh, I mean that also like to,

210
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:21,490
just to get a victory over that guy
when it all said and done. There's a,

211
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,690
there's some, yeah. Listen, I'm
aware of that. People would say, oh,

212
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:30,280
but you didn't get Anderson in his
prime. Well, maybe it was at his prime,

213
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:32,080
but with the amount of shit that I talked,

214
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,760
I certainly see a devil's in the way for
me to, the waste for recently. You know,

215
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,660
and it's funny because people always say
you don't worry that when you talk shit

216
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:45,661
gone into a fight that you got to
motivate your opponent even more.

217
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,490
And I always used to say, oh
no, don't be stupid. Listen,

218
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,870
they're gonna try and hit you as hard as
they can, but I don't know. And that one,

219
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,280
I think it did motivate Anderson cause
he was certainly not fucking about it and

220
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,570
that one, that's for sure. No you wasn't,

221
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,930
it wasn't like the Anderson in the Derek
Brunson fight, that's for sure. Yeah.

222
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,890
That was a different fight right there
in Brunson and him almost like looked him

223
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:09,550
in an agreement. They didn't fight.
Yeah. It was a weird fight. Yeah.

224
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,700
It's like we're,
Bronson didn't want to risk anything,

225
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:16,060
didn't want to engage with them too,
too quickly or go too hard.

226
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,870
But then you see some of his fights, he
comes at you like a fucking Marauder who?

227
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,780
Derek Pronto. Oh yeah, no, absolutely. Um,

228
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,400
I was talking about this recently with
the Israel ladder Sanya fight and I think

229
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,770
a kind of pissed Israel off
with a couple of my comments.

230
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:34,660
And that wasn't my intention. I
said, excuse me. I said, I'm not,

231
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:38,770
I don't know if I'm completely sold on
Israel yet. And what I meant by that,

232
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:43,771
I didn't mean sold on him being a great
fire because he's clearly a great face.

233
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,880
Clearly world class.

234
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,390
What I meant was sold on him being the
future of the division and being the

235
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:52,950
champion. That's what I meant, because
Brunson never showed up in that fight.

236
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,700
Right. And I mean, they were
the greatest of respect.

237
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:59,650
He was like a deer in the headlights,
you know, who he was intimidated.

238
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,310
It just been knocked out of Jack Era. You
know, I was a little gun shy, you know,

239
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:07,930
and it was a great performance. Israel
did what he needed to do. But as I say,

240
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,710
you know, it takes two to tango and
there was only Israel really fat.

241
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,570
And in that fact, so when I
said those comments, I said, ah,

242
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,810
I'm not entirely sold on that fight.
That's what I meant.

243
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,080
I didn't mean because I don't think he's
well class or excellent fire cause he

244
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:23,020
clearly is.
I just meant not sold on that fight.

245
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,700
Whether or not he's the
future of the division.

246
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,600
Well it's a stacked fucking
division. I mean, look,

247
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,180
you mean you still have your well
Romero at the top of the heap.

248
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,380
I don't know what they're doing with him.
I mean he was supposed to be fighting.

249
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,890
Uh, um, boy cina would, oh yeah,

250
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,170
pal. Acosta. Acosta, but her chine.
Yeah. Who's a fucking monster.

251
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,130
If anybody who's not on steroids
who looks like they're on steroids,

252
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,230
it's him and girl in the mirror.
Wow.

253
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,560
It's not that easy these days
with the siren. But come on.

254
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,360
Some of them are on steroids. Some of
them probably are Joe, but who's on?

255
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,450
Okay.

256
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,440
You're telling me that you don't believe
that Yoel Romero ever took a steroid in

257
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:08,360
his life? I didn't say that.
Okay. I definitely didn't
kill. I think it's possible.

258
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,790
It's totally possible. How's that
fence you're sitting on that I get hit?

259
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,200
It's a tough scenario for you to be it.
No, no, no. See commentary can honest Bro,

260
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,780
I believe that I'll say it and
let's not forget he tested positive.

261
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,643
There was that whole,

262
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,880
anytime somebody says it was a
taint or supplement is bullshit.

263
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,340
You never test the part as a friend.
Never tested positive in my life.

264
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,300
Let me tell you something.

265
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm not a guy that scours the
back of everything I've read.

266
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm a careless motherfucker. I
really am. I wish I wasn't, but I am.

267
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,300
I'll just go through my life doing what
I do. I've been tested a million times.

268
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,740
Never come close. Okay. Some of the
guys, they blow up the lab, you know,

269
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,760
there's no smoke without fire. You
know what I'm saying? I agree with you.

270
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,390
I agree with you. I remembered
there was talk years back, um,

271
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,420
before you saw that there was talk of
certain camps that would hire guys who

272
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:04,091
knew testing and these guys
would orchestrate a program
for these fighters to

273
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:08,870
make sure that they didn't get caught
right. They would figure out ways to,

274
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,270
you know, to taper off but
still keep your gains and,

275
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,690
and make sure that you
didn't test positive at all.

276
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,070
And this was done under the assumption
that everyone else was cheating as well.

277
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,940
And this was for a long time. That was
how a lot of people viewed the sport.

278
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,490
There was guys like you,
Bj Penn,

279
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,640
there was a few guys that you just
knew weren't going to do anything.

280
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,250
There was their word. They said they
were never going to do anything and,

281
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,050
and they never looked
like they did anything.

282
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:36,410
You always maintain the exact same
physique throughout your entire career.

283
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,120
What the thing is, I think where
they started getting a little weird,

284
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,650
and I don't want to bang on about
stowaways too much because that's been a

285
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:50,240
narrative that I've over. Yeah. You know,
I've said my piece about that. Right.

286
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:52,700
I don't want to, you know,
banging on about it too much,

287
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:57,140
but I think where the water's really
got America is when TRT came in,

288
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,020
testosterone replacement
therapy became a thing.

289
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,440
I know you had to do was go to the
doctor and said, hey, you know,

290
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,140
I can't get a hard on or whatever and
all of a sudden they sign you off or u of

291
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,440
t it. No, I know even worse,

292
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,530
you could take steroids first
and then come off of it.

293
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,560
So your testosterone was low.
They'll really go to a doctor and say,

294
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:17,180
I have low testosterone of course.
Yeah.

295
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,420
Because it messes up your
natural production of it.

296
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,740
Took steroids and then went in afterwards
and said they have low testosterone

297
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,350
because they were on steroids short.
Not Exactly.

298
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:30,140
So then it became legal and then you
had all these guys coming out of there

299
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:34,970
saying, you know, if I'm the
on TRT I'll die, I'll die.

300
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,140
And then the outlawed it and then 10 years
later some of them are still fighting

301
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,010
to this day. Yes. You know. So without
naming names, you know who you are.

302
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,840
Shame on you. You talked about
TRT Belcourt to your TV tour.

303
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:50,190
Belfort forever.
I mean that was when

304
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,400
he was on TRT.
He was a different kind of human being.

305
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,720
He was just completely different than
he is in either circumstance. Oh yeah.

306
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,630
Looking back you can say that.
I mean cause when I follow him,

307
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:05,340
I fought him on tit. You find him when
he was at the Super Victoria absolutely.

308
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,200
Look like fucking the incredible hulk.

309
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,430
He had butt muscles on his
fucking eyebrows. Yeah.
Looking back, you can see that,

310
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,460
you know, but, but at the time,
as a fighter, you gotta be,

311
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,520
you can't think like that. You know
what I mean? What are you looking at? Oh

312
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,650
yeah. That doesn't do it justice.
That's supposed to be before and after.

313
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm just recovering from a cold or
the week. I'm a little congested,

314
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:32,520
so keep coughing. The real, the real
key. That's a better one. That's better.

315
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,650
That's way better.
That's much more accurate.

316
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,430
And he's a guy who was known
to take things. I mean,

317
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:42,030
he took things early in his
career. Remember when he
fought Randy when he was 19?

318
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:45,300
He was 240 pounds. Yeah, exactly.

319
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:49,200
His neck start at the top of
his head. Yeah. But Sam, yeah,

320
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:54,090
I remember there was a picture of us
both on the scale in Brazil and, uh,

321
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,910
you know, looking back now a holy
shit, you know, anyone else would,

322
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:01,020
they have seen these guys kind of
big blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

323
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,460
But you're not think like that at
the time. You can't, as a fighter,

324
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,730
if you start having those thoughts,

325
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:09,630
those doubts shut looking at fighters
physique and thinking, oh, he looks good.

326
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,570
You've already lost. You
know. But in hindsight,

327
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,900
you can look back at your holy
fuck, what was I thinking? You know,

328
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:19,260
this guy's fucking birdied out
of his mind. I remember on the,

329
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,410
I was trying to get a rise out of him
and he kept putting his hand in my face.

330
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,580
I'm not a religious guy and, and you know,
God bless anyone that is, you know, I,

331
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,830
I mean that, I respect
everyone's opinions, but I'm not.

332
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:33,831
And as we now veto is heavily religious
and he kept sticking in his thing in my

333
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,030
face. He was pissing me off. So I
said, Peter, come here, come here.

334
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:40,890
And he leans down. I said,
Dooley's no, Jesus, mate.

335
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,960
Maybe there is, maybe there is, you know,

336
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:45,450
me getting their jobs with a
head kick in the second round.

337
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,810
Maybe that was God thwarting
May, who knows? What did he say?

338
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,420
Some fucking Portuguese bullshit.
I don't know.

339
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,720
There's, there is the fine line
though, between target shit and uh,

340
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,720
and backing it up. But
you don't, you, you,

341
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:10,440
you did a great job of pissing people
off in your career. And that is,

342
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:15,030
that plays a factor that whatever you
can do to get just them a little bit out

343
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:18,770
of their comfort zone, a little bit
out of their composure. I, and you,

344
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:22,350
you were really good at that. Yeah. You're
not, you know, I mean, I hate that to be,

345
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:25,920
uh, you know, the first thing that
people say about me, but you know,

346
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,890
what's one, it wasn't a, it
was a thing, you know, it was
what I did. And in my mind,

347
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,970
you know, where I come from,
my background, you know,
if we're going to fight,

348
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,220
then we're going to fight and
then it's all out war, you know?

349
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,150
And until it's all said and done. And if
I can make you doubt yourself, if I can,

350
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,840
you know,
it's like at the wains at the ways,

351
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,490
that's the last time you're going to
get a chance to stand in front of your

352
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:51,790
opponent and send a message to him.
You know what I mean?

353
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,650
And if you get in his face and you can
just instill a little fear, puffy chest,

354
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:59,440
that's why animals do it in the wild.
You know what I mean? Puffy chest out,

355
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,830
look intimidating, look as
angry as you can, you know? And,

356
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:04,960
and some fires might just look
at that and laugh and said,

357
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,260
this ain't going to work on me,
but some it does. And, and then,

358
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,900
and then they don't fight to the best of
their ability because they're slightly

359
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,440
doubting themselves and they're not
fully committed to the punch or the kick.

360
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,720
And if they're not fully committed,
they're not 100%.

361
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,260
They're not fighting as well as they
can be. And I'm winning that battle,

362
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,150
you know?
So yeah,

363
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:24,850
you look like kind of a thug standing
up there and pointing your finger and

364
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,780
talking shit. But it's for a
reason, you know, it works. Yeah.

365
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,390
And those Mcgregor Mcgregor is
the best at it, you know. Yeah.

366
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,880
It gets people to fold.
Look at Dustin Poirier. Yay.

367
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:38,680
Didn't even show up in that first fight.
It's true. Yeah. He, yeah, he, I mean,

368
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,750
don't get me wrong. He was great as well.
You know, it wasn't just the trash dot.

369
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,220
No, he's great as well. I think
the Nate Diaz fight didn't,

370
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,340
it didn't work in that fight. Nate
doesn't give a fuck. Doesn't give a fuck.

371
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,590
There you go. It doesn't work.
Exactly. It doesn't work.

372
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,580
We touch shit at him and he's
like, fuck you. It doesn't, yeah.

373
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:59,050
It doesn't make him feel bad at all.
He, it didn't exactly feel comforting.

374
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,150
Yeah. Well, you know, just another
day at the office, you know, it's a,

375
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:08,170
it's a thing like a lot of people would
wish that fighters were respectful and

376
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:12,190
just, you know, treat it well, the
martial arts way and bow to each other.

377
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,260
And that's great. It is.
You know, it's funny,

378
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:18,940
I was working out this morning and the gym
manager, uh, he said, he said, you know,

379
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,340
actually I feel that that side
of things can have, you know,

380
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,780
it's killing the UFC and I shut
the fuck up. I'm like, you know,

381
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:29,590
I nodded away and like, you
know, respectful to the guy. Um,

382
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,060
but I, I see his point, I
understand what he's saying,

383
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,200
but it's entertainment
and it gets people that,

384
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,650
that's another reason why I used to do it.
You're trying to sell the fight.

385
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,000
You know, you want, you want,

386
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,050
you want every product you're involved
with to be as popular as possible.

387
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,200
Whether it's a podcast, whether it's
fighting, whether it's whatever it is.

388
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,030
If no one's watching,
no one gives a fuck,

389
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,180
then you're not going to make much money.
You're not going to get booked again.

390
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:53,940
You're not going to be on the big cards.
So you talk a little,

391
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,550
I know from a consumer standpoint,
if I'm watching a fight, I mean,

392
00:22:57,551 --> 00:23:00,600
look at that last week with their
fury and wilder, you know, I was,

393
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:05,020
I was eating at the palm of their hands.
It was an amazing fight. But um, you know,

394
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,990
it hypes it. It's great. It's
awesome to watch. I mean, yes,

395
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:11,710
it is beautiful to see two fires walk
up there and bow and shake hands and all

396
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:12,460
the rest of it.

397
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,940
But it's also a little fucking boring
if I'm honest lot when I'm working the

398
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,270
ways yards, I'm like give me something
to talk about please. You know,

399
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,370
cause I don't want to talk
about your boy and last bite,

400
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:24,070
they went to a split decision and we're,
nothing really happened.

401
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,380
But if you get in their
face at the way him, great.

402
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:29,590
We can pump it up a little bit. We can
sell the fight. We can hype it up. Yeah.

403
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:32,950
When they have these press conferences
and no one's being mean at all. I mean,

404
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:37,540
half the funds shit. Yeah, no, absolutely.
Do you know, I'm enjoying myself.

405
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm in my element of
there. It's like, you know,

406
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:44,290
the famous one with GSP when his
IRA, you intoxicate dead. Well,

407
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,150
yeah.
Well Yeah,

408
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,650
I'm in Vegas. Where do you
want me to do? You know,

409
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,450
you don't want to fight until the end
of the year and it's January. Okay.

410
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,110
If we were fighting in two
months, I wouldn't be in
toxic gay did for right now.

411
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,810
I am. You know, so, yeah. Well,

412
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:04,120
there's been some hilarious moments
in press conferences. I mean, the,

413
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,410
the one that giant one with the UFC were,
uh,

414
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,130
Jeremy Stephens out the
Connor fuck is that,

415
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,050
that was hilarious. That was great.
It really was good. It honestly,

416
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:19,200
every time I see that, I do laugh.
It was great. He had to say was,

417
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,630
is that guy?
But I don't know.

418
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,960
But I think he was
actually actually serious.

419
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,180
Is this guy calling me out talking shit?
Or he knows who Jeremy Stevens.

420
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:36,110
Just know. You don't think so? Maybe.
Maybe, maybe. Maybe not. Maybe not.

421
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,470
I don't know everybody up there sometimes
at press conferences. Yeah. You can't.

422
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,830
You know what I mean? Do you have see has
more than 500 fighters on their roster.

423
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,090
Exactly. Especially when they have those
giant press conferences and there's,

424
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,630
yeah. Need levels of design. 16
fires up there. It's impossible.

425
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,093
I like both.

426
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,790
I like when fighters are respectful and
I like when fighters talk shit. Yeah,

427
00:24:55,791 --> 00:25:00,260
for sure. I mean, I did enjoy, it was nice
to see. Yeah. Brian Ortega. Max Holloway.

428
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,150
They had that nice back and
forth where Max, sorry. Pardon
me. Brian was, you know,

429
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:05,661
he's like,
listen,

430
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:08,180
I hope you're well and a hobby or over
the injuries and all that type of thing.

431
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,830
That was nice to seems great,

432
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,710
but they both were exuding
confidence at the same time.

433
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,080
They were both adamant they were going
to win the fight. So it wasn't the,

434
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,930
they weren't being too overly cordio.
Yes. You know, I don't want to see that.

435
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,850
Right, right. I don't want to,

436
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,070
I don't want to see too fast pretending
like they were in church or meeting the

437
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:26,450
fucking president.
Okay.

438
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,910
I want to see two guys that want
to rip each other's heads off.

439
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,060
Call me an animal, call me a bad
parent. Call me whatever you want.

440
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,780
But that's what gets my engine taken.
Well,

441
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:39,830
even when they were at the final weigh
in and they're staring each other down,

442
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,310
like even though it was respectful,
there was a lot of tension.

443
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,320
There's a lot of tension. You, you know,
you're talking about as a way in. Yeah.

444
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,190
I never saw that one when they were at
the way in Maxim Brown, they just stood,

445
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,031
you know,

446
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:55,730
a couple of feet away from each other
staring at each other and it was intense.

447
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,040
It was real. There was a fucking
hell of a fight to ballsy shit.

448
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,720
He's incredible. He really
is. Really is. I mean,

449
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,250
I was kind of um,

450
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,910
not concerned and of course were the
one who initially throw up the red flag

451
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,310
when you saw, you just felt like
he looked too tired or lazy.

452
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:17,900
Slurring his words. He
looked, he looked half asleep.

453
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,210
He looked like he just got out of bed.
That's how we looked.

454
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:24,530
And then he was slurring his words. And
then, so I just said, your care Max,

455
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:28,250
everything good. And he's just like, know.
Yeah, he was slowing it. Simple as that.

456
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:31,820
And I'm like, and of course UFC
tonight you have a production meeting,

457
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,520
we go over the questions,
we're gonna ask.

458
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:35,780
So you've got them questions there
in front of you. And I thought,

459
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,080
I can't stick to these questions. I've got
to ask this guy. Are you okay? You know,

460
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,610
for you. I'm glad you
did that. Well, you know,

461
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,140
I felt bad afterwards because then
I heard that the fire was off.

462
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,030
And then I thought, shit, if
I'd gone on, you know, two days,

463
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:54,030
three days out from a five I got on
fucking UFC tonight, or whatever,

464
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,920
you're doing my obligations as a fire.

465
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,610
And then another fire on the roster
is calling me out for an injury.

466
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,920
And now the fight itself,
I'd have been pissed off with them.

467
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,330
You know what I mean?

468
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,180
Maybe you know that that's my
choice if I want to highlight it.

469
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:08,970
So I felt a little bad, but
I really respect him. Max,

470
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:12,510
he sent me a message thanking
me, you know, he said, thank
you. He said, you know,

471
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,020
he said, uh, I appreciate that I needed
someone to do that because he knew he was,

472
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,010
he wasn't 100%. Um, so yeah, so anyway,

473
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,770
I will say that I wasn't fully
convinced that he was okay.

474
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,970
Cause it seemed like he was not an os
still slow in his words or whatever,

475
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,920
but a mumbler he's a mumbler.
Yeah. So am I, you know, so,

476
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,250
uh, he's, uh, he was fine though.
He was more than fine, dude.

477
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,710
He looked insane.
Insane.

478
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,120
Ortega fired back or
three shots third round,

479
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:45,660
hit him a couple of big shots and then
at the end of the third round he's like,

480
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,380
this is my right. No, I saw him and I
told you. Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy.

481
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:53,760
And Cardio Cardio is incredible
to the roof, you know. Excellent.

482
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:57,030
Footwork combinations could
Sangha as well. Weeds the fight.

483
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,980
That's the main thing. You know what
I mean? He reads the fight, so yeah,

484
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,220
he reads the fine and he's,
he's,

485
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:06,690
he's so good at implementing that
strategy of like consistent pressure,

486
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,000
constant angles,
switching stances.

487
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,340
And he switched his stamps as flawlessly
fights. Just as good south paws.

488
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,620
It does Orthodox and he'll switch in the
middle of a combination and then turn

489
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:20,420
corners on. Absolutely. That's right.
He's not there to be counted. Yeah.

490
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,380
Not An amazing man. Really good. And when
you hit him back you look claps. Yeah,

491
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,080
no for sure. It gets recorded. Alarmists
and he just pointed at the floor.

492
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,410
He's like, come on, let's go right here.
That's that. And then bang it out. Yeah.

493
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,140
He's a wise all soccer. That was
awesome. Really was, you know, it's,

494
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:37,110
it's great to see that he is okay too.

495
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,770
But I'm really happy that you did point
that out because there was some issues

496
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:44,040
and I think a lot of that probably
had to do, I'm just speculating,

497
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,170
but probably had to do with
that massive weight cut.

498
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,700
I mean he was trying to get down really
quickly to one 55 which is crazy. Right.

499
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:52,680
Cause he fights at one 45 is the champion.

500
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,240
And even struggling to go down from him
that he was in the one eighties get down

501
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:59,700
to one 55 quickly to find that it can be.
Yeah,

502
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,100
because they offered it to
him on last minute. Sure.

503
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,130
You know when Tony tore his knee apart,
was that on set with you guys? Well,

504
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,620
you wasn't there. I wasn't there now,
but yeah, it was in studios. Yeah.

505
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,810
What a fucking freak occurrence.
That was crazy.

506
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,420
Trips over some wires blows
his knee apart. What was it?

507
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,720
The fire had been matched three times.
Yeah. And then they're all most of that.

508
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,140
That the finish line doing the final
bit of press. Yeah. It's crazy.

509
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,880
It's insane.
You can such bad luck.

510
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:29,310
It's like those guys are destined to
never fight. Oh, they've got to fight now.

511
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,050
I would if I was the,

512
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,980
if I could wave a wand in any
match I want not division.

513
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,230
That's the one that's the
match. Oh, for sure. Well,

514
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:39,240
it's the fight that has to happen.
You know what I mean?

515
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,010
Tony is, uh, in my, my
still the interim champion.

516
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,140
Knowing your why, the Triptan, it doesn't
make any sense to me. Listen, Tony's,

517
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,890
you know, he's a, he's a,
he's a character, shall we
say. Yeah. He's a character.

518
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:58,090
He's a unique character, but he, in my
mind, he fought for the interim title.

519
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,940
He won the interim title and then he
fucking blew his knee out, you know,

520
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,030
doing press obligations. It didn't
do anything stupid. No, exactly.

521
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:09,640
That's why I didn't understand that they
stripped him and I was like, this guy,

522
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,500
I mean the guy's ready to fight then and
then a few months later he was ready to

523
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:17,310
go again. He beats the shit
out of Pedis. Yeah, no noise.

524
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,520
And he looked incredible jobs kind of
concerned in that fight as well because it

525
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:25,570
was so fast coming knock and I've so
fast and apparently he was doing his own

526
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:29,560
rehab, these wild techniques and you
saw that stuff online that he was doing.

527
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,670
I thought this guy is going
to hurt himself again. But
uh, now he went out there,

528
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:38,230
looked amazing. You didn't even do any
sparring. Oh really? Yeah. Interesting.

529
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,060
I need to find this out for sure for him.

530
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:43,090
But the word I'm getting for people
that know him and said he didn't spar,

531
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,900
he just got an incredible shape and he
said, look, this knee is healing up.

532
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:48,100
It's in the process of healing.

533
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:51,880
And during his camp it was continuing
to heal and they chased him the way he

534
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:55,420
kept that going. I don't do any take
downs. Don't get your knee wrench,

535
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,550
don't get leg kicked. Well spine is the
hardest part of preparing for a fire.

536
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:02,470
Of course, you know. Well and the
wrestling, wrestling, inspiring. They're,

537
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,800
they're the toughest probably
wrestling grantees actually.

538
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:09,100
But find a wrestler doesn't have fucked
up knees. Yeah, my knees are fuck.

539
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,060
Not that I'm arrested far from it,
but my knees are just destroyed.

540
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,290
The stress gets mostly,

541
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,860
well I think I have a torn meniscus on
my good knee right now cause that's not

542
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:22,690
good knee. But my bad knee, um, I
actually GSP the son of a bitch,

543
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:24,120
he caused it back here.

544
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,040
I was training for the ultimate fighter
three final and it was trending with

545
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,690
George and we were training, you know,
zoo for the old Jew for headquarters.

546
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,410
They've done little gym at the
bottom with the boxing ring. Yeah.

547
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,610
We were wrestling in there and then
my knee hit the floor, tore my PCL,

548
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,710
and then just one thing after the
other, you know, that was what,

549
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:45,100
1312 years ago. And it's just
always been kind of fucked. Yeah.

550
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,550
Well actually in here right now,
when we finished out,

551
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:52,090
when I stand a limp like crazy,
because when I sit here like this,

552
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,040
it just seizes up like crazy. So if
I'm in a restaurant, let's stand up.

553
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,200
And I walked like a moron.
If I wanted the bathroom,

554
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:01,120
it was like fucking look at this guy,
Jesus grass.

555
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,010
But then I walked back and I'm walking in,
find the light,

556
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,570
this attention seeking bastard.
Forgot that he put on a fake Linwood.

557
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:11,470
He went to the bathroom. I'm like,
no, it's unseized now. It's okay.

558
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:16,120
It's just when I first stand up.
Yeah. Uh, the popliteal cyst.

559
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,690
I think that's what causing
that right now. So there's
a system there? I think so.

560
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:23,770
Yeah. Well, no, it's rained. Yeah,
no, I know this on my right knee.

561
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,280
I've had them drink twice. Yeah, I've got
to get that done. It's a pain in the ass.

562
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah,
it is.

563
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,970
The last time they just went in there
and just pulverized it went in there and

564
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:34,360
just kept sticking it with
needles. Rarely. Yeah. Yeah.
I've got to get it done.

565
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,450
I've got to get that. I got to get
a lot of shit. Does my neck issue,

566
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,470
remember we talking years
ago in Manchester about
[inaudible] and people didn't

567
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,001
know,

568
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:47,000
but what I mean it was hard for me to
talk about it any more to talk about too

569
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:51,050
much while I was commentating.
Your fights, you had a neck
injury that was so bad.

570
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:54,530
One of your arms was weaker than the
other, like if you were doing bench press.

571
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,720
Oh for sure. Still to this
day. I mean you could,

572
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,490
you could take that Samurai sword.

573
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,480
I don't advise it and stick it through
the skin there and I wouldn't feel a

574
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,200
thing. Well, I don't know if I wouldn't
feel a thing, but I'm totally numb.

575
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,340
Totally in a Maya.

576
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:11,420
I had a shower after my workout before
and now what a gala I get lied to.

577
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,070
It's like a a singer. Yeah. But Dan, the
entire buying side, it was in the shower.

578
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,510
I was there. It's having, the few
times when I've been working on TV,

579
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,990
I was doing this show called hyper drive
for Netflix in the summer and we will,

580
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,260
we will,
we will,

581
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,400
it was night shoots is that four in the
morning and all of a sudden I'm doing

582
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:31,460
this and everyone's like, oh my God.
Oh. I'm like, it's okay. Calm down.

583
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:35,170
They're like medic. I'm like, no, it's
okay. It happens all the time. So yeah,

584
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:39,950
it's just pinched nerve, you know, c five
c six, I gotta get it taken care of. Um,

585
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,010
have you ever done any decompression
or anything like that? Um,

586
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,920
it's all my own fault. You
know, I'm too old school.

587
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,180
I need to go in and have treatment
on my body, but it's like,

588
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,630
it's a whole thing. Joe
Casey, I'm a busy man.

589
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,950
I haven't got an afternoon
to golf sit and you know,

590
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,380
get Masyado decompressed or I need to
do it. I need to do it. And this year,

591
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,110
2019 is a year that I
get all these little,

592
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,530
because my quality of life is still
fine. You know what I mean? I just,

593
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:16,070
I just grin and bear it and whatever
and just occasionally have a mini heart

594
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:19,730
attack, you know, I'll be okay, I'm fine.

595
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,470
But eventually,

596
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,140
this is the year I'm gonna get all
these little niggles taken care of.

597
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,220
Well there's a company in Santa Monica
called lifespan medicine and they do a

598
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:31,760
procedure called Regena keen and that's
what Peyton manning had done over in

599
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:33,350
Germany. Come. Brian had it done.

600
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,290
And this is how I fixed my
bulging disc in my neck. Well,

601
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,310
when I saw you there in Manchester,
Dana tried to send me to Germany. Yes.

602
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,750
And I was telling you, you don't have
to go to Germany. Yeah, yeah, they do.

603
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,850
It's exactly the same procedure. I
didn't go to Germany, go to Durham,

604
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,690
that couldn't be bothered.

605
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,670
I didn't want to go down and spend
a half an hour or half of my day.

606
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:55,340
I don't want to fly to fucking Germany
and giving you a week or whatever.

607
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,490
So not that much time.
It'll take you like a couple hours.

608
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:03,230
You do it three or four times and they
can fix it. Now I know inflammation.

609
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
The other thing is there's a
thing that they sell at Amazon.

610
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:10,040
You just get on an amazon.com or a
bunch of other stores online and it's a

611
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,190
spinal decompression harness.
I've seen it hanging on the door.

612
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,000
Have you seen the thing where you use
their, you pump your hand. That one too.

613
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,250
I thought that's what you were talking
about that. That's a good one too.

614
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,290
I haven't used that one, but I have
friends that have used that one.

615
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,050
They like it a lot. It's
not bad. It's not bad.

616
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:25,550
The one that I use your hang from a door.
It's a little more hardcore.

617
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,450
It's hooked up to this harness. It clips
at the top of the door and you crank it.

618
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,390
Click, click, click, click, click, click,
click, and you're like literally hanging.

619
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,810
You're hanging in there. I was
going to say chair, but it just, Oh,

620
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:38,770
when you get out of, yeah. Good. I'm
going to try and get one of those.

621
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,190
If you do it consistently,
it'll decompress. Rarely
do that. I need to do that.

622
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,390
Yeah, you can do it in your house just
to get up in the morning, you know,

623
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:49,050
have you come, a wife comes and finds me.
Hang on. I couldn't make it to suicide,

624
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:53,970
but that dangling from the fucking
doorframe thanks Joelle won't kill you.

625
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,070
It won't kill it now.
But it's um,

626
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,460
it does mean it does feel good and
it's the only way that I know of,

627
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,930
to really stretch your neck out that
way. Yeah. No, I do need to do that.

628
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:07,560
I try and do it in the sauna. Was it
rustling the, did your yeah, for sure.

629
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,440
For sure. Yeah. In fact, I remember it.

630
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:12,390
I was going for a take down and I
think I ended up headbutting the floor.

631
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,130
A lot of it. What happened, there was
one of the fighters from Alpha Male,

632
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,780
he shot in for a take down. The guy
went for a good team. Uh, and he,

633
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,850
he spiked himself. Right. And then
just never walk. Never walked.

634
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:31,570
He never walked home while came paralyzed.
No Way. Yeah. Cause as he shot, you know,

635
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,180
he went and deep on the armpit,

636
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,600
the guy went for the guillotine so his
head is trapped and all their weights

637
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,100
together, you know, feet up
in the air. The whole deal.
Power, power double. Yeah, no,

638
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:43,700
of course. Yeah. And then you've
got two body weights. Yup.

639
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,240
Go on to head and neck as, as the, uh,
you know, the pressure point if you will.

640
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,620
It Derrick Lewis who has the
funniest Instagram of all
time for sure. Absolutely.

641
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,720
One on yesterday of a girl.
I think she's dead.

642
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,820
She twerked and she twerked standing on
her head and then she twisted her neck

643
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,830
and then her whole body seized up. Stiff
as a board. But I'm glad you would Derek.

644
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,740
Finding funny.
I'm sure this poor woman's families,

645
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,320
I hope she's okay. Yeah. Yeah,
I do. I hope she's okay as well.

646
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,910
But, but you know, if she's not, there's
nothing to do about it now. Well No,

647
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:21,790
the visit now, maybe we want take
the piss out of it. It's got to,

648
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,810
you got to look at Derek's Instagram
on a daily basis because a lot of this

649
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,110
stuff gets taken down.
Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.

650
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,430
I'm surprised he hasn't been banned yet.
You know, he's too popular now a lot.

651
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,040
Derrick, for a while. He's
awesome. He's, he's talking,

652
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,540
you'll get areas he doesn't give a damn.
No. Doesn't care. That's the thing.

653
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,230
I see things. People send me things,
you know, guys from back home,

654
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,920
I got some things this morning, you
know, put the massively offensive right.

655
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,990
You know,
and having a little chuckle in private.

656
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,570
I'm not going to put
that shit on Instagram.

657
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,760
I'm not going to put it for the
whole world to see. What is this?

658
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:57,120
Is it doing a movie or something?
He's doing a movie, I think,

659
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:59,460
but then I think somebody
the other day I said, uh,

660
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,380
when John John's sneezes on.
Yeah, I saw some of that caption.

661
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,120
Oh,
Jon Jones.

662
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,260
He's an interesting character,
huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. For sure.

663
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,160
The big comeback is going to be a
tough fight, man. That's a big fight.

664
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,780
That's a big Gustafson is no joke.
The way that I love the way they,

665
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,110
they size up to the way they
match up against you. See,

666
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,530
maybe that's why John's struggled a
little bit the first time because he's not

667
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:30,690
used to fight in somebody
with the same frame,

668
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,980
the same physical attributes and
make John sold. Great. Alex also.

669
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:35,980
Yes.

670
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,260
And what was his last five?
Was it, uh, to sharer?

671
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,090
I think it was amazing in that fight.
It's handled so fast,

672
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,630
so fast. The combinations he put
together there were beautiful, really,

673
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:50,260
really good. The final Kao was like
a video game sequence. Oh Dude.

674
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,020
It was incredible. It really
was. It really was. I mean,

675
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:56,610
I think in a lot of ways that was like
what we're looking at with Tyson fury and

676
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:57,460
Deontay wilder,

677
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:01,000
like two guys would never fought
anybody that size before the for sure.

678
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,430
Both fighting giants, both fighting is tar
guys. Well, I know you had both guys on,

679
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,210
on the show and a listen to a little bit
of yesterday's with Deontae when I was

680
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:14,230
picking my son up from wrestling.
Um, but when I watched that fight,

681
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,310
I sorry, not when I watched it
prior to the fire happening,

682
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,510
I thought [inaudible] was
going to win. Okay. Um,

683
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,680
even though titans are very, very good
technical box and for such a big man,

684
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:31,600
use a lot of faints and a lot of
misdirection and he's very good. Um,

685
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,490
I thought the answer is
probably going to catch him,

686
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,600
but then when I saw that he weighed
in at 212 pounds, I said, it's over.

687
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,220
There's no way. 212 pounds. It's too much
of a weight disparity. It's, it's insane.

688
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,750
But uh, yeah, still got that
knock out power man. Unbelievable.

689
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,190
Another one when he got into the ring.
Yeah, I heard you saying that to or nine.

690
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,250
Yeah. As a fucking heavyweight. It's
insane. Well, that's what I thought.

691
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,580
I thought this guy is too light.
He's like his twig.

692
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,080
The six foot seven two oh nine
crazy. It's crazy. It really is.

693
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:06,130
I have fucking 12th round Kao or the Kale,
the knockdown.

694
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,320
That was insane. It really was. He's got
like Teddy Atlas said it best. He goes,

695
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,150
he's like fucking sore
with their hammer. But, uh,

696
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,770
I mean all respect and credit to task
and fury. Forget now, fuck. I mean,

697
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,190
I know there was all that talk and
Deontae put it on his Instagram about it.

698
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:27,820
Not actually been 10 seconds
about it being over 10 seconds,

699
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,900
but still it is what it is tied to
be over 10 seconds on the clock.

700
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,010
But the referee,

701
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,570
it's not the fighters job
knowing he's his job to,

702
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:42,250
to monitor. I stopped watching the corner
and say, Hey, breath breath, we're at 10.

703
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:45,490
No, he hasn't said 10 and he
gets up fight still on, you know,

704
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,730
there's no telling that he couldn't
have got up on the actual 10.

705
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,130
He probably could have gone up, but
the actual common tenants, well,

706
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,550
but just the way he got up and
then managed to win the round.

707
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,290
Well that's what really impressed me.

708
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,390
I wasn't the biggest fan of
Tyson fury a few years ago. Uh,

709
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,960
he, he, I don't know, we had some
stupid back and forth on a, uh,

710
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,590
on social media, on Twitter. But, uh,

711
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,780
what was it about [inaudible]
he was saying that some gypsy,

712
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:16,960
John, whoever, he is knocked me out
Saturday night club in Blackburn,

713
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:19,570
but the only problem with
that is a supposedly at the
time when I was living in

714
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:22,330
America. So anyway, so,
so it didn't happen.

715
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:24,520
I've never been knocked out
at a nightclub in my life,

716
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,430
but apparently according
to Tyson it did happen.

717
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:31,300
So I wasn't overly thrilled,

718
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,520
but I've got to say
over the last six months

719
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,040
or even a year, you know, he really,

720
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:41,540
really won me over what he overcame
illusion or that way going through that

721
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,750
depression or a slump,
whatever you want to call it.

722
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:49,600
And then coming back and looking so
good. And then afterwards, you know,

723
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,760
the post fight speech I
thought was beautiful. Um,

724
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,330
donating all of his money to
charity, all of it. It's just insane.

725
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,960
I mean 10 million,
you can't respect that then that,

726
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,820
then you've got a serious problem size.
So,

727
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:04,070
so I applaud the guy and I'm a huge fan.
Yeah.

728
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,840
I respect the shit out of both of them.

729
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,680
And I think that what happened with
you was during his cocaine days,

730
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,920
so was coked up and
drinking like a fucking,

731
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,600
probably probably out of his
mind. He said, yeah, yeah,
exactly. Who Cares? Who Cares?

732
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,890
He went through a dark time.

733
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,760
But you know what's fascinating to me is
that he pulled himself out of it and I

734
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:25,520
just pulled themselves out. But I want
to pull other people out too. Sure. No,

735
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:30,130
absolutely. I, and again, you know,
donating all that harder and money hi.

736
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,870
And you know,
you could have just given a million.

737
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,390
Yeah. And would be, I never would
have thought that was amazing as well.

738
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,760
That would have been a huge PR
stuff. But no, he gave it all. And,

739
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:46,130
and that speaks volumes about the man.
I mean, he even said, I don't need it.

740
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,590
You know, he's a gypsy.
He doesn't need it.

741
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:53,070
He's probably made enough money to retire
already. He's had some big fights. Sure.

742
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,080
And close our fight and, and the,
the rematch will be even bigger. Oh,

743
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:00,590
the rematch can then be
gigantic. The talking about it
somewhere, April, May, June,

744
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:03,840
somewhere around there. Yeah. Yeah.
That's going to be fucking saying. Yeah.

745
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,470
One of the best boxing fights
I've ever seen me as well.

746
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,820
It really was incredible.

747
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:12,850
Like it was it w it looked like titan
was out boxing them and you know,

748
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,130
using a lot of faints,
a lot of movement,

749
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,310
a lot of misdirection and a lot of let
that Herky jerky style then that's what

750
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:21,680
he does.
That's how it confuses people.

751
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,770
But then when he got clipped and
dropped I was like, oh you know,

752
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:27,500
I thought it was going to get caught
with the left talk cause I'm saying cause

753
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:28,540
we were um,

754
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,200
there was the UFC Adelai card on at the
same time and we were at the Fox studios

755
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,070
and when the Fox did outside
the UFC deal with Fox is up,

756
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,130
they switched to Pacific CCO,

757
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,990
PCB Pacific coast boxing of which
Deontay wilder. He's one of their guys.

758
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,430
So in the room where we were watching,
watching the Adelaide card,

759
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,560
they've got the fucking day autopilot.
If Tyson fury fight on,

760
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,590
now I've got to talk about the Adelaide
card in detail and break it down and

761
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:58,424
this and that.

762
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,160
But this is one of the
greatest heavyweight boxing
advise you've ever seen in

763
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:02,870
your life going on and
that screen over there.

764
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:07,820
So I'm like this watch and the doing
this tell us. It was crazy. It was crazy.

765
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,570
Anyway, but as I was
watching it, obviously the,

766
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,640
I was looking for that big right
hand and fury was doing a very,

767
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:17,240
very good job of rolling away from it.
Just a boat in that sharp. And I said,

768
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,900
if he follows that with a left hook,
he's going to catch him.

769
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,420
And eventually that's what happened.
I was exactly what it was.

770
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,890
And as he was going down,
which is even more spectrum,

771
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,410
I think he clipped him with the first one.

772
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:29,720
I clipped him with the right hand and
caught him with a left hook or as he was

773
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:32,070
going down.
And the fact that he

774
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,820
got up after he was flat on his back,
his arms are down.

775
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,080
I think six out of 10 referees would
have stopped that fight right there.

776
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,370
They would have waved it off.

777
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,740
Oh, for sure. Yeah, no, he looked
for a moment. He looked dead. Yeah,

778
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:48,460
he looked out. Yeah. So part of me
didn't look dead. He looked at you,

779
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:51,520
looked knocked out,
it looked unconscious for a few seconds,

780
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,670
and then the lights came back on.
And I know he came.

781
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,690
It's interesting when I did,
when a judge or referee rather,

782
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:00,830
it has a decision to make, whether
or not they decided to stop a fight.

783
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,310
And it's one of the more frustrating
things ever when the referee stops a fight

784
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,690
prematurely.
It's rough.

785
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,680
But then when you look at a fight like
the Donna Stevenson fight this weekend,

786
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,980
and I don't remember how to pronounce the
Russian Gentleman's name, it's with it.

787
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,730
Geez. Yeah. He, the guy who
knocked out, I didn't see this,

788
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:20,720
but they're a is in hospital
and in critical condition
might now, correct. Yes.

789
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:21,320
Yes.

790
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,290
And he's gone undergone brain surgery.
He's got a,

791
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:28,330
apparently he's got bleeding on the
brain. And it was, uh, it was, uh,

792
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,470
it was a good knockout, but it wasn't
particularly, it wasn't insanely. Yeah.

793
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,850
Yeah. So when you look to that, you didn't
think this guy's going to have issues.

794
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,730
Yeah.
See he sat up,

795
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,030
he got up there like he looks like
he's okay and it looked like, you know,

796
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,920
that's the problem with boxing, you
know, um, I think what, what is it,

797
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:52,180
12 to 15 deaths per year in boxing
around the world? It's a very,

798
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:56,590
very sad stat, I guess. You know, I mean,
you involved with the UFC, you know,

799
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:59,980
all the, the pro ever May, um,

800
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,130
dialogue that's put out there.
You know what?

801
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:05,500
Boxing is more dangerous because he's
only punches to the head and they can take

802
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:10,260
more blogs. But that is the thing and get
it is true blow. It is, it is true. Yeah.

803
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,650
For sure. The slightly bigger gloves,
you take more shots, which has,

804
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,260
you know what, that's the
argument get effect on the brain.

805
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,610
American football versus rugby as well.
Rugby's a better, safer sport. Yeah.

806
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:25,690
Which is crazy because there's no pads,
no helmets, no nothing. Right. But yeah,

807
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,350
but it's a better state of my
favorite ones. Have a dad in rugby.

808
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,820
It's not something that I hear about. It's
not a narrative. I'm sure if someone's,

809
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,620
probably not for sure exactly what sport,
but I don't think it's a thing. No,

810
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,900
but unfortunately, I mean you
see, I mean the poor guys,

811
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,580
you see kids at high school,

812
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,800
there was one on the news I
think a couple of years ago,

813
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,430
close to where I live down here. And uh,
yeah, heartbreaking. I would never let,

814
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:46,530
yeah,

815
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,440
my kids play football. My kids
wanted to find, I'd say, look,

816
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:51,900
you're going to learn how
to fight correctly, but if
you want to play football,

817
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:52,440
get the fuck.

818
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,100
Got It. Yeah. It's just too many
guys running at you. Full clip,

819
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,580
clash and helmet to helmet. Well that's
the thing because the young kids,

820
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,700
the young kids and you know,
I remember when I was that age,

821
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,730
you think you're invincible.

822
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:08,850
So part of me you where you think you're
invincible and certainly then you put

823
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:12,600
on this giant helmet and you think you
can just charge him with your head.

824
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,860
You know what I mean? And unfortunately
that isn't the case. We've

825
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,150
gone over some of the most
recent statistics that
they've released on CTE would

826
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:24,570
football players and they're talking
about from pop Warner to high school to

827
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:28,020
college to professional the
number like across the board,

828
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,070
the number that exhibits CT symptoms

829
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,330
is staggering. Right. It's, you can only
imagine the vast majority I'm sure it is.

830
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,290
It's crazy to fucking nutty sport.
Rugby's better.

831
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,250
It's a better sport and it's a better
sport. Why? In terms of, it's a bit,

832
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:43,550
it's up to me.
I

833
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,280
playbook bay. I used to love rugby. I was,

834
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,700
I was a pretty good rugby player
when I was younger. But uh,

835
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,760
it seems surprising to hear that
from an American and you know,

836
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,930
I don't watch football
have an America and Joe,

837
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,620
you know who the big American flag
behind you and you got the fucking,

838
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,200
what are those?
What is that?

839
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,520
That's what we'll do at
least know that is a,

840
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,120
an Asian water buffalo from [inaudible].

841
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:08,940
My next guest is it the will to visa
the Asian Water Buffalo. That's from me.

842
00:48:08,941 --> 00:48:13,380
Good mate. Adam Green Tree. Ah, who shot
that sucker and brought it over for me.

843
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:17,610
Nice, nice decoration. But that's
an invasive species in Australia.

844
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:20,490
They shoot them out of helicopters. Oh
really? They have to kill him. There's,

845
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,440
they don't have any,
any other than crocodiles,

846
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,300
but there's no Jeremy till flesh on it.

847
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,810
But if that thing had meat in flesh
and bones, so much brilliant. Got me.

848
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:31,410
I Shit my pants walking gigantic.
The size of those are horns, man.

849
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,940
And it's a huge animal. Oh, knocking on
the imagine. Yeah, I was. Yeah. Cows.

850
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,030
They're gigantic. Well, they have
cows over there that are wild.

851
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,830
They're called Scrub Bulls.
Right.

852
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,610
But you know how like we see a Rodeo
rider rides a bowl and the bulls like get

853
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:46,110
the crazy.

854
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,410
Well that's because they've
got testosterone and giant
balls and they're fucking

855
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:51,810
super aggressive.
You never see a bowl in the wild.

856
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,400
I used to work at slaughter house.
I used to smart 500 cows a day.

857
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,850
The size of those fucking bowls
will scare you to death hammers.

858
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,480
I wasn't looking at the Cox. I know
that. I'm saying that their balls,

859
00:49:05,481 --> 00:49:08,630
they're like, oh yeah,
yeah, no, no. When I was 16,

860
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,870
now that I've come from a
small town and one of the, uh,

861
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,260
the local employers is there,
the slaughterhouse and anyone,

862
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,990
any young loser like myself has done a
stint at the slaughter house when they

863
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,040
need a job,
you know?

864
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:23,930
And I went in and I was squeegeeing
mopping blood into the drains.

865
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,950
I was like, what the fuck is this? So
I said to the forum and I said, listen,

866
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:30,740
I could be of more use to you than
this. He said, let me think about it.

867
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,000
So when I've hammer break, I'm a bacon
sandwich. Came back and he's like, Yep,

868
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,490
you're right. You're a good kid.
I'm going to make you an apprentice.

869
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:40,820
Slaughterman I was like, holy fuck,
that's not what I was looking for.

870
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,170
And talk about shocking.
Oh,

871
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:48,320
I'd never seen anything like it
in my life. It was insane. Insane.

872
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:53,180
And I'm offending all the vegans and
animal lovers am an animal lover big time,

873
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:54,070
you know? But, uh, it,

874
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,770
you've got to make ends meet when you
were a kid living in a small town. Yeah.

875
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,330
Yeah. So how'd you swaddle
them? Well, the, the, the,

876
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:03,620
the line up single file.

877
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,590
And eventually they come into like a
little cubicle like this and you're

878
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:10,850
standing above them and as they come
in, you push a button, door drops down,

879
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,180
and they're in this confined
environment like a big rectangle,

880
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:17,390
like a big cubicle, and you're
raised up and you have this bell.

881
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,590
You touched her head and then to knock
it on the head, that shoots a bolt,

882
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,950
falls down and falls into the wall.

883
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,190
Then you push a button and the
slides up and the cow rolls down.

884
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,380
So you went down the statue
and as you ruining down,

885
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:34,790
you grab what's called a puffin road.

886
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:40,180
It's like a eight foot long flexible
piece of plastic and he's in sterilized

887
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:45,170
liquid. You pull that out as you run
down. Then you put your light neon belly,

888
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,080
you put your knee on the,
uh, the head of the cow,

889
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,570
you feel for the hole you
just made in the hair.

890
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,540
Then you get the end of the piff him Rod.
He push it into the hole,

891
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,770
he feed it all the way in until
it's all the way into this.

892
00:50:56,771 --> 00:51:01,370
About this much at the top
of the headlines Arrive
by eight foot, eight foot,

893
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:03,950
and you feed it all the way cause he
goes down the spinal column. So you're,

894
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,190
you're, you're killing all that. You
killing all the nerve endings. Wow.

895
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,730
Eyes are popping out of his head to
things fucking kicking like a maniac.

896
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,910
You've got your knee on it.
Then you pull that out,

897
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,350
put it back in the sterilized thing. You
get a chain, put it around the rear foot,

898
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,600
push a button. It's strange. You don't
pull out your knife here to here. It

899
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,690
guts elevator doors like the
shining blood everywhere. Does it.

900
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,460
Next one run back upstairs. Netscout's
goal and if you're not quitting and I go,

901
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,270
mother Fucker, let's
go. Come on. 500 a day.

902
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,600
I was such a person has such a little bit,
I couldn't do it.

903
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:43,010
I'm going to fuck this. Fuck this. I'm
going to have nightmares when I go home.

904
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,250
I did it for about two weeks and I'm like,
yeah, I'm out. I'm out. See you buddy.

905
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,070
Too. Disturbing way to
disturb him and, and,

906
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,910
and the people that work there a
little disturbed as well, you know,

907
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,030
going imagine you'd get a little twisted
a couple of years in job. I mean,

908
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,980
I think they were fucking with me
cause I was a kid. Right. You know,

909
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,150
because obviously from there
then they get, you know,

910
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,140
the chance odd in half and they
start looking like meat, you know,

911
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:09,020
they'd go up and they take it back. Yeah.
Ticket by Mike. It's an acquired taste,

912
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,970
you know, and it would
eat it, raw it dead.

913
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:13,430
They were just doing it to fuck with
me, you know, you know what I mean?

914
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,170
Little 16 year old kid wet
behind the ears. But uh, yeah,

915
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:20,450
I didn't know that was
stuck of rod through this,

916
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:25,370
the whole in the brain all the way
through the spot. It's pretty shocking.

917
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,760
You know, I've never even heard of
something like that. Yeah. Pythian Rod,

918
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:29,990
that's what you call.
Wow.

919
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,440
I wonder if that's standard practice
still today because I never,

920
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,850
I've never seen it. I've seen some
awful Peter slaughterhouse. Yeah, yeah.

921
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,120
But they died quick. It was
weird. Instantly it very,

922
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,100
very quick. Yeah. And you get through
enough in one day, I couldn't do it.

923
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:50,480
Now there's no way I could do it
now as when you're young, you know,

924
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,000
you morals change as you get older,

925
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:56,540
your feelings or your values
change couldn't do it would,

926
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,860
if that was the only source of meat,
it was mild sauce, salsa and you meat,

927
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:04,310
then the mother fuckers, Dane. You know
what I mean? Yeah. But I'm not a a,

928
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,350
I know you're a big hunting
guy. I'm not a bit, well,

929
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,640
I've never been hunted in my life,

930
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:11,600
but if you're gonna eat it to live and
then then, then good for you. Of course.

931
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,110
You know, it serves a purpose. Yeah. Well,

932
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,300
I became a hundred because of
those videos. Which videos?

933
00:53:17,301 --> 00:53:20,420
So it was Peter videos of
slaughterhouses. Oh really? Yeah.

934
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,460
Now I want to have any part
of that. I know we're well,
exactly. And I know, and I,

935
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:26,070
I respect that. I do. I'm

936
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,000
not so much into their, well, I detest
it. Trophy hunting and things like that,

937
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,330
you know, I know that's a no, no,
I'm not into it either. I mean,

938
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,420
I really don't understand
the desire to hunt something.

939
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,240
You're not interested in eating
[inaudible] rich businessmen flying out to

940
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,860
Africa and you know,

941
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:48,861
shooting a majestic base or an
elephant or a lion from a distance.

942
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,300
There's no water in that. There's no honor
in shooting Elian even from close up.

943
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,480
But from desk is hiding in the
bushes and pulling a fucking trigger.

944
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,180
Anything that makes you a
man, even though, you know,

945
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,070
the only way that makes sense to me is
if you're in a part of Africa where lions

946
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:08,520
are consistently killing your livestock
and you have to protect your livestock,

947
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,260
which is yet Colorado.

948
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:14,040
There's a big issue with mountain lions
and Sean and a lot of it, Wyoming,

949
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,380
there's a lot of places that have hunting
seasons on mountain lions. Absolutely.

950
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:21,570
Yeah. I wouldn't say there's a hard and
fast rules for everything in different

951
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:25,590
environments, different situations than
you need, you know, a different approach,

952
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,201
you know?
Well,

953
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:29,940
you know that Cecil the lion thing and
that whole story that went down and you

954
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:33,300
know what happened? I, uh, I'm pretty, if
you remind me, I think I know about it.

955
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,830
I remember hearing something about it.

956
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:39,890
A famous majestic lion that was in this
park and the lion left the park and went

957
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:42,060
into this area where it's
legal for them to hunt.

958
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,120
And a hunter who was a dentist
from America shot this lion,

959
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:47,620
right?

960
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:52,410
And everyone became very mad at this
guy because the line had a collar on it,

961
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,780
which meant that there was a
line that they were tracking.

962
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,140
Because the thing is that they can't see
the collar when they're trying to shoot

963
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,490
it.
They have this giant Maine,

964
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,730
there's no way you're gonna see this
dentist from somewhere in America.

965
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,050
So he's a fucking asshole

966
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:10,800
in my territory where I'm allowed
to shoot. All right. Gray area,

967
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,520
I guess.

968
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,120
But the fact that you're flying out to
fucking Africa to shoot majestic base for

969
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:17,670
me,
that that's a weak excuse.

970
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,490
It is it from a guy that you just
fucking kill five of cows a deck.

971
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,330
Here's where it's fucked up for a week.
And I was an apprentice.

972
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:27,780
I didn't really do it very often when
the very nice flash hit in all these

973
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,110
people were furious at that guy and
then no one wanted to go over there and

974
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:33,840
hotlines. So because no one wanted
to go over there and hunt lions,

975
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:36,900
the lion population exploded when
the lion population exploded.

976
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:39,090
The undulate population or the,
you know,

977
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:41,880
antelope and all those and
yet have dropped radically.

978
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,880
She saw the wildlife biologists made an
assessment that they had to kill some

979
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:46,560
lions so they killed,

980
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,700
I think they wound up killing 200
lions and just dumping their bodies.

981
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:55,170
Whereas for the money would
have gone for those 200 lines,

982
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,680
they would have gotten $50,000 for
each line of a hunter had taken them.

983
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,770
And then what they've done,
they take that money,

984
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:04,890
they pour it back into conservation. It's
a very messy business. Sure, absolutely.

985
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,760
You know, and then there you go. There
is the, the the argument for it. Yeah,

986
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:10,300
but it's a tricky argument to eight.

987
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:13,620
It is a tricky argument because I don't
have the answers and I'm not educated

988
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:18,621
enough to really sit here and debate or
really cast any kind of opinion on any

989
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:22,950
one really. I just shooting an animal
from a distance. I'm not a fan of.

990
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,880
That's about it from a distance.
You kind of have to, yeah, no,

991
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:31,840
for sure. I can force you to elk up
close. That's a real problem. Oh yeah. No,

992
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:34,880
actually you gonna shoot first and I'm
not talking about you going out and, uh,

993
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:37,810
I've, I've seen your videos on your
barbecue. It looks fucking delicious.

994
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,360
You should try it. I'm sure it's
great. I'm sure it's awesome.

995
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,440
I have no issue with that. I have you. So
please. I would love to eat it. You Go.

996
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:48,100
Holy Shit. I'm sure I would. Doesn't taste
like anything else, man. I love meat.

997
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:53,410
I'm a carnivore for sure. Um, but yeah,

998
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,310
yeah, no, you're right. Look,
it's the argument for it.

999
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,880
You can make the same argument for people.
Hey, we'll keep these people healthy.

1000
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,500
We just kill a couple
of, well, there you go.

1001
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:06,400
Exactly how you have these really
rich people come over from Germany.

1002
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,980
They spend $100,000 no
kill a few poor people,

1003
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:10,270
and that the rest of the poor people,

1004
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:13,210
they're going to get all this money
and there'll be more houses for them.

1005
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:15,850
All right now there, visit enough
accommodation for everybody to live in.

1006
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:17,350
Let's just slow,
let's just call,

1007
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,600
which is 2000 let them loose in the hills
and we'll chase him with bows and just

1008
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:24,940
kill a few of these people. It's tricky,
you know, it's not good. It's not.

1009
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,690
It's the kill some of the rapists
and murderers coming over the border,

1010
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,620
job solved,
and then the other,

1011
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:31,510
the other problem is even
the animals that make sense.

1012
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:34,050
I don't think there's rapists
and murderers coming off
the bottom was probably,

1013
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,230
let's be honest, most of them were
just poor folks and want a better, oh,

1014
00:57:40,231 --> 00:57:44,490
for sure. Yeah, no shame on that.
You're an immigrant. My family, I mean,

1015
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,170
we're all proud product of
immigrants and so 100 but yeah,

1016
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:51,280
of course you native American,
he's probably shut the
fuck up 100% there you go.

1017
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,720
Yeah. No, that's totally fair. Yeah, no,
I know. That's the funny thing. I'm like,

1018
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,570
really fucking show me a third
generation American in this country.

1019
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,290
Did the hard to come across.
They are,

1020
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:07,350
you know everybody I meet out here claims
to be English when I made them out.

1021
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,830
Have my mom, my fucking Auntie's English
or Irish or they'll claim to be out.

1022
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:16,150
You guys love to claim an Irish descent.
Really? Oh yeah. Is this recent?

1023
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,700
This is because of Conor McGregor.
You guys fucking love. Declare my,

1024
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,750
my mom's Irish. My mom
has an Irish accent. Okay.

1025
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,620
She fucking talks like desk maker.
She's Avish as the car.

1026
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,490
I've never once claimed to be Irish. There
you go. I use what I say to everybody.

1027
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,340
They're like, oh yeah, I'm
Swiss. I'm Italian. I'm this.

1028
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,690
Does anybody in your immediate
family talk with an Italian accent?

1029
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:42,520
Now we'll shut the fuck up because
you're American. Okay. And that's okay.

1030
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,080
That's okay. Be Proud of that.
Yeah, you're not English.
Just cause you great. Great,

1031
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:51,740
great, great grandmother grew up in
Ipswich or Gloucester or somewhere.

1032
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,630
Does it make you, you
English love? So your kids,

1033
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,970
your kids' kids will be
American. Oh yeah. Well, yeah,

1034
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,530
we got green cards recently, so
yeah. Oh yeah. They will be. Yeah.

1035
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,230
How does that work?
You have to mind your p's and q's.

1036
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:09,410
If you get in trouble over
here, they ship you back. Um,

1037
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,590
I guess that's tricky, right? That's
one good thing about what I'm, okay.

1038
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,440
You know, 20 years ago it would have been
an issue, but these days I'm a fireman.

1039
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,770
I'm a gentleman and I'm going to find
gentleman, Jack, come on. Businessman,

1040
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,510
a commentator.
God cast.

1041
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,410
You're doing movies the place. Yeah. I
forget what. They don't have to worry.

1042
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:32,960
We're not, we're not hanging out in
bars getting knocked out by Gypsies.

1043
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,480
They were the old days. You aren't
getting into the movie business, right?

1044
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:39,380
You've been doing a few movies.

1045
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,320
Why aren't you doing a movie during the
time you were doing the Rockhold fight?

1046
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:46,160
That's right. Yeah. I was
filming triple X. Yeah. Yeah.

1047
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:51,161
I've been out there for about three months
and then I was flying home and I was

1048
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,450
looking for some walkie talkies
for my seven year old. Uh,

1049
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,330
I don't know why I thought
that'd be a good idea.

1050
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,970
It turns out getting hold of walkie
talkies isn't very easy these days.

1051
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,830
I've went on a fucking wild goose chase
trying to get these fucking walkie

1052
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,340
talkies that didn't even get played
with. He was like, yeah, cool.

1053
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:09,080
I've got a phone dad. I like, yeah,
I should've thought of that. But um,

1054
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,000
and as I'm looking for them,
I check Twitter,

1055
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:14,510
I've got a coffee and a see Chris
Weidman and pulled out. So yeah,

1056
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,560
it takes Dane and I said, listen, if this
is true, you know, you know where I am.

1057
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,740
And he was like, oh great, we love that,
you know, blah blah blah blah blah.

1058
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,180
But Jack Arrays our first option.
So I thought for a minute there,

1059
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:27,740
I thought I was getting a
title shot and I thought,

1060
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,540
there's no way Jackie is
going to turn it down.

1061
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:34,610
So I went to my buddy's Jason's house
and watched the basketball game and I had

1062
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:38,540
a few drinks and you know, it didn't
party as such. I was on set the next day,

1063
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,990
but had a few drinks. Now, if I knew I was
fighting for a world belt in two weeks,

1064
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,090
you know,
I would have been on a strict diet,

1065
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,060
not overindulging but I
definitely over indulged.

1066
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,540
And then the next day and walking
into the gym, just have, you know,

1067
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:54,500
just a little light workout and my phone
starts exploding lighting up like a

1068
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:58,130
Christmas tree and like what the hell?
And then our aerial Hawaiian, he calls me,

1069
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,610
is that Mike Dana just announced a sports
center that you're fighting for the

1070
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:04,530
belt.
What the fuck?

1071
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:09,620
I was the first day I heard about it. I
look fucking Dana, we all, God bless him.

1072
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:13,650
So, um, that whole shit. So I'm panicking
like crazy. How much did you work?

1073
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:17,870
So that's the first thing I did. I ran
into the changing of, got on the scale.

1074
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:21,860
I was like two 15, two 16 cause
that rough. Yeah, for sure. Yeah,

1075
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:25,040
I like to do like a week
before I like to be 200 pounds.

1076
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,770
So this is two weeks before and um,

1077
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:31,550
I'm 215 so my shit screwed
the weights and need to run.

1078
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,350
So I just run out at the gym,

1079
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:37,460
throw my backpack on my shoulders and
just of sprinting through Toronto city

1080
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,520
center, like a mad man. Of course
there's traffic lights every 30 seconds.

1081
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,040
So I don't want to stop at the
traffic lights cause that's no good.

1082
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,030
So I'm just running out,

1083
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:47,720
nearly getting one over by taxis and
jumping over homeless people falling over,

1084
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,310
ducking and dive. And it was great
training. And um, and then Dana called,

1085
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:55,760
who's I'm negotiating, you know, the
Fi whilst running through Toronto.

1086
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:00,300
And then, uh, carried on going and then
I end up laying in the middle of nowhere.

1087
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,730
I just running and running and running.

1088
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,620
And then Jason Parillo gets
on the phone and uh, you know,

1089
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,330
all the doubt starts creeping in. I
start thinking, Jesus Christ is salt.

1090
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:14,450
Typical of my career, I've wanted a
towel fight my whole career. You know,

1091
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,760
I've been through many ups
and downs and now here I am.

1092
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:20,670
I get the towel fights on two weeks.
Notice I'd be filming a God damn movie.

1093
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,110
I've been near a gym,

1094
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,190
MMA gym for a while doing anything unless
against somebody that's already beaten

1095
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:29,670
me. So I'm kind of destined to
fail this soft fucking typical.

1096
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:33,270
And then Jason got on the phone and
you know, he talks to round big time.

1097
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:36,510
You know, I said a lot of very positive
things. Jason's an amazing coach.

1098
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:39,390
Absolutely is incredible. It
really is. There's a lot of,

1099
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,800
it was a lot of trainers out there.
Uh, there's a lot of pad men. You know,

1100
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:47,210
there's a lot of fakers in mixed martial
arts. Certainly these days. You know,

1101
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:52,240
I mean guys that really have true heritage
in martial arts or any kind of steep

1102
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:56,730
history in combat sports, they're few
and far between. You know, you can train,

1103
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:02,140
any guy can watch a video and
it's a little bit of coordination,

1104
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,920
how to hold pads and you see them.
It's all the crazy, isn't it?

1105
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:09,870
These days in pads to get fit, you
know, one, two left talk, Woo. You know,

1106
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,450
just cause you can do that
and hold it doesn't make you,

1107
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:16,020
a coach does not make you a coach.
And there's a lot of fakers out there,

1108
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:17,730
but Jason is not one of them.

1109
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,180
He speaks from the heart and he knows
what the fuck he's talking about.

1110
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:25,140
And we had a good chat and by the end
of it I was, I was feeling a lot better.

1111
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:29,610
And uh, yeah. So when you were filming
that movie, were you working out at all?

1112
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:34,290
I was doing vanity workouts.

1113
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,900
I like to run certainly
when I'm in a city.

1114
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,580
So I was running probably three or
four days a week of 4.2 mile run. Yeah.

1115
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:45,870
Yes. So as I was running and I was lifting
weights a few times a week, you know,

1116
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,190
biceps and shoulders, you know what
I mean? Yeah. The chest, press luck,

1117
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,820
lots of jazz press, you know
what I mean? Uh, and then, um,

1118
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:58,020
GSPs coach Jorge Blanco. Do you know
Jorge? No, I don't. It's very, very,

1119
01:03:58,021 --> 01:04:02,220
very good trainer. I'm Rashad Evans
put me onto him whilst I was up there.

1120
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,920
I went to see him like two or three
times, you know, uh, but no, not,

1121
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,130
not training as such, but uh, yeah,
all worked out. But it exercise.

1122
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:12,660
But sometimes that's good anyway.
Right?

1123
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:15,150
So it gives your body a chance to recover.
Well,

1124
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:18,780
that's what I said afterwards because I
went into that fight feeling so strong,

1125
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,320
feeling so good.
I'm like,

1126
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,170
cause I consistently have a trend every
single fight in my career apart from

1127
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:29,190
that one. Uh, and I said, oh, I'll
learn from this. I'll learn from this.

1128
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:33,450
And you don't, and it's like
Jason Parillo always says, um,

1129
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:39,160
it takes confidence to take a day
off to rest the body, you know?

1130
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:43,560
And now of course there's a fine line
between having the confidence to take a

1131
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,380
day off and being a lazy bastard and said,
I'm going to sit on the couch today.

1132
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:48,990
You know? But if you could,
if you know, listen, I'm good.

1133
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:52,350
I'm going to take a day or two
off cause I need it, you know?

1134
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,110
So that was one of the
mistakes I made with my career.

1135
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:58,110
I always trained too much in Jason said,
you know,

1136
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:02,280
I used to mind fuck myself because
it meant so much to me. You know,

1137
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,920
my fight career meant so much to me.
I used to overcomplicate it over analyze,

1138
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:11,420
you overwork it, stress myself out
with it, you know, and uh, that,

1139
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,080
that was hindering my performances.
You know, I never once fought to the,

1140
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:19,480
to my ability of, I performed
in the gym, never once. Uh,

1141
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:23,770
I remember one day I pulled up outside
Ruca and Jason was waiting for me outside

1142
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,730
and I pulled up and he says, Mike, come
in and cut me. Have a quick chat. I said,

1143
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:32,170
yeah, what's up? He said, listen buddy,
you go guys in there. Okay. He said,

1144
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:34,120
but you're a fucking world champion.

1145
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,560
Can you go in there and spar these
guys and act like a world champion?

1146
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:43,940
They're here. You're up there,
act like it. Don't go in,
lose your fucking tempest.

1147
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:47,230
Spazz out. Stress out at like
a dig. Say things you regret.

1148
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,280
You know when the spine is not quite
necessarily going your way, you have,

1149
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,710
you know, you get a little
pissed off or whatever, you know,

1150
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,980
say Jiu Jitsu coaches catching you and
tapping you out a little bit and you

1151
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:59,860
start getting a little frustrated.
He said, can you just, you know,

1152
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:04,940
how can we have none of that place and
great advice. Just like when I, uh,

1153
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:07,750
I was fighting for the belt when
I flew home from doing that movie,

1154
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,850
I went straight to the gym when I
landed. And, uh, Jason said to me,

1155
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:16,120
cause I was always stressed, you
know, and he said, listen, um,

1156
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,930
we don't know if you're going to win this
fight, Mac. You know, fingers crossed,

1157
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,830
I believe in you.
I believe you're gonna win this fight,

1158
01:06:21,831 --> 01:06:23,500
but we don't know if you're
going to win this fight.

1159
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:28,270
So this might be the only time you're
ever going to fight for a world title.

1160
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,740
Right. I said, well, yeah, but he said,
well, let's enjoy the process. You know,

1161
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:37,330
let's go through this with a smile on
your face. He said, this is huge. He said,

1162
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:39,600
you're in a position that
everyone would kill to be in.

1163
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:42,610
You're fighting for the championship,
you're find for the belt.

1164
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,900
You've wanted this whole, this your
whole life, enjoy this. You know,

1165
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:50,680
and it was such amazing advice cause
I was like, yeah, you're right.

1166
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,020
And I went through the whole thing
and the big smile on my face,

1167
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:57,160
new clip. Rockhold I
remember thinking, Holy Shit,

1168
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:02,170
when I see rock holds legs buckle and I
see him stagger backwards. I was like,

1169
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:04,360
Holy Shit.
He got him.

1170
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:08,410
And then when he stumbling as the cage
and you bashed him and stopped him,

1171
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,660
I'm going to help but laugh because
you know it does bring a smile to her.

1172
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:17,030
Almost like I couldn't believe it. It was
like a, like a movie. It was like, it was,

1173
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,790
it was one of those things because you
were a big underdog coming third fight.

1174
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,390
Everybody know you took
it on short notice.

1175
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:25,310
Everybody knew that you were working on
a movie and so for you to land that when

1176
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,680
you landed that left hand,
you missed it once before too.

1177
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:31,460
And I remember thinking like, man,
that is fucking close. That's close.

1178
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:34,480
Like you saw this opening
for that left hand and you,

1179
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:38,030
you clipped him over the top of the
shoulder. It didn't see it. Common Bang.

1180
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:41,930
You drop that left hand on his chin and
you see like his eyes rolled back and

1181
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:42,764
his legs give out

1182
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,490
black man. Well that was the whole
plan, the left Hook, you know,

1183
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:50,330
Jason and seeing that it was open for
that and I'd seen it was open for that and

1184
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:54,830
he was even doing this exercise on
these bands are like a resistance bands,

1185
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:57,320
whatever it was doing this
and his chin was open,

1186
01:07:57,321 --> 01:08:00,130
his right hand was down at the end of it.
And Jason said he's,

1187
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:04,370
he's Julian needs moves
here and he's finishing here
that left hook all day long.

1188
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,050
And um,
you know,

1189
01:08:06,051 --> 01:08:09,500
he's coming forward and we're exchanging
punches and nothing really significant

1190
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:13,250
as Landon. And I just ran up to the
battery, just whipped the left talk.

1191
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:16,900
And you know, as a, when you,
when you land a good shot, you,

1192
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:20,360
cause you get the feedback on your fist,
there's nothing like it.

1193
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:22,370
You know what I mean? When,
when you, when you feel that,

1194
01:08:22,371 --> 01:08:25,580
that solid connection and the knuckles
got through the glove, you know,

1195
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:29,540
and you feel it, you're like,
oh, that was a good one.

1196
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:33,590
And then he falls down on that holy shit
all around and then he gets back up on

1197
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:36,850
that, fuck you bomb
back down. And then, uh,

1198
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:41,270
he went down and obviously he's got
very good Jujitsu and he was kind of sat

1199
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,470
back against the fence and I thought,

1200
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:46,190
I've got to be careful not to go in his
guard, but uh, yeah, I got the finish.

1201
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:51,191
Felt the best feeling I've ever felt in
my life was big John Mccarthy's gigantic

1202
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:56,090
forearm, nearly pulling my head off my
shoulders as he wrestled me off him.

1203
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,520
But he knew it was over because
I knew it was over. It was great.

1204
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:00,510
What did that feel like
when you knew you did it?

1205
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:06,950
One of the best feelings in the world?
One of the best, because you know,

1206
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:10,070
for me, you know, the
amount of fights I've had,

1207
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:12,720
this unbelievable professionally
and unprofessionally, you know,

1208
01:09:12,721 --> 01:09:16,850
and when I was a kid,
that's all I was, you know,

1209
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:20,990
that that was my only identity has been
a fire. You know, I'm just being that,

1210
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,910
that guy, you know, unfortunately rightly
or wrongly works wrongly, wrongly,

1211
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:29,150
you know, of course it is.
You know, I was, I was a
fucking idiot when I was a kid.

1212
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:32,930
I was fighting so much, but
that's what I clung to, you know,

1213
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:37,640
I was a fire and that was the only thing
that I could draw pride from, you know,

1214
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:41,450
and, uh, be becoming the world champion,

1215
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:45,440
knowing that everybody wrote me off
knowing that everyone talk shit about me,

1216
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:50,240
you know, uh, other fighters
just, just, you know,

1217
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:54,140
it was everywhere. [inaudible] I heard
what people always said about me.

1218
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:58,130
Do you know what I mean? So to, to win
lie that in style and the first one. Yeah.

1219
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:02,720
Yeah. It felt amazing. It is
right there. Oh yeah, yeah.

1220
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,190
[inaudible] was very upset.
Yeah, he was. Yeah. You know,

1221
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:10,340
you talked a lot of shit too and you, and
after you beat him, well, well, hold on.

1222
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,610
I know my wife was behind me there and
she deserves a shout out because if it

1223
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:15,770
wasn't for her, none of this
would've happened. But, uh,

1224
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,370
with Rockhold with what happened
after the fight. So I, okay,

1225
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:22,460
there's a few things that I regret that
have heard after the fact. First of all,

1226
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:26,060
I jumped on the fence and I'm just all
worked up Husky that fuck you, whatever.

1227
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:29,420
No big deal. I'm not, I'm not
too concerned about that one. Um,

1228
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,790
and then as I'm doing my lap of
victory dance, if you will, um, I,

1229
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,410
I do a lap of the octagon
and I crossed paths with,

1230
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:40,820
with Luke part of me and
I'm like, Hey, you know,

1231
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:45,690
you say whatever you say,
unlucky bird, you know, a good
fire, whatever. Bubba, Bubba,

1232
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:46,670
bubba.
I said that.

1233
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,930
And I carried on having my mom and I
was just out of my mind on Adrenalin and

1234
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:53,330
just having a great time.
And then I found myself,

1235
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:56,750
I'd done an entire lap of the octagon
again and I was passing him again.

1236
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:00,320
So I just thought I'd extended my curtsy
one more time. I'm like, yeah, you know,

1237
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,640
and I put my hand out and he
said, oh, really? Shook your
hand. I'm like, oh, really?

1238
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,220
You're still going to be a decade. Is
that yet? I already shook your hand.

1239
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,430
So then I was like, okay,
well now the gloves are off.
I said, don't worry about it.

1240
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,770
You're in an octagon. You've
just been knocked out. It's okay.

1241
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:15,910
You'll figure it out in a minute. Don't
worry about it. You'll come to buy,

1242
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:16,763
you'll be good.

1243
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,980
So I kind of look like an asshole
because people didn't see that he would,

1244
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:22,380
it was used to shake my hand the
second time. You know, I was like,

1245
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:26,970
well go fuck yourself then.
And then when you gave me the microphone,

1246
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,370
when you gave him the microphone, I said
the most crude comments ever I'm at,

1247
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:34,170
I've been fighting ever since. I care
about it. My mother, I'm not whoa.

1248
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,270
That's not an image that I want to
portray to the world when the world belt,

1249
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:42,120
you know, what I meant was ever since
I've been born. Right. You know, but in,

1250
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:42,960
in the moment,

1251
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:48,530
the word's escaped me a little bit and
then I painted a rather disturbing image

1252
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:52,270
of my mother giving birth
to me. But, uh, but yeah,

1253
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,500
I didn't choose my words too
carefully though, but, uh,
yeah, no, it was great man.

1254
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,780
Be held accountable for
that. I mean, that's it.

1255
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:02,020
There's no one that's ever gonna be able
to understand that other than someone

1256
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:04,700
who wins the title. Yeah. No one's
going to know what that felt like. Oh,

1257
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,810
it's impossible.

1258
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:09,430
18 it was incredible. It really
was. It really was. Yeah.

1259
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,640
I can only imagine it was
good while it was good.

1260
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,350
Just happy that for you. Uh, you know,

1261
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:19,640
having a chance to see all your fights
and see your career go for as long as it

1262
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:21,740
went that you did go out
with a title that is,

1263
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,240
yeah, for sure. Yeah. You
know, I mean, as I say a,

1264
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,330
that was for me, I'm not sure.
Well, I wouldn't have retired.

1265
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:34,440
I wouldn't have retired. Yeah,
yeah. No, no, because, because I,

1266
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:39,000
I know I could still do it. I can still
find now, you know, I can still, but,

1267
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,650
but the time was right.
You know,

1268
01:12:40,651 --> 01:12:44,550
and then I started having issues with
my good eye as well after the gas Dillon

1269
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:47,320
fight. So I'm like, this isn't worth it

1270
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,800
now because you, you had oil in
one of your eyes. Yeah. Yeah.

1271
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:52,400
Can you explain how that was going on?

1272
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,610
Yeah. So when I detached my retina, um,

1273
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:59,030
they did what's called a
[inaudible]. Uh, if you,

1274
01:12:59,031 --> 01:13:03,530
if you've watched their surgery,
it's absolutely disgusting.

1275
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,970
But, uh, one of the things that
they do, the gas inside your eye,

1276
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:10,820
and I think if I'm getting this wrong,
I apologize to all doctors,

1277
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:14,660
but the kind of kind of helps
hold the retina in place. Um,

1278
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,760
but you can't fly with that.

1279
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,110
And I was filming a movie in England
a few weeks later. I said, and I said,

1280
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,700
you can't do the US and I'm filming
a movie. And they went, okay,

1281
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:25,660
there's another way we can do it.
It's a little more unconventional.

1282
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,240
We can put oil inside there, but then
with that you can fly. So I'm like, okay,

1283
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:33,350
cool. Do that. So, uh, they did that. Uh,

1284
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,550
yeah. You know, it's,

1285
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,080
yeah.

1286
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,190
Nah. And then we detoxed and then I've got
glaucoma. I just had a lot of bad luck.

1287
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:47,660
I did whatever can go wrong with
an I trust me. I went through it.

1288
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,480
But it looks different now. Yeah,
it does. Yeah, it does. Yeah.

1289
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,620
But it looks better than it looked
before was great. What did you do?

1290
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:00,380
It looks great. Don't worry about it. Job.
Oh, you want to talk? No, no, you're good.

1291
01:14:00,381 --> 01:14:03,710
You got it. It's okay. It's a,
it's a corrective lens. Oh, okay.

1292
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,140
It's a corrective lenses.
A prosthetic.

1293
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,810
So can you see,

1294
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:13,720
I see, I see. Um, a tiny,
tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny,

1295
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,700
tiny bit. Oh, really? Yeah. So I don't,

1296
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,330
I don't really see out of it and
divisions very blurred. I'm going to,

1297
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:23,260
I was able to pass the test to pass,
to be able to clear by commission to buy,

1298
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:25,090
you got to have 2100 vision,

1299
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:29,050
which I was able to scrape by with
the skin of my teeth. Wow. You know,

1300
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:33,400
so I'm a doctor was always amazed that
I could still see to that amount if I,

1301
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,730
if I squinted in the right direction
and a Turd here and the light was just

1302
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:40,360
right, I could just about
make out 2100. Wow. So, uh,

1303
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,220
but what happens is then that then,

1304
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:45,220
cause you see in two different images
distorted him and you see your brain

1305
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:47,170
councils the distorted one,
you know,

1306
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,840
so with the depth
perception remains the same.

1307
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:53,790
No depth perception is a real
issue. Yeah. Yeah. You know, uh,

1308
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:58,240
it was an issue throughout my last few
fights. For me, the main thing, I mean,

1309
01:14:58,241 --> 01:14:59,790
as I say, you know, uh,

1310
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,420
I was cleared medically by the doctors
and you know, the UFC were very,

1311
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:07,540
very on top of all of
that. The UFC, you know,

1312
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,680
send me to a number of different doctors
and whatnot. And as I say, uh, uh,

1313
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:14,830
pass the test just, but it was, and
every time I did the doctors were like,

1314
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,670
we don't recommend that you fight.
You know, you of course, 2100 vision,

1315
01:15:18,671 --> 01:15:23,260
it's still clinically blind.
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, um,

1316
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,030
but, but yeah, yeah, there you
go. That's fucking crazy. Yeah.

1317
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:31,450
But it never slowed me down. It didn't
slow it down. That's what's crazy.

1318
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,900
Looking back now,
lay fi,

1319
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:39,150
not that I sit there at night and
get drunk and watch my old fights.

1320
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,300
I've never done that once.
But if I ever do see some old fights back,

1321
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:46,120
which occasion just happens by
chance, you know, afterwards,

1322
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,500
I'm always calling for a shot at the
belt or whatever. I said to my wife,

1323
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:54,640
fuck with this guy. Thank you. Get out
of it. He's out of his mind, you know,

1324
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,980
absolutely out of his mind.
But at that time,

1325
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:02,230
it quitting and trying to not be come
the champion did not even occur to me for

1326
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:07,360
a split second. Giving up never
even occurred to me for a heartbeat.

1327
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,370
Why is that? Is this how you've always
been? This is something I still felt.

1328
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:16,840
I still felt that I could, I could
win it. Simple as that, you know? Uh,

1329
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,711
but a lot of guys,

1330
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:21,040
if they lost most of the use of one of
their eyes would have been done. Yeah,

1331
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,840
for sure. No, no chance. It's not
worth it. Yeah. No, I know. Um,

1332
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:27,663
and

1333
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,120
okay,

1334
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,050
probably the smart thing to do would it,
what would have been one of those guys,

1335
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:37,340
but for me, you know, I, I, it
meant a lot to me. I want it.

1336
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,390
I wanted to become the champion.

1337
01:16:38,391 --> 01:16:42,110
I knew I could become the champion
contrary to popular belief.

1338
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,890
And um, this is me. They, they,

1339
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,830
it was my identity. And until I won that
belt, I wasn't happy. Now when I want it,

1340
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:55,780
my wife said she wanted me to be. So
when I fought Luke in, in La, she said,

1341
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:59,170
if you win, I want you
to retire. I said, Bev,

1342
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:04,030
if I lose then I'll retire. Okay. Cause
Fair enough. I got my towel sharp.

1343
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:06,550
You know, it didn't go on
my way. It is what it is.

1344
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,010
I would have had closure on that. I said,
well, if win. Yeah. The fucking mind.

1345
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:14,290
If you think I'm going to retire, you
come on, on the jump into the world.

1346
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:18,680
I got to milk it for a little bit, finally
earn some decent pay days, you know. Uh,

1347
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:23,540
so yeah, but um, it all worked out
or the big fight with GSP. Oh yeah.

1348
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,830
That's why that took place because you
had that belt. Yeah. You know, I mean,

1349
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,690
I mean, joy joy's beat me fair
and square that night. But, uh,

1350
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:36,710
there was a lot going on going into
that camp that, uh, the final week and,

1351
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:37,280
and again,

1352
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,830
I never said anything at the time because
God bless George and he's a great guy

1353
01:17:40,831 --> 01:17:44,600
and I respect the hell out of George.
I really do. How can you not, you know,

1354
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,520
I mean, I know I talked to all
that shit, lead it into the fire,

1355
01:17:47,521 --> 01:17:50,990
but that was just me having a laugh, you
know? I was literally having fun with it.

1356
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:54,200
You know? No ill will towards George
seem like you're enjoying it. Yeah.

1357
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,780
Just having fun, just busting
balls. You know what I mean?

1358
01:17:56,810 --> 01:18:00,530
I think George is incredible. I think
George is the consummate professional,

1359
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:04,940
easier inspiration to all aspiring martial
artists out there. If there's one man,

1360
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:08,420
you can muddle your career on the way
Twain's the way he looks after his body,

1361
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,750
the way cross trains George Saint
Pierre will be that man. You know,

1362
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,760
he's an inspiration to
myself, you know, so, uh,

1363
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,940
nothing but the greatest of respect.
But people,

1364
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:20,270
as we said at the start of the show,
that doesn't sell.

1365
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,030
People don't want to see that.
People don't want to see that,

1366
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:27,500
so I'll play the bad guy. I've been
portrayed as the bad guy my entire career,

1367
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,740
you know, by the UFC,
the editing, you know,

1368
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,110
I've fallen foul to some creative editing.

1369
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,610
I've fallen foul to my own mouth as well
at time. So, you know, come on. You know,

1370
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,780
I'm my own worst enemy as well. But um,
the week before the phone, yeah, we,

1371
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:47,420
before the fight, uh, I had the best
training camp and my life, you know, uh,

1372
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:53,330
sounds braggy, but knocking out multiple
sparring partners, not on purpose.

1373
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,260
It just felt incredible.
It felt absolutely incredible.

1374
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,500
Final sparring session.
We had my protein,

1375
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:03,650
they'd flown in for a photo shoot or
someone else there for a photo shoot.

1376
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:08,320
The Gym's absolutely packed and we got
some guys in their aspiring me and um,

1377
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,840
you know, everybody wants to
be the guy, you know, the, the,

1378
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:15,400
the guests to take down or whatever or
get to submission on the guide. That's,

1379
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:16,520
you know,
that's how it is.

1380
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,940
That's why I don't like gone to too many
MMA gyms when I was fine because every

1381
01:19:19,941 --> 01:19:23,690
time you walk in you have a target on
your back. Anyway, it was the final round.

1382
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,800
We did five rounds,

1383
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:29,801
it was the Friday before the fight and
this guy shooting shoot a double leg

1384
01:19:29,871 --> 01:19:32,660
ones. We all the way across the
octagon, like his life depended on, it,

1385
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,610
depended on it,
picked me up,

1386
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,870
slammed me down and his shoulders
went right into my ribs and I felt it

1387
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,230
instantly.
Just all the cartilage tor completely.

1388
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:46,460
And I just started swearing and screaming,

1389
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,410
fuck fucking, you know, cause I knew,

1390
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:53,390
I knew I went a saw a doctor and Warner
and a yeah, it wasn't good. So I was,

1391
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,650
I got treatment everyday and I was having
nice on me and all that type of stuff.

1392
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:01,790
Uh, but uh, it, it wasn't working. So

1393
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:05,630
what we came up with Kevin with his plan,

1394
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:09,690
it was going to inject myself with
lighter came before the fight cause it,

1395
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:14,210
cause it will nomia but the problem
is the area where it was was, uh, you,

1396
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:18,000
you can pass along.
It's where I have to go in.

1397
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,960
You could piss a lot of bleed to
death cause internal bleeding is yet.

1398
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,670
So I got this doctor,
I was going to add the needle ahead,

1399
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,430
the light again and I was going to fucking
go in and sneak into the toilet and

1400
01:20:29,431 --> 01:20:33,040
facetime the doctor and he was like,
okay. And anyway, the whole thing,

1401
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,390
can we just do it on top of it was, it
was bullshit. I was like, fuck this,

1402
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:38,520
this is the stupidest plan ever.
Bollocks to it.

1403
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:41,630
I'll fire with the sore rib eye
bit of Adrenalin and you're not,

1404
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,850
I've got to feel it anyway, which I didn't
under night, you know. But people said,

1405
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:47,280
Oh, you didn't look yourself in there.
You weren't moving too much. Said yeah,

1406
01:20:47,281 --> 01:20:51,270
no shit. I couldn't move. But uh, but
as I said, hey all credit to George,

1407
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:53,340
God bless him. He did great. Did you,

1408
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,170
there was a sparring partner that you
had sparked with regularly. He'd came.

1409
01:20:58,171 --> 01:20:59,880
Ed Dina. I'm a singer. Great Guy.

1410
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,690
Just came in from England for the
last couple of weeks. So as dean,

1411
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:07,050
who took you down? Dean very well.
Do you know dean? Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:10,710
Fucking day in the Prager dude. What the
fuck, dude? Yeah, no, he's a great guy.

1413
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:14,220
Deans are so he's great. Yeah, he's
great. You know, it's the way it goes.

1414
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:19,230
You training and a, yeah. What are
you going to do? So many fights went,

1415
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,530
that was half El dos Anjos when he's
supposed to fight McGregor, like last,

1416
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:26,190
last sparring kicks and elbows
and breaks his foot. Oh,

1417
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:30,980
so that's why Diaz care men. Ah,
yeah. It has happened to so many guys.

1418
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:34,650
Such a fine line because, because you
feel good, you've trained so hard,

1419
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:39,030
you feel great and you think, ah,
like your coach will say, okay,

1420
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:42,840
let's call it there guys. We're good.
Call there and you're like, I don't know.

1421
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:43,710
I feel good.
Come on,

1422
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:47,760
let's get one good one is because
sometimes I normally train a spar Monday,

1423
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:52,100
Wednesday, Friday, and if the Wednesday
spire goes really well, you know,

1424
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,740
let's end it there because you
want to end on a really good spar.

1425
01:21:55,830 --> 01:22:00,660
You know what I mean? Because
you, you feel like a world
champion, you feel great.

1426
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,131
You know,
I,

1427
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:05,430
you remember how you handled all your
sparring partners and w whatever good

1428
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:08,910
shots you landed and you didn't really
take any damage. That's a great,

1429
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,830
that's great momentum to
go into the fight with.

1430
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:13,500
And you don't know if you have another
spy section, it's going to go like that.

1431
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,750
You might be tired,
you might be worn down.

1432
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,770
Those guys might be on their game that
day. And if you get a Tufts by session,

1433
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,530
well then you want to do one more
because you can't go into a fight after

1434
01:22:22,531 --> 01:22:24,930
getting your ass kicked in a sparring
session. You know what I mean?

1435
01:22:24,931 --> 01:22:28,660
That's not good Karma or
energy to go in there with. Um,

1436
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,670
so it's always a weird one to find.
It's fine balancing gags. But uh, yeah,

1437
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:36,720
there you go. Do you, uh, when
you look back on your career,

1438
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:39,540
would you have done anything differently
in terms of what the way you prepare it?

1439
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,253
MMM,

1440
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,070
yeah, for sure. For sure. A lot of
things. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean

1441
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:54,770
time machine. Yeah. And you'd shoot again.

1442
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:59,000
I do way more things, which
is all different. Well one,

1443
01:22:59,001 --> 01:23:03,140
I wouldn't balloon up in between fights,
discipline between fights, you know,

1444
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:08,110
I didn't exercise enough of in between
fights. Yeah. A little too much.

1445
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:12,890
You know, these days I look after my
body way more now than when I was fine.

1446
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:17,470
It's so fucking hypocritical.
You know, it's so silly now. Um,

1447
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:21,430
well cause now I don't have the luxury
of going through a fight camp to get in

1448
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:24,250
shape. You know what I mean? So now I've
got to stay in shape. Simple as that.

1449
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:26,500
Whereas in the past I'm like,
yeah, whatever. I'll have a pizza,

1450
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,120
I'll have a few beers I have
for dessert, I'll do, I'll,

1451
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:32,050
I'll eat whatever I want and then when
I'm in training camp, switch it on.

1452
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:36,940
But it's not good for the body. So that
would be one. Um, yeah, many things.

1453
01:23:36,941 --> 01:23:37,780
Many things,
you know,

1454
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,500
I don't really want to throw
anyone under the bus or whatever,

1455
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:45,220
but yes, training was, did this things
I would have changed, you know, there,

1456
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,860
there was a group of people that I was
involved with in England for a while.

1457
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,340
Definitely when a wouldn't have wasted
my time with us. Fucking assholes.

1458
01:23:52,341 --> 01:23:56,450
Did you get clear of all that legally
now? Not yet. Still going on this Friday.

1459
01:23:56,451 --> 01:24:00,520
There's another hearing in the
courts. Yeah. She's lots of lies.

1460
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,700
Lots of this has been going on for eight
years. He has something like that. Yes.

1461
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:05,660
It's 2011.

1462
01:24:05,661 --> 01:24:09,200
So I remember you telling me about this
when we were in England together. Yeah.

1463
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:13,700
That was a long time ago, man. It
was a very long time ago. Yeah.

1464
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:16,760
What are you going to do that
there's a lot of scumbags out there.

1465
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:17,840
People that want to take your money.

1466
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:21,980
So it's hard for young fighters too
when they get contractually obligated to

1467
01:24:21,981 --> 01:24:24,620
someone that doesn't suit
them later in their career.

1468
01:24:24,621 --> 01:24:27,470
But then they started becoming successful
and they're still contractually

1469
01:24:27,471 --> 01:24:30,860
obligated to those three for sure. That
it's a very common issue with fighters.

1470
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:31,140
Yeah.

1471
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:34,250
Well for me, I was contractually
obligated, uh, I kept my mouth shut. I,

1472
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:38,310
I did my five years and move down.
But uh, they saw it a different way.

1473
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:43,230
So they came out with from
totally fabricated nonsense
about camp bill is going

1474
01:24:43,231 --> 01:24:46,560
back to 2006 they just
created invoices and

1475
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:52,110
just just totally fabricated an
entire case. Not a single email,

1476
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,280
not a single signature, nothing. It's
laughable that even got this far.

1477
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:00,390
But if you've got brass balls on you and
you're willing to stick to a story and

1478
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:03,900
talk a lot of shit and lie you,
you can,

1479
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,410
you can go a long way it seems,
but I don't want to talk about that too,

1480
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,030
cause they're a pub in and
getting fucking suit again.

1481
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,310
You thought about training fighters.

1482
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:15,950
I would love to.
Yeah.

1483
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:20,720
I really would love to because I feel
this was one of my issues as I was a

1484
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:25,550
coach. So part of me as a, as a
fighter because believe it or not,

1485
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:28,830
you know, I mean I retired
at 39 years old. Um,

1486
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,390
and at the time it had the most
fights in the UFC, you know, whatever,

1487
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:33,891
believe it or not,

1488
01:25:33,891 --> 01:25:37,460
I know a thing or two about how to
prepare for a mixed martial arts fight,

1489
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:40,850
you know? So that was one of my
conflict things always with my coachees.

1490
01:25:40,851 --> 01:25:43,140
I not that I didn't respect them,
but I,

1491
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:47,810
I would always kind of feel maybe I should
be doing this or she'll be doing that

1492
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:50,420
and, and, and that's what I would do a
lot of the time. I was like Cadillac,

1493
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:53,420
the head coach. I mean, Jason
Parillo was probably the head coach,

1494
01:25:53,421 --> 01:25:57,200
but I would like be the one that did
the program and need to work on this.

1495
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:01,550
I'll see that guy on that day, you
know? Um, so yeah, I would love to.

1496
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,650
I would love to. Right now I've
got a lot of things going on and,

1497
01:26:04,651 --> 01:26:09,590
and life is good, so I don't really
have the time to dedicate myself to it.

1498
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,600
Right. And actually I'm kind of enjoying
just, well, I'm still working for the UFC,

1499
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:17,260
doing the, you know,
the Fi coverage stuff.

1500
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,660
But it's enjoyable to be
doing something different.

1501
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:24,830
You'd have to being submerged in it,
totally submerged for so long,

1502
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,280
it's refreshing to be doing something
else, you know? So, uh, but, but,

1503
01:26:29,281 --> 01:26:30,830
but one day I would love to for sure.

1504
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,940
Well you're seeing it with fighters.
Um,

1505
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:36,960
there's some of them that are making
those transitions into training and who

1506
01:26:36,961 --> 01:26:41,430
better to know what it's like to prepare
for a fight and someone like yourself

1507
01:26:41,431 --> 01:26:44,190
who had so many fights in the UFC.
I mean,

1508
01:26:44,191 --> 01:26:48,720
if it's almost like that knowledge and
experiences almost wasted or at least

1509
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:53,310
goes the, the experience of how to
prepare kind of goes away if you,

1510
01:26:53,311 --> 01:26:54,850
if you don't pass it off,
he,

1511
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,640
because otherwise someone has
to go through all this stuff.

1512
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:01,430
Yeah, absolutely. Joe. Um, and the, and
that's partly why I do want to do that.

1513
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,470
When the time comes,
as I say it,

1514
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:06,890
would it be fair to anybody right now
because I haven't got the time to commit

1515
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:10,700
right now. I'm working on some things
and hopefully they all come off and, uh,

1516
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:13,730
I've got some free time and I can sit on
my ass. You know, everyone's always like,

1517
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,910
oh, congrats on the retirement.
I'm like, fucking retirement.

1518
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,100
I'm working harder than ever these days.
You know,

1519
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,350
maybe I need to come out of retirement
to get some free time back, you know. Uh,

1520
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,390
but, um, when the time comes,
I would love to do that.

1521
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:29,750
That is the best case scenario though,
your situation because you,

1522
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,280
you've retired into a
very profitable career,

1523
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,970
whereas there's a lot of fighters
they're lost when it's over.

1524
01:27:35,971 --> 01:27:36,900
They don't know what to do.

1525
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:40,100
Always scared me. Yeah.
Always scared. Good for you,

1526
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:43,100
good for you for thinking like that.
Terrified me right from day one.

1527
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:47,750
So I left school at 16 me and no
education, like a fucking idiot.

1528
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:51,100
That's one of my big regrets in
life. Small town boy, you know,

1529
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,710
northwest of England. Not a lot going
on there. Beautiful little town,

1530
01:27:54,711 --> 01:27:57,350
but you know, tiny little town, uh,

1531
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,790
not a lot of opportunity and
just fell into a Rut, you know,

1532
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,490
working minimum wage in factories,
you know,

1533
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:06,650
from seven in the morning
until six o'clock at night,

1534
01:28:06,651 --> 01:28:10,470
just doing mundane medial shit in on.

1535
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:13,130
And I hated it. I hated it. I really did.

1536
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:16,340
And that's why I became
a fiery ultimately.

1537
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:19,940
And it was a very well planned
decision, you know, the whole,

1538
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:24,940
the whole story to me coming to do
this was a, it didn't happen overnight.

1539
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:27,920
You know, there was a steps to it.
What was your first discipline?

1540
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:31,790
I started doing Japanese Jujitsu when I
was eight years old and I was obsessed

1541
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:34,610
with it. So that's how you knew how
to clear the sword. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1542
01:28:34,611 --> 01:28:37,900
I was obsessed with Japanese
Jujitsu. Reallocate. It's
a great, it's great. Yeah,

1543
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:41,000
I was doing, she, we didn't
know it was Emma back then,

1544
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:44,510
but we were fighting in MMA.
We called it knocked down sport Buddha.

1545
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:47,720
If you, if you Google
it, you can bring it up.

1546
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:51,950
You can pick up some of my FYS knockdown
sport Butoh yeah. Which is MMA,

1547
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:56,690
bare knuckle. Uh, and we have like
these international tournaments against,

1548
01:28:56,691 --> 01:29:00,800
you know, men. I was about 15,
something like that at the time.

1549
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:05,610
But uh, yeah, so we do tons of that stuff.
When I was younger, you know, I was,

1550
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,111
as I say,

1551
01:29:06,111 --> 01:29:10,080
obsessed with martial arts in pretty
much one every single tournament I ever

1552
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:14,490
went in. And then on top of that, and I
was a little shit out and about as well.

1553
01:29:14,491 --> 01:29:17,730
So I was having plenty of fight
experience. And then as I said,

1554
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,610
just dead end job after dead
end job after dead end job.

1555
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:24,420
And I got to a phase in my life and
met my wife Rebecca and we had kids.

1556
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:28,560
I was like, it's this is this or
that. Life is going to be, you know,

1557
01:29:28,561 --> 01:29:31,980
and then my boss at work at the
time, Mick, he said to me, my,

1558
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:33,780
you're pretty intelligent guys.

1559
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:36,870
This is what you want to do for the rest
of your life. And I'm like, fuck no.

1560
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:41,060
He's like, what? Oh, here we go.
Here's one of them. This is wild. Yeah.

1561
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:46,360
May Fight Club Shit. I mean, even
the seedy dark looking background,

1562
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:49,050
the weird lighting.
This is like a scene in the movie.

1563
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,610
He walked through fire and you walked
through fire to get here. Oh Jesus.

1564
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:58,140
You do actual fire. Oh, it's like smoking.

1565
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,340
There's another one actually
did, which is true to my, uh,

1566
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,020
puts good headed on this.

1567
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,110
This is why all the way you guys
are dressed and everything. Yeah.

1568
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,800
I to this day think that fight should
be held in this sort of a scenario where

1569
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:17,160
there's a large open open air
place like a basketball court.

1570
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:22,800
I just feel like the cage is such a
factor in fight. No, it really is.

1571
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:26,460
It really is. And it allows,
I mean you can use the,

1572
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,060
there's one more on there if you can
find it Jamie, which is pretty funny.

1573
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:33,990
The joke had a good laugh and so will
everybody else cause I guess the early

1574
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:38,070
Michael Bisping was on display, we
Bauer eg over and I kick him in the face

1575
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:43,470
right off the bat. But you know the
referee at Ted fight. Um, yeah, the cage.

1576
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:47,850
You can use it as a, uh, you know,
it's, it's, it's another weapon.

1577
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:51,690
You can stall on it. You can lean on it,
you use it to stand up. It's a factor.

1578
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,270
It's a huge factor in,
in the UFC.

1579
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:59,280
And it's hard to see sometimes if you're
in the crowd and you've got to post

1580
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:03,150
there as a brand, you wind up looking at
the screens. Yeah, no, absolutely you do.

1581
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,440
I was having a me Lewis on
one of our episodes recently.
He was saying, you know,

1582
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,870
usually when I probably wrote the
power of that. Hold on a minute.

1583
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,230
Where did you ever been front row at
the fight for one cause he was saying I

1584
01:31:13,231 --> 01:31:14,490
prefer the first wiser.

1585
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,190
I'm like okay well that's what everyone
says that their car get front row

1586
01:31:17,191 --> 01:31:21,240
tickets. Okay. You all said, oh I'd
rather be on the first advisor. You know,

1587
01:31:21,241 --> 01:31:24,180
cause you ever got to get a sore neck
looking up. I said, well guess what?

1588
01:31:24,181 --> 01:31:27,570
When you from rob it's fucking cool.
Okay. You can hear the punches,

1589
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:31,200
you can see the blood and the sweat
from the first riser was good.

1590
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,780
I'd be doing commentary for
the first prize. It was great.

1591
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:37,440
That's where all the celebrity,
why was this? Look at this by

1592
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,390
Oh Jesus Christ. What? That was
fine in my opinion. He said, fine,

1593
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,000
look, I wasn't wearing, he's
wearing wrestling shoes. Yeah,

1594
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,010
the old head scissors classic.
There is the uh,

1595
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:56,100
there a a video on flow
grappling from a recent,

1596
01:31:56,190 --> 01:32:00,280
a Jujitsu tournament where a guy got
a guy in the is to put him to sleep,

1597
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,080
right? Yeah. Right from his guard. Yeah.

1598
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:04,660
Well I wouldn't a couple of that
shitty grappling tournaments.

1599
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:09,040
Well the heads is Yay.
If you can squeeze hard enough,

1600
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:11,210
it wasn't against the
best competition though.

1601
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,200
The guy might've been 55 or something.
The deal legit though,

1602
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:19,030
if you get the knees on the right part
of the neck and squeeze like a bitch,

1603
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,340
yeah, it hurts. And
especially if you practice it,

1604
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,440
I feel like the head scissors or something
like look and think about when you,

1605
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:26,730
when you're synching a
Doris, right? Or when you,

1606
01:32:26,731 --> 01:32:28,510
when you go under for
a Doris and you clamp,

1607
01:32:28,511 --> 01:32:30,040
we'll hold your hands and you pinch down.

1608
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:35,230
Some guys are expert at absolutely
six squeeze, clamp down.

1609
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:37,360
If you just constantly
drilled out all the time,

1610
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:40,570
you could fuck people up with that. Just
get better at it. Just get better at it.

1611
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:42,170
Like you could,
you could,

1612
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,880
I don't want to be the guy going for a
headset is in the UFC and it was that

1613
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:50,020
with his British wrestling.
He let him do that.

1614
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,500
It's like the women go over
their head and I've, you know,

1615
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:58,501
in women's Ndna you try
a head and arm as a man,

1616
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:01,360
they're going to take you back
to choke you out. Simple as that.

1617
01:33:01,361 --> 01:33:05,050
But yet we'll run the run the
main Liz Carmouche she was Ronda,

1618
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:07,750
his thing was always get that
headlock and then hip toss,

1619
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:10,530
get a girl to the ground and then
you know, get her in a normal,

1620
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,550
how does that work on women but not men?

1621
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:18,460
Next heads and necks are even smaller
so they can show stand out of it easier.

1622
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,730
You know what I mean?
Really works.

1623
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,940
I think what we saw on the Ronda
Rousey fight with Liz Carmouche,

1624
01:33:24,941 --> 01:33:27,640
Liz Carmouche took her back and
almost choked her out. Yeah.

1625
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,700
And if Liz was the lids of today,

1626
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:34,270
she probably would have choked her
out showing how she just wasn't quite

1627
01:33:34,271 --> 01:33:35,620
experienced enough at the time.

1628
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:38,920
I think the reason why you're seeing it
more in women's MMA is because although

1629
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:42,910
the level is very high
with like Valentina's shift
Chenko and you own a unit j

1630
01:33:42,911 --> 01:33:46,300
check and Cyborg,
the level the champions is very high.

1631
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:51,540
There's still the lower levels absolutely
near you could watch a guy on an

1632
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:56,770
undercard that's fighting on fight pass
who's a fucking worldclass demon in the

1633
01:33:56,771 --> 01:34:00,160
UFC. A man, the women
you're still, there's,

1634
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:04,330
there's way less of them and
the competition is strong. Yeah.

1635
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:08,050
I mean they haven't been doing it as
long but I tell them pool isn't as big.

1636
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,060
You know,
women aren't as interested in it.

1637
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:14,110
I was just about to say the percentage
of men interested in pursuing martial

1638
01:34:14,111 --> 01:34:17,980
arts and mixed martial arts as opposed
to the percentage of women way lower.

1639
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:19,920
I don't know what the
percentage is of metal.

1640
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,260
If we said it's 50 just for
the sake of the argument. Yeah,

1641
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,330
women it's going to be 5% if that,

1642
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:28,900
if that it's 5% probably men.
If my wife said, Michael,

1643
01:34:28,901 --> 01:34:31,450
I'm going to start training cause I
want to be an MMA or fire. I said,

1644
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,380
pack your bags, get out. I'd say,
shut the hell up. Made me a sandwich.

1645
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:43,230
What are you talking about? Come on,
you're going to be an MMA fighter. I

1646
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:49,320
was the mother of your children
get head kicked and just crazy.

1647
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:53,380
So my Thai boxing coach, actually you
mentioned Vinny shoreman at the start.

1648
01:34:53,381 --> 01:34:56,860
I used to be in business with Vinnie does
Maurice. Very, very good friend of mine.

1649
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,030
He was my Thai boxing coach.

1650
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,790
Back to Vinny shoreman. Shout
out to dad's Maurice. And um,

1651
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,980
he's uh, his girlfriend, he was calling
him and he's, he's getting, you know,

1652
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:11,000
the mother of his children. She was a Thai
boxer, Cassie and Cassie, no disrespect,

1653
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:11,330
you know,

1654
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:16,330
but to be cornering your loved one that
you were in a relationship and she got

1655
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:20,780
knocked out cold and a Thai boxing fan. I
was like, wow. Does, how do you do that?

1656
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:25,781
And the mental strength to understand
that this is a different relationship.

1657
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:30,320
That she's the student and the teacher
and this is just the way it is. I mean,

1658
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:33,620
that takes a lot. I don't think I
could do that. It's incredible. Well,

1659
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:36,170
it takes a different kind of woman
to want to do that right there.

1660
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:37,910
That kind of woman you go.
I mean,

1661
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:41,120
the worst thing I think you could ever
do is take a woman who wants to fight and

1662
01:35:41,121 --> 01:35:44,300
tell him no. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Cause you're going to find a way,

1663
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:48,350
like if you're dating, don't go.
Good luck with that. Good luck.

1664
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,500
Good luck with that one. You're going
to get spinning, kick to the midsection.

1665
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:55,670
Shouldn't bottles. Okay. She's a
fucking monster, isn't she? She's great.

1666
01:35:55,820 --> 01:36:00,130
She's awesome. Quickest spinning back
kicks I've ever seen. There's no fair.

1667
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,180
She's men.
And,

1668
01:36:01,181 --> 01:36:04,670
and I say this with a great
set of respective to women's
mixed martial arts and

1669
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:09,350
I respect everybody that applies themself
and he's willing to get off the couch

1670
01:36:09,351 --> 01:36:13,220
and make something of their lives. So, you
know, I'm not being overly judgemental,

1671
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:18,490
but there isn't too many that I
really get excited for and that really

1672
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:22,040
thoroughly enjoy watching. You
know, because as we just said,

1673
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:25,510
the level of skill isn't quite
there yet. You know, as I say,

1674
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:27,360
it's not nothing to do with genders.
Right.

1675
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:31,850
Why do I want to see a watered down
product if I can see these guys doing it?

1676
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,470
It has such an extreme level.

1677
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:37,210
I don't really want to watch the smaller
people that car hit as hard with lesser

1678
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:40,640
technique, but you know what I mean? As
I say, nothing to do with gender, but um,

1679
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:45,480
but obviously there's a few exceptions
to the rule and Shevchenko Yon j check

1680
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:49,850
Amanda Nunez. Cyborg. Yes,
definitely. Amazing talent.

1681
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,710
There really is just a smaller pool.
It's a smaller fight this weekend,

1682
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,220
one sensational [inaudible] and Valentino,
that was a very,

1683
01:36:58,221 --> 01:37:02,090
very high level fight. Oh, it really
works. And what it really was. Yeah. Yeah.

1684
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,850
And Yon Jake, Jake impress me,
you know, because he had a,

1685
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:08,240
I think it was a tough three
rounds, fourth round. You know,

1686
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,000
she probably mad at the age,
that fourth round, you know,

1687
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:13,360
so it's impressive that she,
uh,

1688
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:17,450
we still had the fight in her soul late
in the Florentine is just too strong to

1689
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:21,740
be too good a grappler and yeah.
Yeah. And bigger, physically bigger.

1690
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:24,910
Like you see Europe, we see it. You
can see when their guests each other,

1691
01:37:24,911 --> 01:37:26,840
the young Ghx very slim,
very slender,

1692
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:31,841
and she's chef can cause muscle on her
or serve Chanko was successful at one 35

1693
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:32,400
you know,

1694
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,800
it's a big gap between 35 and one 15 were
you on the reason young and JJ went up

1695
01:37:36,801 --> 01:37:41,200
to one 25 is because she couldn't get a
boat back at one 15 and I say that with

1696
01:37:41,201 --> 01:37:44,210
the absolute great. So respect,
you know, uh, when I was,

1697
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:47,510
a lot of it was the week it was crushing
her and then she didn't have to cut

1698
01:37:47,511 --> 01:37:51,230
weight for one 25 but the, on the
flip side, you're fighting a bigger,

1699
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:53,630
stronger woman. Sure. Valentino, exactly.

1700
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:56,820
If she was fighting another
Shoreway up to one 25 yeah,

1701
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,050
maybe things will be different,
but that, that was always on paper.

1702
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:02,453
A bad matchup.

1703
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:04,350
Yes. I agree. My opinion, yeah,

1704
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:08,940
it went down the way I thought it was
going to go save here. A lot of fights,

1705
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,360
but the main event, man, the main event
was one of those fights where I was like,

1706
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:16,680
I don't know. I don't know.
[inaudible] I was like, if Max, uh,

1707
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:20,550
and if it goes to the ground and max
gets caught up in something, I mean,

1708
01:38:20,551 --> 01:38:23,900
or tag has got the nastiest
fucking submissions in that.

1709
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:29,070
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I did it
now. I mean, as a sad, I favored Max.

1710
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,170
I thought Max was going to do it,
but it as well,

1711
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:34,380
there's just something
about Brian Arteaga. I mean,
just, just looking at him,

1712
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:36,390
he looks like a fucking killer.
You know what I mean?

1713
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:40,500
And he'd say clear the division. He's
calm. He has that presence, you know?

1714
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:41,401
I don't know.
He has it.

1715
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:44,010
He has just going to look on his face
that it wants to snap your neck off.

1716
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,720
He's going to learn. He's going to
learn from that fire. Of course. A Lot,

1717
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,470
a lot going on in that fight to learn
from it. Yeah. In terms of his movement,

1718
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:56,430
in terms of just trying to handle Max's
barrage and it's the pressure that he

1719
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:57,060
puts on you.

1720
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,990
Well,
he's only young,

1721
01:38:57,991 --> 01:39:01,950
so that should be a massive motivator
for him because when you go away and you

1722
01:39:01,951 --> 01:39:04,530
win fires, he's great. There's no
better feeling than winning fights.

1723
01:39:04,531 --> 01:39:06,660
And I'm telling you this like you
don't know, but you know this.

1724
01:39:06,661 --> 01:39:08,370
But you know when you went in fights,

1725
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:11,400
he's great and you go and you don't really
change anything because everything's

1726
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:15,120
going good. You know, but when you
lose, then you're like, okay shit,

1727
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:17,340
I don't want to make a habit
of this was the undefeated,

1728
01:39:17,341 --> 01:39:20,700
I think it was undefeated.
That was his first loss. So
now he's going to say, okay,

1729
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:25,701
what can I do to it to ensure that
I don't start getting more losses?

1730
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,080
You know,
he wants to be the champion.

1731
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:31,290
Like my first loss was to Rashad
Evans and then I remember on the day,

1732
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,730
um, Dave, the way in,

1733
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,900
he was a sat in the sauna killing himself
during his usual thing and the team

1734
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:42,810
that I was with that shall
remain nameless back then,

1735
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,850
they'll want it to eat Chinese food.

1736
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:48,420
So I was like trying to order the
most healthiest thing in the Chinese

1737
01:39:48,421 --> 01:39:51,870
restaurant that I could.
So I was eat eating noodles
and drinking fucking sprite,

1738
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:53,370
you know,
on the day of the Wayne,

1739
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:57,090
she's as crazy cause cause when I was at
two oh five, I didn't cook way at all,

1740
01:39:57,210 --> 01:40:00,600
you know, so I remember, um, you know,

1741
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:03,870
and I still weighed in another time when
I fought hell of a synthetic world back

1742
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:06,770
in the day,
it was my first fight at Manchester and a,

1743
01:40:06,771 --> 01:40:09,180
I was getting tickets for
everybody, you know, loving it,

1744
01:40:09,181 --> 01:40:11,550
really loving the attendees were
first time, you know what I mean?

1745
01:40:11,551 --> 01:40:14,550
So get your tickets,
talking about a fucking pain in the ass.

1746
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:17,220
It was a lot of tickets is a
pain in the ass. Oh my God.

1747
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:19,650
Because you've got to get
the money off the people,

1748
01:40:19,651 --> 01:40:21,920
then you've got to get the ticket,
then you've got to do the transaction.

1749
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:23,790
This is day of the fight.
You know what I mean?

1750
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:26,310
I remember being on my knees there,
the fight,

1751
01:40:26,311 --> 01:40:29,520
we've hundreds of tickets and cash
everyone. I'm like, Oh my God,

1752
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,050
why did I do this? Oh no, sorry. The
day, the way in part of me anyway.

1753
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:37,140
And I was so stressed out
with it and I drove home.

1754
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:39,780
I fell asleep in my own
bed now before the night,

1755
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:44,350
before the night before the way,
pardon me. And I'm driving home and uh,

1756
01:40:44,351 --> 01:40:45,720
I was so stressed out and I was hungry.

1757
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:48,480
I hadn't eaten all day because
I forgot I was too stressed.

1758
01:40:48,481 --> 01:40:51,150
And as I'm driving along the freeway,
I don't really eat burger king,

1759
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:53,980
but I saw the sign for Burger King
and I was starving. I thought fuck it.

1760
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:58,960
So I pull off and I get a triple whopper
with cheese and bacon fries and a large

1761
01:40:58,961 --> 01:41:01,450
coke.
And I'm sitting there and you know the,

1762
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:03,400
the noise that it makes
when you get to the bottom,

1763
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:07,860
that sound as asthma.
Oh what am I doing?

1764
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,710
Holy Shit.

1765
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:15,050
Cause I'm so stressed out with a God damn
tickets I'd forgot all about it is all

1766
01:41:15,051 --> 01:41:15,884
that crap.

1767
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,890
So before did I just stepped on the
scale? No problem. I'm with Rashad Evans.

1768
01:41:19,891 --> 01:41:23,100
Same thing. I just stepped on the
scale. So after that I was like, okay,

1769
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:27,960
what can I change? Well, I'm not making
the sacrifices I could be, you know,

1770
01:41:27,961 --> 01:41:29,990
to be as successful as
possible. So that was, you know,

1771
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:33,570
moved out of the middle away and Ortega,
you know, he's not going to drop weight.

1772
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,790
He does not need to, but he doesn't need
to. You can work on some things, you know,

1773
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:38,470
you can learn simple as that.

1774
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:42,160
Yeah. He most certainly
can. I mean, uh, he's uh,

1775
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:46,450
he's got tremendous Jujitsu and his
boxing is very good as well. But you know,

1776
01:41:46,451 --> 01:41:49,330
when you experienced
that kind of a fighter,

1777
01:41:49,331 --> 01:41:52,840
when you experienced that kind of
a champion, like Max Holloway, you,

1778
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:55,510
you understand that there's,
there's areas where you're exposed,

1779
01:41:55,511 --> 01:41:59,590
there's areas where you have holes and
you have areas where you can't compete

1780
01:41:59,591 --> 01:42:02,860
with him. And as successfully as you
have been with previous fighters.

1781
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,680
So it's a learning experience and I'm
sure he'll be better because of it. Yeah,

1782
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:09,590
I would say because of the third
round then. Yeah. You know,

1783
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:12,670
he's surely made it competitive in the
third round and landed a couple of good

1784
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:16,120
shots. Cause I was going to say, you know,

1785
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:19,630
in some circumstances it doesn't matter.
You go where work your ass off,

1786
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:22,780
you're never going to beat that guy.
Right. You know what I mean? All the work,

1787
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:25,420
all the culture. You spend all the
money and dedicate your fucking life.

1788
01:42:25,421 --> 01:42:28,000
God live in a monastery in fucking China.
Do whatever you want.

1789
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,530
You're never going to be that guy.

1790
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,980
But in the third round he kept him
on as he landed some good shots.

1791
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:36,670
So I wouldn't say that's necessarily
applicable. Um, you know,

1792
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:39,970
but it certainly got to do
some work. Yeah. He's in the
striking department. Yeah.

1793
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:40,660
Yeah.

1794
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:43,870
And the striking department and I'm sure
in the wrestling department as well.

1795
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:48,670
Sure. You know, he got him down briefly,
but Max did a fantastic job of a stuffing.

1796
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:52,480
It getting back up to his feet,
you know, a retaining, you know.

1797
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:56,580
Yeah, for sure. I mean, I don't
want to speak out of turn. Um,

1798
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:01,310
I did find it somewhat curious. Is it
Hannah grace here? Yes. Hannah. Grace,

1799
01:43:01,311 --> 01:43:05,520
you've given him the, the, the, the, the,
the boxing advice in the corner. Yeah,

1800
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:08,130
I find that somewhat curious.
Yeah. You know, when I,

1801
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:11,190
when I had my FYS Jason Parillo
off the fire was on the fee,

1802
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:14,400
he was given the instruction. When the
fire hit the floor, Brady frank took over,

1803
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:16,980
you know, and if there
was elements, you know,

1804
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:20,910
they knew their elements in the corner,
you know, he'd say his bit, boom, you go,

1805
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:23,700
you know, no disrespect to had a
grace. He's done amazing things.

1806
01:43:23,701 --> 01:43:28,650
You've been a tag of by the, by everything
I see online, you know, congratulations.

1807
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:30,990
You know,
but when you get now struck,

1808
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,200
I don't really want advice from his
shit to coach. Right. All right.

1809
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:38,550
No, that's a good point. It's a
very good point. You know, um, it's,

1810
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:40,050
it's interesting.
Like you,

1811
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:43,470
you had a great situation with Jason
Parillo and the other coaches that you

1812
01:43:43,471 --> 01:43:48,150
worked with, and sometimes a young
fighter needs like a mastermind, right?

1813
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:50,970
Matt Hume or a for Rasa.

1814
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,410
Someone who could put it all
together for you at John Crouch.

1815
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:55,070
You know what I mean?

1816
01:43:55,070 --> 01:43:57,440
Yeah, absolutely. And I
was also going to say,

1817
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:00,080
and this is probably well by all accounts,

1818
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:04,640
it is what Henry is to always take
a mentor as well. He does see my,

1819
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:06,260
he's as mentor. So for that, you know,

1820
01:44:06,261 --> 01:44:09,440
maybe I shouldn't have quiet set
it in the words that I did use,

1821
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:12,230
you know what I mean to say is that
that is his mentor, his father figure,

1822
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,840
whatever it is.
So there's a reason why he is there,

1823
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:19,990
but for sure bring on an expert
in those areas of specialist.

1824
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:25,190
Yeah, yeah. It's uh, you
know, so it's a crazy world.

1825
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,210
The world of fights

1826
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,820
in mixed martial arts, you know what
I mean? As I said, there's a lot of,

1827
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,713
there's a lot of fakes.

1828
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:33,860
Well, there's a lot of that and
there's a lot of, it works good now,

1829
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:37,190
but then when you find a world
class fighter, you realize why,

1830
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,350
why there was holes in that.

1831
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:42,560
Yeah. That you'll find out pretty quick.
You know, when you've got a coach,

1832
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:43,394
there's never,

1833
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:48,020
now you don't have to have real life
combat experience to be a good coach.

1834
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,570
But it helps. It certainly helps. It.

1835
01:44:50,571 --> 01:44:54,230
It helps the fighter really trust the
advice that they're giving you. Yeah.

1836
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,180
For a fire to be standing there
and telling you throw combinations.

1837
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:58,130
Have you ever been in there?

1838
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:01,130
You have experienced what it's like to
have another guy trying to take your head

1839
01:45:01,131 --> 01:45:03,260
off every time and you're,
and you're going to talk shit to me.

1840
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:08,290
Did you see the Mike Perry
video now planning my Peri
Peri is great video or did

1841
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:09,400
he do

1842
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,480
bill telling him that like, like when
you're fighting and the coach is like, go,

1843
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:14,970
go, go, go, go. He's like,

1844
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,880
I'm not trying to get fucking
hit right now. Yeah, exactly.

1845
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,770
That's what is video too.
I know

1846
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:22,830
Mike, you know he's an intense guy
and he's talking about, and he's like,

1847
01:45:22,831 --> 01:45:25,770
we're faking, we're faking, were
fainting. We're trying to make our way in,

1848
01:45:25,771 --> 01:45:28,260
but no one wants to make a move because
no one wants to get clipped first.

1849
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,780
Yeah. Well, I remember, you know,
I mean when I fought Rashad Evans,

1850
01:45:31,781 --> 01:45:34,450
it wasn't the most action packed fight.
And when I watched it back I was like,

1851
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:37,750
fuck, why did I just go for it a
little bit more? And then I'm like,

1852
01:45:37,751 --> 01:45:39,730
oh cause I remember,
cause every time we took a step forward,

1853
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:43,810
built the wind of the punches nearly
taking my head off when you sit,

1854
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:46,770
even myself, when you sit and
watch and go, wow, I do more.

1855
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:50,470
But then you take yourself back to when
you were in there and you know, ah yeah,

1856
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:53,410
that was why that was why,
you know,

1857
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:58,000
to such a tricky situation
and the fight game evolves,

1858
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:02,920
the styles evolve in the way guys
pursue fights, evolves. It's just,

1859
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,910
it's really interesting to watch know
you see a guy like mighty mouse who does

1860
01:46:06,911 --> 01:46:08,500
things different than anybody else.
And you go,

1861
01:46:08,501 --> 01:46:12,220
oh well look at how this motherfucker does
it. You know what I mean? No, for sure.

1862
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:15,430
And it's, it's a, it's
a sport where, you mean,

1863
01:46:15,431 --> 01:46:18,100
you were incredibly fortunate in that,
um,

1864
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:22,390
you got to not just be
there when it was exploding,

1865
01:46:22,391 --> 01:46:25,550
but you've got to got to be a part
of the explosion. Sure. You know,

1866
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:28,870
I mean, that's not, I absolutely, I made

1867
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,410
six. You were, you were
in the ultimate fighter.

1868
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:37,290
Yeah. 2005. I feel like it was
December, 2005. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy,

1869
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:40,590
right? Crazy man. It
really was. It really was.

1870
01:46:40,591 --> 01:46:43,440
It was good times when it
was just popping. Oh yeah.

1871
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:45,510
I remember when the ultimate
fighter first came out.

1872
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:50,220
I know it was on Bravo TV in England.
Oh, Sam's here. And I said to my wife,

1873
01:46:50,221 --> 01:46:53,370
I was like, check this out. And she's
like, I can't watch it. I'm like,

1874
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:55,360
why is it because if you are on
there, you'd win the things. Right.

1875
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:58,080
I don't want to watch it. It's not
fair, Michael. You should be on there.

1876
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:01,500
And then Lo and behold, you
know, about six months later,

1877
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:04,200
they were looking for
two English men. And, uh,

1878
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:07,800
we went down to Earl's court for
auditions. And the great thing was,

1879
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:10,440
at that time I was 10 and now
I was the cage rage champion,

1880
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:13,950
cage warriors champion in FX three
champion as well as the British headwear

1881
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:15,270
kickboxing champion as well.

1882
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,750
And every 100 that was auditioning
for the light everywhere.

1883
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:21,400
I'd knocked them all out in
the first round. Of course,
you know, to, to my style.

1884
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:25,770
I Made, you know, Dana fully
aware of that. But uh, yeah,

1885
01:47:25,771 --> 01:47:28,290
it was crazy, man. I couldn't
believe it. You know, it was nuts.

1886
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:29,490
I'd never been to America.

1887
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,480
Next minute I'm on some fucking we TV
show and a manager in Las Vegas, you know,

1888
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,150
it was, it was a great
time. It was, it really was.

1889
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:39,620
What was it like being separated from
your family for six weeks and doing that

1890
01:47:39,621 --> 01:47:40,454
show?
And

1891
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,010
very hard, very difficult. Of course.

1892
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:46,230
But I was there for a reason,
you know,

1893
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:50,240
so I was the greater good, you know,
I said, yeah, of course it sucks.

1894
01:47:50,241 --> 01:47:53,900
It sucks being away. Sucks, missing time,
missing birthdays, all that type of stuff.

1895
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:56,810
But if you're doing it for a
reason, then, then you know,

1896
01:47:56,811 --> 01:48:00,860
he's gotta be mature about it. My wife
always was, the kids understand, you know?

1897
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:03,500
Yeah. It's not good being
away from home, but, uh,

1898
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:08,600
I'm working on something here and I
just set us up. Come on, do me a favor.

1899
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,930
Understand, you know, well, it worked out.
Yeah. They were always great, you know.

1900
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:16,460
Yeah. It worked out and then it did
not. No regrets. I mean, maybe a few,

1901
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,200
maybe a few.

1902
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,910
Yeah. But you know what, man,
there's no way to not have him. Yeah.

1903
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:22,550
I mean there's no perfect path.

1904
01:48:22,551 --> 01:48:26,210
That's one of the crazy things about
fighting zig when you should a zag.

1905
01:48:26,211 --> 01:48:29,000
Do you get hit? That's it. There's
no, that's part of the game.

1906
01:48:29,050 --> 01:48:31,800
That really is the sport.
You know, it's, uh,

1907
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:35,760
it's such a cliche thing to say
so many ways to win and lose,

1908
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:38,640
but there really is, you know, and as
you say, Zig when you should have zagged,

1909
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:41,790
the smaller gloves, you know, the
take downs, that's the problem.

1910
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:44,220
When you find a restless, such
a pain in the ass, you know,

1911
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:47,060
cause I'm a better strike is
the most of these west is.

1912
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:48,060
But when they tried to take you down,

1913
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,640
it changes everything because
you go out and you're like,

1914
01:48:50,641 --> 01:48:55,380
okay this motherfuckers just try to take
me down. That's all he's trying to do.

1915
01:48:55,381 --> 01:48:57,710
So I can stand here and I'm going to wait
for him to shoot and then I'm going to

1916
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:01,330
stuff his take down because
I'm waiting for a take down.

1917
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:04,380
I'm not thinking about the hands and
Douche. Then you get caught with a shot,

1918
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:06,350
you know like what the fuck he
supposed to be gone for a take down,

1919
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,470
not punching me in the face.

1920
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:11,220
And then all of a sudden you're striking
is terrible because you're totally

1921
01:49:11,221 --> 01:49:16,050
thrown off by the wrestling. So it, it,
it's, it's a very, very difficult spoil.

1922
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:16,884
It really is.

1923
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:20,610
Another one of your most impressive
victories was the second fight with Dan

1924
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:25,110
Henderson cause you got hit with some
fucking oh yeah. Arms in that fight.

1925
01:49:25,111 --> 01:49:29,640
But you refuse to go out. Yeah. You
refuse to be stomped in that fight.

1926
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,110
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1927
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,070
That was a,

1928
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:35,760
that was a display of willpower and a
lot of ways because I remember watching

1929
01:49:35,761 --> 01:49:36,180
those,

1930
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:41,180
those big shots from Henderson land
and I mean they were on the edge.

1931
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,530
I mean,
you were on the edge going out.

1932
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:48,040
Oh, for sure. Absolutely. I mean,
I remember he hit me, I went down,

1933
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,880
it was swarming on me, hit me with some
elbows, but I remember I was always fine,

1934
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:55,270
but I was like, Holy Shit. You
know, that was what hit me there.

1935
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:58,540
And then I managed to get myself back
to mafia and had blood pouring down my

1936
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:01,420
face and whatnot. Of course, second round,

1937
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:05,410
the same thing happened and he had two
big mamas in the file too. Big shots.

1938
01:50:05,411 --> 01:50:09,420
But they were big moments. But you
don't win a 25 minute five by London,

1939
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:13,450
two shots, you know. But they were
big shots. Fair play to him. But uh,

1940
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:18,430
you know, I refuse to quit
there because, you know,

1941
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:21,010
obviously going into that fight,
I talked to me the shit like always,

1942
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:25,480
and you can lie to everybody. You can lie
to the media. You can lie to the press,

1943
01:50:25,481 --> 01:50:29,290
you can lie to your family.
Lighty coaches was not necessarily lies,

1944
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:34,180
but you can ooze bravado and this and
that. But you can't lie to yourself.

1945
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:37,870
You know, when you let him bed at night
and your head's on the cushion, you know,

1946
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,670
can't bullshit yourself,
you know,

1947
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:42,610
and day of the fight because the
fire was at six in the morning.

1948
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:43,750
They're the fight.

1949
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:46,930
I'm let them my bed trying to just have
a nap cause it was going to be a long

1950
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:48,940
night obviously.
And uh,

1951
01:50:48,941 --> 01:50:52,000
I couldn't sleep and all I
was thinking human nature.

1952
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:54,070
Last time I stepped into
an octagon with this guy,

1953
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:57,190
I was fucking out cold for a long time.

1954
01:50:57,191 --> 01:51:01,420
My brain was scrambled eggs for a
long time after that fight. And, uh,

1955
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:03,580
as I say,
you can lie to everybody else,

1956
01:51:03,581 --> 01:51:07,210
but now the fight was getting close and
it's in my hometown and it's my first

1957
01:51:07,211 --> 01:51:10,780
title defense and all this.
I'm like, Shit, Shit. I know
I'm better than this guy,

1958
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:15,010
but fuck, last time, last time it
didn't end well. So, uh, I was, uh,

1959
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:19,720
getting a little worked up and I remember
I was at the arena and I was kind of,

1960
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:22,360
you know,
being a little edgy,

1961
01:51:22,361 --> 01:51:25,090
a little snappy with people
and there's not need for it.

1962
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:28,030
And then I just stopped over.
I started laughing and I said,

1963
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,890
what's you laughing at? I said, well,

1964
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,500
what's the worst it's
going to happen if I lose,

1965
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:35,680
what's the word I'm going to lose a fight?
It's happened before,

1966
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:39,220
so why am I stressing myself out of it?
And I just started laughing after that.

1967
01:51:39,221 --> 01:51:42,560
It was fine, but uh, yeah,
yeah, no, it was, uh,

1968
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:49,060
I definitely, uh, had a sour face the
next day after that one for sure. Yeah.

1969
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:53,440
But you, you know, you got
through the fire. Yeah,

1970
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:55,330
no I did and I felt great.

1971
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:59,200
The only problem was in the fifth round
because this cheekbone, it's swollen.

1972
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:04,060
It was on my good side. It's shad, the
cheekbone on the, on my good side and a,

1973
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:07,590
it swelled up so much I could
hardly see out of that eye,

1974
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:11,200
this size Fox as well.
So in the fifth round,

1975
01:52:11,201 --> 01:52:14,650
I'm like trying to like get a certain
angle where I could even see the,

1976
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:19,690
do you know what I mean? It was a
nightmare, you know? But uh, yeah.

1977
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:21,310
Got The job done unfortunately.

1978
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:25,600
Is there anything that like is on the
horizon in terms of like medical science

1979
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:28,900
that you're looking at in terms of
being able to fix your eyes? Eh,

1980
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,320
not that I know of. I spoke to
doctors about it, you know, cause I,

1981
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:37,470
I was uh,
yeah,

1982
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:40,660
I was always curious what, what,
what, uh, what could be done.

1983
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:43,180
But I don't think in my lifetime there is,

1984
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:45,350
but the reason I retired was that the gas,
Dylan five,

1985
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:50,060
because I was clear to fi and
the doctors were always like,

1986
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:52,730
we don't really advise it,
but you are cleared.

1987
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:55,130
You've passed the test just
by the skin of your teeth.

1988
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:58,550
And for me that was all well and good.
You gotta do your medical.

1989
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:03,200
The most stressful part of
all of that was when you,

1990
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:05,600
you got to got to do a full training.
Come now,

1991
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:08,630
then fly somewhere and you're going
to see another doctor, a commission,

1992
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:10,340
docs read the way it right.

1993
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,260
And you don't know what this
doctor is going to be like.

1994
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:13,940
You don't know if he
knows anything about eyes.

1995
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:15,380
You don't know if he wants to be a hero.

1996
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:18,110
You don't know if he wants to make
fucking press the guy that pulled the main

1997
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:21,950
event. Do you know what I mean?
Very, very stressful time. So for me,

1998
01:53:21,951 --> 01:53:23,660
the fight was always the easy part.

1999
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:27,400
The hard part was just fucking making it
to the octagon and I got to the Wayne's

2000
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:32,000
and I get cleared up. The feeling was
like, okay, we're good. The fights aren't,

2001
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:35,390
because I didn't know the fire was on
until I got past the commission. Doctor.

2002
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:37,490
How many different fights did
you have to go through like that?

2003
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,750
About 12 something like that.
Fights with,

2004
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:43,180
I'm not sure as as 12 something like that.
Oh Damn

2005
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,960
Belcher. Kang Lee Belcher. Tim Kennedy.

2006
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:52,760
Kung Lou Rockhold CB tells lies.
And this is silver.

2007
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:55,520
Luke Rockhold,
Dan Henderson,

2008
01:53:56,210 --> 01:54:00,640
GSP gasoline. 11 1111 yeah. Yeah.

2009
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:04,730
So that was stressful. And
then obviously, you know,

2010
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:08,080
I lost the belt and I would in
my mind, every tired, you know,

2011
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:11,060
I just hadn't made it formal yet. And, uh,

2012
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:14,450
I was driving up for lunch
with my wife and my in laws,

2013
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:18,790
they were in town and we heard on the
Sirius Xm fight club dilute Thomas show.

2014
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:20,510
He was talking about,
and this is Silva silver testing,

2015
01:54:20,511 --> 01:54:24,890
positive for steroids and they
needed a replacement. And I said,

2016
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,230
should I do it? And they were
like, what are you talking about?

2017
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:28,700
So I text Dana right then and there,

2018
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:33,610
and then a week later I'm on a plane to
Shanghai, no training, I'd done anything.

2019
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:37,360
I'm like, well, I mean, I trained as
soon as I found out about that, you know,

2020
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,060
I mean, I, you know,

2021
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:42,560
I aspire it a few times and then got on
a plane and went out there and, uh, yeah,

2022
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:45,860
you know, God bless him. He got
me. But then after the fight,

2023
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,640
because you know, as I said, you
know, I was cleared to fight,

2024
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:51,470
but the doctors always said,

2025
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:54,500
we don't recommend it because if
anything happens to you, good eye,

2026
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:57,710
you're going to, you're going to be in
a real problem. And I was like, well,

2027
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:02,690
so many fighters in the UFC have long
careers and they don't get detached

2028
01:55:02,691 --> 01:55:06,920
witness. Okay. It's, it's,
it's a very, not rare,

2029
01:55:06,921 --> 01:55:10,160
but it's pretty rare. Pretty read or
hear about it too much when I'm thinking,

2030
01:55:10,161 --> 01:55:13,130
okay, well the strike, the
lightenings already struck. Okay,

2031
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:15,680
lightening isn't going to strike twice.
You know what I mean?

2032
01:55:15,681 --> 01:55:18,050
I'm not that fucking unlucky anyway.

2033
01:55:18,051 --> 01:55:21,020
So we have the gas in them fight and
then we go to an after party in Shanghai.

2034
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,480
I mean some club and a,

2035
01:55:23,481 --> 01:55:26,090
I'm in the club and every time I look
that way and he still does it to this day,

2036
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:30,020
every time I look that way,
like a bolt of lightening,

2037
01:55:30,021 --> 01:55:34,620
like I'm slouching around
when you do that. Yeah. Work.
What do you see? Was it art?

2038
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:36,860
Someone's taking lasher yeah.
Yeah.

2039
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:39,840
And I was in this club and every time
I'm looking at it's doing that and,

2040
01:55:39,841 --> 01:55:44,220
and I start freaking out, cause
I know you, I've got history of,

2041
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:47,640
of symptoms with eye problems and
whatever. And I start telling myself,

2042
01:55:47,641 --> 01:55:51,170
I don't believe this. I've got a
detached retina in my good eye and I'm,

2043
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:53,130
I'm freaking out. And, uh,

2044
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,250
I didn't want to be in a nightclub around
a bunch of fucking dickheads anyway or

2045
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:59,360
drinking. I hate nightclubs. So, um,

2046
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:04,380
I said I'm just going to go to the
toilet and a restroom. And, uh,

2047
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:05,970
that was it. I was leaving, you know,

2048
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:09,930
but I just wanted to be by myself and I
left there and shed a little tear in the

2049
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:10,271
taxi.

2050
01:56:10,271 --> 01:56:12,840
I didn't want to be sat in the fucking
nightclub crying because if people see me

2051
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:15,320
crying, they're gonna blow. He's crying.
Cause bless him, he lost a fight to gas.

2052
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:16,111
Dillon was like,
no,

2053
01:56:16,111 --> 01:56:19,290
I'm not crying cause I lost a fight to
gas them crying because I might be going

2054
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:23,580
fucking blind here. You know what I
mean? So, uh, so I jump in a taxi,

2055
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:28,581
I got back to my hotel and then a layer
on Perillo and a few guys came back,

2056
01:56:29,170 --> 01:56:32,880
see if I was okay and you know,
whatever.

2057
01:56:32,881 --> 01:56:35,370
We just carried on talking and having
a few drinks at the room and forgot all

2058
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:39,450
about it. And uh, you know, I'll turn
into a bit of a messy one in Shanghai,

2059
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:43,980
forgot all about my eye and the next
thing I'm on a plane flying home and I'd

2060
01:56:43,981 --> 01:56:46,510
forgotten all about it.
I fall asleep on the plane.

2061
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:49,710
I wake up halfway home problem
flying over the Pacific somewhere,

2062
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:52,240
the planes pitch black and then albums,

2063
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:57,390
he starts doing it again. I'm like, Shit,
because I've forgotten all about it.

2064
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,840
So trying to get a Wifi on the plane,
trying to find something about it,

2065
01:57:00,841 --> 01:57:03,870
trying to Google it, what it could be
and all the rest of it. And the wife,

2066
01:57:03,871 --> 01:57:08,280
I would at work and I'm going off on him
trying to beg the air hostess, you know,

2067
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:12,360
please, please do I need to get a Wifi?
I need, I have to. I didn't tell her why.

2068
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:15,850
And she said, nice, it's down right
now. And I'm like, Oh fuck. Anyway,

2069
01:57:15,851 --> 01:57:19,170
so our land there, call my eye doctor
straight away. I tell him, I said, listen,

2070
01:57:19,171 --> 01:57:22,130
I think I've got a detached retina
and her good eye. Why'd he say that?

2071
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:25,410
Tell them the stories is don't worry,
don't worry. You know, he'd be okay.

2072
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:30,680
So I go see an eye doctor the
next day. And uh, he says, well,

2073
01:57:30,681 --> 01:57:35,000
I told him the issue and he says, why do
you say that? And I tell him why. I said,

2074
01:57:35,001 --> 01:57:37,020
so do you think it's a detached
retina? And he says, well,

2075
01:57:37,021 --> 01:57:40,230
it certainly sounds like one.
I'm like, fuck me. He says, okay,

2076
01:57:40,231 --> 01:57:43,050
we're going to put some drops in your
eyes. Everything's going to go blurry.

2077
01:57:43,051 --> 01:57:46,910
And I only see a tiny bit out this
eye. And I'm like, ah, I made,

2078
01:57:46,911 --> 01:57:49,510
I make stupid joggers. My
defense mechanism on like, oh,

2079
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:53,250
I guess a better get used to this view
way, Huh? And the doctor's like, well,

2080
01:57:53,251 --> 01:57:55,920
we don't know that just
yet. And I'm like, fuck me.

2081
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:00,630
Do you know that's not the answer
I was expecting anyway. Turns out,

2082
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:04,680
didn't have a detached retina. I had a
partial vitreous detachment. So you have,

2083
01:58:04,681 --> 01:58:06,540
you,
you're a cornea here,

2084
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:10,440
you retina at the back and in
between what's called bitchy fluid,

2085
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:14,250
millions of fibers connect to
the retina to send a message.

2086
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:16,260
I think if I'm getting it
wrong, I'm sorry, doctors.

2087
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:20,880
And in your sixties that
just slides off the retina,

2088
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:24,990
detaches naturally. Maybe you 60,
70, who knows? But as you get older,

2089
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:28,830
through old age, it just slides
off. It can detach due to trauma.

2090
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:34,140
So that's what happened to me. Uh, so it,
it, it, but it had partially detached.

2091
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,680
So, but the problem was when
these fibers are polling,

2092
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:42,400
they can cause the retina to tear. So,
uh, they were, they were like, well,

2093
01:58:42,401 --> 01:58:45,610
we need to keep an eye on this and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So anyway,

2094
01:58:45,611 --> 01:58:48,910
long story short, after that, I thought,
fuck this. Yeah, they ain't worth it.

2095
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:53,470
And if they've done anything to the
isense no, and there's nothing to be done.

2096
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:56,580
There's nothing that be done. Nothing
can be done now. Yeah. And, and,

2097
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:00,010
and they're fine with it.
They're happy with it. It,
it's okay. But it, but it was,

2098
01:59:00,011 --> 01:59:04,480
for me it was, it was, uh,
you know, a step too far.

2099
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:09,730
I pushed it as far as I, you know, I was
willing to push. In fact, I'm a liar.

2100
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:14,320
I was at a spouse to fight with shard
in London earlier this year, but, uh,

2101
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:18,670
we couldn't agree on the deal
terms with the UFC fight.

2102
01:59:18,671 --> 01:59:20,470
Never materialized.

2103
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:26,170
And I was flying up to New York to
do my podcasts. We've Louis and, uh,

2104
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:31,510
on the plane I'm watching this movie
called the journeyman and Paddy Considine.

2105
01:59:31,511 --> 01:59:33,830
It's about a boxer.
He's a world champion at the end of it,

2106
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:38,530
it wins a fight and then he has
severe brain damage and it's a very,

2107
01:59:38,531 --> 01:59:41,920
very sad movie. She checked it out. It's
really, really powerful. Very, very good.

2108
01:59:41,921 --> 01:59:46,120
Anyway, I watched that in a
fudge. That's it. That was it.

2109
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,000
So I'm going to have the plane. We
started our podcast. I said boom.

2110
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:52,890
I wouldn't even ask him.
What's it good for you? I,

2111
01:59:52,891 --> 01:59:55,660
it was the best decision I ever
made. You know, I've been very,

2112
01:59:55,661 --> 01:59:56,590
very happy ever since.

2113
01:59:56,750 --> 02:00:01,010
Yeah. You, I mean, you have other options.
I mean, you had a long, great career.

2114
02:00:01,011 --> 02:00:02,000
You have options.

2115
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:07,150
Yeah. I mean, as I say, no
regrets, you know, I mean, um,
it, it was a wonderful ride.

2116
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:11,500
I, I loved it. I, I never thought
a young kid doing martial arts and,

2117
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:12,940
and you know,

2118
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:17,860
a guy that liked to have a scrap when
he was a kid could take it this far.

2119
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:20,440
And that's a beautiful thing about
the UFC these days. You know,

2120
02:00:20,441 --> 02:00:22,060
if you're up that certain mindset,

2121
02:00:22,061 --> 02:00:24,610
that certain character you
like a bit of rough and tumble,

2122
02:00:24,611 --> 02:00:27,190
you don't mind getting a punch in the
face here and there and you're willing to

2123
02:00:27,191 --> 02:00:31,600
go for it. You can make your living, you
can make it, you know, when I was younger,

2124
02:00:31,601 --> 02:00:33,400
I used to do a lot of
professional kickboxing,

2125
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:36,370
but I had never looked at it as a
career because it wasn't back then.

2126
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:39,970
But now it's great. You know, it
really is a career viable career.

2127
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:43,890
Well, especially for a guy
like you who's a good talker,

2128
02:00:43,891 --> 02:00:47,430
who understands how to break fights
down and you can make this transition.

2129
02:00:47,431 --> 02:00:51,150
It's one of the things that are really
like about the UFC and they've allowed

2130
02:00:51,151 --> 02:00:52,680
these fighters, like, you know,

2131
02:00:52,681 --> 02:00:57,510
I do a lot of commentary now with Paul
Felder and Daniel Cormier, Dominick Cruz,

2132
02:00:57,511 --> 02:00:59,130
and they've given these guys,
he's,

2133
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:02,730
Oh yeah, it's great. Yeah,
as I was saying before,

2134
02:01:02,731 --> 02:01:07,731
but that was one of the things that scared
me as well as a kid because your gyms

2135
02:01:08,371 --> 02:01:13,290
all over the world and you see amazing
talent everywhere. Amazing talent.

2136
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:16,770
And you know, the, the, the,

2137
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:19,620
the sleeping in the cars
or the sleeping on a couch.

2138
02:01:19,621 --> 02:01:21,500
It's someone's friends
house, you know, and,

2139
02:01:21,501 --> 02:01:25,530
and they're struggling to pay the bills
and the jab and a shitty beat up piece

2140
02:01:25,531 --> 02:01:27,750
of Shit, you know? And it's a shame.

2141
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:31,260
And I see them and in my heart goes
out to them and for whatever reason,

2142
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:33,780
they don't get the breaks.
They'd all look right.

2143
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:36,930
The cop put it together and find out
the nerves get the better of them.

2144
02:01:36,931 --> 02:01:41,480
Who knows what it is. But they just don't
it. You know what, I'm fine. Such a cruel,

2145
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:45,920
vicious sport. It really is. So that's
why when people, I get asked all the time,

2146
02:01:45,921 --> 02:01:48,080
do you want your son to
do it? I might. Well, no,

2147
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:51,020
not really the way icees I
fall so he doesn't have to,

2148
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:55,360
but if he wants to use the number for
frank wrestler in, uh, in California,

2149
02:01:55,410 --> 02:01:58,820
he's seen the videos, he's a CEO.
He's a beast. If he wanted to,

2150
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:02,090
of course I support it.
My father supported me ridiculously.

2151
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:04,980
If it wasn't for my father, I
wouldn't be here either. Um,

2152
02:02:05,690 --> 02:02:06,830
but I wouldn't wish it on him.

2153
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:11,480
I would've wished to life of a fire on
anybody because it's so unpredictable and

2154
02:02:11,481 --> 02:02:13,760
just because you're good and just cause
you can take a punch and just cause

2155
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:17,960
you're, you're an animal in there doesn't
mean you're going to be a success.

2156
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:20,270
You know what I tell you
got to be the perfect storm.

2157
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:23,530
What I tell young fighters is, uh,
you know, when they say, Oh, I'm,

2158
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:26,990
I'm thinking about trying MMA, I go, don't
do it. Yeah. If you're thinking about it,

2159
02:02:26,991 --> 02:02:27,531
don't do it.

2160
02:02:27,531 --> 02:02:30,170
If you tell me you're obsessed with it
and you want to be a world champion,

2161
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:33,980
then I say go ahead. Sure, absolutely.
Yeah. If you're not obsessed,

2162
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:37,130
there's some motherfuckers out there
that, oh yeah, they're living at 24,

2163
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:41,910
seven all day long. They're
there and this is a thing. Um,

2164
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:43,760
you know,
you see a lot of young fighters now,

2165
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:46,580
they're obsessed with the image
and you know, you know what I mean?

2166
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:49,610
Cause it's on TV. It's cool and
it's got a lot of popularity now,

2167
02:02:49,611 --> 02:02:53,120
so a lot of people want to do it. As
I said, this pretenders in coaches,

2168
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:56,250
it's pretenders in fires as
well. A lot of people, you know,

2169
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:59,670
they want to be in,
are they want to be Connor Mcgregor,

2170
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:01,010
they want to be choked with Ella,
whatever,

2171
02:03:01,011 --> 02:03:03,890
and they're all fucking way and tap
out and we're having Mohawks and stuff.

2172
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:06,830
Do you know what I mean?
And they're talking about,

2173
02:03:06,990 --> 02:03:10,400
or for this camp I'm going to
bring in this guy fucking camp.

2174
02:03:10,401 --> 02:03:13,100
You don't have training camps at the
start of your career, right at the start,

2175
02:03:13,110 --> 02:03:15,290
he clear you.
When you train Monday to Friday,

2176
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:16,520
you have a fire at the weekend if you,

2177
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:19,220
when you're back in the gym fucking
Monday. You know what I mean?

2178
02:03:19,221 --> 02:03:22,800
You fight every few weeks. You know,
every, you know, when I was starting,

2179
02:03:22,801 --> 02:03:26,300
and I think I had six fires in the first
year, probably five kickboxing fights.

2180
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:29,720
You're trying to build momentum.
You're not doing camps right.

2181
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:31,880
I don't want to hear any young
fire saying to me for this camp,

2182
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:34,550
I'm focusing on my wrestling.
He's like, shut the fuck up.

2183
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:39,620
You've had two amateur fights. You're not
doing the trading category. Do Training.

2184
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:44,130
That's it. You know, for
sure. Well, listen, Mike, uh,

2185
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:45,110
thanks for doing this,
man.

2186
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:47,600
I'm going to flash it and we could do
it again anytime you learn. Yeah, no,

2187
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:51,110
I don't tell everybody about your podcast
with Louis Gomez. She, yeah. To Louis.

2188
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:54,980
Yeah, absolutely. The big shout Lewis, I
think he's listing all areas guide. Oh,

2189

hilarious. I believe you. Me, uh

2192

2193

hour to check it out, if not, kiss my ass.
