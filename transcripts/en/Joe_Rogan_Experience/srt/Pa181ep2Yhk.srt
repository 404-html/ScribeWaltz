00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello Freak bitches.
Now,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:05,870
the reason why that upsets me is because
it's,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,910
it's,
it's grants people a false sense of

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,150
security and hope.
You know Islam is wonderful,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,330
but we need to attack this separate
thing called Islam Islam.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,090
Well from day one,
1400 years ago,

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,630
Islam was Islam,
Islam.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,870
Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a
spiritual element.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,280
That doesn't mean that most Muslims just
want to practice the spiritual part,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,820
but there is no set of doctrines and a
separate book called radicalized Islam,

11
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,100
Islam.
It all comes from the same texts.

12
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,440
It comes from the Koran,
it comes from the Heidi's,

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,810
and it comes from the Sierra,
the biography of Mohammed,

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,890
so,
so this kind of false narrative that

15
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,740
people are prominently gating so that
they seem as though they're not

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,490
frontally attacking a religion while
laudable.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,920
While Nice,
I get that reflex,

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,720
it's false.
And so again,

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,090
to go back to our point of talking
honestly,

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,350
we need to talk.

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,090
Honestly,
there's only Islam.

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,620
Some people choose to practice it fully.
Some people choose to ignore the ugly

23
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,050
parts,
but there is no such thing as Islamism.

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,610
Islam.
Islam is part of Islam.

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,720
Now you're a person that goes out of
your way to say,

26
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:16,020
no,
we're not talking about the kind sweet

27
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,780
Islamic people that just want to raise
their children now.

28
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:23,781
So how do you sort of manage those two
ideas that they're the same?

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,030
Like when the term radical Islam gets
thrown around,

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,590
right?
So radical Islam simply means I really

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,930
take my Islam seriously,
right?

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,913
It's,
it's.

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,580
Let's draw us a silly analogy.
If I don't eat pork,

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,230
uh,
my radical Jew,

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,530
or am I a Jew right now,
I happen to be Jewish.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,740
I simply ignore the kosher edict that
says,

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,380
don't eat pork.
That's why do you do that though?

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,460
Because in my case,
I simply identify as Jewish in the sense

39
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,670
that at Judaism is a multi attribute
identity.

40
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,000
It includes a shared history,
shared lineage,

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,940
sh,
sh kind of erase.

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,160
It's what some could argue.
It's array,

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,300
so it's considered in a lot of people's
ideas.

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,160
So I could still in the same way that
you might identify as coming from Boston

45
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:14,970
and there's a shared history from all
people who grew up around the time that

46
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:19,380
you grew up in Boston and there was a
sense of affiliation and tribalism,

47
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,510
would that reality being Jewish as far
as I'm concerned and for most Jews is

48
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,720
exactly that.
We don't necessarily take the religious

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,640
elements very seriously.
Now.

50
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:34,641
That doesn't mean that we are practicing
a light Judaism or non radical Judaism.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,870
We're simply ignoring those parts of
Judaism that we choose to ignore.

52
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,700
So there is no such thing as radical
Islam.

53
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:46,701
There are no books called radical Islam.
There is a set of doctrines called Islam

54
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,470
and then I could do what's called
cafeteria Islam,

55
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,770
which is I pick and choose the parts
that I wish to adhere to.

56
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,440
So again,
the discourse is a false narrative.

57
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,830
I understand the reason for it because
people find it rather Gauche to attack

58
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,000
frontally it religion at least to attack
Islam.

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,720
So they have to.
I call this the,

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,320
the,
the ISM magic eucharistic rite.

61
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,360
You add ism to something.
It makes it bad.

62
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,520
Islam as good Islam,
Islam is bad.

63
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,301
Yeah.
But that's,

64
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,260
um,
that's a characteristic that I see in

65
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:21,310
almost everybody that I respect.
They all think that everything they do

66
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,840
socks or at least they have very,
very high standards and an often

67
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,090
disappointed by their own work.
Well,

68
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,770
you know,
I think I have some of that,

69
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,250
but I also have that idea of like,
it's something that I've,

70
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,940
I don't know if I talked about my dad
with you,

71
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,460
but um,
he was my wrestling coach in high

72
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,294
school.
Uh,

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
he was also my,
uh,

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,520
earth science biology and environmental
studies teacher.

75
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,900
She was my teacher.
Well,

76
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:50,590
what a drag you went to school,
your dad being the fucking.

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
I learned a lot because he was no joke.
He didn't pull any punches from me.

78
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:54,940
He,
you know,

79
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,470
he drove me as hard,
if not harder than his other students.

80
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,630
He didn't show any favoritism,
but one of the things that was always

81
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:04,450
his thing on the mat,
and I'm kind of paraphrasing,

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,070
but basically you,
you either win or you learn,

83
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,430
especially in that high school college
setting,

84
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,293
you're,
you're,

85
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,890
you're learning about yourself.
If you,

86
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:19,480
if you went out there and you got your
ass handed to you and you just got beat

87
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,370
and didn't learn anything,
well yeah,

88
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,040
you're a fucking loser.
Take the moment,

89
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,570
reflect on it,
build on what you did wrong and you now

90
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,910
you're actually gonna.
Wave one.

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Now you know more about yourself.
You know about where your your

92
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,270
limitations are,
what you need to improve and expand your

93
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,380
talents are your limitations.

94
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,380
So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing,
I'm always looking at it from a learning

95
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:49,080
perspective so there aren't necessarily
mistakes unless they're fatal and then

96
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,570
you wouldn't know anyway.
So whatever that really is the right way

97
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,790
to look at everything.
You win or you learn.

98
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,130
You know you have great experiences
because you were successful or you have

99
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:03,700
very beneficial experiences because you
realized what went wrong.

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,380
What is just one more wrinkle,
one more piece of information or one

101
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:13,180
more experience that you can add to your
database of knowledge and it'll make you

102
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,530
better at everything.
So that,

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,320
and a lot of ways,
that's my biggest frustration in life is

104
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:22,321
when there is something that Kinda goes
wrong and I can't figure out what it was

105
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,580
that's frustrating for me because I
can't,

106
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,320
I can't build on it.
I can't learn from it,

107
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:31,321
but I don't understand what went wrong,
but whether it's a relationship or

108
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,860
whether it's something I tried to build
or something I did or how often does

109
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,480
that happen?
A lot,

110
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,160
you know,
you know,

111
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,140
there's a couple of times I've actually
had an opportunity to do,

112
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,870
have a uh,
vocal with somebody else as a guest

113
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:48,871
singer and I know rehearsal was great
and then you blew it for the,

114
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,730
for the main event.
And I'm like,

115
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,770
what did I do wrong?
I did everything the same.

116
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,310
And until you can actually pinpoint that
and figure out what it was,

117
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm a fucking mess.
Like I'm slipping.

118
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,270
I'm waking up in the middle of the night
trying to figure out what the fuck went

119
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,650
wrong.
And then when you're done with that,

120
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,590
you've got to figure out a way to get
that thing from dead deer to meet.

121
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,710
And all the other things.
So it's just so complex.

122
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:14,800
How would you ever expect somebody to
just to be,

123
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,000
have like a desire.
You were like that at some point.

124
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,830
Well,
Rinella opened the door for me to have

125
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,220
that super lucky forever grateful
because when he took me into a wild back

126
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,580
country,
Montana.

127
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,020
Yeah,
you gotta get to the nuts.

128
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,670
The first year it was a three breaks in
the Missouri breaks in October,

129
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,730
nine degrees out.
Freezing your dick off every night and

130
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,050
attend like lifeless Steven Ella.
That's kind of.

131
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,990
What was it?
He loves suffering.

132
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,820
He loves it.
But I love that he loves it.

133
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,160
He's legit as they come.
He really is.

134
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
I think that's it,
right?

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,100
There is just this,
there's this big gap.

136
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,780
And my father got me into it,
but I,

137
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,800
my brother doesn't.
Doesn't hunt and.

138
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,390
But I think he has a respect for it and
understands what's going on.

139
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:59,310
But he just,
I think at the time that I was

140
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:02,400
introduced to hunting,
my brother was more interested in going

141
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,070
out with his friends and Saturday
mornings were not for getting up early.

142
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,860
And so we're essentially the same
person,

143
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,980
but I just went this way and he didn't
go that way.

144
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,660
Right.
So it's a weird.

145
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:16,260
So you could be in the same house with
somebody in a different way.

146
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,980
Well,
Rinella has a real good way of looking

147
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:18,870
at it too.
He's like,

148
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,800
uh,
I don't expect people to go out and get

149
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:24,610
rid of their own sewage.
Why should I expect them to go out and

150
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,320
hunt their own food like you don't have
to?

151
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,971
Well,
and he's,

152
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:28,620
I think he probably said this at some
point,

153
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,930
um,
or somebody smart did.

154
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,930
It was like I choose,
I believe it.

155
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:38,120
I choose to for meat to be the one thing
that I grabbed ahold of to bring into

156
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,450
my,
to my skill set.

157
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,850
I don't knit my own clothes.
I don't,

158
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,240
I don't make my own shoes.
I don't build my own houses.

159
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,310
You know,
we were just looking at some

160
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:48,720
construction stuff a little bit earlier.
I'm like,

161
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,010
dude,
I don't know what.

162
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,120
Yeah,
what are they doing?

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,080
What are they doing?
Yeah.

164
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,050
I couldn't do that.
I just picked this one thing because

165
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:58,830
it's also part of my passion,
so you couldn't just ask someone who's a

166
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,250
construction worker to go like,
go hunt,

167
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,980
get some meat.
I know you have a desire for that,

168
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:09,981
so that's just another hard part about
hunting and and non hunters by proxy are

169
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:15,021
essential to hunting always in industry
and opinion and because we could

170
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,190
legislate ourselves out of being able to
hunt.

171
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,600
That can happen.
One is a privileged man.

172
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:24,540
That's not a right and a lot of ways and
so that's another whole nother can of

173
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,800
worms,
but it could.

174
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,210
It could go away.
Yeah.

175
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,910
I think the.
The issue is that so many people are

176
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:34,911
opposed to it because they're so removed
from the realities of the wild and they

177
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:40,260
just feel some sort of moral superiority
by either not eating meat entirely or by

178
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,110
not killing their own meat.
The not killing their own meat is really

179
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:45,420
ridiculous.
Like my wife was having a conversation

180
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,880
with someone.
They were out to dinner with a bunch of

181
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:52,881
people while I was on El con and the guy
was eating a steak guy from England in

182
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,930
England and will hunt or they've do
these,

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
these like foxes and

184
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,690
horses and shit,
and they were like,

185
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,360
tweed pussies,
Kesari England.

186
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,330
We love you guys carving a steak.
And my wife goes,

187
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,950
oh,
he's actually out elk hunting.

188
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,780
And the guy goes,
he hunts.

189
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,460
That's deplorable.
The guy said,

190
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,950
does deplorable.
He's carving a steak,

191
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,960
was saying something the other day.
And I got.

192
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,873
I got a lot of,
like,

193
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,890
people were looking at me like I was
weird at work.

194
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,810
Uh,
one of my buddies at work was eating a

195
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,890
chicken sandwich from chick filet and I
look on the bag and there's a cartoon

196
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,290
chicken on the bag.
And in my mind I'm like,

197
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,150
well,
that's like building a swimming pool by

198
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,430
the lake.
That's fucking weird and irony that,

199
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,860
that were like saying,
Hey,

200
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,260
I'm eating the chicken,
but here's a cartoon version of it so we

201
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,590
can celebrate the fact that we just
murdered this chicken and we fried it

202
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,090
up.
Like that doesn't make sense like a

203
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:42,160
swimming pool with a lake as smart
because it's Paris.
