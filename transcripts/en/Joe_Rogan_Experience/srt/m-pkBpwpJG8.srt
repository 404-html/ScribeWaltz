1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,180
Did you ever do that in studio?

2
00:00:01,181 --> 00:00:03,100
I feel like our thing
cause you do sex and candy.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,640
No,

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:03,870
no,

5
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,040
no.

6
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,810
I know I did.

7
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,640
Do you want that?

8
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,473
You want to know,

9
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,350
okay,

10
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,640
this is my version of
the songs by the way,

11
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,290
when I covered so many songs I just,

12
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,390
I just Kinda do what I think it is.

13
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,290
That song was a song that I liked
the first few times and it came out.

14
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:21,430
I thought it was interesting because
I'd never heard a song like that and um,

15
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,473
I kind of grew up.

16
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,370
But you,

17
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,623
your version of it,

18
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,710
it's very different.

19
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:28,090
It's a little bit faster I think.

20
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,983
Well it's cooler.

21
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,970
It's a good song,

22
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:31,141
man.

23
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,340
I,

24
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,320
that's a very good song.

25
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:35,380
I liked it a lot is when I
often like warm myself up with.

26
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,214
So yeah.

27
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:37,661
But again,

28
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:38,890
this is my version and you know,

29
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,783
if I butcher it up,

30
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,680
y'all just going to have
to dig it like that.

31
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,603
You know what I mean?

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,720

The show.

41
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,170
The show is a tree

42
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,743
downtown

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,110
platform.

44
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,080
Double Swede

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,480
Pack.

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,830

chair who's at cast?

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,050
Leo Stills in that direction.

56
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,120
My spin match.

57
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,030
I could understand the words in that.

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,383
Like there's,

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,260
there's a bunch of the words in that
other one where I don't know what the fuck

60
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,870
who was saying devious
stairs in my direction now.

61
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,470
I know.

62
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,140
I thought it was like beefeater
stairs and my direction somewhere.

63
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,280
I know I threw a really
bad cold somewhere.

64
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,260
Please.

65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,090
It was beautiful.

66
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,870
Kept it moving so hopefully it did work.

67
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,880
I love the slang that I smell.

68
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,290
They're real slow and they do it too.

69
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,124
Like

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,040
you know,

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,770
it's real.

72
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,800
I think the guy who was singing that song,

73
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,634
the original dude,

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,900
it's a great version,

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,150
but it's the version of
a is trying to get laid.

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,141
He's like,

77
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:47,980
he's trying to be sexy.

78
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,970
It's being a little sexy.

79
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,870
He's working on it.

80
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,723
I fuck.

81
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,110
You'll still get laid

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,370
and it is a sexy song.

83
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,390
It is very sexy

84
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,170
fucking sexy song.

85
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,370
If you imagine what Saks and
candy would actually smell like,

86
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:03,581
though,

87
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,490
that'd be a fucking weird gummy
bears and yeast infections.

88
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,850
I was thinking snickers bars and bleach

89
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,240
rats.

90
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,073
They

91
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,550
snatched.
