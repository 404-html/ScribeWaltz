1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,293
Okay.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,280
Well good.

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,003
Yes,

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,960
we're back. Ladies and gentlemen. Look,

5
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:26,600
Greg Fitzsimmons is right in the
letter of Santa Right now plays,

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,040
it's not too late next year.
So always next year.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,030
I was thinking about Santa with uh,
the elves.

8
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:38,840
Isn't there a funny metaphor that like
he's got all these little elves working

9
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,550
to make children's toys for no money.

10
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:44,180
And then you think about our toys do come
from China. That is kind of fucked up.

11
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:46,640
But Chinese people weren't elves,
dude to children.

12
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:51,410
How rude their children are making
the toys, little else children.

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,030
That is kind of fucked up.
Yeah.

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,140
The whole idea of getting a
bunch of people to work for

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,390
way less than they would ever make here
is kind of a weird accepted thing that

16
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:07,380
we have as far as like our items, our
electronics and the things that we love.

17
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,820
Like almost all of them are made by
people in another country working for shit

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,654
money.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,370
That's NAFTA, man. We opened it up.

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,590
So what it is the WTO to trade
organization, he has basically, you know,

21
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:23,950
they used to be slavery and with
slavery you paid, you paid the help,

22
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,050
nothing or very little and a,

23
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:29,380
you had to house them and you had to
feed them and you have to heal them.

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,050
You go to a third world country,
it's slavery,

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,760
but you don't have to deal
with any of the overhead

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,960
Yo. Cause they don't really care
if they own you all the time.

27
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:42,010
They just care if they own you enough
so that you show up and do what you have

28
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,640
to do.
Exactly like the,

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,230
the idea that you're just free to
wander around and quit and come back.

30
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:52,000
But if you keep them in economic slavery
essentially always going to be in

31
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:52,834
slave.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,240
Well that's a mark Saturday
that capitalism depends on a, a,

33
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,370
a certain percentage of the population
being hardcore Unemployable's so that you

34
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,960
can always say there's somebody else.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,360
Ooh,
that's weird.

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,070
It's weird because I like the idea that
people can do whatever they want them to

37
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,700
do with their life. They can, they
can make whatever choices they would,

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,300
they would like to make. They could take
on whenever, any job they want. But it's,

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,110
it's strange when you think of someone
who's so far ahead of the game,

40
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,000
like some Warren Buffet type character,
not him.

41
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,310
I don't know what kind of business
he owns. Sam Walton, some dude,

42
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,360
some what's make up some fucking
billionaire character. Right.

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Who decides he can make x amount more
per year if they open up a shop and

44
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:41,270
Guatemala and they just close up that
one they have here in the states,

45
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,270
a little too pricey. This one's
going to make us, you know,

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,340
x amount more on the dollar.
Yeah.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,350
And probably he will never
even know what is it.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,850
He will l it's a fucking,

49
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:53,560
it's another zero and it column
and in one of his and it,

50
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,550
and it crazy thing is, is that, you know,
I don't know, I'm not super wealthy,

51
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,990
but if I,
I would really

52
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,670
be thinking about a different agenda than
making more, you know, you really feel,

53
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,470
look at the people that
create, um, you know,

54
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:10,760
an economy within their own country
or within their own community and a,

55
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,630
at the same time live
the life that they deal.

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,140
Never fucking eat that money up anyway.
And look at you.

57
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:20,600
You got your own little
in your little economy,

58
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,890
you've got a little podcast coming off
of yours and you got people that work for

59
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:28,610
you and comedians that you bring on the
road and you know, it's, it's everywhere.

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,970
It's almost like,
you know,

61
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,580
I hate that expression that
Obama used when he was running,

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,390
when he was in office about small
businesses. You didn't do that alone.

63
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,010
He didn't do that by herself. Right.
But the reality is his point was,

64
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,160
was right. And it's, it's
right with everything. Like,

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,630
you can't sell iPhones if no one shows
up for work in the factory. Right.

66
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,160
If everyone goes, fuck you, you
can't pay me 25 cents an hour,

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,920
fuck you, then we don't
have iPhones anymore. Yeah.

68
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,420
But because we know that these
people were poor, not we were not,

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,080
we don't have any iPhone factories, but
because they know these people are poor,

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,850
they can continue doing that. Yeah.
That's so weird. Man. That's so weird.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,670
They're jumping off the building so much.
They have nets around them.

72
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,390
You look at that, right? He
didn't know that. Nah. God, dude,

73
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,410
the Foxconn factories are terrifying
because those people live there.

74
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,260
They have dormitories there, the
eat there, live there, asleep there,

75
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,710
and they have nets all around them.
And this is where it gets really weird.

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,131
You know,

77
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:32,131
there's always gonna be people who on
the hardcore right will always argue

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,080
towards whatever's like economically
best for the company. Yeah.

79
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,840
They'll somehow or another come up with
some justification for what kind of

80
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:45,640
damage? Tapping an oil well do or
oil spills or, or this kind of shit.

81
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,900
But this guy said to me, he goes, well,
you know, if you look at the numbers,

82
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:53,770
it's actually very similar to the
number of people that commit suicide and

83
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,930
overall population because
you've got to look at it.

84
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,860
There's like 500,000 people working at
this factory. Yeah. Or some crazy number.

85
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,470
I just made that up. We should
find out what the actual number is,

86
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,990
but it's some nutty number like that.
You're talking about thousands of people,

87
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,250
olfactory complex.
It has a half million people there.

88
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,810
I don't think it's a half a million.
I made that up,

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,170
but it might be 50,000 whatever it is.

90
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,020
There's so many people that work there
that there the amount of people that are,

91
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,960
that commit suicide on the job or
correctly portion to a normal city. Right.

92
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,210
Which is okay, I get it, but how many
people killed themselves at work?

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,500
I was going to go down.

94
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,830
Okay.

95
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,890
It'd be at my job.
I'm taking a couple people with me.

96
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,340
I really think suicide is
the only reason I would kill,

97
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,730
kill myself is that I want it to
kill some other people and I don't,

98
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:43,810
I don't want to do the time.

99
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,890
God Damn. That's what a lot of people
do it when they know the Jig is up. Yup.

100
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,950
Let's put that gun in their head.
I just that feeling roof.

101
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,850
Imagine that moment before you committed
suicide. What was what's called high?

102
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:02,480
Your heart rate would be pacing,
dealing with your own mortality.

103
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,710
The biggest question,

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,550
and we both know people who've
done it right. You know,

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,540
I know two people that I know.
One guy that did it pretty well,

106
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,440
I knew him pretty well. He was a really
nice time. It was really disturbing.

107
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,370
It really hurt. Like you know you,
you hear the seven was in such pain,

108
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:24,550
they put a gun to their head. You're
like, yeah, I really liked that guy.

109
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,480
Like that's fucked.
Like I dunno what tipped left or right.

110
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,550
It is a chemical makeup or his life's,
you know, situation and circumstances,

111
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:38,290
whatever it was. But God
damn, that's a, that's a sad,

112
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:42,230
sad thing that the game gets
so far gone that Gillette,

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,150
there's just got to pull the plug. I just
going to flip the board over. This is,

114
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,290
this is never going to work out

115
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,260
because the instinct to not kill yourself
is so strong at the pain that would

116
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,620
make you do.
It must just be something you can imagine.

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,100
You know, I've talked to quite a few
people now with what you would call it,

118
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:06,101
depression or have had depression and
overcome it or have had any sort of mental

119
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,640
issues and had to take medication
for it and overcome it.

120
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,140
And I just think we vary so much ma'am.

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,000
I think human bring our minds and what we
could go our norm, what makes us happy,

122
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:20,511
like whatever,

123
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:25,130
whatever your state is that what you
need to achieve to get out of like the

124
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:29,720
muck, like the, the, the down feeling,
what another person needs to achieve.

125
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:32,780
It could be very different, right? Yeah.
You know, it's just like everything else.

126
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:35,570
Like people that are tall,
people that are short, freckles,

127
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,291
whatever the fuck it is.

128
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,480
We vary so much that we gotta be really
careful when we like look at like, yeah.

129
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,340
Wow. How could he do that?
He had such a good life.

130
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,830
Like you might've been good
life for you on the outside,

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,910
but that guy was in like some
sort of chemical hell all of that,

132
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,850
huh? Yeah. With the x theory or maybe
doesn't have much to do with the interior.

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,670
I mean if you talk about the statistics
of people committing suicide,

134
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,710
I wonder if it's not about the same and
the lower class as it is in the upper

135
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,544
class.

136
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,660
I wonder, you know what
I mean? I don't, I don't,

137
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,140
I don't know if that's really the factor
because I think there's quite a few

138
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:07,160
people,
like they said,

139
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:12,161
Mexico is one of the happiest countries
on earth and it was also like not a very

140
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:16,490
wealthy country and staff community.
Yeah, there's, I think there's,

141
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,170
there's a benefit to that that we don't
recognize because we're so wrapped up in

142
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:25,610
the idea of community money
accumulating dollars that we forget.

143
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,430
Like that's only part of wealth.

144
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,350
Like the really intelligent wealth is
keeping the vibe good as long as possible.

145
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,980
Whether it's happiness with friends,
happiness with coworkers,

146
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,180
happiness with what you do for a living,
pride in, in your accomplishments,

147
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,800
whatever the fuck it is that it takes
to keep feeling included in a group of

148
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,590
people. That's huge.
That's huge for everybody.

149
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,510
People have always wanted to deny that.

150
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,810
Everybody wants to be the rugged
individualist, but that's too,

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,980
well, that's our, that's
our whole mythology

152
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,550
in this country. It's the, you know, the
guy riding off alone into the sunset.

153
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:03,570
That's America. That's the
cool guy in every movies to
go. Doesn't need the chick.

154
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,480
Right?
You never seen with a buddy.

155
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,950
He's got one black buddy and that guy
dies in the first act. Somehow or another,

156
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,160
he just gets on a horse and it's like,
I gotta go.

157
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,890
It just gets on that fucking horse.
Did you see that commercial?

158
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,290
And I would rarely quote a commercial.
I think when it's funny,

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,860
but it's like this chick and she's saying
goodbye to a guy and a, it's a hell.

160
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:27,630
It's an insurance commercial and she's
in like a big prairie dress with a bonnet

161
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,970
and he's the real cowboy and he's
putting his hat on and he's like, uh,

162
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,170
I got to go off into the sunset
and she's pulling it like, no, no.

163
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,410
And then he rides off towards the
sunset and then he just falls off.

164
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,860
It's just so fucking
immediate. So funny. Um,

165
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,200
yeah, but that's it, man. Being being
loners, um, is, it's an important thing.

166
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:54,100
I think as a, as Comedians,
obviously that's a solo craft.
Podcasting is, you know,

167
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:54,931
a solo craft,

168
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,340
but at the same time to feel part of a
group and I think like you and I have

169
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:03,240
both gone to the comedy store,
uh, it's become part of our lives.

170
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,960
Mine for the first time,
yours for the second act.

171
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,130
And it's like a great feeling
to be doing your solo thing,

172
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:14,190
but you're surrounded by other people
that have the same background and are

173
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,120
following the same path and you know,
you really feel very included there.

174
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,210
Yeah, it's a really good vibe.
It's a, it's a way better vibe.

175
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,980
And it was the first time I was there.
Yeah,

176
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,190
like I really believe is the Internet.

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,560
I think the Internet has inspired more
people to try stand up that were on like

178
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,590
maybe the right frequency
to be to become a comic.

179
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,710
They recognize in their own personality
all the shit that we talk about that's

180
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,680
wrong with us. They're like,
oh, maybe I'm just a comic.

181
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,010
Like maybe like I might be able to
do that. I make people laugh at work.

182
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,980
I might literally be able to do that.
I think more people were inspired by that.

183
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,490
And then also when you hear a bunch
of comics doing these podcasts,

184
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:54,330
talking about comedy like as an art form
and what's involved in it and you kind

185
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:59,331
of get a sense like this guy described
it to me and he became an open miker and

186
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,050
now he's actually have a working comic.

187
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,410
You started out doing it from hearing
us talk about it on the podcast,

188
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,020
but doing comedy like I think he
said like two and a half years now,

189
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,930
but he said it's like taking
a master's class in comedy.

190
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,050
He listened to the bill burr and talk
about how he writes jokes it listening to

191
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,630
Greg Fitzsimmons talk about
the differences treatment,

192
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:18,330
his act now and his act
then where the errors are.

193
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,380
He'd get Joey Diaz talking about like
how we learned to let go and how he had

194
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,560
fear when he was on and always worried
about people accepting them and one day

195
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,890
he was like, fuck you. And I
remember that turnaround for Joey.

196
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:32,760
This is radical turnaround.
When he was always really funny offstage,

197
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,850
we had a hard time being funny
on stage and then it was like,

198
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,190
like 99 somewhere around that 98 99 boom.

199
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:44,140
He figured it out. Yeah, just
like out of nowhere. Right.

200
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,390
He went quicker than I've
ever seen anybody go from
having a hard time on stage

201
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,070
to destroy.
Yeah.

202
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,380
Like I remember he gained a lot of
weight coincidentally at that same time.

203
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,280
That was how

204
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,900
didn't give a fuck he got,
yeah.

205
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,160
That's when he went from like 210
pounds to like Mike over 300 pounds,

206
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,740
like in a year. But God
damn was he funny. Yeah, he,

207
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:07,720
I've seen it happen with guys and
uh, you know, like Jim Norton, man,

208
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:12,310
he haunted the, the comedy cellar
and those clubs for a decade,

209
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,630
you know, 12 years something before he
got any real traction. And then when he,

210
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,340
when he found his voice, I mean
the guy's, he's just fucking great.

211
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,890
He's phenomenal.
He's a really good comic man.

212
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,120
I saw him in Austin and it was a good
thing for me to see because I was doing

213
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:32,230
sets that maybe we like too long.
Yeah. And he did like 55, 50,

214
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,120
55 minutes and just murdered.
And I'm like,

215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,200
that's a good amount of time because you
don't get tired of a guy, you know, like,

216
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:40,680
I know when people are tired of
hearing me talking, you're going,

217
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,050
but you always feel like there's this
borderline between wanting to give them

218
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,640
their money's worth and just like,

219
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,640
even a great movie sucks after
three and a half hours, you know,

220
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,180
or whatever it is for comedy, an hour
and 10 minutes or whatever the number is.

221
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,110
Yeah. But seeing him, uh,

222
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:58,060
in Austin was great because
I hadn't gone to like a show,

223
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:02,500
like sit down and watch a show in a
while. It always been like, I'm at a set,

224
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,890
oh who's on, you know, oh Bubba buzz
on, Oh let's go peek in real quick.

225
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,950
But to sit down and watch the whole
show, his whole set was really fun. Yeah,

226
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,210
it's really fun.
It is weird to sit down.

227
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,530
Like I just was in Vegas with some friends
and Steven Wright was playing, sadly.

228
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:22,030
I said, fuck man, we was it. It was
great. He was great. Dan, you know,

229
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,410
he was doing a lot of new shit and just,
you know,

230
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,130
everyone was high of course,
and it was just this perfect match.

231
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,700
And then he hung out with us after the
shelf for a while. I told him, my friend,

232
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,020
my friend got so baked,

233
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:38,060
he fell asleep during the shell
and Steven came out and he goes,

234
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:38,891
how'd you guys like the show?

235
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:43,750
And I called my friend Dan fell asleep
and stay right. Could not stop laughing.

236
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,080
And he's like, cause he's, he's been
on my podcast and he's just like,

237
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,460
I in all the years I've done this,

238
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,610
I've never had anybody like throw
somebody under the bus like that.

239
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,010
And he just kept talking
about it for like 15 minutes.

240
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,440
I had some funny thing look about
what people don't want to admit.

241
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,920
They were asleep. All right. All right.
You know I fell asleep during your show.

242
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,940
If you fall asleep,
you been up for 72 hours.

243
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,300
It's the first time he sat still
in 72 hours and Steven right.

244
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,570
If you're going to like that, that's
a, that's not like a Kevin Hart,

245
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,070
like lack of explosion. Yeah.
Steven Wright is the guy. Yeah.

246
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,180
You know like I used to work in a fire,

247
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,650
hard drink factory.
Couldn't park anywhere near the place.

248
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,750
He was like the first Twitter,
you know,

249
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,260
his comedy was Twitter call like easily.

250
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:39,580
He would have been a monster on Twitter
if he put just those jokes on Twitter.

251
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,900
Yeah. But then they would, you
know, you would ruin the bits. Yeah.

252
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,330
Maybe he should go back and
just take all the Shitty,

253
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:49,030
never put out and just start
tweeting it because you know,

254
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,280
that guy doesn't tweet. You
probably doesn't give a shit.
Well, didn't he write it?

255
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:55,640
He was tweeting a whole
book. Oh really? Yeah.

256
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,950
He was doing this weird thing
where he was tweeting a whole book,

257
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:03,800
140 characters at a time. That's
really cool. I love that. Yeah.

258
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,670
I, yeah, I think you would write like a
new hundred and 40 characters every day.

259
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,580
Oh, he, oh. He wasn't just like he
wrote it and he was releasing it.

260
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,940
He was actually, I don't think
so. I think he was doing it like,

261
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,390
how was he doing it?
How many tweets a day was he doing?

262
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,240
It probably had a limited number of
tweets who's doing every day. Yeah.

263
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,710
Explains it on Conan. He explains it
on Conan. We can't play that though.

264
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,060
Would get in trouble. Yeah.
But whatever it is, uh,

265
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,650
he tweeted a book. He said, fucking
Weirdo. That's amazing. He's the guy,

266
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:35,510
man that changed Boston comedy.

267
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,540
That was the one guy that
changed the whole scene. It,

268
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,360
at least if you listen to a,

269
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,810
like the guys that grew up during that
time and that France Alameda documentary

270
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,630
when standup stood out.
So great documentary.

271
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:52,631
It's really cool cause it was like the
generation right before we started,

272
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,600
you had to really let us know
that like how lucky we are.

273
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,950
We got like you and I've
talked about this before,

274
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,110
but we came along at the perfect time
like ever in the history of comics.

275
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,800
That made me now, now it's
pretty God damn good time. Yeah.

276
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:07,700
There's not a lot less money that me and
you are making money right out of the

277
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,270
gate. Hey, we got a car.
He got his 50 bucks kit.

278
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,820
There was so many satellite rooms.
Yeah we could,

279
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:18,650
we were living in Boston and
we could go in any direction.

280
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,150
There was probably two or 300 rooms.
Yeah,

281
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,860
right between Boston comedy
between Sherry Hirsch, between um,

282
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,930
pill. He downs. Paul Barkley. They all
had like Boston comedy. Barry Katz,

283
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,400
his organization had married 50 rooms
problems. They had so many rooms.

284
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,070
So there's, I mean, may maybe
exaggerating saying hundreds,

285
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,730
but it was more than a hundred
rooms all around this area.

286
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,010
And so we could just go to a
different place all the time.

287
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,230
They always needed comics.
And if you were,

288
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,320
if you were a good comic and
you were reliable, and again,

289
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:53,780
if you had a car and you
would pick up the headliner,

290
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,470
you would literally call a guy like Mike
Clark and he would fill seven weekends

291
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,530
on the spot in one phone call and then
you'd call a Barry Katz and he'd fell

292
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:09,830
seven weekends. And like, you
know, in, in, you know, a week,

293
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,910
you talked to five agents and your
year is booked six nights a week.

294
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,240
And then all you got
to do is play softball,

295
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,950
go to the movies and
drive to the Gig at night.

296
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,900
That's a lot of guys fall into that.

297
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,870
Mike Clark had some of the
craziest fucking gigs. Dude,

298
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,550
I did a restaurant for him once.

299
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,540
I was the one opening week and it
never happened again after me. It was,

300
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,980
it was one of the clubs. It
opened and closed it, uh,

301
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,400
because I told them how it was set up and
he agreed that they couldn't do a show

302
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,001
there.
I was like,

303
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:42,470
you just literally can't do a show there
because you do standup at a lounge.

304
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,380
First of all, nobody told these
people there's going to be stand up.

305
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,360
So they're sitting there
waiting to get seated.

306
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,010
It was the biggest seafood and like

307
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,990
this part of the Cape. So
there would be, you know,

308
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:57,270
this giant fucking like room
where people are seeding,

309
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,710
waiting for them to call their
seat and they're now no shit.

310
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:05,070
So when they're calling their
seat and their name or their, uh,

311
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,260
their name and their, you
know, Johnson party of six,

312
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,260
they're doing it on the
same microphone as you.

313
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,250
So you're on stage, you're on
stage. I'm onstage. And uh,

314
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,990
it became a joke after a while.
I'm like,

315
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:23,991
this is like truly hilarious cause you'd
be right up and I'm telling her Johnson

316
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:28,830
party has six, your table's ready. Johnson
party of six. You're table's ready.

317
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,540
Johnson Johnson Party of [inaudible].
And you're like, oh my God. I mean,

318
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm not joking man, because they're
not even in the same room as you.

319
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,160
So they have no fucking idea.
No, no, no. It's a big place.

320
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,970
So like you're in this giant lounge
area with these families there.

321
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,700
You're talking about blow jobs
and these families are like,

322
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,620
what the fuck is going on?

323
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,200
And then it's surreal. It's surreal.
And in the middle of your act,

324
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,630
just right in the middle,
out of nowhere,

325
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,500
there's six birds and Johnson
party of six. Your table's ready.

326
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,100
It was the worst. It was
one of the, it wasn't,

327
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,140
it wasn't the worst cause
the people were friends.

328
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,130
Lee, you know the magic. Just go back
to that same place now and you know,

329
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,680
it's the same restaurant with the
same PA system, the whole thing.

330
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,260
Bring cameras and film your one hour
special with, with them. Come project.

331
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,110
Try to work around this.
Work

332
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,220
the Johnsons, they're heading
into the family. Hey, nice
jacket. Well you know what,

333
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:29,560
if people knew you were filming though,

334
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,630
they would come up with stupid
names and it's just so solar.

335
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,700
You yell out their name.
Take my current party of six.

336
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,950
You're table's ready,
Mike Hunt.

337
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,370
They would probably hate that
kind of comedy out there.

338
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,170
Even no matter how famous you got,

339
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,810
there's like a really conservative
part of the yeah, yeah.

340
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:52,910
The Cape is very family. It's
very Norman Rockwell tight. Yeah.

341
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,460
Right. And they leave the Cape. And my
friend dated this girl from the Cape,

342
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:01,180
but she, she became a, a whore and
a crack head. He, she was as sweet,

343
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:03,760
like preppy girl from the Cape,
came from money,

344
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,890
moved to Venice beach and all of a
sudden she was getting skinny and they'll

345
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,280
send, she had a herpes virus on her lip
and he got it from her and then, and then,

346
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,910
and then he found,
I think he found an ad,

347
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,290
like she had the newspaper with the
classified section where she had put an ad

348
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:25,291
is back before the Internet for
herself and she was selling herself,

349
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,911
selling herself.

350
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:32,110
And then she came by and so they broke
up and she came by like a year later with

351
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:36,400
another dude. She weighed
like 90 pounds. Wow.

352
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,100
Having the Cape on the Cape, man. Well,

353
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,380
there's a lot of sheltered people
up in that neck of the woods.

354
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,820
It's beautiful though. Oh, it's
great. It's so nice. In the summer,

355
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,280
especially in the,
there's something about

356
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,940
it. It's just so gray and the
water is so unforgiving. You know?

357
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,280
It's the something Cooley,

358
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:58,150
but even being cold walking around the
beach and the winter was always weird for

359
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,560
me.
I enjoy it.

360
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,570
You look at the trees and with no leaves
on them and they just look strong.

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,770
Everything is strong because it's just
getting battered by wind and cold and it

362
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:09,340
also like,

363
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,050
it gives you this sense of cycle that
I think we miss out on a bit of here.

364
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,250
I think the cycle,

365
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,970
the seasons is much more normal than no
seasons and what we're doing is we're

366
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:21,670
all sort of adapting our,

367
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,050
our like perceptions of nature on this
really unrealistic spot. Yeah. You know,

368
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,620
as power and fucking
never rains stalled out.

369
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,370
I mean it gets kind of hot for a while,
but just go near the water.

370
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:36,820
You'll be fine now. You need it. You
need the cycle that's in my house.

371
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:41,821
We celebrate my wife's menstrual
flow change clothes like fall,

372
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,950
we'll go fall and then fall colors.

373
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,660
He had fall colors on her timber
on her September dripping.

374
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,680
Did you see that? Um, I don't
know if this is bullshit or not.

375
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,400
Somebody said to me on Twitter and I
looked at, it was about to get in my car.

376
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,270
I was like,
what?

377
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,750
It was something about women that don't
want to be forced to wear maxi pads or

378
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,690
tampons. I think it's bullshit.
So they're just going natural.

379
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,520
They're just doing natural flow.

380
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,870
Like the literally in your face about
their period blood dripping out of their

381
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:16,840
underwear. They don't give a fuck.
They just wear it like fluffy socks.

382
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,840
I think they just let it drip down
their leg. I mean, it might be bullshit.

383
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,360
I might be getting trolled right now
because I just looked at it like,

384
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:25,150
really briefly take a look
at it. They're young, Jamie,

385
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:26,920
and you tell me with your discerning eye,

386
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,980
I could see that because the tampon
that that's the way you stick inside,

387
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:36,650
right? The tampon. Yes. Gregory.
I didn't get confused. Um,

388
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,870
the tampon causes toxic shock syndrome.
It can if you leave it in, right?

389
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,550
Is that what happens?
I don't know.

390
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,850
I didn't even know it was help
catalyze the movement. Oh my God.

391
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:49,390
This is real benefits of
sustainable menstrual options.

392
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:52,300
What does this sustainable, I'm really
tired of people using that word.

393
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,210
I think the people that use the word
sustainable and the people that use the

394
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:58,150
word handcrafted should get
together and go fuck themselves.

395
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,620
I'm tired of both of those terms.
All natural. You're sustainable.

396
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,980
What are you taught?
What human beings devour the planet?

397
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:09,160
Stop with your sustainable.
Yeah. Oh, this is better.

398
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,480
It's better for the environment.

399
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,510
One dump truck of waste per person
versus a few desing reusable pads.

400
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,710
Reduce pollution. They're reusable
pads. Hold on a second. BARF.

401
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,960
Could you imagine you're,

402
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,990
you're cooter is blowing into
this fucking wad of cotton every,

403
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,480
every month. You're scrubbing
out the bacteria in the blood.

404
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:36,481
It's all intertwined and all the fibers
of your coach area of your underwear.

405
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,700
Man,
get the fuck Outta here with this.

406
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:43,340
Listen we live in 2015 if we,

407
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:46,310
you still use paper to write down on you,

408
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:49,280
we can afford a little cot in
the plug your clam with. Okay,

409
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,090
I'll kick in a few bucks for that.
I'm on board. I mean they, yeah,

410
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,700
there's a few things that we'll look
at that picture. Hold on a second.

411
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,030
Pull that picture. Becca, what
did it say? The Stat, oh my God.

412
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,550
I just,

413
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:06,500
it says disposable Tampon
Pad user produces a dump
truck of menstrual wastes in

414
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:10,310
their lifetime and it's showing
you this giant fucking dump truck,

415
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,440
which probably doesn't
have only tampons in it but

416
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,660
that would be great is if every time you
throw out a Tampon you had to throw it

417
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:20,340
in your truck. Every woman gets
one truck and once it's filled

418
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,400
kill you. Yeah. You have like
a year lead dump of your,

419
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,234
your tampons.

420
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,070
Like for a year they have to stay in
your backyard in a big pink barrel.

421
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,980
Just dogs barking from all
over the neighborhood. Yeah.

422
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:37,430
You know how you have like trash?
It's like one color of the recyclables,

423
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:41,340
like Brown, like lawn, lawn
trim is good stuff is bro. Yeah,

424
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:42,380
everybody has different,

425
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,710
it would be like once a year they
pick up your soiled menstrual plugs.

426
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,980
That's a weird thing with guys
being scared of menstrual blood.

427
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,460
I've never really understood that.
It doesn't bother me at all. I mean,

428
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,660
not a little, not even a little bit.
I don't get it. It doesn't bind.

429
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,760
I mean some do. It's freak though. I had
a friend and he would fucking be like,

430
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:04,910
I'm never buying a chick on her
period. Get outta here. I'm like,

431
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,130
so your girlfriend really wants
to have sex. She's on her period.

432
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,830
You wanna have sex story. He's like, fuck
that and I want you to own that shit.

433
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,820
I think it seems

434
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,310
better. Woo. Greg is dirty.
Like we were. Well dirty boy.

435
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,190
We were down to Florida one time,
me and a, you know, Mike Gibbons,

436
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:21,590
my buddy Mike and this other guy, the
guy whose girlfriend became a hooker's,

437
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,410
matter of fact, and it was a, uh, there
was a water slide park and it was,

438
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
it was locked.

439
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,900
And we got through the chain link fence
and we went in and my buddy turned the

440
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:31,620
water on.

441
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,090
It was like a real rudimentary roadside
waterpark and we started going down the

442
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:39,990
slide in the middle of the night. It's
like fucking, you know, midnight and a,

443
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:43,050
I remember thinking like, I would not
have had that much fun during the day.

444
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,510
And I think that's what
menstrual sex is like,

445
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,740
you're not supposed to be in there.
So it's like a, it's a special treat.

446
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,210
That's a special treat, but a lot of
girls are horny or when they're on,

447
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:59,200
they're pretty, oh yeah. Oh yeah,
that's right. Would you push back?

448
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,090
Let me ask you this in all
sincerity, because I've
debated this myself, would you,

449
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,343
um,

450
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,440
if they one day figure out a way
to manipulate human bodies in,

451
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,200
in such an incredible way that they
can actually turn you into a woman,

452
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,020
like turn you back into a woman back
into Greg again. Like would you try to,

453
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,700
would you be a woman for a Doris?
Yes.

454
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,220
For a whole day or how long had
you held on just do it for a week.

455
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,530
Would you take the d?

456
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,720
No. No. I would do the woman that I would
definitely masturbate. Relentless Lake.

457
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,170
You'd stick something and
I would go to some spas.

458
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:37,600
I'd go to a lot of spas are women
are walking around, okay, what about

459
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,380
this? How about this? What if
here's, we went, we're going deep.

460
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,010
What if you,
they figured

461
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,010
out a way to manipulate genetics to the
point where you could become your wife

462
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:51,180
and your wife could become you, like
literally become you and then fuck you.

463
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,350
Would you agree to that?

464
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:53,720
Okay.

465
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,220
And No.
No Way.

466
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,970
You wouldn't let your wife be you and
you'll be your wife just for a day now.

467
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,500
No. Why not? Cause I could never look
at it the same way again. But it's her.

468
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,520
I don't want to be inside there.
But there's so many seat, little,

469
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:14,690
little secrets that women have and
there's things you wonder about their soul

470
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:18,050
and what they're really thinking when
you're talking and all those little subtle

471
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:22,100
things. I don't, I don't
want that. Uh hmm. I see your
point. I want to know that.

472
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,270
That's beautiful. You're a man of
like, you love romance mystery. Yeah.

473
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,930
That's beautiful. I love my wife.
I'm not even talking about your wife.

474
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,870
I think in everything in life.
Yeah.

475
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,080
50 shades of gray.
There was in the book,

476
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:39,520
there was a Tampon sex scene and they
took it out in the movie. How dare they,

477
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,020
the movie made a trillion dollars
movie cure the deficits. Right. I know.

478
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:48,050
It's fucking crazy.
Why do you think it,

479
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:52,370
did you think you think guys went, like,
did, did women dragged our men to it?

480
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,920
Or is that just women going? Mostly
women, I think probably. Right. And, uh,

481
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,150
psychologically if I had to
analyze with all due respect,

482
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:00,560
and this is again just my opinion,

483
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,250
I think the reason why those like savage
type sexual scenarios like savage,

484
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,930
lustful,
crazy things,

485
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,590
they'll ball gags and spitting
in your mouth and you know,

486
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:16,490
look a lot of the crazy shit that
seems to excite people unexpectedly.

487
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,870
You know when you talk about like the
average American woman and then you talk

488
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,330
about them. I don't know exactly
what 50 shades of grey hairs,

489
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:24,440
I'm just talking out of my ass,

490
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,110
but I ran was a lot of like
time you read the whole thing.

491
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,550
Well I was hired to do a parody of it.
Oh,

492
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:32,960
so I read it will tell me because I
would assume that it's like a lot of like

493
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:37,070
choking and abuse really light.
It's light.

494
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,860
Like the funny thing is is there's no,

495
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,790
I described it as if you had a seven
year old and you showed them nothing but

496
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,520
porn and then you said write a story.

497
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,280
It's so inane. There's no
fucking story. It's just a,

498
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,930
it's an excuse for a rich guy to
completely humiliate a college girl.

499
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,060
And when get off on it because he's so
beautiful and wealthy and, but there's no,

500
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,660
nothing happened. I mean, I don't want
to ruin the ending. I don't fuck it up.

501
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:10,220
Spoiler alert. Literally nothing
happens in the, everybody knows already.

502
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,800
I don't think they care.
It's just,

503
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,640
it's just the same kind of shit you'd
see at Cinemax. I think there is a,

504
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,560
a lot of women,

505
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,040
I think there are a lot of women
that don't feel sexually attractive.

506
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,813
They don't like,

507
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,420
they don't feel like anyone ever feels
like that with them like anyone has ever

508
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:32,390
overcome with lug desire to be with them.

509
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,590
They look at themselves as like,
God, I wish that was happening to me.

510
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:39,710
And they developed this like
intense need for romance.

511
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,550
It's like the classic story
of Romance Novel Readers.

512
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,280
Like what do they look like?
It's usually like an overweight woman.

513
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,460
Like that's what a lot of people think
about when they think of someone who

514
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:51,880
reads romance novels. What comes
to mind? Not necessarily true,

515
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:56,590
but the idea being that like for a lot
of people like that is so attractive.

516
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,600
This, this, you know, this crazy,
maniacal, passionate, little,

517
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,050
even disgusting, an abusive
situation between a guy and a girl.

518
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:09,490
Cause there's so much lust there is like
lust and depravity and they're missing

519
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:10,870
that. They're not getting, you know,

520
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,840
they're not getting anybody that
wants to be with them and touch them.

521
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,110
That's like a fundamental need that
people have that we kind of ignore a lot

522
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:24,190
when we're looking at like social trends
and the way people behave, like the fun,

523
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,130
there's a fundamental need that
we have to touch each other.

524
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,360
Like it's 100% necessary.
Like if you,

525
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,960
if you take people and you give
them no contact with other people,

526
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:38,200
they literally go bananas.
We need to be around each other.

527
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,500
I was hugged sad people.
Oh.

528
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,990
Like if I meet somebody and
they just seem really sad,

529
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,860
I not right then and there, but the next
time I see them I'll throw a hug on him.

530
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:50,190
And it's amazing to see the change.
They fucking like you so much.

531
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,790
Yeah, man, I've told the story,

532
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:57,560
but just in the nature of, uh, this, uh,

533
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,090
discussion, I got it. The first
job that I ever did in Hollywood.

534
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:03,320
That's stupid hardball show.

535
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,430
I had the situation where I came out
here to not have any friends and uh,

536
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:12,930
I was out here filming it
for like two weeks and uh,

537
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,980
didn't have a girlfriend in La.
I didn't know anybody.

538
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:19,880
So I just go to the comedy store and go
home and we have this scene that we were

539
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:24,620
doing with me and this girl and she gave
me a hug and she didn't even give me a

540
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:28,520
hug, like a sexual hug. It
wasn't like I was a track,

541
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,910
I mean she was a very attractive, but
it wasn't like that. She was like, aw,

542
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,930
she came over, give me a hug.
And my whole body just tangled,

543
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,840
like not sexually because
he'd been in love.

544
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,640
Like I felt love and like I felt like
a warm hug from a, like God damn.

545
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:47,780
And I realized right there immediately
I was like, I need this in my life.

546
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,530
If this is something like if you
don't have your, you feel dull,

547
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,340
you life feels dulled down.
Yeah. And unfortunately,

548
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:56,800
whether it's because of genetics,

549
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,350
because a diet or because of fucking
fill in the blank where some people just

550
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,890
aren't that attractive to other people
and then that's not a politically correct

551
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:06,320
thing to say,
but that's exactly what it is.

552
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,250
And so they're super excited about
someone being excited about them.

553
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,980
There's an app where you can
hug people where people meet,

554
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,940
they meet out in a public place
and they have here look it up.

555
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,480
They meet in a public place and
they just come. They say hello,

556
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,280
they hug and then they walk away. Oh my
God. And it's worldwide. That's insane.

557
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,810
That is so insane. And I heard the guy
getting interviewed and they were like,

558
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:34,230
well, it does it sometimes. Like then lead
to Saks like you would naturally think.

559
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:37,080
He's like now most people just,
they just wanted a hug.

560
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,590
That's why they went on the APP.
That's all they wanted. Wow.

561
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,590
Yeah. That's going to end badly.
Well, my son, yeah. Oh yeah.

562
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:50,210
Yeah, that'll cuddle. Curious.
Free App makes it easy to score.

563
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:53,750
Hugs, cuddler. Aw, that's
cute. And that hilarious.

564
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,490
Hugging People's Nice.

565
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:59,270
It's just the problem is there's a lot
of like overly needy people out there.

566
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,960
A lot of crazy people out there.
A lot of them mean people out there,

567
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,100
a lot of insult people that will insult
you just to get a rise out of you.

568
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:10,520
And that's just the world. And girls
have to deal that way more than we do.

569
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,500
Like it's the worst thing in the world
when you see a guy hit on a girl and then

570
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:18,950
the girl refutes him and you know, fuck
you bitch, you know I didn't like you.

571
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,040
And you're like, that is
disgusting. That's like,

572
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,520
you realize like guys like that are the
reason why chicks her fucking weirded

573
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:30,170
out by dudes. Yeah. You know, someone
who hits on you and then when you say no,

574
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,720
they get angry at you,
they all of a sudden like from,

575
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,160
I want to fuck you too. I
want to hit you. You know?

576
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,190
And that's something fortunately
we don't have to deal with.

577
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,240
Yeah. It's uh, I mean, he can see it.
It's an insecurity. Obviously the guy,

578
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:48,030
the guy got hurt and so
he lashed out with anger.

579
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,920
It could be that for sure.
I mean it certainly, I think
there's a lot of factors.

580
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,080
I think that's, that's a big
part of it though. Definitely.

581
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,830
I think the other part of it is that like,

582
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,480
I think for a lot of men it's like very
frustrating to try to figure out how to

583
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:08,520
get someone to choose you
over, you know, x guys,

584
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,460
x number of competition. Yeah.
I mean you're losing, yeah.

585
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:15,000
I mean that's the reason why men
dressed the way they dress. I mean,

586
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:18,760
a big part of it for them is like
to try to look good. You know,

587
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:22,530
like guys who were the right watch are
guys who have the right shoes or guys who

588
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:27,330
were like a really slick
jacket. Like you're doing it
to look good. You're doing,

589
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,140
I mean, that's why you're doing it.
You're doing it to be more attractive.

590
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,711
You know,

591
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:34,660
whether you're doing it for yourself or
you're doing it for your business images

592
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,620
ultimately for yourself,
you're trying to be more attractive

593
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,050
and no matter how attractive you are,

594
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,280
you're trying to be more attractive
because you're trying to, you know,

595
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:48,150
it's nature. You're trying to attract
the best mate that you can get.

596
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,780
It's crazy.
The guys will,

597
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:54,781
some guys will go like all out liquid
diamonds and shit and to like giant

598
00:34:55,961 --> 00:35:00,010
watches would crossed it and
diamonds and they know like, look,

599
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:03,530
I am only going to attract
dumb hose. Yeah, that's it.

600
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,510
That's what I'm shooting
for. Right. You know,

601
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:11,880
and they'll like walk around with like
giant golden crusted or diamond encrusted

602
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,690
necklaces and shit off.

603
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,710
Yeah. They could pull it off
way better than we can. Um,

604
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,080
you know her at certain cars,

605
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:22,750
you see a guy pull up in a certain car
and for some guys that makes sense.

606
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:23,201
You're like,
yeah,

607
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:26,500
that guy belongs in a Porsche and they
see another guy and you're like, you're,

608
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,700
am I going to say you're not
supposed to be in a Porsche?

609
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Anybody who really likes a should
be in a Porsche, but Porsche, no,

610
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,020
but want to be, no, you
shouldn't be in a Porsche. Right.

611
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,350
You should be in a Porsche.
That's a Porsche, is it? Yeah.

612
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,610
That's what you're supposed
to say. Porsche. Yeah.

613
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,590
There's still a lot of people that are
like car journalists like Chris Harris

614
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:54,360
who calls it Polsh is a Porsche though.
Is it Jaguar?

615
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,160
Jaguar? It depends on what country
and this is American mother.

616
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:03,120
Fuck American Jaguar. Good
American. Now you minium Jag.

617
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:07,260
You are Jag. Yeah. That sounds
like you're cursing somebody out.

618
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,030
Jag.
You all y'all.

619
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,880
You Jaguar Fit Simmons? Yeah, I gotta.

620
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,410
I gotta get that fucking Mustang.
I saw one yesterday. New Ones.

621
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,980
And they wait for the new ones. Yeah,
they're coming out 50th year anniversary.

622
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,320
This is what you want. You want the GT
three 50 don't fuck around. Do not pass.

623
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,960
Go the Shelby gt.
Three 50 coming.

624
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:35,940
It'll be coming out very soon. Gregory.
How much? I don't know how much.

625
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:39,480
Stop with the money. You're going to
live forever. Stop. You make good money.

626
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,650
This is what you need to do.

627
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:45,200
You need to get 500 American naturally
aspirated horsepower under your balls.

628
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:49,770
Yeah, dude, it's doing
Newburg ring times like low,

629
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,240
low numbers, man. They look like
spectacular results with this car.

630
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,780
It's like got independent suspension
for the first time in a long time.

631
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:58,441
For mustangs.

632
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:01,430
Like they had it for awhile and then
they went back to the live rear axle.

633
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,360
I guess I don't know enough about that,

634
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,940
but this new suspension is
supposed to be incredible.

635
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,750
This car cars coming out soon, son,
don't fuck around or get one of those.

636
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:12,420
Challenger hellcats.
I drove one of those in Denver.

637
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,770
Has the visibility out the back of that
good enough? No, it doesn't matter.

638
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,260
Nothing's coming up behind you.
Look, get that fucking car.

639
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,350
Oh 16 Shelby gt three 15 I like the back.
Good Lord.

640
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:27,780
That mixed my fast back to
fucking American car son.

641
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,430
That's, that's real American muscle,
but like super sophisticated.

642
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:37,050
Now they're making these cars like
this car where they're American muscle

643
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:41,970
meaning like stupid high horsepower.
V Eight awesome sound rumble.

644
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,060
But they handle that
car fucking handles man.

645
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,080
That's how much money do they spend
making that roar sound right? You know,

646
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,580
they got all kinds of acoustics experts
and on that Muffler we'll, you know,

647
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,080
accident. They probably do. I think so.

648
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,010
Especially the Shelby has that awesome
deep throaty like bubbling up in the

649
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,730
morning. Yeah, they sound so good.
V Eight sounds always the best.

650
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:09,720
Like you can have a beautiful VC
like Porsche's are sixes flat six.

651
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,840
They sound really good too.
But that sounds the best.

652
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,450
That American v eight rumble.

653
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,140
It's just so fucking ball draining.

654
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,223
That's uh,

655
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,630
something about that engine sound for
whatever reason actually stimulates

656
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:31,760
testosterone in men. There's been studies
dial. I'm sure that's insane. Absolutely.

657
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,980
The sound of an engine, it's like a
lion roaring. You probably hear that and

658
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,310
you gotta grow some. You've got
to grow some balls fast. Yeah man.

659
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:42,770
If you had lions all around your bedroom,
I bet you'd have so much testosterone.

660
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,870
Imagine if you slept in like you
had this like super thick wire cage,

661
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,440
like really fucking fic where lines
definitely can't get through it. No Way.

662
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,400
And that's your walls and your,
the rest of your house,

663
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:03,760
like all on the outside, there's
an outside wall way, way out there.

664
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,760
But most of it is a lion sanctuary.
Yeah.

665
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,600
So where you live is like
the outside is like a house,

666
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,920
but the inside,

667
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,980
like where it faces the line sanctuary
is all wire mesh and it's all around your

668
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:17,950
bed.

669
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,730
So it's like your walls are insulated
with lions and you walk out there and then

670
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:22,564
you sleep.

671
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,610
You walk out there like a long path
through this thick wire mesh and you sleep

672
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,170
in the middle of the line sanctuary.

673
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,130
And periodically throughout the day they
release animals for the lines to chase

674
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:35,080
and kill in front of you.

675
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,720
You're brushing your teeth and you see
some poor giraffe stumble out, look left,

676
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:44,554
look right,

677
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,210
and you see them run towards it and
take it down like fucking Christ.

678
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,810
You hear ball and snap and one of them's
got the neck and the things flop around.

679
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:55,030
I was trying to kick in a town,

680
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:59,700
its guts apart and you're 20 feet
away and your chest is rumbling noise.

681
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,350
Allow raw. You can barely hear it
over your electric toothbrush. Yeah.

682
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,720
Oh,

683
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,540
ripping apart some giraffe right in
front of you. Fun splatters on your face,

684
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,290
fighting each other over
chunks of meat swab.

685
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,550
The new male comes into town,
there's a fucking bra and,

686
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,840
and you're just getting manly.

687
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:29,710
You're either shrinking from
it and becoming a complete
pussy or you're growing

688
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:34,480
hair on your chest and you're going, you
would look like in Armenian bodybuilder.

689
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,670
That's what you look like. Just
hey, Harry thing. He'd get angry.

690
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,780
You're not even working out. You've
never lifted a weight and your ribs.

691
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,230
Your body's just prepared for
death every second of every day.

692
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,980
You just hear that roar in the middle of
the night. Plus you're inhaling on that.

693
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,440
Fair owns that.
They spray it up the whole time.

694
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,810
They probably piss on your fucking cage.
They'll probably spray your cage.

695
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,770
You probably going to have to call
in the maid and shows the Lion Piss.

696
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:09,840
All of those things up. The Fairmont's.
I just want to take a nap. I'm,

697
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,580
you know what? I'm not getting pissed
on tonight. I'm putting up the shades.

698
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,110
I'm just, you know what?
I'm not avoiding the lions.

699
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:19,540
I just don't want to pee in them.
I can handle the lions.

700
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,570
I just don't want to Piss it on my
head while I'm sleeping. It's it. Yeah,

701
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:25,620
they will. They will piss on things.
Right, like a regular cat does. Well,

702
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:28,930
especially after they fight and they
spray the area cause they just one,

703
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,620
it's fucking weird to watch man was like
what does that even coming from? Yeah,

704
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,980
you got an extra hole back there.
Like what is that? How's that work?

705
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,950
Cause they spray out the
back like out of their ass.

706
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,550
He has some kind of little gland
back there. How bizarre. Yeah.

707
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,930
Like they have almost like an extra dick,
like a d,

708
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,820
an extra like a blow hole and their deck.
Well it's, I guess it's like pre semen,

709
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,410
right? I don't know where it comes
from. I'd never thought about,

710
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,690
I had a cat that used to spray to really?
Oh Man.

711
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:00,240
I had a feral cat and at
one point in time, um,

712
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,460
I had a great veterinarian.
Luckily Dr. Craig,

713
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,760
unfortunately he died,
drunk driver hit her man fucking,

714
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,220
he was the nicest guy. He was hilarious.
Like a really funny guy. Loved, loved,

715
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:17,330
loved animals. Anyway, I had this
feral cat and when it was time,

716
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,790
like most of the time I could pet him,

717
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,920
but there was occasionally
times we tried to pick him up.

718
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,880
He'll fight you to the death,
just fucking freak out and run away.

719
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,530
And I had to get him to the vet
because it was time to get them fixed.

720
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:33,290
He's just pissing in my fucking house.
Seems like we'd pick up his back.

721
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:33,711
They like,

722
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:37,610
is it the pickup is back like his ass and
his tail and he would just see it come

723
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:42,050
out. You're like you little motherfucker.
And when I trapped him in the bathroom,

724
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:45,380
he was just spraying
everywhere. Dude, just spraying.

725
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,710
But I never looked at where it came
from because that was in mortal danger.

726
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,740
Like I was trying to figure out how
to get this little guy in a basket.

727
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,020
What I did was I threw a blanket over him.

728
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,030
I wrapped him up in the blanket and
then I stuffed the blanket inside of a

729
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:01,640
laundry basket and then I carried him out.

730
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:05,630
I carried him to the vet in a
fucking laundry basket place.

731
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,190
He's like going crazy like that. He was
going bananas. He was going bananas.

732
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:13,580
He's trying to kill me. He was trying
to kill me, but he was my buddy.

733
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:16,460
It was the weirdest thing and no
one else could even touch this cat.

734
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,400
If you came out with my head, he
might house, he would run from you,

735
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,440
but he would sit in my lap.
I could pet them up,

736
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,250
I can pick them up and once I started
petting him, he would perse so loud.

737
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,010
But it was like the person like never
got touched. Like once, like he,

738
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,480
it was the weirdest thing. He would go
from work. I'm scared of everything.

739
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,160
You pick them up dude. It's
all right. It's all right.

740
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,980
Like a and really loud
per like the poor guy,

741
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:44,030
his whatever months of his life where
he was wild before I got ahold of them.

742
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,400
She has fucked his head up.

743
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,700
Like trying to maintain in your home.

744
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,380
A feral cat is a very unique situation.
Taught me a lot.

745
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,850
Did it, did the behavior change
after he got neutered? He never did.

746
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,360
Behavior never changed. No. I mean it,

747
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,390
he was always cool only with
me. That's it. No other people.

748
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,190
That's it.
He liked my cats.

749
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,190
My cats and him were very close
and he would hang out with them.

750
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,210
Everybody was groovy,

751
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,580
but there was no other person
who was allowed to pick them up.

752
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,540
He just wouldn't have it and he wouldn't
have it sometimes for me, like he do.

753
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:21,290
He knew me from the time he was a little
baby and I had them for at least seven

754
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,790
or eight years. How did you find
him? My friend found him. Yeah.

755
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,940
Her and her boyfriend were living in this
apartment and underneath it there was

756
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:31,260
like a cat that had given
birth to a bunch of kittens.

757
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,610
And so like she kind of freaked out like,
oh my God, these poor little things.

758
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:37,370
They're wild and they're
hissing and people.

759
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:39,750
So they set traps for them because
they were like, you know, they were,

760
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:43,050
well they would go out to their car and
there's like this litter of Kittens,

761
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,560
like living under your house. Like
it was really depressing time. Yeah.

762
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,310
So her and her boyfriend decided to
trap him. Trap the cats and you know,

763
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:51,660
they were a little demons man,

764
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,930
just fucking spotter in. And then
you realize like, man, once you,

765
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:02,250
if you're that fucked up from like that,
like first couple months,

766
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:04,530
like your view of the world
is that dangerous. I mean,

767
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:07,890
you literally a wild industry,
no one's petting you. You know,

768
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:12,510
you're not getting little can of tuna
in front of you. Oh, do you like it? No,

769
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,000
it's full on instinct. You're eating
bugs, reading anything that moves yes.

770
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,550
Fighting other cats to get to the,

771
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,800
yeah. And you know, your parents
are trying to bring you back food.

772
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,940
You're barely staying alive.

773
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,590
And so he goes from that to
all of a sudden he's hanging
out with me in my house

774
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,850
and he's eating cat food. You know,
it was get cat food every day.

775
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,310
You can't believe the food's
still here every day. You know,

776
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,510
it was really weird to see will he overeat
if you leave out food? He's dead now.

777
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,770
But, uh, he uh, didn't
overeat. No, he, he, no,

778
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,760
he normalized to the point where
like walking around the house,

779
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:49,420
he didn't look like it was constantly in
terror, but if you got too close to him,

780
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,570
he would be like, what the fuck are
you planning? You know, it's like,

781
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:56,440
it was when he was by himself,
he was fine. Like he was cool.

782
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:59,710
It was just chill out and who you catch
them like signing himself by the window.

783
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:03,200
Everything was groovy. It's on people's
got too close to him. You just wasn't, oh,

784
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,010
would never was. Totally. Sure.
Yeah. No, it was totally sure.

785
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,900
Here, reminded me of when you talked
about grabbing them in the laundry basket.

786
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,510
Do you remember back in Boston?

787
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,340
You were out one night with Jennifer
and I was home and I swear to God on my

788
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:22,100
father's grave, this happened.
I rented Batman Blockbuster.

789
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,690
Uh, and I put it in and I'm sitting at
home and I'm watching it. And then, uh,

790
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:31,230
all of a sudden I see this shadow and
then I turned my head and I see another

791
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:35,490
shadow and I look up and there's
a bat flying around the apartment.

792
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,840
And I'm like, what? And I'm
scared shitless of bats.

793
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,280
Like it's like my thing.
And it's like ever since I was a kid,

794
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,250
my aunt had this bar near her and they
had bats and they would be telling me

795
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:50,750
they were fruit bats. And
if they bite you, you'll get
rabies and you'll die. And,

796
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,480
and so, and we would always be outside
playing tag at night and I would fucking,

797
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,130
bats would fly by and I'd freak out.
And,

798
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:01,110
and so I'm alone in the apartment and
there's a bat flying around and Batman is

799
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:05,160
on TV. And so, uh, all I
knew is they go in your hair,

800
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,870
which I think is like not even true.

801
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,200
So I put on a baseball cap backwards and
I had on sunglasses and a tennis racket

802
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,890
suck. Glad in one going in my eyes,

803
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,130
he's going to go from that.
So,

804
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,630
and I'm running around the
apartment swinging at him.
He's taken off, he's like,

805
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,120
you know, he's just, they're
erratic, the way they fly.

806
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:30,430
You don't know where they're
fucking going. And this
goes on for like 10 minutes.

807
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,640
And then there's like a standoff on a
waiting and then I hear you coming up the

808
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,790
stairs and you came in and you
opened the door and you go,

809
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,390
what the fuck are you doing? And I
got this a bad in here. And you just,

810
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,520
you just grabbed the tennis
racket out of my hand.

811
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:46,330
And he walked up and he was in the window
and you just bashed him once and he

812
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:49,660
just went down and then you just walked
over and you had take out in your hand

813
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,550
and you just went into the
kitchen and started eating it.

814
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,990
I'm standing there with sunglasses
and I, Ana, I remember that.

815
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,310
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.

816
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,890
I probably wouldn't even killed it if
you weren't already trying to kill it.

817
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,830
I think you, you might, I call
the animal people to come get it

818
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,790
because it looked like it was stunned.
Ooh. He was actually dead sick.

819
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,620
Oh, you mean once I hit it?
Yeah, no, it was done right.
Yeah, I remember I killed it.

820
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,240
Yeah, I remember. I'm like, I'm not
going to have this thing software. Yeah.

821
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,750
I don't remember what I did, but I
remember it was some hitting involved.

822
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,910
I'm pretty sure it was the tennis
racket could have been. Yeah.

823
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,120
I mean you were fearless. I was
like, fuck man. I don't like,

824
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,470
I don't like baths,
but I do know that on very rare,

825
00:48:34,471 --> 00:48:38,400
very rare occasions, bats I've
rabies. Yeah, it's very, very rare.

826
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,810
So like same thing with like squirrels.
Very rare they have rabies,

827
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:47,250
but I'm not taking any fucking chances.
I'm not getting rabies. Dude, get rabies.

828
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:50,820
You have some crazy shot they put
through your stomach and he can call in

829
00:48:50,821 --> 00:48:53,740
retrospect. Probably could have tried
to save the thing. Throw, throw.

830
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:55,050
But it might've been sick too.

831
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,590
Yeah, I didn't want to loan
him. There was a lot of bats.

832
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,590
Neighborhood in Brookline. The
other were raccoons too. Right?

833
00:49:01,591 --> 00:49:05,190
Remember lot of raccoons.
Yeah. Here in la, you get rats.

834
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,150
They're everywhere. The Hollywood hills,
apparently it's especially bad. Yeah,

835
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:12,480
they're filled with a Mo. There
probably isn't as many birds. You know,

836
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,400
you don't see hawks
flying around that much.

837
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:17,550
You should see a lot more hawks that,
and they're, they're not around,

838
00:49:17,551 --> 00:49:19,890
so they're not killing
the, uh, the Vermont. Well,

839
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:24,240
it's also unfortunately coyotes too. And
people hate coyotes. And I, you know,

840
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:27,150
I'm not a fan because they will
kill your dog right in front of you.

841
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,760
And they would bite children if they
could get away with it. Oh yeah.

842
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,180
There's been many instance. I mean they
don't have like rules, they're just,

843
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,170
they're opportunists.

844
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,630
And if you have a three year old
and it's wandering around naked,

845
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:37,464
a coyote lead it,

846
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,770
it's just mean it's a fucked up thing to
say because most people don't leave the

847
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:43,770
three year olds alone. But
you know, coyotes are creepy,

848
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,460
but they do keep rat populations
down and they'd learn.

849
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,240
There is a balance that has to be,

850
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,610
unless we're going to
kill all the rats to like,

851
00:49:50,611 --> 00:49:53,490
we were just going to be the
executioners and fucking natural world.

852
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,560
Like when it doesn't work like that.

853
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,540
So when you force coyotes out of
neighborhoods, which I agree with, it's a,

854
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,570
it's a two edge sword. Yeah. Cause I don't
want coyotes killing my friend's dog.

855
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,680
Yeah. That's a sad thing.
There's a, one of the guys that,

856
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,400
I think it was one of the guys
that worked on fear factor,

857
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:10,770
I forget who it was in his neighborhood.

858
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:15,090
This lady was walking her dog in Brentwood
in this fucking coyote came running

859
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:17,490
up behind her. She said she
just heard click, click, click,
click, click, click, click,

860
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:18,210
click, click, click.

861
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,390
And she didn't even know what it was and
it just snatched her fuck a dog right

862
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:24,960
off the leash and ran with it. Yeah.
Just crammed it right in front of her.

863
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:29,660
She screamed, she let go of the leash.
Coyote ran off with their dog. Wow.

864
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:33,780
Killed it right in front of her.
Brazen. That's brutal. Yeah.

865
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,480
So I would rather have rat traps out then
those little fucking conti dog's eaten

866
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:42,500
monsters. Yeah, they'll eat dogs,
man. I mean that's, that is shit.

867
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:47,030
You're on the Diet because I guess our
coyotes related to wolves. Are they?

868
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,370
They're, they're dogs.
They're all dogs. Right?

869
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,400
So everything comes from wolves
because you gotta think if you can,

870
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,970
if you come from a wealth and
you're now coyote, you're,

871
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,500
you're pretty bad ass. And then you
see an Americanized, like a small dog.

872
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,730
They are not very tough.
Yeah.

873
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,360
You probably don't even see
it as the same species as you.

874
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:07,740
That's just an easy soft lunch.
Well,

875
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,590
it's fucked as the coyotes are actually
so clever that they will get dogs to

876
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,910
think that they're their friends.

877
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,700
Like they come around and hang out with
them the right outside the fence. Yeah.

878
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,910
Like my neighbor has this little dog,

879
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,990
he has a Beagle and he says the coyote
comes out and the dog starts wagging its

880
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:27,020
tail. Like, look, my friend is
here. But meanwhile they're Kyle.

881
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:31,280
He'll eat that beagle to beagle
thinks everybody's like him. You know,

882
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:35,480
at four o'clock in the afternoon the food
gets put into a bowl and his tail wags

883
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,950
and he waddles his little fucking Chubby
Body over to the bowl and he eats.

884
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,180
And meanwhile outside,

885
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,170
it's just things ribs are showing
and it's gets big long face.

886
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,410
Just design for snatch and
shit up and it's like, ah man,

887
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:53,290
come on outside and play. Hey, I'm
your friend, Mr Bagel. I like you.

888
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:57,180
Come on man. Did my dad look at my
tail? Look, the door's open, man. What?

889
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,160
The door's open. Should I come? Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. Come on. Just who's your nose,

890
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,120
you should know is open to
talk. Come on. Just grab them.

891
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,550
There's fucking run with them.

892
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,780
Poured bigos wasn't playing golf
recently in this, uh, coyote.

893
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:16,010
We just came out on the
course. Just looked at us.
Didn't, wasn't scared at all.

894
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:20,810
You know, they're, they're
slippery because, you know,
I'm not saying I hate them.

895
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:25,790
I think there's something beautiful about
their existence. I don't want to do it,

896
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,710
but there's something
beautiful about this.

897
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,900
This animal that lives like
just adjacent to civilization,

898
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,240
intertwined slightly,

899
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,770
occasionally dips into their
world and steals a cat. You know,

900
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,800
last ones to leave the party. You
see, they've got one of my chickens.

901
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,280
I watched it watch a jump over the
fence with my chicken. Yeah, yeah.

902
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,230
Recently it was,

903
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:52,370
it jumped over this like I had a fountain
and it jumped onto the fountain and

904
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:54,020
then right over the fence I
got the fountain right up,

905
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,830
like one of those little portable
fountains with the chicken in his mouth.

906
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,520
And just boom,

907
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,410
just right over ice mail down about 10
times before I had a chicken in one of

908
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:08,270
the, not in the regular pen,
but in another box. And it
was a, when chickens brood,

909
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,930
you have to a, you have to take them
away from the rest of the chickens.

910
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,120
You gotta take him out of their box,

911
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,840
you're going to force him to sit on a
perch for like usually a day or two and

912
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,570
then they calm down. They get
out of it. But if you don't,

913
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,160
they'll start picking their feathers off.

914
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:26,100
And what it is is like females
in the natural world of chickens,

915
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,450
they want to fuck a rooster and they
want the egg that they give. You know,

916
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:32,280
they've make an egg almost every day,

917
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,350
but most of the time those
eggs are unfertilized.

918
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,380
So the exit we eat are unfertilized eggs.
I didn't even fucking know this.

919
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,940
I was in my forties I thought that all
eggs could be chunked chickens if you'd

920
00:53:40,941 --> 00:53:43,360
just laid on them, which
is really retarded. I,

921
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:49,110
I had no idea that chickens
just lay an egg every day.

922
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:50,900
Whether or not they're pregnant or not.
I just,

923
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,810
how do they know which ones to sit on?
They don't mean,

924
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,140
you know when you leave the eggs there,
some of them they'll like,

925
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:02,040
I guess like some of them sometimes
they'll peck away at their eggs, no,

926
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,260
eat them and you have to like
make sure that they don't do that.

927
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:06,450
They're really stupid man.
They're stupid as fuck.

928
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,440
But when they get broody when they get
broody is when they think that somehow or

929
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,660
another one of these eggs,
even though there's no rooster,

930
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:13,620
is going to become a baby.

931
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,230
So they sit on it and they don't want
to get off of it and then they start

932
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:19,920
pecking at their belly and
fluffing it up and it gets ugly.

933
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,920
But you can fix it as long as you
catch it early and catch it early,

934
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:24,210
you just put them on a perch.

935
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,600
So it was a smaller box and the coyote
got under it and smashed the bottom of it

936
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:33,260
and stole the chicken. It's fucked
up, man. Clever little cunt.

937
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,800
You ever get attacked by a chicken ever?
They never bit, you know, but if they did,

938
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:42,810
that'd be the end of their life. That
my rules. Right. I'm just kidding.

939
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,350
But deal. You don't, you don't
raise them to eat them? No. No.

940
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:51,330
They're like little pets. The pets,
their pets that make food. I feel bad.

941
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:54,600
I was more sensitive to the loss of
your chicken. No, I mean I would,

942
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:59,130
I would do that. I named chicken.
Yeah. I don't, my kids do.

943
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,670
I don't.
I'm like,

944
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,060
I don't have any desire to eat
these chickens. Like they're cool.

945
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,360
I like having him around. I like,
uh, I like eating their eggs,

946
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:14,190
but it's so really weird thing that by
other chicken from the grocery store,

947
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,270
like I'll go to the grocery store and
buy chickens. He's completely murdered,

948
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,450
fucked up chicken. You don't get
to ever look at its face. You know,

949
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,520
you don't have to cut its neck and
see its last blood jump out of it.

950
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,590
You don't have to really recognize what
it is you're doing and you're eating a

951
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,740
chicken, right. You're just letting
the supermarket supermarket hit man.

952
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,870
Take care of all the dirty work for you?

953
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,390
Well, it's almost like we've got this
hamster that's in a cage in our house,

954
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:41,290
which is really to me the saddest thing
in the world because he's alone and

955
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:42,061
nobody holds him.

956
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:47,061
My daughter picks him up like once a week
for about 20 minutes tops and the rest

957
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:49,750
of the time he knows
on the bars to get out.

958
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,070
And I just think like this is the most
pathetic existential existence this thing

959
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:56,950
lives in and I hate that we have as a pet.

960
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,170
And then we had a mouse that was loose
and we set a trap and I was like,

961
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,000
this mouse,

962
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,390
that hamster are a fucking chromosome
apart and why don't we hold and pat and

963
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:07,730
give a little a

964
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,100
bath and a little fucking butter dish.

965
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,490
And the other one I'm trying to
snap his neck with a spring. Well,

966
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:15,590
how about squirrels, man? I mean,

967
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:19,610
squirrels have this free ride
in the road and community.

968
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:24,280
Nobody hates squirrels. Yeah,
everybody hates but squirrels.

969
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:27,910
All they had to do was get
cute. All them do. Listen,

970
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,250
just stay an herbivore.

971
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,110
Don't go eating animal protein and gross
out in pretty girl big fluffy tail that

972
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,540
looks cute with did a little tail show.

973
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,590
I do little tail show and they chew and
a little nuts and everybody thinks their

974
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:46,330
cute little kids walk up to these wild
rodents and they'll give them nuts.

975
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,290
Could you imagine this? You saw your
little kid walking up to a fucking rat.

976
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:54,860
How much you'd be terrified,
but they're there.

977
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,910
Like we were so confident in their
behavior that will just walk up to them,

978
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:03,790
give them peanuts. I to love our ice, love
squirrels. We had him where I grew up.

979
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,980
I used to feed him all the time.
Give him a little peanuts.

980
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:10,720
There's a park in north Hollywood that
you could go to. And um, the squirrels,

981
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,670
apparently people have
been feeding them forever.

982
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,550
So they come up to you when they see you,
they're like, you, you got something.

983
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,990
You got something for me. And I watched
this one dude, this old Chinese guy, he,

984
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:21,340
he laid down on a blanket.

985
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,690
You had a bag of peanuts and it would
just slowly like reach his hand out and

986
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,260
squirrels would come over and just take
it from him. They were so confident. Yeah.

987
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,250
It's just Greg.
I mean he's holding a peanut.

988
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,100
They've just taken it from him and they
just step back just a little bit and

989
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:35,470
they would eat it. They didn't worry
about him or they're just a rodent.

990
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,410
The got cute. That's it. I mean is
this fight going back to the wolf?

991
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:43,411
Like the dogs that we have today are just
the wolves that were able to be around

992
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:47,350
man. They were able to chill
the fuck out, grab some scraps.

993
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,140
Man liked him cause he was protection.
Yeah.

994
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,380
Wolf like the mad because he was
giving him food and he, but he,

995
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,520
but it weeded out the vicious ones
until they got smaller and cuter and we

996
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,830
crafted them to be the
little lapdogs we wanted.

997
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,030
The crazy thing is how short
of a time it takes to do that,

998
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,410
to change these animals.

999
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,940
Like we don't know how long it
took before wolves became dogs,

1000
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,700
but they did this experiment.
They do well,

1001
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:15,490
it was listening to this podcast on
radio lab, I forget the name of it,

1002
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:18,670
but it was about wolves and
they did this experiment on,

1003
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,420
I was about dogs with dogs and they're
wild nature, whatever the fuck it was.

1004
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,720
But they did this experiment with foxes
where this guy was raising foxes and

1005
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:33,690
whenever he would go towards like
the cage where the Fox Fox were,

1006
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:39,010
if the foxes were um,
scared of him,

1007
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,850
if they like feared him, if there
was any like aggression towards him,

1008
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:43,990
he'd killed those foxes.

1009
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,300
So the only foxes that he let stay alive
where the foxes that were actually like

1010
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:50,920
happy to see people.

1011
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,820
And then over time they did this
over a period of like 10 years,

1012
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,880
they literally changed
the way the foxes looked.

1013
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,420
They changed the way their face look.
Their face became smaller,

1014
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:05,890
their bones became more petite, they
became different colors. They're cheap.

1015
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,800
They're, their colors changed their,
their overall, even the males,

1016
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:13,890
their bodies became much more feminine
and they became domesticated like in 10

1017
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:18,250
years to the point where you would go
near the Fox cage and they would wag their

1018
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:20,290
tail and like whimper to be near you.

1019
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:24,410
Like they wanted to be near people
and they were in a fucking for factory

1020
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,230
essentially. Wow. They're
killing these things.

1021
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:32,330
And this guy recorded all
this stuff and did these,

1022
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,030
these studies over the period of like
10 years changed the foxes that he had

1023
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,183
changed them.

1024
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,240
And George Orwell buck was just something
about the reaction to adrenaline that

1025
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:44,910
some of these animals didn't have the
same reaction to adrenaline that did the

1026
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,700
same, uh, response to seeing strangers.
And that those, by favoring those,

1027
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:53,390
you sort of domesticated this
animal like very quickly.

1028
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,720
And the idea behind it was they were
trying to make an analogy towards people

1029
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,310
like that were kind of
doing that with society.

1030
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,960
If you look at the way people used to be,

1031
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:05,550
like there was some study
recently about um, uh,

1032
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:10,070
hunter gatherers and the difference
between their bones and our bones,

1033
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,580
their bones were much more
dense and cause he's, you know,

1034
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:16,350
as people were working from the
time they were babies, I mean they,

1035
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,020
they just never stopped like picking
things up and climbing hills and like they

1036
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:22,430
were constantly at work.

1037
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,640
But we're becoming like more and more
fragile as we sit at desks all day and sit

1038
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:32,450
in our car to get dark desk and sit on
the couch to watch TV after you're done

1039
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,510
and then read a book in bed.
I mean fucking were falling apart.

1040
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:39,550
We're like mush and that,
you know,

1041
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,000
when you really think about that,

1042
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:45,410
like that's kind of very similar to
what is happening with those foxes.

1043
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,120
It's just a matter of
preferring one type of behavior,

1044
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,460
not breeding with the other ones.

1045
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:57,461
And they think their premise was about
like the best way to eliminate like war

1046
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,220
and eliminate all these different negative
aspects of our culture would be four.

1047
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,570
And people said this for people like that,
to just people stop fucking them.

1048
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,380
Stop fucking savages. Stop fucking all
the people that want to go to war. Yeah.

1049
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:16,040
I give as as a,
as a rule like all across the world,

1050
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,280
if women just stop fucking
all men who want to go to war.

1051
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,710
Well if you think about it and stay with
me on this cause it's a little dark.

1052
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,120
But if the people that
are natural soldiers,

1053
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,190
they are going to war and they are dying
without breeding as much as the guys

1054
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:35,090
that, that are afraid to go to war. Right.

1055
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,830
So in a sense there is some natural
selection. If that is a gene,

1056
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:43,390
if there is a gene that makes you
more, you know, uh, likely to,

1057
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,100
to want to go to battle,

1058
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:50,750
um, that kind of makes Hans someone's
car alarm. Isn't that hilarious?

1059
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:54,140
Like back in the day, car alarms were like
something that anybody took seriously.

1060
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,260
Oh my God. Yeah. There's
a car alarm going on.

1061
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:02,390
I bet this is a crime now.
It's like asshole, you know,

1062
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:03,530
is in the back or the front

1063
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:07,883
front.

1064
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,880
Yeah. You go take a look at it if you
want. Just make sure it's not one of ours.

1065
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:17,530
One of our hardest moves. Somebody hit
your car and that's why the alarms going.

1066
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,090
Yeah,
that is possible

1067
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,220
is in the back. Oh, then
don't worry about it.

1068
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,620
Fuck these people with their gun.

1069
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:32,220
Remember those ones that would
do like different door. My,

1070
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,850
I remember in a way I
lived in little Italy.

1071
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:39,570
This fucking Cadillac got tapped and
it played the theme from the Godfather.

1072
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,000
Nn Nnn, Nnn, nnn.

1073
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:50,710
That's hilarious. I remember
everybody used to have that one alarm.

1074
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,940
That one type of alarm.

1075
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,660
Yeah.
That you'd be like,

1076
01:02:59,661 --> 01:03:02,990
fuck somebody who was always
so many bumping into it.

1077
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:06,800
Whether they were parking and they do used
to go. They used to go for way longer.

1078
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:09,290
Now usually people are near their car.
They,

1079
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:11,930
it's almost always somebody
set it off by accident,

1080
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,640
which means it usually
stops pretty quickly. Yeah.

1081
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,410
But back then it would go on for 10 15
minutes and you'd be going out of your

1082
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:20,710
fucking mind. You're sitting there
trying to write it on your computer,

1083
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,070
whatever death. Yeah. Those things
are fucking distracting shit.

1084
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:28,370
When they came along with noise,
reducing headphones. Dot Is,

1085
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,340
that was a beautiful thing
to be able to sit and have.

1086
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:34,130
If you had like noise reducing headphones
on right now and you could totally

1087
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:35,690
filtered that out. Yeah, most of it.

1088
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,070
Well the Mike's probably didn't pick up
on that. Do you think they did? Yeah.

1089
01:03:40,071 --> 01:03:42,260
If some of these like got headphones
on. Yeah, but they could hear it.

1090
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:45,760
That was pretty fucking loud. But those
Bose ones, I mean I've got a pair,

1091
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:47,300
I've had the same pair but it this way,

1092
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:49,490
I've had them long enough
that I got replacement.

1093
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,880
You know the rubber padding
thing in the middle. Yeah.

1094
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,830
I was in a Bose store and I was like, Oh
fuck you can buy replacements. Cause I,

1095
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,340
I had stopped using it because they just
wore out and I popped in some new ones.

1096
01:03:58,341 --> 01:04:01,550
I haven't, I swear to God, 10 years
I've had these things. Wow. They still,

1097
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:04,280
I don't think they make a better version.
It's like one of those products,

1098
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:05,114
you know,
they make a,

1099
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,800
they make a year of it like the Honda
Civic and like 1982 it was like a perfect

1100
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:14,090
fucking car. Yeah. There was a bunch
of cars from that era that are like,

1101
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:17,150
to this day, like they're
becoming like really valuable.

1102
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,160
Like Volvo DL land cruisers. Yeah.
They're t those old Toyota land cruisers.

1103
01:04:22,161 --> 01:04:25,880
Yeah. People are taking those Land Cruiser
is still the old ones that looked like

1104
01:04:25,881 --> 01:04:29,480
jeeps and even the newer ones like after
that and they're fixing them up and

1105
01:04:29,481 --> 01:04:33,860
selling them for over a hundred
thousand dollars. What? Yeah, no shit.

1106
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:34,850
Yeah.

1107
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:39,830
There's a company called icon and a
day they make incredible cars, man.

1108
01:04:39,831 --> 01:04:43,790
I mean it's like you're talking about
very, very expensive shit and I agree.

1109
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:47,330
I mean, it's not necessarily something
that I would buy it because it is a lot of

1110
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:49,010
fucking money and uh,

1111
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:52,580
but they take these like Broncos
and they take it old bronco,

1112
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:57,170
they take the shell and they completely
redo it with the highest end components,

1113
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,910
like the best suspension possible.
A completely modern engine,

1114
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,860
you know,
with like 400 horsepower,

1115
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:07,220
they take a coyote engine
from the 5.0 Mustang.

1116
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:11,780
So it's a Mustang gt engine like
this crate engines, beautiful engine.

1117
01:05:11,781 --> 01:05:16,240
They stick it in an old bronco. Those
really cool old, I love those body.

1118
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:18,040
You got to see it. Pull
it up. The convertible

1119
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,690
ones,
icon Bronco,

1120
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:22,990
pull up the silver one cause there's a
fucking silver one that if it doesn't

1121
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:26,800
make all this money for the non five,
well it's not just the body,

1122
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:31,600
it's the engineering. Like this guy. Um,
I forget his name. I think Jonathan Ward,

1123
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:36,520
I think his name is the guy who is the uh,
the lead CEO.

1124
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:37,900
Whatever the fuck he is
president of this company.

1125
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:40,990
Just leave that thing on there for a
second so I can stare at it. Good Lord.

1126
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:45,130
That's beautiful. Look at
that fucking truck kind of
long. That Hood is God. Damn,

1127
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:47,140
that's a fucking work of art man.

1128
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:50,410
It's like something you played with
as a kid and dreamed of driving. Yeah.

1129
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:54,730
Like when you think about a regular truck,
like regular trucks are cool, you know,

1130
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:58,150
hey, you know you got kids, you want to
pile them into an Escalade, that's cool.

1131
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,490
But if you see that thing
driving down the street,

1132
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,520
I mean that's like some mad
Max Apocalypto wonder ride.

1133
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,910
It's a cool west side car too cause it
looks like you could take it on the beach.

1134
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,170
You could take that on the beach.

1135
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,570
You can take that wherever
the fuck you want to go.

1136
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,170
Well that's what I think about is when
the shit hits the fan and it's going to,

1137
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:17,651
in La,

1138
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:20,500
obviously there's going to be some type
of a terrorist strike or there's going

1139
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:24,520
to be a poisoning. Easy, easy, easy.
Greg Fitzsimmons I want to have,

1140
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:29,410
I've a Prius and my wife has a Toyota
Highlander so if I want to get out,

1141
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:32,350
I know the way out because if I,
if I live in Venice,

1142
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:37,480
I'm the last one in line for the 10 for
the four or five for the Pacific coast

1143
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:40,720
highway.
We were the last ones to leave la,

1144
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,740
like lock up on our way out.
Everyone's a front of us. So I think,

1145
01:06:44,741 --> 01:06:48,070
well you got two options.
One of them is to jump on a boat.

1146
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,650
Like you gotta be able to Jerry Rig.
It's something simple.

1147
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:54,460
Little fucking motor boat go off
to Catalina Island. Waited out.

1148
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,390
The other option is like,
cause when I was a teenager,

1149
01:06:57,391 --> 01:07:01,810
he used to ride motorcycles on the power
lines because wherever there's power

1150
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:02,141
lines,

1151
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:05,590
they have to have a a path
cleared underneath it so
they can serve as the power

1152
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:08,100
lines.
So if you drive dirt bikes,

1153
01:07:08,101 --> 01:07:11,680
he always know if there's power lines
is a good trail underneath it. Wow.

1154
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:15,460
So if you want to get out of La, you,
you get on one of those power lines,

1155
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:19,390
but you need a truck like that. You need
something with like a lot of clearance.

1156
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:21,670
Big Fat wheels.
Dude.

1157
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:26,770
Do you want to live? If the apocalypse
hits like okay, lists their stages,

1158
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:30,700
the apocalypse power goes out.
Apocalypse, that's going to suck. Yeah.

1159
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:33,280
Especially if it's in July.
People are going to be hot as fuck.

1160
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:34,150
No one's gonna know what to do.

1161
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:36,520
People are going to be camping out in
the beach cause they can't take living in

1162
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:37,271
the valley and the,

1163
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:41,380
in the middle of the summer there's going
to be some shortages of food for sure.

1164
01:07:41,381 --> 01:07:43,150
It's going to be some looting for sure.

1165
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,600
You cannot pump gas cause they're all
electric pumps going to be a real problem

1166
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:49,120
until they figured out how to get
the power back on. And you know,

1167
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:53,080
there's been situations in other parts
of the world where power in a modern city

1168
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:53,980
has been off for weeks.

1169
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:58,660
Like Toronto apparently had some crazy
ice storm in the 90s and you know,

1170
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:03,340
it was like fucking zero below 10 below
zero, something like that. Horrible,

1171
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:05,920
horrible weather, you know,
Celsius. Whatever they do up there.

1172
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:11,050
And these people had no power for like
two fucking weeks. And in Toronto,

1173
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,620
Maya in the middle of the winter
so that he could happen in La. Man,

1174
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,100
if it happened in la in the summer,

1175
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,390
it can get ugly. Quick Stat would be
one that's like one kind of apocalyptic.

1176
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:25,220
I can handle that. That's not that bad.
But the real bad ones, like super volcano,

1177
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:29,570
earthquake,
asteroidal impact,

1178
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:33,890
those are the big tsunami tsunami,
tsunami zone.

1179
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:38,660
You probably aren't because the way the
bay is shaped, you know, you've got,

1180
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,170
you know,
from the Palisades down to whatever,

1181
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:45,350
Manhattan beach is all
one half circle basically.

1182
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:47,870
And Venice is in the
center of that half circle.

1183
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:51,110
So as the water is
rushing in from a tsunami,

1184
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,250
it's all getting channeled into
one opening, which is Venice beach.

1185
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,150
That shit's going to come straight down
Venice Boulevard, take everything out.

1186
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,570
The canals, canals of the underwater.
That's right. And it's canals,

1187
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,290
canals right through the city. Get
out now, get out. Now actually we,

1188
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,450
we moved up the hill. We moved from Venice
to Mar Vista, which is about a mile,

1189
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,550
but it's straight up hill.

1190
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,720
The people that live on the beach like
right on the water or bold is fuck bold

1191
01:09:16,721 --> 01:09:20,300
is fuck. You have to have
some either some mad loot,

1192
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:23,240
whether it's like house number five,
you know,

1193
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,340
CEO of Q tips or some shit.

1194
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,080
And his house is shaped like a cue tip.

1195
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,180
And the servants were placed
with real cotton every day. Oh,

1196
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,831
that would be it.

1197
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:41,831
Q tips mad because people are not going
to stop using Q tips and there's no like

1198
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:46,040
nobody wants the generic ones because
the generic ones are like they get flat

1199
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,560
qtip stay fluffy shit.

1200
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:53,270
Who's the asshole that makes those
qtip fake Q tips with plastics.

1201
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:54,813
Yeah.

1202
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:59,240
Cut the inside of your ear cause you dig
around the fucking cotton falls right

1203
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:03,380
off. She get us now you got
a cocktail straw in your ear.

1204
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,190
Now they get the real cute tips is like
one of those again going back to like

1205
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:10,380
the 82 civic or uh,
it's just there.

1206
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:14,900
They made perfect products in St Louis.
Just you nail it. You got it. Walk away.

1207
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,110
Walk away. Walk away. He
know certain cameras like a,

1208
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,850
I don't know what kind of camera you got
but die of the uh, those old cannons.

1209
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:26,000
The original like first generation Canon
video cameras, they were high eight.

1210
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,870
They were beautiful pieces of machinery.
That's,

1211
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,660
I have one that I still use to
this day. Whoa. Yeah. I mean,

1212
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,390
if you've got really good shit,

1213
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,080
it does the purpose and does
it a really high level, you,

1214
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,000
you essentially could
just maintain it forever.

1215
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,850
That's what they've been really
doing in Cuba with cars. You know,

1216
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,080
if you go to Cuba,
you look at their cars,

1217
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,810
apparently a large percentage of them
are American automobiles from like the

1218
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,240
fifties or sixties big ass car.

1219
01:10:51,241 --> 01:10:54,250
It's crazy and beautiful and
in really good shape. Oh yeah.

1220
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,600
I think that's what that
guy's doing with those icons.

1221
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,860
He's just taking these old cars and just
putting the best components on it and

1222
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:01,694
building,

1223
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:06,350
you know like what it could have been
guys from Europe come over here and they

1224
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:10,370
buy muscle cars and they just shipped
him right over to Germany, double it.

1225
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:13,980
They're worth a lot of money in other
countries. Yeah, there's a flavor. Those

1226
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,450
things have to those American muscle
cars at like the best engineered cars.

1227
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:22,470
My opinion or like the Japanese and
the German and some of the Italians,

1228
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,730
they have some amazing engineered cars,
but like the coolest cars,

1229
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,060
there's no question like just straight
cool 69 Mustang rolls up 10 just shut the

1230
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:37,620
fuck up. Everybody shut the fuck up.
You have a Ferrari and a Lamborghini,

1231
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:40,950
you doors open up like wings stop.

1232
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:46,550
Just stop suddenly pulls up one of those
Eleanor mustangs and those 67 gt five

1233
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:51,930
hundreds just like good Lord. What
a beautiful car that is. So simple.

1234
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,000
They just nailed it.
Yeah,

1235
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:59,180
like those core vets like give her a c
those Corvettes from like like 1968 69

1236
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,010
that that the sting ray car,

1237
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,720
beautiful fucking and the wide
tires and the wide backend rumble.

1238
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:11,154
That engine,

1239
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,950
it looked like a lion about to pounce
with big back conscious and just,

1240
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,290
they just nailed it.

1241
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,890
You don't know what drugs they were doing
when they were designing cars in the

1242
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:23,810
60s but they just fucking nailed
it. Right. They nailed it over,

1243
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,130
over and over again.
Barracuda's Ma, I mean everyone,

1244
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,530
they'd be creating these
fucking masterpiece. Yeah,

1245
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,740
they're getting back to that now for sure.

1246
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:35,050
Like the cars look better today
than it did for a long time.

1247
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,670
But I would really like to know
what the fuck happened, what,

1248
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:43,180
what happened in like the
1980s where things went so bad?

1249
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:46,240
Like I know there's peaks and
valleys and a lot of things,

1250
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,210
but in American automobile
design it doesn't make any sense.

1251
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,900
Yeah. And at the exact same time as when
the Japanese cars that are coming out,

1252
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:56,740
just when we need it to be at our
best to compete, we suddenly just,

1253
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:00,750
I don't know what the, you know, the
factories where they, I don't know.

1254
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,740
I bet there's probably
two versions of the story.

1255
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:06,790
There's the pro union version and
the con Union version. Yeah. Oh,

1256
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:09,550
I'm sure there's a lot of people
that blame the unions. I mean,

1257
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:13,930
it's tough because I just
talking to somebody who's
very pro union yesterday and

1258
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:18,610
I, I'm very pro union, but I'm starting
to slip a little bit in some ways. Like,

1259
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:21,310
I'm, I'm in the writer's guild and
I'm very, you know, I walk the walk,

1260
01:13:21,311 --> 01:13:25,480
I walked away from a deal so I could walk
the picket line and my dad was in the

1261
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:27,760
radio union after for his whole career.

1262
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,540
That's what left left
my mom a pension and I,

1263
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,420
and I believe that there should be a
living wage for people, but I also think,

1264
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:38,500
God, how do we fix these
fucking corrupt procon engines?

1265
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:43,300
Like what? Corrupt, broken engines union
wise, you mean like things like, well,

1266
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:47,470
construction, certain, you know,
a kind of shield, something.

1267
01:13:47,471 --> 01:13:50,380
It's really gotten to the point where
you're just getting squoze from every

1268
01:13:50,381 --> 01:13:54,140
direction and it's adding,
it's adding, you know, I,

1269
01:13:54,141 --> 01:13:58,660
I'd rather see another guy get a job then
see the union just absorbed that much

1270
01:13:58,661 --> 01:14:02,890
more money. Well, any times you
have your bureaucracy, bureaucracy,

1271
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:06,880
anytime you have a large number of people
that are involved in something that

1272
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:09,700
really only needs a couple people,
you know,

1273
01:14:09,701 --> 01:14:14,200
I mean how many people really need be
involved in going over your construction

1274
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:16,150
plans or how many people
really need, I mean, yeah,

1275
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,170
once you establish environmental
parameters and shit,

1276
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:22,380
like things like people trying to fix
their house up or something like that.

1277
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:24,480
Like how many people really
need to be involved in this?

1278
01:14:24,481 --> 01:14:27,900
Like are you hiring a contractor? Does the
contract and no one is doing? Yes. Okay.

1279
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,900
Well we're good. Yeah. Like let me just
get the fuck out of your hair. Yeah.

1280
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:31,820
Like what do you,

1281
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:34,650
unless you're doing something dangerous
and we're just going to assume that

1282
01:14:34,651 --> 01:14:37,830
everyone's doing something dangerous
now there's a lot of people are getting

1283
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:42,260
paid off too. I have a friend who is
trying to get a house built and uh,

1284
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,350
they're dealing with this, a commission
in this area, this particular area.

1285
01:14:46,351 --> 01:14:49,320
They're trying to develop a house
and they've literally been told like,

1286
01:14:49,321 --> 01:14:51,120
you have to like Greece wheels.

1287
01:14:51,121 --> 01:14:53,760
You have to like to get things
moving to get things approved.

1288
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,440
Do you have to like get
on people's good side?

1289
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:59,190
Like there's saying thanks to these people
like to indicate that I came that you

1290
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:01,770
might monitor by these people,
something you might want to bribe them.

1291
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:04,860
You want to be friends with them. He,
the closer you can get to these people,

1292
01:15:04,861 --> 01:15:07,050
the easier they'll lube
this process of like what?

1293
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:11,130
This is so bizarre because it's
like they have power over you.

1294
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:15,390
This is not like there's real clear
parameters. This is how we operate.

1295
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,480
Regardless of whether or not we'd
like you or don't like, you know,

1296
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:21,390
there's like this,
like this little wiggle room going on.

1297
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:24,000
I mean that's essentially what
corruption really is, right? It's wiggle,

1298
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:27,390
Bro. It's like it's never, nobody
ever states it as corruption.

1299
01:15:27,391 --> 01:15:30,150
Nobody ever says black and white.
I'm bribing this guy.

1300
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,850
It's just I happen to take this guy out
to dinner. Well, it starts there. Well,

1301
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:35,461
well,

1302
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:38,430
was that the difference between him going
with you and going with somebody else?

1303
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:43,410
Very likely. Well then that's a bribe.
That's true. Right. And in a lot of ways,

1304
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:43,891
I mean,

1305
01:15:43,891 --> 01:15:46,860
you should be able to hire whoever the
fuck you want if it's your money and your

1306
01:15:46,861 --> 01:15:47,694
job.

1307
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:51,990
But when you're talking about something
like a union that's involved and

1308
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:56,820
construction are unions involved
and you know, coastal commissions,

1309
01:15:56,821 --> 01:16:00,750
those type of things know where people
are deciding whether I like the groups of

1310
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:03,690
people that decide whether or not this
happens to or that doesn't happen. Yeah.

1311
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:08,610
Yeah. Things get real weird. Man
Can, is ridiculous. Apparently. Like,

1312
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,730
you know,
uh,

1313
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,610
they tried to build a high speed railroad
or they did build a high speed power

1314
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,000
and the you the, not the unions,
but uh, you know, the different, um,

1315
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,610
levels of bureaucracy within the
government and privately we're squeezing

1316
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:27,000
everybody to the point where the project
was 10 times as much as it should have

1317
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:27,480
been.

1318
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,600
And then the train started crashing
because they were trying to save so much

1319
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:33,360
money. They're putting
inferior parts in. Yeah.

1320
01:16:33,361 --> 01:16:35,760
That's where the argument
for unions come in, right?

1321
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,980
Cause it's not a, um, it's not a black
and white issue. Like I definitely think,

1322
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:40,221
look,

1323
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:43,070
we're talking about Foxconn and all those
people that are being forced to work

1324
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:46,360
for such a horrible waves that
jumping off roofs, you Kinda,

1325
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:49,880
you gotta establish like a living wage.

1326
01:16:49,881 --> 01:16:53,900
You got to establish if people are working
for you and this is a valuable thing

1327
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:54,734
they're doing for you.

1328
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,140
Like you have to pay them enough
so they could feed themselves,

1329
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:01,340
clothe themselves like you can't. So
like in the in and then, you know,

1330
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:04,640
healthcare and all the different things
that are going to come up. I mean,

1331
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:08,330
you're a piece of their
organization and they're,

1332
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:12,470
they're demanding to be recognized as
a valuable piece of the organization.

1333
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:14,600
Like you can't have all the money.
Like that's what it is.

1334
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:18,680
You have people working for you, you
need to pay them. That makes sense.

1335
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:24,220
But it's like whenever you get a
group that is exploiting these,

1336
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:27,740
uh, these laws that are in
place to protect people,

1337
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,210
like that's when shit gets weird.

1338
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:33,050
Like my buddy was in the
automotive industry in Detroit.

1339
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:37,070
He was in the auto workers union and he
was telling me like how crazy some of

1340
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:40,370
the contracts were and some of the gigs
where they had this thing where you

1341
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:44,540
would both work, you would have a two man
contract. Like meaning that this was, uh,

1342
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,500
this not a two man contract, a two man
job, like this job to run this machine.

1343
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:53,240
It really only took one guy, but they
would, the union would require two men.

1344
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:56,870
So you guys get two guys get
jobs. So you, you're both,

1345
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,220
you would do four hours a day,

1346
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,670
like you would do four
hours in the morning and uh,

1347
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,440
I would come in at noon and
I would take over and uh,

1348
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:06,680
I would do the job for the next four
hours. And then you go to the gym,

1349
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,640
you go fucking have lunch. You literally
would work four hours a day. Yeah.

1350
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:13,460
And that's what they all did. And they
all were making like 150 grand a year.

1351
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,590
I mean,
it was crazy money.

1352
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:18,380
He was talking about how much money
these different workers were making.

1353
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,380
It's like, you know, if you got to a
certain level, like you got benefits,

1354
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:21,830
you got this.

1355
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:26,150
It was like super expensive to keep
all those people employed at that.

1356
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:29,150
Not only that, but for that
money that you're paying them,

1357
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:34,151
you're also paying a 13% into the union
which pays for the benefits so that you

1358
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:35,490
know,
if what,

1359
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:40,370
what's $50 an hour to that worker
actually costs the employer. You know,

1360
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,470
what's 12% of $50 six, six, $7.

1361
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,000
Something along those lines. Does it
matter that I need to break down that uh,

1362
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:53,450
no math? No, I don't think, I
think your listeners get it. Yeah.

1363
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:58,790
I think unions if used correctly or a a
nice sort of insurance to people getting

1364
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:05,420
paid a fair wage and getting treated
ethically and having, you know,

1365
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:09,690
money distributed in an
ethical and fair way.

1366
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,460
There was no problem with
anything is things don't
always go the way they should.

1367
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,050
Best case scenario.
Yeah.

1368
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,910
It's almost like you got to start over
again with the unions. You got to get the,

1369
01:19:17,911 --> 01:19:20,930
like the Teacher's Union is insane.
You got women in there.

1370
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,230
There was a woman that a women,
there's melting,

1371
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:29,430
dare you know you met this one woman
though that works at my kid's school and

1372
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:34,070
she had liquor on her breath and she
was like just ignoring the class and

1373
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:37,670
reading the paper and like they couldn't
get rid of her. They just, yeah.

1374
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:40,760
It was just impossible to get rid of her.
There's so much you have to go through.

1375
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,350
We'll 10 years. A weird thing, man.

1376
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,520
And I had this professor after three years
as a teacher. That's it. Three years.

1377
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:50,060
Welcome to the jungle though. You got
to survive three years. Yeah. Yeah.

1378
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:54,050
Especially in La. He deserve it. Ooh. You
get through three years of working in La,

1379
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,780
babysitting kids, your gray
hair. The women are balls.
He's just beaten down. Yeah.

1380
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,840
Ulcers and shit. Fucking how many
kids brought a gun? Just class today.

1381
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,020
It's a weird world,
man. It's a weird world.

1382
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:08,100
There's so many haves and
have nots in this world.

1383
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:11,130
I don't know. Doesn't seem to be any
solution or anybody reaching for it.

1384
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:15,090
But that might be the one thing that's
ever going to level anything out when it

1385
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:18,690
comes to unions. Yeah. I mean having,

1386
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,390
having groups of people that uh,
are all behaving in an ethical way,

1387
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,900
having them in a, in a large number,
like whether it's a, you know,

1388
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:32,820
a big group like the actors union or
whether it's a carpenter's union or it's

1389
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:34,230
just,
it's fucking really hard.

1390
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:37,770
It's really hard to get people all
together in a group like that to act

1391
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,780
ethically,
to just always be cool to always do it

1392
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,190
gray. I mean, unions just split apart.

1393
01:20:43,191 --> 01:20:47,060
There was the writer's guild east and the
writer's guild west, which effectively,

1394
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:50,990
you know, destroy the power of
either one. There was aftra and sag,

1395
01:20:50,991 --> 01:20:54,350
which are both actors. Unions have,
should it, they're finally combined now,

1396
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:57,080
but it should have been,
it should right now should be the DGA,

1397
01:20:57,081 --> 01:20:58,220
which is the director's guild.

1398
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:02,350
The writer's guild and the actors union
should all be under the same to end a

1399
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,841
Yahtzee,

1400
01:21:02,841 --> 01:21:07,460
which is like the technical guys should
all be one union because what they do is

1401
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:10,000
the studios, we'll line
it up so that they, uh,

1402
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:14,600
the contract for the actors union
comes up in January every two years,

1403
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:19,750
but then they set up the writer's guild
to renew in February every two years

1404
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:24,800
that they make them off here.
So that way you've never got everybody,

1405
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:29,390
uh, lining up against you want a
union contract at the same time the,

1406
01:21:29,391 --> 01:21:30,224
and they can,
they can,

1407
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:35,150
can everybody do what kind
of disagreements or they
have like when you have

1408
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:37,390
disagreements and like the actors
union or something like that.

1409
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,150
Mostly it's digital downloads, which is
a battle that everybody lost, you know,

1410
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:42,170
that that should have been,
I mean,

1411
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:46,430
I just got a residual check on
a TV show that I did and I got,

1412
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,330
first I got the check for the
reruns on TV, the cable reruns.

1413
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:53,960
Then I got the one for
digital online. And, uh,

1414
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:58,990
the one on cable was like 1700 bucks
and the same usage period on digital was

1415
01:22:00,321 --> 01:22:05,321
like $13 and it's like probably more
views digitally than it was on cable.

1416
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:10,040
But we gave that away
during the last strike. Ooh.

1417
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,780
They weren't looking down the road.

1418
01:22:11,781 --> 01:22:14,680
They were really fighting
for network and cable reuse.

1419
01:22:14,681 --> 01:22:17,480
CIJ and they weren't looking at
the, missed it. Yeah. Netflix,

1420
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:20,210
all this shit that's taken off.
We're barely getting a taste.

1421
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:24,950
That's crazy. Yeah, they miss that. That's
a big one. It's the whole future. Wow.

1422
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:27,830
That is so nuts. Yeah. But what,

1423
01:22:27,831 --> 01:22:30,810
but there's benefits to having
a union. Like what, what do you,

1424
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,420
what do you think are like
the primary benefits of,

1425
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,810
well I've had my health coverage cause
I've been in the writer's guild for like

1426
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:39,720
13 years straight,
so I've had my health insurance paid for.

1427
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:44,400
It's amazing coverage, low
deductible, low premiums.

1428
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:48,750
It's like I think I pay like 250 bucks
a quarter or something crazy and I'm

1429
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:52,770
paying third 13 grand. I pay, I was,

1430
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:56,970
I was in the Union for 12 years out for
one year and I'm now I'm back in again.

1431
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:01,320
And that one year that I had off,
I paid $13,000 for my family.

1432
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:04,440
So that's, you know, that's
a lot of money right there.

1433
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:07,030
And then you get the residuals to come in,

1434
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:12,430
which is big and um,
you don't get abused,

1435
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:16,090
you know, you have certain, like you
get meals you get, um, they can't,

1436
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,890
they can only work a certain
number of hours. I mean,

1437
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:21,150
there's not too many people that dig in
on that, but the spirit of it is there,

1438
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,140
you know,
producers know that they,

1439
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:24,860
if you're in the union
that they're not going to,

1440
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:28,750
I've worked on both sides of it.
I've worked non union jobs and as per,

1441
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:31,600
as a producer,
not a writer because I can't,

1442
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,220
but I've seen the hours that you work
and how you writer's guild jobs, you get,

1443
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,840
you can take an hour for lunch

1444
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:43,420
and you also get treated in a
pretty commensurate way. Right.

1445
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,290
You know, like when you're in a, a sag TV
show or something like that. I was like,

1446
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,060
it's pretty across the board
or was professional like
as far as like, you know,

1447
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:56,230
you've got the craft service table, this
is where your dressing room is, you know,

1448
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:59,220
you're out by x amount of times,
you have a 12 hour turnover.

1449
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,810
Like they have all these rules
they have to follow by those rules.

1450
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:05,110
When they go over, like they
get all bummed out. Like
everybody gets pumped out.

1451
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:07,870
Yeah, it's a super expensive.
When they start going over time

1452
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,970
and money, money talks, that
makes them get, there's no way,

1453
01:24:11,971 --> 01:24:16,170
like most shows shouldn't take more
than eight hours to shoot, you know?

1454
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:18,570
And instead it takes 15
why do you think that is?

1455
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:24,060
Because everybody wants to brand whatever
it is that they're putting into the

1456
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:27,450
project. You know, if you're
the hairstylist, he want
the hair to look perfect.

1457
01:24:27,451 --> 01:24:30,660
If your, you know, the,
the set Kai you want, you,

1458
01:24:30,661 --> 01:24:34,290
you need an extra 20 minutes to do this
as opposed to if there's penalties,

1459
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:38,640
it's like, no, we got to fucking go get
it done and then we're gonna move on.

1460
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:43,230
So I think with cable there's usually
not a strong hand on the, on the, uh,

1461
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,530
on the wheel as much as there is an in
network shows where there's somebody

1462
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:50,010
that's a show runner that really has
to answer to the studio and say, no,

1463
01:24:50,011 --> 01:24:53,400
we are done at 6:00 PM that's it.
You know, maybe they go an hour long.

1464
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:58,730
But I work on cable shows where I worked
on one and it was a [inaudible] wife,

1465
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:03,170
tiny and her ghetto fabulous friends.
Oh,

1466
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:06,900
what'd you do on it was a panel show. I
was a, what was I on that? I was the head,

1467
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:09,450
I was the show runner on that.
And uh,

1468
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,490
they came in and we were
supposed to start taping it.

1469
01:25:11,491 --> 01:25:16,410
Four o'clock started at 7:00 PM because
they all were getting their hair done

1470
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:19,410
and it was a cat fight.
The next night we're taping again.

1471
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:23,520
Supposed to be four o'clock
taping seven 30. Wow. Yeah,

1472
01:25:23,521 --> 01:25:26,310
it was fucking money. That
is, that's a lot of money.

1473
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:30,150
You're paying everybody just for
three and a half hours. Right.

1474
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,440
And then you're going along,

1475
01:25:31,441 --> 01:25:34,320
which means now you're going into
overtime wages on the other side.

1476
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,153
So

1477
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,140
there's many good things about having a
union. So many good things about them.

1478
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:45,460
Oh yeah. Yeah. Some unions that
are fucked, man, there's a,

1479
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:49,660
there's a big dispute right now with
the UFC in the culinary union and the

1480
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:54,400
Culinary Union is the attack the UFC and
make all these like websites and posts

1481
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,830
and they have like stories that they,
uh,

1482
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:01,860
they have people write about how horrible
the UFC is because they want the UFC

1483
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:04,070
to give up a station.
Casinos

1484
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,180
owns, uh, the UFC, the UFC is owned by
[inaudible]. They own station casinos.

1485
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:12,740
They owned the UFC and
they own a 22 casinos.

1486
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:17,850
And if those casinos went union, they're
not union or non union. And I guess I'm,

1487
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:22,850
I might be speaking as school here. I
don't really know. I believe check this,

1488
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:25,550
that the workers don't
want it to be union.

1489
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:27,830
Like they voted against it because
they didn't want to pay the wages.

1490
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,620
But if they did pay the wages there,
ha.

1491
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:32,690
I guess they're happy with what they
make. I don't, I pay the dues, the dues,

1492
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,600
but if they did do it,

1493
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,390
the Culinary Union would make some
insane amount of money every year.

1494
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,510
Millions dollars every year.
Yeah.

1495
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,600
So what they do is they have
this like smear campaign,

1496
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:46,601
like constant smear campaign about the
UFC and they hired politicians and one of

1497
01:26:46,761 --> 01:26:47,900
them,
I actually just got busted,

1498
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:53,310
one of the main guys in New York that
they had supposedly that had been a

1499
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,480
roadblock to getting the
UFC legalized in New York.

1500
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,030
UFC is not legal in New York still.
No,

1501
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,950
still to this day it's
illegal in New York state.

1502
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:05,870
The reason being because of corrupt
politicians and all brick goes back to the

1503
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:09,160
culinary union trying to keep the UFC,
uh,

1504
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:13,970
it like trying to turn the station
casinos into um, union casinos.

1505
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,570
Right?

1506
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:18,830
So they're spending all this money and
like getting people upset about the UFC

1507
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:22,880
and making all these nutty websites. And
anytime anybody says anything fucked up,

1508
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:26,870
anytime anything goes wrong, the color
and union was ditch jumps all over it.

1509
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:30,890
And they're just trying to muscle the
UFC and to relinquishing control of these

1510
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:33,530
casinos. It's a, that's
allegedly the story.

1511
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,950
Obviously I don't know all the details
so I should probably say for legal

1512
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:39,380
purposes, this is how it's
been told to me. Yeah.

1513
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:44,710
But ultimately you know that if there's
a lot of money to be made and you've got

1514
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:49,490
some organization that relies on
keeping strong numbers of members,

1515
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:53,430
they're going to be, you know, financially
motivated to try to make things cheap.

1516
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:59,210
I had a buddy was in the teamsters like
when I was a kid and I was like 21,

1517
01:27:59,211 --> 01:28:03,110
22 years old. He was a, in the end
he, he would uh, work the docks,

1518
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,440
he would filet fish all day and he had a
dent in his hip and the dent in his hip

1519
01:28:08,571 --> 01:28:13,190
was from his hip pressing up against the
fish filet table all day looking at a

1520
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:16,390
dent, very like one hip was like
dented in and be like, you're an adult,

1521
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,270
your radios ducted.

1522
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,530
Cause he just leaned all day and leaned
all day and he always smelled like fish.

1523
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:26,510
Oh always smelled like fish. This
poor bastard. I don't mean to laugh.

1524
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:30,500
I mean the guys making a living, but when
a life, yeah, totally. Shit. He was a,

1525
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:33,680
he was my boxing coach and so he
would, when he would rub this, uh,

1526
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:37,970
like Vaseline stuff on your face and
stuff called Abilene so that like punches

1527
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:41,300
when they, they hit you, they
slide, they don't cut you. Yeah.

1528
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,910
The leather doesn't cut. You see, he'd
rub this stuff all over your face.

1529
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:48,520
You just smell fish, fish and Abilene
and he'd just be rubbing it. He,

1530
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:52,220
so he was filleting fish and
training as a boxer. Yeah.

1531
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,950
He's one of the craziest
guys I've ever met. He, uh,

1532
01:28:54,951 --> 01:28:58,340
he got his finger bit and often a street
fight and they replaced it with his toe

1533
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,590
and they curved it permanently so
he could still throw right hooks,

1534
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,350
crazy Irishman, Joe Lake,
which tell the big toe,

1535
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:11,670
uh, they took the second toe, not
the big tub with the one next to it,

1536
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,660
I guess you don't use, you don't
use that. I guess you don't need it.

1537
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:18,900
Just strengthen up those
last three babies. Keep that
party role on with no toe.

1538
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:21,810
Now. I mean, the thing is,
if you think about a finger,

1539
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,690
each one individually is dealing
with things but your toes, it just,

1540
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:29,280
that you don't even really need. And we
could get rid of toes at this point. No,

1541
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:33,330
they do help you. They help you with
movement, with movement and you know,

1542
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:37,720
like they're, they're
adjustable. I, she had a balance
yourself. Like you need toes.

1543
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:41,090
It fucks with people when they
lose a toe, they lose a lot of, uh,

1544
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:43,620
their ability to move around.
Yeah. It's not the same.

1545
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:45,510
I used to caddy for this guy that,
uh,

1546
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:49,830
something happened to him in Vietnam
and uh, his feet were paralyzed,

1547
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:53,190
so like his ankles work but
like is from the ankle down.

1548
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:56,190
Everything was just fucking dead.
And this guy walked,

1549
01:29:56,191 --> 01:30:01,191
he walked like he'd have to almost bring
his knee up in the front every time

1550
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:05,280
he'd stepped forward. Like
ski boots. Yeah. Almost like
that. And then he would, uh,

1551
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:09,510
he'd hit the ball and it just, it never
could hit it straight because you need,

1552
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,730
you know, you need balance.
But the guy fucking loved golf.

1553
01:30:11,731 --> 01:30:13,020
He played like two rounds a day.

1554
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:15,600
Do you have to caddy for him
to be all over the course?

1555
01:30:15,601 --> 01:30:19,830
Look over this guy's fucking ball.
Fucking numb feet. That's so weird.

1556
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,900
What a weird ailment. Dead Feet. Oh, I
guess probably happy. That was it. Yeah.

1557
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,720
Right on all the shit that could go wrong.
I know.

1558
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,740
I know a dude who broke his toe really
bad and they told him he couldn't do

1559
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:36,660
Jujitsu for six months if they were going
to fix it to or they can amputate it.

1560
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:40,680
So he said cut it off.
No Shit. Which tell a,

1561
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:44,970
I think it was like the same one by my
success. Which toes are in each story?

1562
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,460
I think it was the one next to the
big toe. Yeah. I might be wrong.

1563
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:51,600
One of his toes. If you had to lose
one toe, which one would it be?

1564
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:56,730
Uh, that little. Hmm.

1565
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:58,763
That's a good question.

1566
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:03,780
I was going to say that free loader
toe right next to the little toe.

1567
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,460
All right. Fuck it. The ring finger.
Yeah, toad doesn't it does nothing.

1568
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:10,050
I never paid attention to until,
yeah,

1569
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:13,920
look washed out tow a million times
in my life. Never looked at it twice.

1570
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:19,080
Do you go look at my pinky toe?
I'll check it out cause it's weird.

1571
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,550
I look at that tiny little nail. Go leave
the stupid nail. You know, I'll look.

1572
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:25,110
It's like a clipping of another now.

1573
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:28,680
It's not even it's own nail but the
little toe next to the pinky toe.

1574
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:33,000
No love gets no lo. Do you get in
there and individually watch your toes.

1575
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,100
I used to it now. Now I don't give up.
You got no, no desire slapping on the top.

1576
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:42,150
Slab it on the bottom down. I
wash my feet, you know in between.

1577
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,020
I'm always doing stuff barefoot.
Yeah, like I lift weights barefoot.

1578
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:48,240
I do kickboxing, barefoot. Jujitsu's
barefoot. It's all barefoot.

1579
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,200
You got to get in there.

1580
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:54,120
You also got to make sure you don't get
athlete's foot like athlete's foot is

1581
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:57,240
what you, when you get that,
those cracks underneath your toes,

1582
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:00,220
like get the base where the the ball

1583
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,320
of your foot reaches the
bottom of your title.

1584
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,500
Like that gets all dry and fucked
up and cracks and it hurts.

1585
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,440
And a lot of that comes from
your toes being dirty. Yeah.

1586
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:10,930
It comes from like weird
fungus getting in there.

1587
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:14,320
And apparently this is the same,
like the same as ringworm.

1588
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:18,030
Like athlete's foot is kind of the same.
Fungus is ringworm.

1589
01:32:18,031 --> 01:32:19,600
It's just in a different spot on your body

1590
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:26,320
and Jock itch all same shit. Yeah, that's
right. Jackets, just athlete's foot.

1591
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:30,220
Yeah. It's some fucking funk growing
on your dick boy. Yeah, right.

1592
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,430
Yeah. God, I would
hate, I would hate that.

1593
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,410
It's important if anybody's
listening to this though,

1594
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,150
if you do have some funk on
you, um, whatever you do,
don't use antibacterial soap.

1595
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:44,470
Don't ever use that stuff. If you
use antibacterial soap, soap, I mean,

1596
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:47,890
unless you're a hospital, you know,
pay worker, you're a, you know,

1597
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:51,570
a doctor or something and then you should
use it. But there's stuff called um,

1598
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:55,840
defense soap that is a,
a probiotic. It's a, it,

1599
01:32:55,841 --> 01:32:58,630
it discourages the growth of bad bacteria,

1600
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:02,080
but it promotes healthy bacteria
and it's all like natural oils.

1601
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:03,750
They use like um,

1602
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:08,910
eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil and it
just like staff and ringworm and all that

1603
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:12,190
stuff. It's really good for grapplers.
That's why it's called defense soap.

1604
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:13,090
They made it for grapplers,

1605
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,990
but for anybody like for keeping
like healthy skin flora that,

1606
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:20,800
and here's a big one, dude,
this is really big probiotics.

1607
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,950
Fucking I drank this shit all the
time. Yeah, you telling me about that?

1608
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:28,180
So important. Yeah. Yeah. These
are organisms like live organisms.

1609
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,680
You take them into your body and literally
strengthens your immune system like

1610
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:33,810
acidophilus.

1611
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:37,540
I was reading this thing where they were
saying that acid off lists they believe

1612
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:40,930
can discourage when you touch things
like say if you touch something and it's

1613
01:33:40,931 --> 01:33:44,500
got some sort of a funk on it and then
you accidentally touch your face. Well,

1614
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:47,040
if you're taking healthy
doses of acidophilus,

1615
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:51,280
apparently acid office will resist
the introduction of new bacteria.

1616
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:53,440
They're like, Whoa, whoa
bitch, what are you doing here?

1617
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:57,130
What the fuck are you doing here?
Whereas if you have that antibacterial,

1618
01:33:57,131 --> 01:34:01,190
so your skin is like devoid of
even healthy bacteria. Yeah.

1619
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:05,980
Does healthy flora is just as important,
like you can't like strip it off.

1620
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:09,160
It's just as important to keep the healthy
flora as it is to get rid of the bad

1621
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:12,400
shit. Yeah. The um, uh, somebody,

1622
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:16,270
so we told me I was reading an article
about bacteria and it's like there's a

1623
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:20,770
pretty big percentage of your body that's
made up of bacteria. Yeah. It's huge.

1624
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,040
Like the amount of weight and your
body's like 12 pounds or something of

1625
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:27,940
bacteria. This is the way
I saw it explained once. It
really rang that number up.

1626
01:34:27,941 --> 01:34:31,380
But it's a lot. This is the way
I saw a scientist explain that.

1627
01:34:31,381 --> 01:34:32,560
So I'm pretty sure he's correct.

1628
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:37,330
He said there's more eco lie in your
gut than I've ever been. People ever.

1629
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,250
Wow.
Whoa.

1630
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:42,643
Yeah.

1631
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,830
Yeah we did. It's just sitting there
while it's doing, it's working like it.

1632
01:34:46,831 --> 01:34:50,660
Healthy stomach bacteria is like
very important for digestion.

1633
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:54,410
That's what you're getting when you're
absorbing like these Kombucha is and shit

1634
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:56,120
like that.
You're changing your,

1635
01:34:56,210 --> 01:35:01,210
your gut and there's a lot of studies
that are trying to link that to autism and

1636
01:35:02,151 --> 01:35:06,920
they think that autism and poor gut
bacteria in the intestinal tract,

1637
01:35:06,921 --> 01:35:08,330
bacteria,
it might be an issue,

1638
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,620
the inflammation factor that inflammation
might cost or it's all sorts of

1639
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:15,570
distress throughout the entire
body. Like as a, you know, the,

1640
01:35:15,571 --> 01:35:18,740
the symbiosis of your stomach,
your digestive tract,

1641
01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:20,600
your circulatory system and your brain,

1642
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:25,550
all of them together being affected
equally that this digestive disorder might

1643
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:27,290
also fuck with people's heads.

1644
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:30,820
Yeah. Yeah. I got my guts fucked man.

1645
01:35:30,821 --> 01:35:35,730
I fart soft shits pain.
My Gut is wrong. Well,

1646
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:40,180
how's your diet? Diet's great.
Really fantastic. So what the fuck?

1647
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:45,240
I think I got GRD when I was in Florida
like 20 years ago and I never really got

1648
01:35:46,211 --> 01:35:49,000
rid of it ever since I got it.
I've had gas,

1649
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,490
Johnny are you get that
from drinking water?

1650
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:53,680
The animals shit in right down to Florida.

1651
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:56,710
They don't have fresh water very much
in Florida. So what were you doing?

1652
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,760
How'd you get it? Just staying in a hotel.
Me, me and my wife. She got rid of it.

1653
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:04,810
I never did. You got it from
all hotel? Yeah. What? Yeah.

1654
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,130
How the fuck did you get it?

1655
01:36:06,131 --> 01:36:07,960
Because they don't have a lot
of groundwater in Florida.

1656
01:36:07,961 --> 01:36:10,060
They fucking pump all that
shit in from out of town.

1657
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,890
So like the tap water cave,
you chop water gave us GRD.

1658
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:19,480
Jesus fucking Christ.
I went on like three different cycles of,

1659
01:36:19,481 --> 01:36:22,690
I figured it was tetracycline or something
to the point where the doctor was

1660
01:36:22,691 --> 01:36:26,380
like, you can't keep taking this and
it should just, it should equal out.

1661
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:30,880
And I've gone back and it never
has. Oh my God, Dude. That's insane.

1662
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,850
I've been far to once we've been in
here by the way, that wouldn't do it.

1663
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:38,860
Thank you. I appreciate
that. I would fart. Um,

1664
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,430
it, I did fart in an
elevated recently and the,

1665
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:45,160
someone did the running leg hand in,

1666
01:36:45,161 --> 01:36:48,190
opened the doors and they came in
and I just looked at him like, hey,

1667
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,980
it's an asshole move.
Mine was an asshole move,

1668
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:54,490
but you don't open up elevator doors
on somebody, so let's take a ride.

1669
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:58,460
So because he shoved his
arm in the elevator door.

1670
01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:01,780
No, I had just farted and then I
saw the hand come in. It's not,

1671
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:03,160
you don't like people
showing the hand through.

1672
01:37:03,161 --> 01:37:04,570
I don't think you should do that ever.

1673
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,690
Unless it's like if you're in a
parking structure in Santa Monica,

1674
01:37:07,691 --> 01:37:09,820
that's six stories and
there's like one elevator.

1675
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,340
So it comes every 12 and you
could stick your hand in that.

1676
01:37:12,341 --> 01:37:15,700
But if I'm into like an an office
complex and there's like six banks of

1677
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:19,390
elevators or a hotel, you don't
stick your hand in the door. Wow.

1678
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:23,650
But what if the guy's in a super hurry?
He can wait for the next elevator.

1679
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,340
I'm in a super hurry to always have sim.

1680
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:29,290
It's looking for excuses to
fart on people. Take stand.

1681
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,730
Is that what this is yours? This is
just an excuse to force it on people.

1682
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,130
Well the other thing is if you put all,
forget that I'm,

1683
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:38,860
that it's valley parking somewhere.
Like if I go to the comedy store,

1684
01:37:38,861 --> 01:37:42,940
I always forget and I'll fart before
I get there. And I was like, Oh fuck,

1685
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:48,040
sorry doc.
So

1686
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:51,810
does Giardia like you saw a noticeable
change from the way you were?

1687
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:56,940
Oh yeah. Immediate, immediate damn
fuck no, it's way better than it was,

1688
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:01,380
but it's still there. I got to watch what
I eat. Like I'm lactose intolerant now

1689
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:03,630
my friend Steve or no,

1690
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:08,690
he got Giardia and then he got
trichinosis so she to from bad beef,

1691
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:12,900
but his was for bad bear.
Oozes from eating a bear.

1692
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:17,040
But apparently he keeps it for life.
Like they kill it in your stomach,

1693
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,410
like it lives in your stomach and then it,
it goes like it migrates into your,

1694
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:26,100
your muscle cells and it hurts
like a fall. She have like agony,

1695
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,120
like muscle agony. Like you're in pain.
Like your back hurts, your shoulders hurt.

1696
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:32,850
They can't kill that.
They just plant spores in you.

1697
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:38,310
So essentially this rude of crazy, the
shit that's in your stomach that's gone.

1698
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,600
But the stuff that's in your,
your arms and your legs and your,

1699
01:38:41,601 --> 01:38:44,630
your tissue stays there for the
rest of your life. Those spores,

1700
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,360
like if you ate him, if you were in
the of the apocalypse came around,

1701
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,910
you've got to cook them 260 degrees,
160

1702
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:55,050
hall. Let me write that down. One to 60
bill. Oh, speaking of which, by the way,

1703
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:58,140
can I plug some dates fall
again? What'd we got? Addison,

1704
01:38:58,141 --> 01:39:02,700
Texas coming to see you folks.
February 28th. March 1st. Yeah.

1705
01:39:02,701 --> 01:39:07,440
It's not a great room.
Fucking room on the second floor and uh,

1706
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,900
it's just a perfect shape.
It's been around forever too.

1707
01:39:09,901 --> 01:39:12,020
So it's soaked with
laughter. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1708
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:15,530
Like the, the different sets that have
been in that room. That's a great room.

1709
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:18,830
Addison, Texas, they still have the
piano bar right next door. Oh yeah.

1710
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:19,963
That's a great

1711
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,560
a hand job shack to right around the
corner. How dare you, I didn't go.

1712
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,040
How dare you even know.
No,

1713
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:29,620
I walked past it and I saw this guy who
was loitering out front and he just kept

1714
01:39:29,621 --> 01:39:33,070
like walking back and forth
and I was like, why is this
guy hanging out in front?

1715
01:39:33,071 --> 01:39:34,960
And then I looked over and it's,
and it was like a,

1716
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:39,010
somebody told me that you can net Tel
it's a jack check because if it has a neon

1717
01:39:39,011 --> 01:39:40,060
footprint on it,

1718
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,710
those are the jacket that's like a sign
that it's a happy ending place. Really.

1719
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:49,990
That's what a certain comedian told me.
I don't know if he's right,

1720
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:54,220
but isn't that like a reflexology thing?
That's what they want you to think.

1721
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:59,290
No Shit. Yeah. So you go in, they rub your
feet, just jerk you off. Have no idea.

1722
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:02,110
I didn't even touch your feet.
If I had a choice,

1723
01:40:02,111 --> 01:40:04,570
if I was going to do what I would
say as long as I'm in here, you know,

1724
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:06,130
let's get the feet gone first.

1725
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,560
Yeah. Some people like get weirded
out about people touching their feet,

1726
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:12,150
only not into it at all.

1727
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:15,160
I like women's feet.
I enjoy looking at women's face.

1728
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,830
Well when they're attractive, you
know, I never attractive. It's great.

1729
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:26,920
What is it about that though? I mean,
if not, I'm not asking you personally,

1730
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:28,750
but what is it about like,

1731
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:34,070
like why would a guy give a shit about
a girl if it girls toes took a hook turn

1732
01:40:34,151 --> 01:40:37,900
and her feet are all but like what?
Why? What does it even affect us?

1733
01:40:37,901 --> 01:40:41,280
Like why is it more desirable
to see like perfect toes, right?

1734
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:45,600
I mean it's just me. My personal thing
is I believe it shows they're evil.

1735
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:51,700
They're haunted hammer
toe equals haunted you,

1736
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:54,190
but she will kill you one day.

1737
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,990
At that time you'll be sleeping.
I'll send,

1738
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,900
you'll feel this little hook going
around your trachea and you'll look and

1739
01:40:58,901 --> 01:40:59,734
you'll see an ankle.

1740
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:03,760
Can you imagine if people
were that transparent where
the way their hands looked

1741
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:08,080
was like how deadly or nice they were?
Yeah. So if people had beautiful, smooth,

1742
01:41:08,081 --> 01:41:09,880
clean hands,
you never had to worry about them.

1743
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:13,320
They're all knuckled up and
fucked up after wine number.

1744
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:16,960
Her sisters had those nasty fucking feet.
He couldn't fit in the shoes.

1745
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:21,730
That's right. She was the original
foot fetish. Worship Goddess shoot was,

1746
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:25,780
but maybe she was just a part of a
narrative. That's been going on forever.

1747
01:41:25,781 --> 01:41:28,550
Like the Chinese people with
their binding bindings. Yeah.

1748
01:41:28,551 --> 01:41:31,990
It's the craziest shit of all.
That's crazy. That's so frightening.

1749
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:33,790
But it's totally logical if you go back,

1750
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:36,190
I mean if you put it in
context of going back,

1751
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:40,540
you could show wealth by saying it
wasn't just the aesthetic of small feat.

1752
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:45,190
It was also saying my bitch doesn't
have to work. I can bind her feet.

1753
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:49,120
That's how much money I have. Good
Lord. Yeah. Yeah. She could never work.

1754
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:50,050
Work in the fields.

1755
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:54,970
That's why Japanese people were fucking
hats and sunblock and gloves because in

1756
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:59,800
their culture having fair skin
is a sign of wealth. Wow. Right.

1757
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:02,590
Once you know in some cultures
are trying to bleach people,

1758
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:06,650
like Filipinos are really
getting into glutathione,

1759
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,540
which is I think it's like an amino acid
or something like that. Some nutrition.

1760
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:14,020
I mean I, I take it actually it's like
really good for your liver, but they,

1761
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:17,980
they're taking this stuff and through
some injection process that I don't

1762
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:22,210
totally understand. It makes your
skin lighter so they want to be like,

1763
01:42:22,211 --> 01:42:25,460
maybe they're darker brown Filipinos.
They want to be light because light,

1764
01:42:25,461 --> 01:42:28,020
lighter state. That's what
Michael Jackson did. No,

1765
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,540
Michael Jackson had what I
have. He had vitiligo. Yeah.

1766
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,550
If you look at my hands like
you see these spots on my hands,

1767
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:36,520
I'm just a white guy so it
doesn't look that freaky.

1768
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:40,630
But if I get a tan it can look
pretty freaky. Like all my knuckles,

1769
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,280
like trauma areas are big areas that
get it like knuckles because you know

1770
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:48,850
anytime you get cuts, scratches
sometimes that can turn to Ville.

1771
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,350
Lygo I have to put like a, an ointment
on it to keep it from spreading. Yeah.

1772
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:55,900
But um, plus you, your hairy
so it just looks like patches,

1773
01:42:55,901 --> 01:42:59,590
a hair on your knuckles. But
Michael, but I'm a white guy. Again,

1774
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:04,060
it's not that much of a contrast between
the area where I have pigment in the

1775
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:07,090
area where I don't have pigment.
But if you're black,

1776
01:43:07,091 --> 01:43:08,830
like Michael Jackson
was when he was young.

1777
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:12,190
It's super traumatic for a lot of people.
Some people freak out,

1778
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:15,970
they have like some really good remedies
for it now they've ointment that can

1779
01:43:15,971 --> 01:43:17,650
pretty much stop it from spreading.

1780
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:21,100
And they have these poobah treatments
that they do that re pigment areas.

1781
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:23,590
They're pretty good at it now.
But the Michael Jackson days,

1782
01:43:23,591 --> 01:43:28,180
they couldn't do shit. You know, I'm the
opposite. I'm so fair that I try to, uh,

1783
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:32,920
I try to darken like on the weekends I
put a black shoe Polish on my face and I

1784
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:33,754
go sing.

1785
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:37,930
Do you leave like a white thing around
your mouth so you don't fuck your food up?

1786
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,580
I'll eat some pattern down.
That's me flooring.

1787
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:47,500
I'm also,
I'm going to be at the helium comedy club.

1788
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,100
Oh, I forgot what we were doing.
March 6th and seventh. Uh,

1789
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:59,030
don't forget Denver comedy works. I think
it's your favorite club in the country.

1790
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:00,410
March 12th through 14th.

1791
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,630
You just rattled off two of my
favorite clubs in the country.

1792
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:05,980
Helium and Philly is fucking
amazing. Amazing. And uh,

1793
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:09,230
the comedy works where it did my last
special rocky mountain high did that to

1794
01:44:09,231 --> 01:44:13,010
calm me down was so great. It's the best
club ever. Yeah, it's the best club.

1795
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:16,580
It's just so perfect. I mean, there's a
bunch of the best clubs ever. You know,

1796
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:19,810
there's like five or six of them all
over the country. Those are two of them.

1797
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,430
The top five right there.
And then the Hollywood Improv,

1798
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:26,480
which is definitely up in that,
uh, rankings. That's a great spot.

1799
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:28,550
March 21st that's a fucking great spot.

1800
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,800
The Hollywood improv is so that's such
a good fucking room for comedy and such

1801
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:35,510
like a high level room.
You go there,

1802
01:44:35,511 --> 01:44:40,310
you see Judd Apatow working out and you
know, I mean you're there all the time.

1803
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:44,390
There's so many good comics there that's
a, that's a fucking showcase spot man.

1804
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:47,720
And they run a tight, they keep it
on time for the most part. You know,

1805
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:52,490
if they had a Arsenio hall dropped in
one night and he did about 35 at the top

1806
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:56,180
of the shell on announced.
And I spent a, I don't know,

1807
01:44:56,181 --> 01:45:00,580
16 at my 20 minutes shitting all over
Arsenio Hall for going along and they,

1808
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,870
they have crowd fucking went crazy. I
think he tanked it. Oh, did he really?

1809
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,930
Nothing like starting to show
off with a tank and going,

1810
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:12,860
you know, over your five it
dropped buys five minutes.

1811
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:17,270
That's all they were giving them. Yeah.
Well that's not good, but I don't know,

1812
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:19,970
10 minutes. What? What was his playing?
It was supposed to do any, hey,

1813
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:24,500
are you listening to Arsenio? Whoa.
Throwing it down. I know that dude.

1814
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:28,880
He's a good guy. He's a very nice guy.
I never met him. He's a very nice guy.

1815
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:31,570
He left before I started.
I talked to him, um,

1816
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:36,290
really recently about a social media
stuff when he was doing the new version of

1817
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:39,260
the Arsenio Hall show.
They took over social media,

1818
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:42,740
like it's Facebook and it's Twitter and
I'll let you, they asked to do that now.

1819
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:46,070
Like there was a, I was doing this
one thing. They asked me to do that.

1820
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,240
They wanted to go over my Twitter.
I go, fuck you. Like what?

1821
01:45:50,241 --> 01:45:51,110
Are you crazy?

1822
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:53,920
But we're going to tweet for you the
fuck you're going to tweet for me. Yeah.

1823
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,980
Like, no, you're not like you want
to start a Twitter page for the show.

1824
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,380
Will you start that and then
you can tweet from that.

1825
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:03,740
You're not gonna tweet from my personal
Twitter page just because I'm on a show.

1826
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,460
Like the idea that you have to give it up.

1827
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,720
Genius in the Digital Marketing Department
brought that up in a meeting and they

1828
01:46:08,721 --> 01:46:10,430
went,
sounds like a good idea Phil.

1829
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:13,880
Will you imagine you have to be such
a whore that you have to give up your

1830
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:18,620
Twitter page? Like get the fuck
out of here. No, can't, no,

1831
01:46:18,621 --> 01:46:21,170
you can't have my Twitter page.
If you want me to tweet stuff,

1832
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:24,200
send it to me and I'll tweet
it if I agree with it. Yeah,

1833
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,680
but you can't take boot for him. He
didn't even think about it. He just,

1834
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:30,830
he like didn't think that it was a
big deal. It was just like Yay, cool.

1835
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:32,150
But now he's trying to get it back.

1836
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:35,810
Like he was struggling to get it back
under his own control after show was

1837
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:40,220
canceled. No Shit. I was like,
this is ridiculous. Wow. They like,

1838
01:46:40,221 --> 01:46:45,200
they own your social media presence,
which is worth a fuck load of money. Yeah.

1839
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:50,190
Like, what if you did a project for,
you know, name x production company and

1840
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:55,220
in the project was they can tweet
anything they want from your social media

1841
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:59,250
sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.
They can tweet anything they want.

1842
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:00,690
They're going to get put
out anything they want.

1843
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:04,590
They would just release
commercials all day. Yeah. I mean,

1844
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:07,110
imagine if that was in your contract
and they just started putting out like,

1845
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:10,860
there's a tide commercial on
your fucking Twitter feed tied.

1846
01:47:10,861 --> 01:47:15,180
Got My clothes smelling fucking
amazing breakfast Simmons.

1847
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:18,570
And then there's a video and you're
like, watts, yeah, I can't believe this.

1848
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:21,000
And then you call your age and like, Look
Greg, it's in the contract. He's like,

1849
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,990
Oh my God, I'm retired. And
they like Mecca. It's funny,

1850
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:29,220
it's about the Greg Fitzsimmons show. It's
funny, but it's also product placement.

1851
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:31,500
Yeah. He'd be like, oh no,

1852
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:35,790
nobody can really write a tweet for you.
That doesn't sound like it's not you.

1853
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:37,980
It's kind of like,
because it's so tight,

1854
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:40,800
it's like it really has
to be your wording. Yeah.

1855
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:44,070
You would have to get somebody who
really knew you well. Like I put out,

1856
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:45,390
when I put out my podcast,

1857
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:48,660
I have my producer put out the tweet
because he's the one that uploads it.

1858
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:53,150
So then I know that as soon as it uploads,
he just sends a tweet saying, uh, so I,

1859
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:57,690
I give him a blurb to write ahead of time
so that when it goes up, it's written.

1860
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,840
But sometimes if I don't give him one,
he writes it and it just immediately,

1861
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,310
I don't know what it is.
Like something subtle.

1862
01:48:02,311 --> 01:48:05,820
You can just tell it wasn't sent by
the person that it says it is. Okay.

1863
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:08,250
Well you get a sense of
someone who they are,

1864
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:12,840
when you read just their
posts on a message board or
you read their Twitter feed,

1865
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:18,210
you don't get it all. But if you're
reading 140 characters a day,

1866
01:48:18,211 --> 01:48:20,910
over a long period of time,
140 characters,

1867
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,680
a tweet rather over a long period of time,

1868
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:25,230
you kind of get a sense of the terrain.

1869
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:30,740
You kind of get a sense of the way people
phrase things and say how angry they

1870
01:48:30,751 --> 01:48:33,780
are. Oh yeah. That's a
big indicator of anger.

1871
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:37,380
You could find out some fucked up shit
about people just by reading their angry

1872
01:48:37,381 --> 01:48:41,430
tweets. Yeah. Like what are you getting
mad at? Dummy? Yeah. Like Jesus Christ,

1873
01:48:41,431 --> 01:48:43,500
like this person away
from your fucking life

1874
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:47,360
and just everything's like, I have
to watch myself. I can get bit or,

1875
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,820
because I think it's funny
to write something that,

1876
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,350
and I'm not really being bitter.

1877
01:48:51,351 --> 01:48:54,690
It's just like it's the easy
path to a laugh better. Yeah.

1878
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:58,040
And then I looked back and I go, wow,
that was 12 bitter ones in a row.

1879
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,080
How the fuck do I look right now?

1880
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:04,580
I uh, follow several people
that I think are idiots and uh,

1881
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:08,360
one of the things that I really enjoy
following is people that are not very

1882
01:49:08,361 --> 01:49:13,340
bright, but they give a lot of advice.
Yeah. Like people are not very bright,

1883
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:15,530
but they're,
their Twitter feed is always advice.

1884
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:19,470
Like what you need to do in this
world is go for your dreams. And like

1885
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:24,980
you read their Twitter, you're like,
oh, okay. I think it's an insight.

1886
01:49:25,010 --> 01:49:28,700
It's an insight to like someone's
struggling for sanity insight to someone

1887
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:33,110
trying to like find,
find sense in the world with this doll.

1888
01:49:33,111 --> 01:49:34,460
Nine volt brain.

1889
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:36,360
Yeah,
it's def.

1890
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:40,050
It's definitely the access to giving
people information has outweighed the

1891
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:44,700
ability to supply it in an equality
way. There's just, there's just like,

1892
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,130
I even feel it. Like I can't,
I can't tweet every day

1893
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,420
sometimes I just don't really have
anything to say. But you know,

1894
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:54,190
you feel like I should put something out
today and then you write something and

1895
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:56,440
you go, what if I could I
write that for that was stupid.

1896
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:00,430
I liked taking news off of Twitter.
I think it's good to do. Yeah. Yeah.

1897
01:50:00,431 --> 01:50:04,510
Cause I think some days I don't have
shit to say. I think taking days off, um,

1898
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:07,270
you know, I was talking about
this the other day we were,

1899
01:50:07,271 --> 01:50:10,780
we were talking about stand up in this
way, that taking days off standup,

1900
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:13,390
taking weeks off, stand up. I think
it was Collin was talking to him,

1901
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:18,160
we were talking about how if you go and
go and go your act, it's really tight.

1902
01:50:18,161 --> 01:50:19,180
Everything feels really good.

1903
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:21,640
But when you take like a week
off and then jump back in,

1904
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:25,010
the enthusiasm just cranks back up again.
You know?

1905
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,760
I think that's the case with
pretty much everything in life.

1906
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:30,880
If you do things too much,
you'll lose your perspective.

1907
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:34,740
Like you lose like what it is about that
thing that you really enjoy. Like yeah,

1908
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:38,050
you need little breaks. Hey, your bit
at big can get a lot stronger when you,

1909
01:50:38,051 --> 01:50:41,710
when you walk away from it for a little
while and you come back and you go, oh,

1910
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:44,380
I didn't even get why I wrote that bit.
That's,

1911
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:47,890
that's what I was originally
thinking. It's about this. Yeah.

1912
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,090
You tighten it up and you realize
that like for me, you know,

1913
01:50:52,091 --> 01:50:55,030
you make a lot of choices throughout a
bit. I can go this way or go that way.

1914
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:58,840
Sometimes you just get to clarity when
you come back to it to see that you were,

1915
01:50:59,080 --> 01:50:59,861
that that was a,

1916
01:50:59,861 --> 01:51:03,220
you got a cheap laugh off that one time
and you thought that was part of the bet

1917
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,490
and it wasn't. It was just a, it
was a, you got lost for a second.

1918
01:51:06,491 --> 01:51:07,870
You got to come back?
Yeah,

1919
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:12,700
I have a bit that I just added to
another book that I abandoned years ago.

1920
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:17,700
Like I had it and then I lost it.
Like I had it for a while.

1921
01:51:17,701 --> 01:51:22,150
It's like very strong bit and then I
fucked something up with it or tweaked it

1922
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:24,910
wrong and, and it just got too
complicated and I was like,

1923
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:26,410
well there's too many
jokes similar to that. My,

1924
01:51:26,411 --> 01:51:30,250
I'll just put aside and I put
it aside for years and years.

1925
01:51:30,251 --> 01:51:31,540
And the other day I was on stage,

1926
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:35,710
I was in the middle of one bit and
I started thinking about, oh my God,

1927
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:40,750
that fits right in there.
And like a glove, it just
slid into place and crushed.

1928
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:42,370
It was like almost like I was holding,

1929
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:45,880
it was a wedge that I didn't have a gap
for. Yeah. And then all of a sudden,

1930
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:49,720
oh it's right there. Yeah. And all
its liabilities were out the window.

1931
01:51:49,721 --> 01:51:52,610
Cause it didn't like it as a standalone
bit. It didn't have an ending. It's like,

1932
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:56,980
but when I shoved it in the middle of
this other bit that already had an ending,

1933
01:51:56,981 --> 01:52:00,340
he just made that bit way better and
you didn't have to work on it and fine

1934
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:03,160
tuning it already done that work.
It just needed a place.

1935
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,470
That's why I think standup comedy,

1936
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:10,530
like spending time just going over your
act is like one of the one things that

1937
01:52:10,901 --> 01:52:12,190
we all could do more of.

1938
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:16,720
I did this thing with Ari where
I went over a shiny happy jihad,

1939
01:52:16,721 --> 01:52:21,721
which was CD I put out in like 86 or
something like that or a 2006 rather.

1940
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:25,330
And um, when we went over it, we're
talking about why you did this,

1941
01:52:25,331 --> 01:52:26,140
why he did that.

1942
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:29,950
And I really hadn't thought about a lot
of it and listening to it for the first

1943
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:32,440
time in all these years.
Like I don't remember the jokes.

1944
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:35,710
So like a few of them I remembered, but
some of them were really making me laugh.

1945
01:52:35,711 --> 01:52:38,780
Like I didn't, I never had heard them
before. Even though there were mine,

1946
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,730
you know, I could be completely forgot
them and going over it like that,

1947
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:47,570
like made me like super fucking to go
to stand up and I got on this like real

1948
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:52,460
rampage over the next few weeks after
that there really helped me and it made me

1949
01:52:52,461 --> 01:52:54,760
think like, man, that's
probably an aspect, um,

1950
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:58,550
of comedy that we don't like to do that
we probably all should be doing sitting

1951
01:52:58,551 --> 01:53:02,160
down, going over all of your
act, going over to your note,

1952
01:53:02,161 --> 01:53:05,930
what's going over all the different bits
and is this the right order for them?

1953
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:08,330
What's a better order?
Why don't we try this order tonight?

1954
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:10,820
Why don't we try this for the first
show and that for the second show.

1955
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:11,940
Well that's just nice

1956
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:14,820
that when you go to a club and you worked
there for three nights as you got two

1957
01:53:14,821 --> 01:53:19,650
afternoons where you can take your sat
and listened to it the next day and think

1958
01:53:19,651 --> 01:53:22,950
about it and then give yourself some
time to write new shit. And you know,

1959
01:53:22,951 --> 01:53:26,120
you really have nothing to do except
focus on your stand up for, you know,

1960
01:53:26,130 --> 01:53:27,390
two straight days.

1961
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:31,170
Then you come back to La and you gotta
you go on at the Improv or somewhere and

1962
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:35,850
people are like, wow, you got like fucking
lot of new material there. That's good.

1963
01:53:35,851 --> 01:53:38,310
And like you wouldn't have that
if you were just working in town.

1964
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:41,620
Right. Or if you were, you need to
have to be really disciplined. Yeah.

1965
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:44,260
Really disciplined to make sure that
you're just going up and doing this.

1966
01:53:44,261 --> 01:53:47,240
Is this 15 minutes is going
to be all about blank. Yeah.

1967
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:51,520
It's just a fun, fun fucking
thing to do, man. Yeah.

1968
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,850
Still after all these years,
people who don't know,

1969
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:58,420
we started out together like within a
week of each other. Right. That's crazy.

1970
01:53:58,450 --> 01:54:02,910
Yeah. Dude, we're only shy
25 years old as fuck. Yeah.

1971
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:03,850
We're all this shit.

1972
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:06,970
Remember when you were a kid and you
thought of someone who was 47 you're like,

1973
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,710
what's Eh, 47 that was beyond
marriage. Like Middle Ages,

1974
01:54:11,711 --> 01:54:16,180
40 dead man. Yeah. I remember I was in
high school and I had a thing for Madonna.

1975
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:20,230
I found that Madonna was 26 it's
like God damn, that bitch is old.

1976
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:25,360
She's 26 good Lord. Yeah. Yeah.

1977
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:30,590
I used to like older. I always
liked older women. How old?

1978
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:35,270
Well, when I was, um, I guess,

1979
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,040
I guess when I was in like ninth grade,

1980
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:39,620
I fooled around with this girl that was
a senior, but it was like, you know,

1981
01:54:39,621 --> 01:54:41,420
she wasn't doing it because
she was turned on by me.

1982
01:54:41,421 --> 01:54:44,870
It was just like I hung around or a
lot and she was like, throw me a bone.

1983
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:47,420
So she let me see your tits and stuff.

1984
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:52,280
But then when I was like 19 I dated a
woman who was turning 40 that summer.

1985
01:54:52,281 --> 01:54:55,940
It was like a whole summer long romance.
Whoa. She is this big corporate lawyer.

1986
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:56,870
Very successful.

1987
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:59,960
And I was living out in the Hamptons
with my brother and another guy and like

1988
01:54:59,961 --> 01:55:03,380
this shitty,
it was a one bedroom just flee written.

1989
01:55:03,381 --> 01:55:07,760
You woke up every day covered in bites
and they had a two bedroom next to us,

1990
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:11,720
her and her sister. The Palumbo
sisters and they would, uh,

1991
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:14,750
they had this beautiful two better with
like top shelf liquor and they were

1992
01:55:14,751 --> 01:55:17,060
Italian from queens and so they would,

1993
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:21,560
they'd come out and they would cook
pasta and chicken cutlets everything all

1994
01:55:21,561 --> 01:55:23,720
weekend and we would just move over there.

1995
01:55:23,721 --> 01:55:27,230
My brother was hooking up with one sister
and I was hooking up with the other

1996
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:32,150
one and then we would just like fuck
around and eat and drink and then we'd go

1997
01:55:32,151 --> 01:55:35,390
dancing with them at night and then they'd
leave on Sunday night and they'd give

1998
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:37,880
us like all this Tupperware with
all the leftovers in it that we'd,

1999
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,650
we'd survive on for a couple more days.
Then they come out on the weekends. Oh,

2000
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:43,850
she was the greatest. Wow. Yeah.

2001
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:49,020
40. Huh? 40 years old. You were 19.
I was 19. How was her body? Good.

2002
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:51,690
Good. You know, Italian girls the age,

2003
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:54,900
well at Brown skin tight.

2004
01:55:55,890 --> 01:56:00,690
Was she getting off a big divorce
feet? No, she was a workaholic. Thanks.

2005
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:05,100
She was know she was a corporate lawyer.
She was big time and a lot of money.

2006
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:10,180
Was she on top most of the time?
Yeah. She took control. Wow. So yeah,

2007
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:13,320
she'd ride it. Yes. She'd hold
the base and then it was all,

2008
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:18,210
it was like hers all up to her.
Wow. Standard shift. She fucked you.

2009
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:22,950
She fucked me. Whoa. I pushed back and
she'd yell at me, Whoa, you don't move.

2010
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:26,220
Whoa. You Little Shit. You
spit in your mouth. You're in
high school. Spit my mouth.

2011
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:30,820
Stick her feet and that's where the foot
thing, she would stick her feet. Oh, cut.

2012
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:35,730
Nah, we allow it to be on
top. Oh yeah. No. Look,

2013
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:39,670
I was an adult when I was 19 I was an
animal. I couldn't be stopped. I just,

2014
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,400
I just was so horny.

2015
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:44,910
I was so horny that when women finally
let me start having sex with them,

2016
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,780
I would ravage them. I would
just, I my hands, I was,

2017
01:56:48,781 --> 01:56:51,270
you wouldn't see me laying
with my arms by my side.

2018
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:54,000
I didn't care for having sex for an hour.
I was still working.

2019
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:55,440
I would grab a nipple.

2020
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:59,550
Fucking fishhook hands
were moving all the time.

2021
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:03,390
Can I get one in the asshole that
night then? I am. I'm checking.

2022
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:07,230
I'm going to check the oil, check
it every time. Get Away with here.

2023
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:11,880
How far can I push it on every single
encounter. That was my emo. Wow.

2024
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,690
Yeah, you're an animal. Then they stop you
when you go. All right. That's the line.

2025
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:19,560
We don't cross that till
next time we try it again.

2026
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:24,470
If you thought about the
difference between you as
like a 12 year old or 11 year

2027
01:57:24,471 --> 01:57:29,150
old and then puberty and then riding
the furious waves of pure beauty,

2028
01:57:29,151 --> 01:57:32,990
which is what I call like 16 1718 yeah,
like those years,

2029
01:57:32,991 --> 01:57:37,280
like into 19 even though like by the time
you like figure out how to stay on the

2030
01:57:37,281 --> 01:57:38,114
wave,

2031
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:42,770
the wave of hormones that your body starts
producing and how different you are,

2032
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:46,880
your observations on life are like when
you're 10 you don't give a fuck about

2033
01:57:46,881 --> 01:57:51,710
ass or tits or feet or high heels or
the way a girl puts her lipstick on.

2034
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:56,080
But when you're 17 you're jerking off to
magazines. Like you're taking magazines,

2035
01:57:56,090 --> 01:58:00,940
you're beaten off on the girls' pictures,
on magazines. Like look at naked bodies,

2036
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,980
you're fading off

2037
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:04,271
and all.

2038
01:58:04,271 --> 01:58:08,530
I can just remember going into a white
noise space where nothing else mattered.

2039
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:13,720
I was jerking off and the world shut
down around me. It was just so intense.

2040
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:16,690
It was like, I guess what somebody would
feel like if they went in like heroine.

2041
01:58:16,691 --> 01:58:21,640
Nod.
It was so like all encompassing.

2042
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:26,460
Yeah, it's a drug. I mean your
body's trying to reproduce.

2043
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:31,170
Your body's trying to give you
all these fucking neuro chemicals.

2044
01:58:31,171 --> 01:58:34,800
These feel good juices to
pump through your body.

2045
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:40,130
Serotonin and dopamine and
love and oxytocin and calm.

2046
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:41,680
Hurry up,
calm.

2047
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,800
Ah Good.
We,

2048
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:49,000
when we reproduce and the eggs break open,

2049
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:51,730
the little kid comes out screaming.
You're like, how the fuck?

2050
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:54,280
Cause they tricked you
with that come juice.

2051
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:59,200
That's that feeling that you get
when you just, oh, rub my balls. Oh,

2052
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:02,350
that's how you make a
person that's sweet relief.

2053
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:06,730
It's this weird biological trick.
Isn't that amazing? It's the most,

2054
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:10,750
it's the most intense, incredible thing
you do and it's also the most intense,

2055
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:13,180
incredible feeling that
you're having while you do it.

2056
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:16,570
And if you don't smoke pot,
you don't even know what sex feels like.

2057
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,220
You think you do? We'd make
sex feel so much better. Hey,

2058
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:23,890
what did you think of that article I
sent you from the New Yorker about the,

2059
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:28,090
isn't that wild? Yeah. Explain
what it is. Basically, you know,

2060
01:59:28,091 --> 01:59:32,080
all the testing that they did on
mushrooms and LSD back in the 60s.

2061
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:35,290
I mean starting, I think they started
and let like the forties right? Well,

2062
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:39,640
Gordon Wasson was the guy who originally
started bringing mushrooms to the

2063
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:43,330
Western world. Who was the one who
started, I think it was a life magazine.

2064
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:48,250
They publish some shit about him or
some shit about, uh, his, uh, his, uh,

2065
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,910
trials to Mexico's travels to Mexico and
his experiments with magic mushrooms.

2066
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:56,110
I think that was, I think
that was in the 50s yeah. So,

2067
01:59:56,170 --> 02:00:00,340
so they did all these studies and then
obviously the CIA did all the LSD studies

2068
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:03,130
and the fifties and sixties,
they're mostly fifties, I think.

2069
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:07,540
And then all the sudden they
outlawed it and they just said,

2070
02:00:07,541 --> 02:00:10,900
bury that data and it just disappeared.

2071
02:00:10,901 --> 02:00:14,170
You cannot find any of the testing
results that they did from back then.

2072
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,660
And so they lost a lot of good progress.

2073
02:00:16,661 --> 02:00:21,661
And so this New Yorker piece is talking
about how suddenly scientists are

2074
02:00:21,911 --> 02:00:24,580
getting the green light
from major universities.

2075
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:29,580
Harvard and Yale and Boston University
are all funding studies to look back into

2076
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:33,790
what he called the drug and magic
mushrooms, psilocybin, psilocybin.

2077
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:38,810
And what they're doing is they're
doing control testing, um,

2078
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:42,880
and they're giving it to
people specifically that
have terminal illnesses and

2079
02:00:42,881 --> 02:00:47,230
helping them deal with the,
you know, the, their mortality,

2080
02:00:47,231 --> 02:00:48,820
literary that they're going to die.

2081
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:50,830
And how do you wrap your head around
that and how do you deal with the

2082
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:55,090
depression that comes with that and
they're giving them the mushrooms and

2083
02:00:55,091 --> 02:01:00,010
they're having, their 70% of them are
having mystical experiences like God,

2084
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:04,240
like experiences and then
they are holding on to it.

2085
02:01:04,241 --> 02:01:05,230
It doesn't go away.

2086
02:01:05,231 --> 02:01:10,231
They are walking through the rest of
their lives realizing that all is love.

2087
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:11,763
They said that's the,

2088
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,640
the common thread that runs through all
of them is that it's all about love.

2089
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:19,220
And they get that in their head and
they die with it whenever, you know,

2090
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:20,980
if they last another year or two years,

2091
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:26,410
they don't need another experience on
the mushrooms to get back to that place.

2092
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:28,660
It stays with them.
Well,

2093
02:01:28,661 --> 02:01:31,660
I think if you were at a real
transformative period of your life,

2094
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:35,560
I mean that's the biggest transformation
ever, right? Going from life to death,

2095
02:01:35,561 --> 02:01:39,980
the ultimate last trip that we all take,
you're probably like super

2096
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,980
emotional and very engaged and I would
imagine that under that kind of stress

2097
02:01:45,501 --> 02:01:50,180
and that kind of like uncertainty, a
mushroom trip would be even more profound.

2098
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,570
But if you have a,

2099
02:01:52,571 --> 02:01:56,390
a real powerful psychedelic
trip and it doesn't change your,

2100
02:01:56,391 --> 02:01:59,900
your complete total view of,
of reality,

2101
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:03,620
he probably just didn't get a high
enough dose. That's all it is. I mean,

2102
02:02:03,621 --> 02:02:06,650
I know I've talked to a lot of people
who've done mushrooms and they loved it.

2103
02:02:06,651 --> 02:02:09,530
They had a great time. They're like,
oh my God, we were on the beach.

2104
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:12,530
We were so silly. We laugh for
hours. It was so beautiful.

2105
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:17,240
It was this amazing experience opened me
up to the way the world was and made me

2106
02:02:17,241 --> 02:02:21,530
feel like they probably had that wonderful
experience. They really probably did.

2107
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:24,410
But the difference between that kind of
experience and like what they're giving

2108
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:25,940
these people in these,
these trials,

2109
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:29,930
like you give people like five
dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms,

2110
02:02:29,931 --> 02:02:34,160
that's like a big breakthrough dose
and you have this overwhelming like

2111
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:36,770
incredible visionary,

2112
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,730
like transformative experience
that most people don't get to.

2113
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:44,600
Like the DMT experience is supposedly
the most intense that of all the

2114
02:02:44,601 --> 02:02:48,300
psychedelics at,
of all the Wood Mckenna used to call,

2115
02:02:48,301 --> 02:02:51,080
like the center of the
Mandalah. If those all, all,

2116
02:02:51,081 --> 02:02:55,660
all psychedelic experiences vary,
whether it's Payoti or mushrooms or, um,

2117
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:00,100
you know, sage, which is, um, um, uh,

2118
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:04,580
what is that fucking one that
everybody gets at grocery stores?

2119
02:03:04,581 --> 02:03:08,420
It's still available. Salvia,
Salvia divinorum. It's
essentially like a sage plant.

2120
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:12,080
They all like reach some
different psychedelic state.

2121
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:16,220
But the center of the Mandala of the
craziest one is the dimethyltryptamine

2122
02:03:16,221 --> 02:03:19,540
experience. And if you
have the dimethyltryptamine
experience, like I said,

2123
02:03:19,541 --> 02:03:24,541
it's impossible to look at the rest of
reality the same way again because you

2124
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:28,760
always know that that's, that's in
your head last very, very short.

2125
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:32,390
It's only like 15 minutes. No, but
I'm saying how long does the effect,

2126
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:38,170
it depends on how much you entrench
yourself in the the common threads and

2127
02:03:39,531 --> 02:03:41,390
themes and pathways of everyday life.

2128
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:44,750
You can jump right back into everyday
life and it doesn't last very long at all.

2129
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:50,020
It's like this unbelievably
profound loving experience
where when it's happening

2130
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:51,440
you,
you,

2131
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:56,360
you just feel overwhelmed first of all
by the truth in these entities that

2132
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:58,880
you're encountering,
like how much they know about you,

2133
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:02,600
like how much they know about who you
are and then the reality of like that

2134
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:05,390
might not even be entities.
That might be you. It might be,

2135
02:04:05,391 --> 02:04:10,070
there are many use that encompass you
just like there's billions of eco lie

2136
02:04:10,071 --> 02:04:10,970
living in your gut.

2137
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:16,040
There might be like various streams
of consciousness that are almost like

2138
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:19,010
entities that exist in your
mind at any given time.

2139
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:22,580
And you might be tapping into these and
turning these two 11 when you're on a

2140
02:04:22,581 --> 02:04:23,414
psychedelic,

2141
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,900
it might be what the psychedelic is
really doing is introducing you the

2142
02:04:26,901 --> 02:04:31,760
potential of all the chemicals in your
mind if like optimized and it's one brief

2143
02:04:31,761 --> 02:04:34,590
burst of love and color and and,

2144
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:38,760
and just geometric objects,
patterns, just representing

2145
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,750
imagination at its
fullest, wild Liz, wildest,

2146
02:04:42,751 --> 02:04:43,980
most open flower.

2147
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:46,440
And then that might be what's happening
when you're doing these things.

2148
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:51,090
But regardless of what the actual, you
know, whether it's both or neither one,

2149
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,580
the experiences themselves,

2150
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:57,210
they changed the way you view the world
because you know that that's possible

2151
02:04:57,211 --> 02:04:59,220
now where you never knew
that that was possible.

2152
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:03,860
You always felt like everything
in my life, you know, if, if I,

2153
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:06,540
there was a scale from the worst
experiences I've ever had to,

2154
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:10,140
the best experiences I've ever had.
Everything is sort of categorized.

2155
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:12,390
So it was like, well, I know what
it's like to be scared. Well,

2156
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:13,680
I know what it's like
to be in a car accident.

2157
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:15,540
Well I know what it's
like to get a blow job.

2158
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:17,510
I know what it's like to play
football. I know, you know,

2159
02:05:17,511 --> 02:05:18,930
you know you have all
these things and you say,

2160
02:05:18,931 --> 02:05:21,270
well I have a pretty good
idea of what life is.

2161
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:25,710
And then you take three hits off
of this little vaporizer piping

2162
02:05:28,450 --> 02:05:28,600
and

2163
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,840
he looks like crackling,

2164
02:05:29,841 --> 02:05:34,841
like burning plastic and you see this
chrysanthemum looking sort of like the

2165
02:05:35,691 --> 02:05:40,010
flower of life. You know, that flower of
life that's described like you, you a,

2166
02:05:40,011 --> 02:05:43,550
you see it in a lot of like
ancient Hindu art. Yeah. It's um,

2167
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:47,050
it's a geometric pattern and um,
this flower of like you,

2168
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:50,630
you see this flower of life,
Dmt, DMT. Oh yeah, for sure.

2169
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,980
Almost everybody sees it or you see some
version of it, but the things that are,

2170
02:05:54,981 --> 02:05:58,640
you're seeing are happening so
fast. It's so diff in, they're all,

2171
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:00,350
they're never the same thing.
Look,

2172
02:06:00,351 --> 02:06:03,800
you look at something and
they become something else.
Like instantly, constantly,

2173
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:06,950
always changing. So you never
can really lock onto anything.

2174
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:10,940
Everything is constantly moving
and morphing and looking at you.

2175
02:06:10,941 --> 02:06:13,820
And sometimes he's like gestures
and they're giving you the finger.

2176
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:15,040
And then they disappeared,

2177
02:06:15,041 --> 02:06:19,630
which won behind these fractal
psych clones of geometric patterns.

2178
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:21,950
It turn it into flowers
that turn into grass.

2179
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:25,490
They turn it to babies coming out
of vaginas that turning to you,

2180
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:28,490
they're turning to
handshakes and hugs and love.

2181
02:06:28,491 --> 02:06:33,410
And it is insane.
And it happens for about 15 minutes.

2182
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:36,320
And when it's over, just knowing
that that can ever happen. Yeah,

2183
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:39,810
it's just a matter of whether or not you
remember it. Well, they said also it,

2184
02:06:39,811 --> 02:06:42,320
it deals with depression.
It helps people with depression a lot.

2185
02:06:42,321 --> 02:06:44,810
And I think it's maybe that when
you're depressed for long enough,

2186
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:48,020
you literally forget what
it feels like to feel good.

2187
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,010
And I think that by giving you that
intense of a good positive experience,

2188
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:55,970
it makes you go, Oh yeah, I'm supposed
to try. I'm supposed to, you know,

2189
02:06:56,150 --> 02:07:00,440
achieve that in whatever means I can, you
know, whether it's exercise or you know,

2190
02:07:00,441 --> 02:07:04,010
sex or whatever it is that you've just
stopped doing because you're so depressed,

2191
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:08,030
it gives you the inspiration to try
to get back there. Yeah. And it also,

2192
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:12,680
it's like a really intense form of love.
You know,

2193
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:14,360
that's a weird way to describe it.

2194
02:07:14,361 --> 02:07:18,050
But the psychedelic experiences make
you feel loved, not to everybody.

2195
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:20,090
And obviously, I mean, you
have to Redo it and do it.

2196
02:07:20,091 --> 02:07:22,190
Cause some people have mental issues.
Some people,

2197
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:24,370
regular reality is slippery already.
Yeah.

2198
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:28,910
They probably shouldn't be doing anything
right. But the people that do do it,

2199
02:07:28,911 --> 02:07:32,480
that are in a good place when they wind
up doing it oftentimes experiences like

2200
02:07:32,481 --> 02:07:35,980
profound sense of being loved.
How is it who

2201
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,500
you do it with?
Very important set.

2202
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:41,320
That's what it said in this is they
have people that walk you through it,

2203
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:45,340
that are professionals at guiding you
through this kind of experience. Yeah.

2204
02:07:45,341 --> 02:07:48,770
That's super, super,
super important. Um, uh,

2205
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:53,790
like a lot of those indigenous tribes
that do these a shamonic rituals,

2206
02:07:53,801 --> 02:07:58,270
they have like very like
rigid sort of ideas of like,

2207
02:07:58,330 --> 02:08:01,510
this is what we do. We sit down and
we're all going to like, you know,

2208
02:08:01,511 --> 02:08:02,410
we're all going to talk,

2209
02:08:02,411 --> 02:08:05,380
we're all going to drink this liquid
and this guy's gonna blow tobacco.

2210
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:08,830
Small can play the drums.
And it's like slowly going to come on.

2211
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:10,620
And it's like orchestrated.
Like they're,

2212
02:08:10,621 --> 02:08:12,850
they're setting this up and
this guy's going to sing.

2213
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:15,910
And these guys will sing
these things called eco rows.

2214
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:21,010
And these eco rows are these songs
that they sing that accompany the DMT

2215
02:08:21,011 --> 02:08:25,000
experience. So when you, when you smoked
DMT and you listen to these songs,

2216
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:28,930
you see these things dancing, like as
they're like, I'll play it for you.

2217
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:31,540
I've played it on the podcast whores.
Now,

2218
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:36,220
if some of these native places to take
the, uh, others, a lot of parents,

2219
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:38,740
there's a lot of them, dude,
oh, I cut into my phone.

2220
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,240
There's a lot of these fucking tours.

2221
02:08:40,241 --> 02:08:42,700
They're doing it all over the place
and they're doing it. You know,

2222
02:08:42,701 --> 02:08:45,940
some of them it's not good to because
there's going to be people that are

2223
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:49,040
capitalizing on those situations
where, you know, they,

2224
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:54,670
they're just profiting.
Of course selling cell phones,

2225
02:08:54,671 --> 02:08:58,330
recording it. Yeah. Yeah.
I got it right there.

2226
02:08:59,670 --> 02:09:04,090
Oh, it plug it in. No, I'll just play
it on the, the, the thing here. But um,

2227
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:07,840
I think that uh,
it should all be legal.

2228
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:11,130
I think you should be able to do
whatever you want to do as far as a,

2229
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:11,711
you want to,

2230
02:09:11,711 --> 02:09:16,711
if you want to run around and you want
to have a good time and do mushrooms or

2231
02:09:17,531 --> 02:09:21,310
drink whiskey or you know, whatever it
is, whether it will scare you used to be,

2232
02:09:21,311 --> 02:09:22,630
I'm sorry,
I was going to say,

2233
02:09:22,631 --> 02:09:27,370
but when you see these studies coming
out about the benefits of it, you just,

2234
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:32,440
it makes you feel bad that all these
people were kept from that for so many

2235
02:09:32,441 --> 02:09:36,370
decades that like there's a lot of
people over from 1970 when they made

2236
02:09:36,371 --> 02:09:41,371
mushrooms illegal and Lsd and pretty
much everything to 2014 that's horrible.

2237
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:44,440
That's 44 45 years.

2238
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:49,770
While these really beneficial plants
have been illegal and for no fucking

2239
02:09:50,321 --> 02:09:54,160
reason, there's no reason that
makes any sense. Yeah. It's um,

2240
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:59,800
man, it was, it was the Rockefeller
laws, right? Is that what the someone,

2241
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:04,000
someone, I don't know who was responsible
for it all, but there was this sweeping

2242
02:10:05,810 --> 02:10:10,210
illegalization or sweeping
prohibition act that covered shit.

2243
02:10:10,211 --> 02:10:11,620
That's not even psychoactive.

2244
02:10:11,890 --> 02:10:14,760
There's like they just started marking
things illegal like a bunch of,

2245
02:10:14,761 --> 02:10:17,590
they didn't know exactly what was legal,
what wasn't legal,

2246
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,580
but they lumped shit in like
everything that was scheduled one,

2247
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:25,090
there's all nontoxic nonlethal
drugs that are scheduled. One,

2248
02:10:25,091 --> 02:10:29,080
like a giant percentage of them, which
is crazy because that just shows you,

2249
02:10:29,081 --> 02:10:33,650
this is a giant problem with the way
they're classifying drugs still in 2015

2250
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:34,490
marijuana

2251
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:39,470
federally is still a schedule.
Right, right, right. It's
fucking same as currently.

2252
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:42,560
Ridiculous. Same as, yes. Same as cocaine.

2253
02:10:42,590 --> 02:10:47,590
Well cocaine and then heroin is scheduled
to write because I think they have

2254
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:50,870
medicinal uses,
you know,

2255
02:10:50,871 --> 02:10:55,020
because opiates they use for painkillers
and there's medical cocaine. Oh,

2256
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:57,370
I'm going to make sure that I'm right
about that cause I think they might've

2257
02:10:57,380 --> 02:10:57,790
changed.

2258
02:10:57,790 --> 02:11:01,090
Well that was the whole thing that uh,
black people feel like is that,

2259
02:11:01,091 --> 02:11:06,091
why is it the crack is schedule one
and cocaine because crack is for black

2260
02:11:06,311 --> 02:11:10,480
people and cocaine is for white
people as the, uh, the interpretation,

2261
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:13,660
which is unbelievably racist.
Yeah, right. There's the issue.

2262
02:11:13,661 --> 02:11:16,840
It's heroin is one. It
used to be two, I believe.

2263
02:11:16,841 --> 02:11:19,210
Now it's one and coke is still too,

2264
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:24,130
which is fucking bananas.
But look, psilocybin,

2265
02:11:24,190 --> 02:11:28,930
psilocybin and LSD and masculine.
Jesus,

2266
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:33,820
is there a danger with the psilocybin?
No, you can't freak out on it. Yeah,

2267
02:11:33,821 --> 02:11:36,910
you could definitely freak out,
but you come back. Well, hopefully.

2268
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:41,740
So there is a boss.
If you get that close to the abyss,

2269
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:45,460
I mean the experiences that you have in
those things, if you have a weak heart,

2270
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:48,730
it would probably be incredibly taxing
because a lot of people feel like they're

2271
02:11:48,731 --> 02:11:51,160
going to die.
They relive their entire life.

2272
02:11:51,161 --> 02:11:54,550
They look at themselves through this
really intense introspective vision that

2273
02:11:54,551 --> 02:11:56,410
freaks him out. You know, the, the,

2274
02:11:56,411 --> 02:11:59,990
the harsh introspective aspects of a
lot of these psychedelics really bother

2275
02:11:59,991 --> 02:12:02,840
some people. And if you're like
barely hanging on, if you're,

2276
02:12:02,841 --> 02:12:04,480
you're like on the
verge of a heart attack,

2277
02:12:04,481 --> 02:12:09,160
it could push you over the top Adderalls
schedule too. I used to take that shit.

2278
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:13,960
Well that's legal now. All that shit they
could prescribe. Look at all that stuff.

2279
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:15,043
There's a lot of stuff.

2280
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:19,520
Yeah, there's a lot of drugs up there.
Look at all those drugs. They were,

2281
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:22,790
they did a special on 60 minutes
last night about, um, that they,

2282
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:27,860
they think they have a cure for the,
uh, uh, Ebola virus. It, I mean,

2283
02:12:27,861 --> 02:12:28,311
it worked.

2284
02:12:28,311 --> 02:12:31,190
They only had like seven batches of it
and they gave it to seven people and they

2285
02:12:31,191 --> 02:12:34,400
were all cured,
but that they,

2286
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:36,500
Dave knew about it since the 70s,

2287
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:39,410
but it's taken them this many years
to develop it because none of the

2288
02:12:39,411 --> 02:12:44,411
pharmaceutical companies can make a
profit off of it because the government

2289
02:12:44,781 --> 02:12:48,660
wasn't buying it. They weren't really,
you know, actively, you know, they,

2290
02:12:48,661 --> 02:12:52,640
they were looking for a cure,
but not really putting any
money behind it. And so,

2291
02:12:52,641 --> 02:12:57,641
but in order to make this cure that you
have to like take fucking thousands of

2292
02:12:57,890 --> 02:13:00,180
acres of this special
kind of tobacco and uh,

2293
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:05,090
they have to soak it in this chemical
and all to come up with like a dozen

2294
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:08,480
doses. Wow. It's crazy.

2295
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:11,550
That's so strange when,

2296
02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:15,380
when you think about what these indigenous
tribes have been able to do with

2297
02:13:15,390 --> 02:13:17,370
these plants,
that's when it gets really strange.

2298
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:21,630
Think about the fact that they've
figured out like a big percentage of the

2299
02:13:21,631 --> 02:13:23,520
pharmaceutical drugs that we use today.

2300
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:25,650
Big percentage of them
come from like rainforests.

2301
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:28,020
They find these plants how
they fund a lot of play.

2302
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:32,040
Like they're constantly searching the
rain forest for different properties of

2303
02:13:32,041 --> 02:13:32,461
plants.

2304
02:13:32,461 --> 02:13:35,030
They think that one day they're gonna
come up with some plant that cures cancer.

2305
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:36,810
They're going to find it in the Amazon.

2306
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:40,950
They use him for a lot of different
purposes, which is, you know, weird.

2307
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:44,670
These people figured out some of them on
their own, you know, the Iowasca thing,

2308
02:13:44,671 --> 02:13:45,930
they figured that thing on their own.

2309
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:49,350
They figured out how to blend
plants and make a drug out of it.

2310
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:52,080
Like they figured out how to
boil it and the whole thing.

2311
02:13:52,081 --> 02:13:56,150
They use a pot and they boil
it and it takes hours. Yeah.

2312
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,600
They all figured out a way how to do this,
which is

2313
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:01,580
just lot of trial and error.
A lot of stuff. They tried to,

2314
02:14:01,581 --> 02:14:04,780
somebody died from and they went
well, shut that one off. Like the,

2315
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:08,050
the knowledge of what you can
eat and your neighborhood. Yeah.

2316
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:11,390
Fucking super important. Yeah. The Wong,

2317
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:14,810
the wrong little stripe
on a frog and you're dead.

2318
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:19,880
You know the wrong little, you
know, little spot on a bug.

2319
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:20,960
Yeah.
It can kill you.

2320
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:25,640
Knowing how to plant the seeds in a way
that makes them grow correctly and had a

2321
02:14:25,641 --> 02:14:27,950
burn out the forest when
it needs to be burned out.

2322
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:32,180
How's just in Yellowstone and there were
tears talking about how that, you know,

2323
02:14:32,181 --> 02:14:34,790
that the native people used to set fires,
they just,

2324
02:14:35,150 --> 02:14:36,830
they knew the schedule to rotate,

2325
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:40,130
burning the FTF forest out so
that they can get super fires.

2326
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:45,670
And I did the ashes.
Where was that? It? Yeah,

2327
02:14:45,671 --> 02:14:50,460
it was the sound that you listened
to and you're fucked up on DMT.

2328
02:14:56,130 --> 02:15:00,810
I wish I could describe what it looks
like, but you see the song when you're,

2329
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:02,970
when you're under the aim
for once you actually see it,

2330
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:08,630
like the song takes place
in three dimensional form
that gives a dancing thing.

2331
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:10,620
It's not just a sound,

2332
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:16,160
it becomes like a dancing object
to your mind transforms the trip.

2333
02:15:16,710 --> 02:15:20,760
And do people describe it similarly?
But they say, yeah, but it's,

2334
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:24,590
it's hard to describe. So I think
they're saying something similar,

2335
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:28,550
but there's no real words for it. Like
the, like everything that I've said,

2336
02:15:28,551 --> 02:15:30,350
the way I described it is really shitty.

2337
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:33,020
It's like that you can't
really do it or you don't,

2338
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:36,170
there's no context for the experience.
The experience is so weird.

2339
02:15:36,171 --> 02:15:38,230
There's no context for it.
So it doesn't,

2340
02:15:38,231 --> 02:15:41,360
it like if you described it and I
listened to your description, I'm like,

2341
02:15:41,361 --> 02:15:45,320
I guess we were in the same place, but
it's not like, yeah, there was this tree,

2342
02:15:45,321 --> 02:15:48,320
you remember there was a tree and had
a broken branch and it laid over it.

2343
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:50,930
Oh yeah, I remember that. It was
right near the fountain. Yes.

2344
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:54,530
And it's not like that. Like you would be
describing it to me. I'd be like, okay,

2345
02:15:54,531 --> 02:15:59,531
maybe complex geometric patterns
floating in and out of existence.

2346
02:15:59,841 --> 02:16:04,250
Constantly morphing in front of you.
It's all love and understand. I guess.

2347
02:16:04,251 --> 02:16:07,700
I guess you were at the same spot,
you know, is there a seven 11?

2348
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:13,910
What did smell like? It smell
like Bumpus yes. Bump this.

2349
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:16,670
Oh we were in the same spot. Yeah.
You know, you could talk about like,

2350
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:19,820
oh I went to the ski lodge. You know, you
walk in, there's a big moose in the wall.

2351
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:24,320
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've been out of spot.
You say, you know all we did LSD.

2352
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:26,630
What was it like?
Oh it's just,

2353
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:29,710
I spend an hour staring
in the mirror and uh,

2354
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:34,620
I watched my entire life from birth
to that moment on fast forward. Yeah.

2355
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,273
Okay.

2356
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:38,910
That's it. Cause you're not going to
jot it down while you're doing it.

2357
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,990
It'd be great if they come
up to technology where they
can videotape what you're

2358
02:16:42,991 --> 02:16:45,600
imagination is going through while
you're tripping on something.

2359
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:47,910
And then show it and major
theaters around the country.

2360
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:51,480
That's one of the things that
someone in mind, they've been,

2361
02:16:51,481 --> 02:16:56,430
Mckenna again was speculating that
one of the best ways to deliver,

2362
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:57,090
um,

2363
02:16:57,090 --> 02:17:02,090
a psychedelic trip to someone was with
virtual reality and figuring out a way

2364
02:17:03,181 --> 02:17:08,110
through like CGI imagery to reproduce
the effects of the trip. Like the,

2365
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:09,930
the reproduce what you're saying.
Yeah.

2366
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:13,890
If they could get the technology
to that point where they could,

2367
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:15,900
someone could go to trip,
you know,

2368
02:17:15,901 --> 02:17:20,901
do mushrooms or do DMT trip and then
figure out a way to reproduce that.

2369
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:22,970
Then you would take the drugs out.

2370
02:17:22,971 --> 02:17:25,390
Somebody could just watch the
trip and feel the trip. Yeah.

2371
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:29,110
Yeah. That it could be possible that
it could be done that way. He was,

2372
02:17:29,111 --> 02:17:32,890
it was totally believing it can be done
that way because there's people that

2373
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:34,150
said they could do it with yoga man.

2374
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:37,450
There's people that say they can have
full blown psychedelic experiences.

2375
02:17:37,451 --> 02:17:39,280
She'll loosen nations,
visuals,

2376
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:43,840
transport it to the center of the
universe and dancing with angels the whole

2377
02:17:43,841 --> 02:17:45,490
deal.
And they do it all through yoga.

2378
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:48,970
Yeah. Yeah. I know with meditation they,
certain levels you can get to. I mean,

2379
02:17:48,971 --> 02:17:52,690
I do very basic TM.
I've been doing it for like six months,

2380
02:17:52,691 --> 02:17:56,590
but I do it twice a day.
Yeah. What made you start? Um,

2381
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:00,820
everybody I've talked to that had done
it had a profound experience with it.

2382
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:04,210
You know, their lives are better. You
know, you guys like, you know, Seinfeld,

2383
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:08,770
it's done it forever. And um, a lot
of comics that, uh, that I like,

2384
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:11,320
we're doing it. What do
you do? It's really simple.

2385
02:18:11,321 --> 02:18:15,070
It's a very unguided meditation. You
just kind of sit in a comfortable place.

2386
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:19,090
They give you a mantra that you do
and you're not tied to the match.

2387
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:22,090
You're not like repeating it over and over
again. And that's all you think about.

2388
02:18:22,091 --> 02:18:24,500
It's more of like, it
kind of leads you, um,

2389
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,740
it's sort of the way they describe it as.

2390
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:29,980
It's almost like it's off in the distance
and you can hear it, but you're not,

2391
02:18:29,981 --> 02:18:34,150
it's not your whole focus. And then your
brain can go wherever it's going to go.

2392
02:18:34,151 --> 02:18:38,170
You can go into little daydreams and
then you can gently notice that and pull

2393
02:18:38,171 --> 02:18:40,120
yourself back to the mantra and do that.

2394
02:18:40,690 --> 02:18:44,560
And you just let yourself go with it.
And it's very nonjudgmental.

2395
02:18:44,561 --> 02:18:46,630
You don't ever judge where your mind went.

2396
02:18:46,631 --> 02:18:51,100
You don't snap yourself self back to
it. And then, uh, and then it ends,

2397
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:54,820
it feels like it feels like five,
10 minutes and 20 minutes ends.

2398
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I set my alarm and then you just feel
totally rested and centered and stress is

2399
02:19:00,311 --> 02:19:01,144
gone.

2400
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:05,920
And like my baseline of depression has
been so much higher since I started.

2401
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:08,440
You mean the baseline?
Meaning like,

2402
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:11,750
like I get depression
and this helped me a lot.

2403
02:19:12,150 --> 02:19:15,300
Oh, so you're not saying let
like the Depression is higher

2404
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:19,800
now? I would say that the
bad, the bad part of the
depression, the level is higher.

2405
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:20,460
Right.

2406
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:24,660
Um, that's, that's really fascinating. And
what is the mantra? Like, what'd you say?

2407
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:28,790
Well, they give each person a different
one. I, I'm, there's x number of mantras.

2408
02:19:28,791 --> 02:19:31,640
I don't know how many there are, but
they assigned them to you. Like what?

2409
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:36,470
Give me an example of what a macho
like ohm is like the classic mantra.

2410
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:39,830
So it doesn't have to be a word.
It could be like, oh, it's a sound.

2411
02:19:39,890 --> 02:19:43,310
It's always a song. Yeah. So He'd
just sit there and make the Sanskrit.

2412
02:19:43,311 --> 02:19:45,200
So it's different.
Sanskrit sounds

2413
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:48,860
TM is t like transcendental meditation
is all Sanskrit. Right? Wow.

2414
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:51,890
And so just sitting there going home.

2415
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:54,360
Well we know it's all,
you don't say it,

2416
02:19:54,390 --> 02:19:56,550
you don't verbalize it in your
mind and your mind, you do it.

2417
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:00,210
But it does have a resonant sound because
they see even mentally there's some

2418
02:20:00,211 --> 02:20:01,950
kind of reverberation that goes on.

2419
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:07,130
So this just doing this has raised like
whatever depression that you do get,

2420
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:10,340
it takes a longer time to come
on and it's, it's less impact.

2421
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:14,710
It doesn't stay, it doesn't stay.
And I don't go down as far as I did.

2422
02:20:15,430 --> 02:20:18,790
And that's probably the chief reason I
started is that I'd read a lot about it

2423
02:20:18,791 --> 02:20:20,590
and it said that that's one
of the main things, you know,

2424
02:20:20,591 --> 02:20:24,930
anxiety and depression can be
tied hand in hand. I don't expect,

2425
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:27,610
I don't think I experience
anxiety as much as just, you know,

2426
02:20:27,611 --> 02:20:30,760
my family has depression. My, you
know, everybody in my family's got it.

2427
02:20:31,150 --> 02:20:34,240
And it's just something that, you
know, you can, you can medicate it,

2428
02:20:34,241 --> 02:20:36,370
you can exercise it out or you can,
you know,

2429
02:20:36,371 --> 02:20:38,140
there's a lot of different
ways to go at it.

2430
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:40,370
That's a weird way,
um,

2431
02:20:40,410 --> 02:20:44,460
that we have to regulate the
minds like to manage the mind,

2432
02:20:44,940 --> 02:20:47,130
but just taking a thing like a,

2433
02:20:47,131 --> 02:20:50,610
a sound and rolling it over in your
mind over and over and over again.

2434
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:53,490
And it's almost like a cycle,
like a cleaning cycle.

2435
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:53,701
Yeah.

2436
02:20:53,701 --> 02:20:57,540
It's like stopping the cycle at stopping
the cycle of thoughts that are nonstop

2437
02:20:57,550 --> 02:21:01,260
in your mind. It gives you a break. It's
almost like, it's like doing a cleanse.

2438
02:21:01,261 --> 02:21:04,410
It gives your stomach and you're
calling it a chance to clean itself.

2439
02:21:04,830 --> 02:21:07,500
So twice a day you're stopping that site.

2440
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:11,790
And that's the thing that I find with
it is that I get bored of the cycle.

2441
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:13,380
Like if I'm going through my day,

2442
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:16,080
I'm having a cycle of
thoughts like anybody does.

2443
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:20,430
And you don't notice that it's a cycle
until you stop and it's all that's in

2444
02:21:20,431 --> 02:21:23,520
your mind and then you go, oh,
you're fucking, that's boring.

2445
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:27,810
We've already thought that you
kind of let it go and it goes away.

2446
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:32,020
That's that. I liked that idea
of a cleaning cycle like you,

2447
02:21:32,021 --> 02:21:37,021
you introduced like a cleaning agent for
20 minutes and you a nip all the buds

2448
02:21:37,531 --> 02:21:41,850
and parcel the problems and settle
it all down. That make sense?

2449
02:21:41,851 --> 02:21:44,520
Because me and my worst in my life,

2450
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:48,810
the one I've felt most out of control
and my wife are doing the wrong shit or

2451
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:52,560
you know least in control of my emotions.

2452
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:57,480
I've always felt like I was on like too
much momentum. Like I couldn't stop.

2453
02:21:57,481 --> 02:21:58,300
Like I was like the,

2454
02:21:58,300 --> 02:22:03,030
the momentum of all my past acts was like
overwhelming me and I was just running

2455
02:22:03,031 --> 02:22:08,031
to keep from getting run over and like
something like TM or for me it became a

2456
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:11,250
martial arts and then later the tank,

2457
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:16,280
the tank helps a lot to just get into
that space where you just let it all go.

2458
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:21,100
And once you do let it all go,
you could start fresh. Right.

2459
02:22:21,210 --> 02:22:22,710
But when you don't get
a chance to do that,

2460
02:22:22,711 --> 02:22:24,990
it seems like you're constantly
dealing with this phone.

2461
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:27,580
What's connected to that thing
that you got to take care of you.

2462
02:22:27,581 --> 02:22:30,750
You didn't clean out that thing and
fucking this guy wants to meet you because

2463
02:22:30,751 --> 02:22:32,620
you're supposed to do that
thing and it's all done.

2464
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:34,950
It all builds up to
the point where you're,

2465
02:22:35,010 --> 02:22:37,350
the anxiety is oftentimes just the data,

2466
02:22:37,351 --> 02:22:39,450
the sheer data that you're
dealing with every day in life.

2467
02:22:39,810 --> 02:22:42,250
Whether it's emotional shit,
whether it's memory shit, we,

2468
02:22:42,270 --> 02:22:45,630
it's work related shit or family
related shit. It's like fuck.

2469
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:50,160
And your thoughts all go to, they all
go back to, I mean not to be Friday in,

2470
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:53,110
cause I'm, I, I'm not
Freudian, but there are,

2471
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:58,000
there are aberrations in your thoughts
in terms of how we perceive ourselves and

2472
02:22:58,001 --> 02:23:02,890
what external events, how we identify
ourselves based on external events. Like,

2473
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:06,460
I didn't get this job.
That means, well you can,

2474
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:09,730
you can control what that means
is ways of having, you know,

2475
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:14,880
cognitive changes where you stop yourself
from thinking what you thought from

2476
02:23:15,251 --> 02:23:19,030
being a child and having a father that
beat you or even something more subtle,

2477
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:21,280
you know,
things that affected over time,

2478
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:25,150
the way you connected external events
to how you felt about yourself.

2479
02:23:25,390 --> 02:23:30,130
And you can go in and you can just
buy by repeating, you know, no,

2480
02:23:30,131 --> 02:23:33,860
that doesn't mean that, you
know, that just means that this,

2481
02:23:33,861 --> 02:23:37,540
this happened like power of now. It's
like you don't, you don't, uh, you know,

2482
02:23:37,541 --> 02:23:39,160
a thought is not a reality.

2483
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:42,820
It's just something that is flowing
through you and you can notice it and you

2484
02:23:42,821 --> 02:23:46,720
can comment on it without internalizing
it and going for the full ride.

2485
02:23:47,050 --> 02:23:49,960
They say that's one of the things that
people have the hardest time with when it

2486
02:23:49,961 --> 02:23:51,950
comes to, uh, suffers.

2487
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:56,950
People that are trying to overcome the
abusive they have when their a childhood

2488
02:23:57,340 --> 02:24:02,200
that when they were in childhood because
that abuse oftentimes like defines them.

2489
02:24:02,201 --> 02:24:05,620
They feel like they're a shitty
person for have been being abused.

2490
02:24:05,621 --> 02:24:09,910
You're damaged because you've been abused
and you'd just sort of define yourself

2491
02:24:09,911 --> 02:24:11,840
by this abuse that you've suffered.
Yeah.

2492
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:14,260
Where you can't look at the
bright side of things like you,

2493
02:24:14,261 --> 02:24:17,320
you look like it's always bad.
Things are always going to happen to you.

2494
02:24:17,321 --> 02:24:21,390
It's like if you've defined yourself in
some way because of the abusive side.

2495
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:24,940
Oh, you even caused the abuse because
you're bad, right? Yeah. You could have,

2496
02:24:24,970 --> 02:24:27,580
there was a reason why I was beat.
It's my fault.

2497
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:29,620
So then when anything
bad happens in your life,

2498
02:24:29,621 --> 02:24:31,450
you go back to thinking you caused it.

2499
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:37,050
It makes you think if this psychedelic
Lez legislation of the 1970s if it never

2500
02:24:37,331 --> 02:24:42,331
had been passed and if these
35 years since that happened,

2501
02:24:42,461 --> 02:24:46,720
if people had been allowed to explore
these things and come to these conclusions

2502
02:24:46,721 --> 02:24:48,430
and try to figure out like what,
what are,

2503
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:52,480
what are the beneficial aspects of the
way we behave and the way we think and

2504
02:24:52,481 --> 02:24:57,310
the way we sort of qualify
and quantify life's meaning,

2505
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:00,720
whether it's financial or whether
it's family, like what did what, what,

2506
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:05,880
what's really smart about this and how
much more could we have done if people

2507
02:25:06,071 --> 02:25:08,710
were doing mushrooms,
doing acid.

2508
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:13,510
So much more thinking would have taken
place on these really people could say

2509
02:25:13,511 --> 02:25:17,560
they're frivolous, there's just, these are
distractions, but they're not, you know,

2510
02:25:17,561 --> 02:25:17,950
these are,

2511
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:21,790
these are these ideas and concepts that
you develop when you're either doing

2512
02:25:21,791 --> 02:25:23,230
psychedelics or meditating,

2513
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:28,800
anything where you're involved in sort
of an active assessment and resetting of

2514
02:25:29,261 --> 02:25:33,630
your consciousness, whether
it's yoga, meditation,
whatever the fuck it is, tanks,

2515
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:35,320
size,
isolation tanks.

2516
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:40,180
We will you doing is you're allowing
yourself time to reflect on what you're

2517
02:25:40,181 --> 02:25:43,030
doing and whether or not it's
beneficial and what can be changed.

2518
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:45,040
And if you don't have
that reflection time,

2519
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:49,300
you oftentimes don't change unless you
fall completely apart and you're forced

2520
02:25:49,301 --> 02:25:52,270
to change. Yeah. That happens.
A lot of people they have,

2521
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:54,340
that's what they always say about
drug addicts. They have to hit rock.

2522
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:57,360
I forgot to hit bottom mean
anything gambling, you know,

2523
02:25:57,361 --> 02:25:59,880
and you were always shocked by
people's bottoms. Like, you know,

2524
02:25:59,881 --> 02:26:03,270
you look at somebody who just
keeps fucking up like, you know,

2525
02:26:03,271 --> 02:26:06,690
Brittany Spears when she was really
going down the rails, it was like,

2526
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:11,400
hasn't she hit bottom yet?
No, not even close. Yeah.

2527
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:14,100
And then there's other people like me,
I had a pretty shallow bottom.

2528
02:26:14,101 --> 02:26:19,020
I quit drinking when I was
like, I dunno, 24. And uh,

2529
02:26:19,021 --> 02:26:21,920
I started drinking when I was
probably 12. So I drank for, you know,

2530
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:26,130
a decent period of time, but like I
wasn't blowing guys for a sandwich.

2531
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:29,190
I was just feeling like it
was controlling my life.

2532
02:26:29,191 --> 02:26:33,480
I was feeling like this is something
I'm going to when I'm feeling sad or I'm

2533
02:26:33,481 --> 02:26:38,370
going to when I'm feeling stressed or
would a was definitely the relationship to

2534
02:26:38,371 --> 02:26:41,730
alcohol I had was bad cause my
father was an alcoholic, you know,

2535
02:26:41,731 --> 02:26:45,840
he died at 51 and so I just knew I
didn't want to go down that path.

2536
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,170
So I had what you'd call a shallow bottom.
But you know,

2537
02:26:49,171 --> 02:26:53,460
just to see other people where it
just can get, it can get so extreme.

2538
02:26:53,461 --> 02:26:57,000
But that's the only time you
really change. And so for me,

2539
02:26:57,001 --> 02:27:00,480
I think changing it with a shallow
bottom meant that there was so much more

2540
02:27:00,481 --> 02:27:02,710
baggage that went with it. You know, that,

2541
02:27:02,711 --> 02:27:07,230
that I was bottoming out with feeling
that I was dependent on something and I

2542
02:27:07,231 --> 02:27:07,800
wasn't,

2543
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:11,460
I couldn't be myself fully because there
was a part of my psyche that was locked

2544
02:27:11,461 --> 02:27:14,250
up in this thing and that was enough
for me to go, I got to change.

2545
02:27:14,251 --> 02:27:15,810
I don't want to live my life like that.

2546
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:18,420
You did a young man,
I remember when you did it.

2547
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:22,380
I remember it because I
remember you were almost like,

2548
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:27,540
like you had remorse, you
know, that you had to do this.

2549
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:32,280
Like I felt like there was
almost a sadness about you,
about the having it like,

2550
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:36,420
fuck yeah, I can't do this. I just can't
do it. I'm sorry I'm going to miss it.

2551
02:27:36,421 --> 02:27:40,110
But it's over. Yeah. And you
just, you just stopped. You know,

2552
02:27:40,111 --> 02:27:43,080
you didn't have to fucking join a what?
All these other comics.

2553
02:27:43,081 --> 02:27:46,170
There's a million comics that were in a,
and they were all like,

2554
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:49,740
they had this like real weird preachy
thing about them too. They look at,

2555
02:27:49,741 --> 02:27:53,280
you drink in the chick there had,
they were really annoying. You know,

2556
02:27:53,730 --> 02:27:56,400
you didn't do that. He just
stopped drinking. You stopped.

2557
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:58,300
Yeah. And it's, it's,

2558
02:27:58,301 --> 02:28:02,450
it's funny because Boston Aa in Boston
is a very intense thing because the city

2559
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:05,620
with the same power they drank
with, they got sober with, you know,

2560
02:28:05,621 --> 02:28:09,930
they would rage with sobriety. Yeah.
And you know, and look, God bless him,

2561
02:28:09,931 --> 02:28:12,760
the people that used it and it
worked for them, that's fantastic.

2562
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:16,720
But for some of them it became
like two meetings day and you know,

2563
02:28:16,721 --> 02:28:20,900
you've got three sponsors and you, and
it's like, you know, that's great, but uh,

2564
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:22,100
you know, move, move

2565
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,650
along a little bit here. You get a
little caught up in this thing. Well,

2566
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:27,940
it becomes their culture. Yeah.
The culture of sober people. Yeah.

2567
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,640
That's a big culture. A strong
culture. Yeah. And if sy, again,

2568
02:28:31,641 --> 02:28:33,980
like for some people it's life or death.
It literally is,

2569
02:28:33,981 --> 02:28:36,770
those are the stakes with
the meetings. Oh yeah, man.

2570
02:28:36,771 --> 02:28:40,760
And also it's a good launching
pad for a lot of comics. Oh yeah.

2571
02:28:40,761 --> 02:28:43,070
Get up and do those meetings.
He tells hilarious stories,

2572
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:47,240
wicking up shit face stuffed into
a laundry machine and you know,

2573
02:28:47,241 --> 02:28:51,050
they have these ridiculous shit,
their pants stories as crowd of all time.

2574
02:28:51,051 --> 02:28:53,960
They're all sober, they're jacked
up on coffee. They love it.

2575
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:56,990
And they know what the fuck you're
talking about. Yeah. You know,

2576
02:28:56,991 --> 02:28:59,810
they're having a good time. I remember
going to some, they was just saying,

2577
02:29:00,110 --> 02:29:03,170
I think it was called like Miskiw par.
I don't know why I remember that.

2578
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:07,700
But it was in Worcester and the Aa
community gets together and they do these

2579
02:29:07,701 --> 02:29:09,650
conventions where they had like,
you know,

2580
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:14,570
a thousand people coming from all over
New England staying in his hotel and just

2581
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:15,650
having meetings.
You know,

2582
02:29:15,651 --> 02:29:20,651
the 9:00 AM there's a 1212 o'clock step
meeting and they'd all go and apparently

2583
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:26,650
everybody's fucking everybody because
they got all this energy to channel and

2584
02:29:26,781 --> 02:29:30,950
burn off and so it was just hypersexual
obviously very social. I mean,

2585
02:29:30,951 --> 02:29:34,640
what's more social then you sit down in
a meeting and the person next to you go,

2586
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:38,350
how you doing? 12 years
sober. Hey, are you doing, I'm
great. 10 years. Bula he did.

2587
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:41,450
Somebody does a motivational
talk. You clap, you laugh,

2588
02:29:41,451 --> 02:29:43,070
everybody has a coffee halfway through.

2589
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:46,970
What a fucking great way to meet people
and now you're just like you normally

2590
02:29:46,971 --> 02:29:51,440
you would go get drunk and pass out and
instead you're awake and jacked up on

2591
02:29:51,441 --> 02:29:56,120
coffee and you all have something in
common. Yeah. Talk about your sobriety,

2592
02:29:56,121 --> 02:29:56,954
where you're fuck

2593
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:03,060
drunk with your cock. People
love little groups. Yeah.

2594
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:06,730
Part of a nice little group that everybody
else is trying to run marathons are

2595
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:10,580
marathon runners group together? Yeah.
Oh, we're all owners of Dotson's.

2596
02:30:10,610 --> 02:30:14,150
We're going to get our dots. It's all a
little doggies. Look, your bull Godson,

2597
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:18,350
they meant Dotson's cause it's fairly
group people that own dogs or those old to

2598
02:30:18,351 --> 02:30:22,340
40 zs. That shit. Yup. I was
a little Japanese sports cars.

2599
02:30:22,341 --> 02:30:25,280
Those were fucking bad ass. But
those little groups of people, man,

2600
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:29,130
no matter what it is, they
just, people love being dug by.

2601
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:32,900
You ever go with dog park? But he's
shitting me. Same people every day.

2602
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:36,560
And you know what they talk
about why they hang out? Dogs.

2603
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:41,630
That's all they talk about. Oh,
I got a Corgi. Mine's half Corgi.

2604
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:45,890
Half Poodle. So it's a cook.
She is such a Pomeranian.

2605
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:48,230
Let me tell you,
she's such a Pomeranian.

2606
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:51,920
Sometimes she looks in the mirror and
she thinks this is another Pomeranian she

2607
02:30:51,921 --> 02:30:56,340
barks. It's adorable. But
she's protective. I mean
you look at the size of her,

2608
02:30:56,341 --> 02:30:59,600
you wouldn't think she protects. Oh,
she becomes an animal, becomes a bear.

2609
02:31:00,010 --> 02:31:04,670
You'd be able to hear that. Did you ever
see best in show? Oh yeah. That was great.

2610
02:31:04,671 --> 02:31:06,680
Amazing. It was awesome. Nailed it.

2611
02:31:07,070 --> 02:31:10,670
They nailed that culture and they
didn't know a subtle enough way,

2612
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:14,810
so it was just ridiculous enough where
you want that would never happen like you

2613
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:17,990
go. That could fucking totally,
yeah. Yeah. Those people,

2614
02:31:17,991 --> 02:31:20,160
that people that are really
in then no matter what

2615
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,100
it is, it's always funny.
Yeah. I mean even the US,

2616
02:31:23,101 --> 02:31:24,950
like the way we talk about comedy,
I'm sure people think

2617
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:28,130
it's hilarious. Yeah. You got
to have something because,

2618
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:30,980
and I think as you get older, the
more you want, cause I think you,

2619
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:34,370
you don't realize when you're young and
having a shared history about something

2620
02:31:34,371 --> 02:31:37,920
is going to be so important than
the nostalgia of it. They, the,

2621
02:31:37,921 --> 02:31:41,990
the self identity of it. And so as you
get older all sudden, like you got guys,

2622
02:31:41,991 --> 02:31:45,110
now they're, you know, just rejoicing
in the fact that they're geeks,

2623
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:48,170
that they all watched star wars when
they were kids and now they get together

2624
02:31:48,171 --> 02:31:50,900
and they talk about it. When they
were watching star wars as a kid,

2625
02:31:51,050 --> 02:31:53,990
they felt like a fucking gig and they
weren't necessarily sharing it with

2626
02:31:53,991 --> 02:31:54,680
anybody.

2627
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:58,160
They were quietly watching it again and
again and then crying in their father's

2628
02:31:58,161 --> 02:32:01,120
basement. You know, there wasn't
like a solidarity about it.

2629
02:32:01,210 --> 02:32:06,100
No. And you remember when, um, like
comic books used to be like for losers?

2630
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:10,270
Yeah. Like when I got rid of my comic
books, I'm over the girls. Danny was like,

2631
02:32:10,271 --> 02:32:14,800
good, why do you need, um, why'd you
have, I'm still here 21. I'm like,

2632
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:19,420
I only got rid of him cause I'm fucking
broke. I sold them to eat, I missed them,

2633
02:32:19,930 --> 02:32:20,860
I missed all of them.

2634
02:32:20,861 --> 02:32:24,970
I collect those for a long fucking time
and I sold them for like no money and I

2635
02:32:24,980 --> 02:32:28,480
remember what it was, but I
had like these boxes, you know,

2636
02:32:28,481 --> 02:32:32,350
I had like three or four boxes fill with
comics that I'd collected from the time

2637
02:32:32,351 --> 02:32:35,290
I was like 15, no Shim. It
probably even the earlier,

2638
02:32:35,291 --> 02:32:39,970
no way earlier because I had a couple of
them from the time I was like 12 that I,

2639
02:32:40,190 --> 02:32:44,140
I really started collecting when I
moved to Boston. But before that,

2640
02:32:44,430 --> 02:32:47,700
I guess I had someone San Francisco too,
but the point being I'd have,

2641
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:53,050
I'd have him for a good chunk of my life
and I would open the plastic bags and

2642
02:32:53,051 --> 02:32:57,190
pull out the fucking hulk and we like
different episodes that were like

2643
02:32:57,191 --> 02:33:00,160
valuable. This one's worth
five bucks. Right? You know,

2644
02:33:00,161 --> 02:33:04,210
like old x men and punishers
and I love those fucking things.

2645
02:33:04,211 --> 02:33:06,310
But you were taught that
you were like a loser,

2646
02:33:06,311 --> 02:33:08,800
like you're clinging on to
some childhood stupidity.

2647
02:33:09,010 --> 02:33:12,490
Now they have comic con and a million
people fly from all over the country to

2648
02:33:12,491 --> 02:33:15,130
hang out in San Diego and they
all wear costumes and shit.

2649
02:33:15,230 --> 02:33:18,650
I noticed those magazines would
be worth a lot of money right now,

2650
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:19,790
probably high it.

2651
02:33:19,791 --> 02:33:24,140
I had all the mad magazine starting in
1975 I had a subscription all the way

2652
02:33:24,141 --> 02:33:28,160
through pro. I'm probably like three,
four, five years and I had them all.

2653
02:33:28,460 --> 02:33:31,940
And then my mom just tossed
mall out while I was in college,

2654
02:33:32,010 --> 02:33:33,650
cleaned out the attic.
Gotcha.

2655
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:36,230
Devastating. Cause it's like you, I
used to actually go back and read them.

2656
02:33:36,231 --> 02:33:37,490
I thought they were hilarious.

2657
02:33:37,770 --> 02:33:41,610
Those old mad magazines were fucking
brilliant. Yeah, those were good.

2658
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:44,550
My parents bought those when
I was a little kid. I used
to read them in a toilet.

2659
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:49,740
They used to, you know what else they had?
Our crumb, my Stepdad was into our crop.

2660
02:33:49,770 --> 02:33:51,900
Oh Shit. Yeah. You ever
read yes. Comics. Yeah.

2661
02:33:51,901 --> 02:33:56,460
I've read that in the fabulous freak
brothers. My stepdad's a hippie and uh,

2662
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:58,470
when I was like seven,

2663
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:02,850
eight years old when we all started
living together because it was like seven,

2664
02:34:03,210 --> 02:34:06,720
uh, I got introduced to this
weird kind of comic books.

2665
02:34:06,721 --> 02:34:07,950
They would leave in the bathroom,

2666
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:11,650
the fabulous freak brothers and
the San Francisco. Yeah. Yeah.

2667
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:14,590
That's what I was living in San Francisco
from like seven to 11. No, but I mean,

2668
02:34:14,610 --> 02:34:17,770
I think the artists there that
San Francisco, right? Was He

2669
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:22,930
out right? Yeah. Archroma San
Francisco. That a documentary.
Yeah. Yeah. Really cool.

2670
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:27,610
He was a weird model. Still is
a weird motherfucker. Yeah. Wow.

2671
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:31,270
He lives in France and he moved to
Paris or something, but as images,

2672
02:34:31,271 --> 02:34:35,740
like he would draw these women with these
ridiculous enormous acids and like men

2673
02:34:35,741 --> 02:34:37,090
would be riding them and shit.

2674
02:34:37,091 --> 02:34:42,091
It was just very strange fetish and
like seeing that as like a little boy.

2675
02:34:42,731 --> 02:34:45,810
I remember thinking like, why,
who is this weird fucking kind?

2676
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:49,510
Why is he drawing these
people like this? Yeah. Yeah.

2677
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:52,050
The fabulous freak brothers was a big one.
Like there's all that,

2678
02:34:52,051 --> 02:34:54,310
there were a lot of like
hippie comic strips,

2679
02:34:54,311 --> 02:34:59,200
all black and white comic books that
were sort of designed for adults.

2680
02:34:59,201 --> 02:35:03,520
It was very strange stuff. He, yeah,
it was very, uh, it was very, like,

2681
02:35:04,030 --> 02:35:08,020
you could call it perverted, but it was
actually just really raw. It's like,

2682
02:35:08,021 --> 02:35:12,070
it was like, it wasn't dirty.
It was just graphic. Yeah.

2683
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:15,340
It was just like, and, and resonated.

2684
02:35:15,341 --> 02:35:20,110
It seemed kind of honest like watching
this weird fucking guy with glasses are

2685
02:35:20,111 --> 02:35:23,830
crumb like his version of himself that
would do like riding on top of these

2686
02:35:23,831 --> 02:35:28,810
women that with z enormous asses and
high heels and they, it was very strange,

2687
02:35:28,811 --> 02:35:31,720
but you could tell like for him
this is like this wild fantasy.

2688
02:35:31,721 --> 02:35:36,310
I got to see that movie again. It was
really good shit insight into, you know,

2689
02:35:36,850 --> 02:35:40,440
a really extremely creative artists
and all that weird demons that,

2690
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:45,190
that flow through his brain that may
come or, or angels, whatever it is,

2691
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:47,710
make him create his very strange art.

2692
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:51,100
Trying to think if there's anything
like that today. I mean there's,

2693
02:35:51,730 --> 02:35:55,060
there's all this cartoon is like adult
swim kind of cartoons that are a little

2694
02:35:55,061 --> 02:35:57,970
offbeat, but they're nowhere
near as Ra's this stuff.

2695
02:35:57,970 --> 02:36:02,620
And I think that if you did
it today, you'd be accused
of being massaged. Oh yeah,

2696
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:06,700
no, his stuff was definitely had reached,
you know, a lot of racist overtones,

2697
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:11,440
but it was, that's what I mean by it
was raw. It was honest. It was like, no,

2698
02:36:11,441 --> 02:36:13,330
this is how this guy thinks he's writing.

2699
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:16,960
There's something that you could
appreciate about this guy is unadulterated

2700
02:36:16,961 --> 02:36:19,390
putting his thoughts on, on paper. Yeah.

2701
02:36:19,391 --> 02:36:23,770
Let's Google our Crum racism
and then look at this. Bam.

2702
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:26,320
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2703
02:36:26,321 --> 02:36:30,460
I mean he's doing total blackface
images like Jesus Christ,

2704
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:35,230
but he was like a hero of the
counter culture at the time. Oh yeah.

2705
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:39,610
Like he did a lot of like,
oh my God, look at this one.

2706
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:45,910
Shit. I mean, these are really
fucking racist man. Holy Shit.

2707
02:36:45,940 --> 02:36:48,610
But they had a sense of humor
to them that you had to be,

2708
02:36:48,611 --> 02:36:53,440
you had to be in on the joke. I guess if
you just looked at it from the outside,

2709
02:36:53,441 --> 02:36:58,390
he would just be like, what the
fuck? Kind of hate mail is this. Wow,

2710
02:36:58,391 --> 02:37:01,840
this is weird.
This is weird to see.

2711
02:37:01,841 --> 02:37:05,740
I had forgotten how racist some of the
shit was and how weird some of it was.

2712
02:37:06,310 --> 02:37:10,420
Like there's him and this woman
with these enormous horse like legs,

2713
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:14,830
like there was so exaggerated
the size of their asses and legs.

2714
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,190
He was the first big ass

2715
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:20,750
guy way before j Lo way before any,

2716
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:25,340
any of these people. He was
like the first, he was like
really into giant asses,

2717
02:37:26,030 --> 02:37:30,530
but he also had like really cool
like political shit, you know?

2718
02:37:30,531 --> 02:37:33,980
He had like, here's one of him
riding a woman. Look through that.

2719
02:37:35,630 --> 02:37:39,080
How strange that at the legs? Yeah. Yeah.

2720
02:37:39,081 --> 02:37:43,730
He would ride these women that
were in cutoff jeans. Jesus Christ.

2721
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:46,190
This is a famous one.

2722
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:50,270
The True Amazon low center of
gravity wide hips strong back.

2723
02:37:50,271 --> 02:37:53,660
He like had these weird
fetishes about thick,

2724
02:37:53,661 --> 02:37:55,640
powerful women that he would ride.

2725
02:38:00,090 --> 02:38:03,400
What did we to sex life wise you think
he was, he must've been paid prostitutes.

2726
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:06,340
Uh Damn. Well who knows? I wonder if

2727
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:10,890
tell us he was to get them
on your podcast. Yeah,

2728
02:38:10,891 --> 02:38:14,490
I bet he doesn't do podcasts.
I mean,

2729
02:38:14,491 --> 02:38:18,930
I don't know where even is. I think he is
in France or you think he's on Twitter?

2730
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:19,973
I'm going to say no.

2731
02:38:21,370 --> 02:38:23,930
I'm going to say that if you got
in touch with him and you said,

2732
02:38:23,931 --> 02:38:26,690
I'll come to you. I want to
talk to you. I'm a big fan.

2733
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:29,510
He wouldn't give a shit if
it was a podcast, whatever.

2734
02:38:29,511 --> 02:38:33,290
I bet you that guy would sit down with
you. Really? Yeah. That's my guess.

2735
02:38:33,530 --> 02:38:34,790
I would say just the opposite.

2736
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:38,300
I'd say he's just some fucking
weird guy likes to hide from people,

2737
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:41,430
but I might be wrong. I mean
one way, just signed down.

2738
02:38:41,431 --> 02:38:42,950
I think you'd be kind of introverted.

2739
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:46,940
Some of it is her drawing a blank with
Robert Crumb's, a guardian article.

2740
02:38:46,941 --> 02:38:48,230
Some of his work is pretty striking,

2741
02:38:48,231 --> 02:38:51,680
but he's hardly worthy of his current
status is God of the literary underground.

2742
02:38:52,070 --> 02:38:55,010
Wow. Is it? People are upset.

2743
02:38:55,310 --> 02:38:58,380
I wrote, my sister used to work
at an art gallery in New York,

2744
02:38:58,381 --> 02:38:59,580
the Alexander Gallery,

2745
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,150
and they had an art crime exhibit and
I remember asking her and she said, no,

2746
02:39:03,151 --> 02:39:07,980
he didn't come. He was a huge
like month long exhibit. Yeah.

2747
02:39:07,981 --> 02:39:11,310
He probably doesn't want to deal with
all the weirdness that he must get from

2748
02:39:11,311 --> 02:39:12,990
these kind of strange images.
If you're,

2749
02:39:13,050 --> 02:39:16,470
most of the images are like women
with big giant acids and huge legs,

2750
02:39:16,471 --> 02:39:17,430
tree trunk legs,

2751
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:22,590
and a lot of them have dudes riding these
women like people would get upset at

2752
02:39:22,591 --> 02:39:25,680
you. Those would be uncomfortable
moments by you making me look at this.

2753
02:39:25,681 --> 02:39:28,590
What is this? What is the obsession
with women with giant ankles?

2754
02:39:29,130 --> 02:39:31,670
I think they put him, I think they
used to put them in pen house.

2755
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:35,180
Really? I think so. Hmm.

2756
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:41,040
This is really interesting. Keep on
trucking. That was his shit. Yeah.

2757
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,460
Yeah.

2758
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:47,460
I mean he was like a part of that weird
hippie sub culture of like the late

2759
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:51,210
sixties and the 70s. It's a
strange time to be alive, man.

2760
02:39:51,630 --> 02:39:53,740
These are the first people
that were really kind of, uh,

2761
02:39:53,790 --> 02:39:58,050
experimenting with Lsd and
cannabis was like, oh my God,

2762
02:39:58,051 --> 02:40:01,500
some of these are so racist. I can't
even look at them anymore. I am upset.

2763
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:05,240
Craig foot sevens. I literally can't look
at them. I'm looking at the penthouse.

2764
02:40:05,770 --> 02:40:08,020
Yeah. One I would have around, uh,

2765
02:40:09,090 --> 02:40:12,930
the house with the kids. Well, I think
people now they look at the content of it,

2766
02:40:12,931 --> 02:40:15,560
that kind of what that guardian article
was about. They're like, Hey, yeah,

2767
02:40:15,570 --> 02:40:16,860
this guy was kind of fucked up.

2768
02:40:16,861 --> 02:40:20,640
Like why are we making them
out to be this amazing artist?

2769
02:40:20,790 --> 02:40:23,460
But it is amazing art because
it does something to you.

2770
02:40:23,461 --> 02:40:27,450
It gives you this reaction, you know,
it's, is it necessarily all good now?

2771
02:40:27,460 --> 02:40:29,700
But it's, it's art. Like this is a very,

2772
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:33,480
this is a very unique
individual viewpoint.

2773
02:40:33,481 --> 02:40:37,890
Like this is this guy's
viewpoint and that's, that is
art. You might not like it,

2774
02:40:37,891 --> 02:40:39,150
you might be weirded out by it,

2775
02:40:39,151 --> 02:40:41,700
but it takes weird people to
make shit that strikes you.

2776
02:40:42,060 --> 02:40:43,790
And the way that this
guy's work strikes people.

2777
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:47,930
Well, arts turned into something that
people are supposed to agree with and,

2778
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:52,180
and you know, and it's supposed to not
offend anybody and that's the opposite.

2779
02:40:52,181 --> 02:40:55,210
Art's supposed to shake it up.
It's supposed to challenge, I mean,

2780
02:40:55,420 --> 02:40:59,960
you think about punk rock and now it's
almost like folksy when you think about

2781
02:40:59,961 --> 02:41:01,000
old punk rock.
Yeah,

2782
02:41:01,001 --> 02:41:03,700
they have a Mohawk and they peer
stuff and they jump up and down.

2783
02:41:03,970 --> 02:41:06,980
But when it came out, it was
anarchy. It was at a time, you know,

2784
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:09,410
when it came out in London, it
was about, you know, there were,

2785
02:41:09,610 --> 02:41:12,460
there were strikes going on at the time
and there was riots going on in the

2786
02:41:12,461 --> 02:41:13,810
street and you know,

2787
02:41:13,811 --> 02:41:17,830
punk rock represented something that was
really fucking scary to the status quo.

2788
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:18,591
Yeah.

2789
02:41:18,591 --> 02:41:22,580
It wasn't just your mom won't buy you a
car and now they called Green Day punk

2790
02:41:22,581 --> 02:41:24,380
rock. It's like, are
you fucking kidding me?

2791
02:41:25,550 --> 02:41:29,460
When Green Day was shitting on Justin
Bieber, we're not fucking Justin Bieber.

2792
02:41:29,461 --> 02:41:30,530
It was like,
Oh God.

2793
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:33,990
Oh, did they say if you have to
say that you're not punk rock?

2794
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:37,290
Yeah. I mean, there was something where
they're getting them off stage early.

2795
02:41:37,291 --> 02:41:40,110
Do remember that Jamie? Yeah.
He freaked out and he said,

2796
02:41:40,111 --> 02:41:41,290
we're not fucking Justin Bieber.

2797
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:43,930
I think he probably apologized to
Justin Bieber after that. Yeah.

2798
02:41:44,690 --> 02:41:47,960
I, no offense, like green day's a
great band, but they're not punk rock.

2799
02:41:48,230 --> 02:41:52,850
Yeah, they're okay. They're an okay
pop band pop band. Yeah. It's not,

2800
02:41:52,910 --> 02:41:56,120
it's not my style, but they
have some songs that I like.
Sure. Yeah. If I hear them,

2801
02:41:56,121 --> 02:41:57,620
I think they're enjoyable.
Right.

2802
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:03,100
But it's not like this is like our chrome
was like really essentially like punk

2803
02:42:03,861 --> 02:42:07,790
rock comic books. He, a lot of
the racist stuff that he did,

2804
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:13,240
he wasn't necessarily being racist as
he was highlighting like how a racist

2805
02:42:14,481 --> 02:42:17,510
would view something and doing
it in a very shocking way.

2806
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:21,650
Like I don't think there can be a,
I don't think I've ever read anything.

2807
02:42:21,651 --> 02:42:23,910
I might be wrong,
but I don't think I've read it.

2808
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:28,790
Ever read anything that indicated
that he was actually racist?

2809
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:32,180
No. No, I don't think so. I think he
was actually a big liberal. I think,

2810
02:42:32,181 --> 02:42:34,660
you know he lived in San
Francisco, I believe. Yeah.

2811
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:39,470
But I think it was a lot to do with just
being a boy expressing himself. He was,

2812
02:42:39,650 --> 02:42:43,640
he kind of had arrested development and
he was in the same way that when I was

2813
02:42:43,641 --> 02:42:44,421
12 years old,

2814
02:42:44,421 --> 02:42:48,440
the pictures that I would make would
probably be in the wheelhouse of the shit

2815
02:42:48,441 --> 02:42:52,400
that he was making. He just made it much
better. And he did it as a man, but to,

2816
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:56,570
but to put big pussy lips and nipples
that are, you know, four inches long.

2817
02:42:56,571 --> 02:42:59,900
Like that's what you used to write. He's,
I think he was just expressing that.

2818
02:42:59,970 --> 02:43:03,510
Yeah. Well also I guess
what he was doing, um,

2819
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:05,140
with a lot of his images there,

2820
02:43:05,141 --> 02:43:10,141
they were racist pop culture images from
the 1940s so he was reviving this very

2821
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:12,183
type of imagery

2822
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:14,650
that was really racist.
And so the real question,

2823
02:43:14,651 --> 02:43:19,270
the argument in this article on a hood,
you tell it,

2824
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:22,220
who did,
who did utilitarian.com um,

2825
02:43:22,270 --> 02:43:27,270
the argument was whether or not it
was ironic and or parody and like,

2826
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:33,450
whether it's enough to absolve
him of doing, you know,

2827
02:43:33,490 --> 02:43:37,360
these images of re reenacting
them or recreating them.

2828
02:43:38,740 --> 02:43:39,910
Hmm.
It's interesting.

2829
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:43,990
It's interesting because it's kind of,

2830
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:49,320
it's revealing like a very specific style
of racist cartoons that they used to

2831
02:43:49,511 --> 02:43:53,710
do. And in doing so, he's like, you know,
he's highlighting it is showing you like,

2832
02:43:53,711 --> 02:43:58,320
hey, like this is, if you're normal
and if you're a reasonable person who,

2833
02:43:58,330 --> 02:44:01,780
who's not racist, you're not going to
get racist feelings from looking at this.

2834
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:03,700
What you're going to do is
you're going to say, wow,

2835
02:44:03,790 --> 02:44:08,020
this was like how people who are racist
think it's not gonna make you raise.

2836
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:12,010
You look at like a, you know, chaplain was
doing Hitler, you know, f troop. You know,

2837
02:44:12,011 --> 02:44:14,850
you're, you're depicting
the Holocaust. Yeah.

2838
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:18,670
In a way that brings some humor to it
and brings a different angle to it now.

2839
02:44:18,671 --> 02:44:21,190
And he brought, he had
humor in his pictures. Yeah.

2840
02:44:21,191 --> 02:44:24,490
You don't become racist by
looking at racist shit. Right.

2841
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,940
The idea is effecting developmenting,
developing minds,

2842
02:44:27,941 --> 02:44:31,570
developing personalities,
children, adolescents,

2843
02:44:31,571 --> 02:44:35,440
like showing them racist stuff and let
him know it's okay that can plant racist

2844
02:44:35,441 --> 02:44:37,930
seeds. But once you're an
adult, like no one's gonna,

2845
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:39,910
no one's gonna like make you racist.

2846
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:43,720
Like if you're Greg Fitzsimmons
in 2015 and you see some,

2847
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:47,380
some fucking ridiculous racist,
racist imagery,

2848
02:44:47,381 --> 02:44:49,570
you're not going to automatically
become racist. Right.

2849
02:44:49,720 --> 02:44:51,820
So the real concern is like,

2850
02:44:52,060 --> 02:44:57,010
are we protecting people from these hat
tire images because we're worried about

2851
02:44:57,011 --> 02:44:59,620
the impact of them or
because it's offensive,

2852
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:03,430
it's offensive to some people and it's
only going to be offensive to some people

2853
02:45:03,431 --> 02:45:07,930
until things even out. Like
if you do ridiculous racist
versions of white people,

2854
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:10,450
I think it's hilarious. And
I'm white. You know why?

2855
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:14,200
Because white people were ahead of the
curve and if it evens out to the point

2856
02:45:14,201 --> 02:45:18,040
where black people and white people and
Chinese people and everybody on such a

2857
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:21,610
fucking even ground and that
racism is completely preposterous,

2858
02:45:21,611 --> 02:45:26,050
but the racial differences
of each nationality is
allowed to be highlighted in

2859
02:45:26,051 --> 02:45:28,390
brutal fashion and nobody cares.
Yeah.

2860
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:32,350
Like if you like Richard
Pryor sold to white people,

2861
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:36,070
the idea of mocking white people,
hey there fella.

2862
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:39,190
You know the white motherfuckers at work
would, you know, like, and we laughed.

2863
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:43,210
Your Mama Bitch, my mom was a
great old cow. Yeah. You know,

2864
02:45:43,211 --> 02:45:47,170
like you could white people never got
offended by that. Oh, never. Never.

2865
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:50,080
It's like awe.
Very cute.

2866
02:45:50,110 --> 02:45:53,920
But there's a lot of jokes like you're
not even allowed to joke about certain

2867
02:45:53,921 --> 02:45:56,710
people on stage,
like at all.

2868
02:45:56,740 --> 02:45:59,620
Like any joke about them is racist,

2869
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:03,400
this is racist or
homophobic or it's whatever,

2870
02:46:03,401 --> 02:46:07,630
fill in the blank and that's ridiculous.
Like that's ridiculous.

2871
02:46:07,631 --> 02:46:10,130
Like the joke about Rosa parks
and they got a lot of shit about

2872
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:13,280
it. Someone a joke, whatever it was.
Yeah. They something like he was,

2873
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:14,840
she was just to tie,

2874
02:46:14,841 --> 02:46:17,930
she was too lazy to move to the back of
the bus or something like that and it

2875
02:46:17,931 --> 02:46:22,520
was like a fucking blew up.
It was a black comic. Hmm.

2876
02:46:22,610 --> 02:46:26,150
I don't know if it's cat willy. Nah,
it wasn't Katt Williams, but it's a,

2877
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:28,250
would it be,
what do you think about Leslie Jones?

2878
02:46:29,390 --> 02:46:31,370
What's he's doing fucking great.
She's just a,

2879
02:46:31,371 --> 02:46:35,780
she's going to be in the new
Ghostbusters movie. Who's Leslie Jones?

2880
02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:38,740
You know her from the comment? Oh, you
know what? She probably left the Commie.

2881
02:46:38,741 --> 02:46:42,830
Still refer you came back. She's black
chick. She's tall. She opened for a cat.

2882
02:46:42,831 --> 02:46:43,664
Williams for you?

2883
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:48,550
She's a killer. Okay. I
don't know her. She's really,

2884
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:50,440
I've seen her on TV one.

2885
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:53,600
She's,
she's a big funny,

2886
02:46:54,050 --> 02:46:55,880
great check and she's a,

2887
02:46:55,881 --> 02:47:00,430
she struggled for fucking 1520
years doing standup, I dunno.

2888
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:02,740
15 years maybe. Good for
her. And then she got,

2889
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:07,190
she got an a on SNL and she's just
blowing up on SNL and that's just got

2890
02:47:07,191 --> 02:47:08,024
Ghostbusters.

2891
02:47:08,090 --> 02:47:12,830
Wow. Ghostbusters with all
checks. Is that what it is? Yes.

2892
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:17,460
Oh, cast. Okay, good luck with
that. Yeah, that's going to be a

2893
02:47:19,190 --> 02:47:22,670
different angle on that new new
remakes of movies. There's just,

2894
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:26,720
it's hard to get behind these remakes
of movies. It's like, you know,

2895
02:47:26,721 --> 02:47:27,980
and we're going to flip the switch.

2896
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:32,780
We're going to do Cagney and Lacey with
gay men. Yeah, yeah. We're going to do,

2897
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:34,430
you know,
not Cagney and Lacey.

2898
02:47:34,431 --> 02:47:36,770
What was the one where they went
off the fucking dumb and Louise,

2899
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:41,400
they read the film and
Louise, the gay man. No, no.

2900
02:47:45,060 --> 02:47:47,960
He did best in guys holding hands,

2901
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:51,110
driving off the cliff and it
driving across the country,

2902
02:47:51,111 --> 02:47:54,620
just blowing guys in rest areas,
just blowing guys and shooting women,

2903
02:47:57,350 --> 02:47:59,720
women that don't want it to be gay.
That gone down.

2904
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:03,470
And then they're running shoes. No,
let her run first because it wasn't,

2905
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:06,830
wasn't telling the Louise like some
guy did something horrible to them.

2906
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:11,540
The way that guy was Brad Pitt.
Oh Shit. That's right. Right.

2907
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:16,090
That's when it was a young, sexy. Aw, God
dammit. He was good looking man, man. Oh,

2908
02:48:16,091 --> 02:48:19,850
the tits on him. That was perfect.
That was a great movie though.

2909
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:24,400
That was like the first chick buddy movie
where the chicks were gangster. Right.

2910
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:24,831
You know,

2911
02:48:24,831 --> 02:48:29,360
this was a few of those moments where the
chicks were like super fucking bad ass

2912
02:48:29,361 --> 02:48:33,230
in a believable way.
One of the best ones was pulp fiction,

2913
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:37,050
pulp fiction and kill
bill was just as bad ass.

2914
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:41,280
Or how about this? Maybe even better.
What was the, not, not pulp fiction.

2915
02:48:41,281 --> 02:48:43,870
What was the one with Kush
Christian Slater that, uh,

2916
02:48:43,950 --> 02:48:48,720
turns turn around aunts
dude. Yeah, she was great.

2917
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:51,180
Come on man. What's her
name? Patricia or cat.

2918
02:48:51,390 --> 02:48:53,430
Is it Patricia Arquette or the other one?
Well,

2919
02:48:53,431 --> 02:48:58,320
there was two movies that were similar.
There was patty Arquette did one. Uh,

2920
02:48:58,321 --> 02:49:03,120
and then, uh, what's her name? There's
a David Arquette. Patricia Arquette.

2921
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:06,840
It was a trip. She was the
one in true romance. Yeah.

2922
02:49:06,841 --> 02:49:08,670
When was at Gamble Fini

2923
02:49:08,700 --> 02:49:12,720
and her have that fucking crazy fight
scene or was it John Madsen? Who Was it?

2924
02:49:14,550 --> 02:49:16,710
Who else is in it is Gandolfini in it.

2925
02:49:18,390 --> 02:49:23,130
That's all it says for the cast.
Dennis Hopper. But who uh, no,

2926
02:49:23,131 --> 02:49:27,090
there was somebody that got in that,
that it was getting a Fini. Yeah. Again,

2927
02:49:27,091 --> 02:49:30,390
the Fini beats the shit out of her and
she eventually kills him at the end and

2928
02:49:30,391 --> 02:49:33,060
it was just so wa cause
it was like believable.

2929
02:49:33,061 --> 02:49:35,580
She was talking shit while I was
beating the fuck out of her and then she

2930
02:49:35,581 --> 02:49:40,200
eventually kills him and it's just so
wild and primal when she does and she's

2931
02:49:40,201 --> 02:49:41,730
all fucked up and beaten up.

2932
02:49:41,731 --> 02:49:46,200
Like you really felt like she had
been in a fight and just killed this.

2933
02:49:46,201 --> 02:49:50,880
Fuck did, it wasn't like a Charlie's
angels type thing. It was so real.

2934
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:53,760
It was so real bozo with Juliette Lewis,

2935
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:58,600
natural born killers that was pretty
natural born killers was amazing. Yeah.

2936
02:49:58,950 --> 02:50:02,130
I want to get her in here, man.
We, she said she would do it too.

2937
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:04,800
She said she would do the podcast.
She's a comedy Fan, right?

2938
02:50:04,801 --> 02:50:06,060
She didn't have a lot of comics.

2939
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:10,410
She's a fascinating person
and she believes that like
Tom Cruise is a victim of

2940
02:50:10,411 --> 02:50:14,160
like propaganda when it comes to
like anti Scientology propaganda.

2941
02:50:14,161 --> 02:50:17,460
I would love to hear someone who's like
a happy scientist. She's a psychologist.

2942
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:21,660
Hardcore. Wow. Unless she
doesn't want to talk about that.

2943
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:25,290
Do you had at Scientologists?
Not before. No. No.

2944
02:50:25,360 --> 02:50:27,000
It's curious how much they
want to talk about it.

2945
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:30,810
I just have one neighbor couldn't shut
the fuck up about it. Right. He loved it.

2946
02:50:31,350 --> 02:50:34,380
He was telling me about how his
wife was going. Clear. Yeah.

2947
02:50:34,630 --> 02:50:38,070
She was spending 50 grand turned clear,
50 grand.

2948
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:39,450
When you know what
happens when you're clear,

2949
02:50:40,050 --> 02:50:42,780
you're no longer negatively affected
by outside influence. Gregory.

2950
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:46,560
That's amazing. It's incredible.
Fixes everything. 50 50 just pay up.

2951
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:49,740
Probably going to be some math outside
influences cause you're going to be broke.

2952
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:50,940
You Go,

2953
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:53,370
this guy wanted to buy a piece of property
and he couldn't buy it because his

2954
02:50:53,371 --> 02:50:56,100
wife was going clear.
I'm not kidding.

2955
02:50:56,590 --> 02:50:59,910
He was talking about this piece of
property. He wanted to, you know,

2956
02:51:00,260 --> 02:51:01,380
it was like adjacent to his,

2957
02:51:01,381 --> 02:51:03,780
his property and was thinking about buying
it but he couldn't afford it because

2958
02:51:03,781 --> 02:51:08,370
it's trying to get you to a
meeting. Uh, no. Nope, nope, nope.

2959
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:09,293
Explained it to me.

2960
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:14,220
Tell me how much it benefited him but
it wasn't proselytizing. Thank goodness.

2961
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:18,530
Wow. That would have been ugly.
That would be Dang Dong, Mr Ogun.

2962
02:51:18,531 --> 02:51:21,090
Oh you're in there.
It's me happiness.

2963
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:25,500
Your happiness awaits its clarity.
Its at the door. It's your choice.

2964
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:30,120
Go with clarity or with none.
The coast is clear Gel.

2965
02:51:30,210 --> 02:51:33,040
Don't they like to use
like acronyms they have to,

2966
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:35,880
they use abbreviations or whatever it
is for like all these different types of

2967
02:51:35,881 --> 02:51:37,140
people.
Suppressive people.

2968
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:41,010
They have all these different like things
that they call upon when they define

2969
02:51:41,011 --> 02:51:42,120
like various aspects.

2970
02:51:42,150 --> 02:51:45,390
Negative people that you're encountering
in your life that disbelieved the

2971
02:51:45,391 --> 02:51:49,950
tenants of Scientology. Yeah.
There's like orgs, orbs, something.

2972
02:51:50,130 --> 02:51:54,120
I read a book about a written by the
niece of the guy who is the head of

2973
02:51:54,121 --> 02:51:58,770
Scientology. She broke out. She
talked about being a child slave.

2974
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:02,670
Like they literally separated her
and me while her uncle is the head of

2975
02:52:02,671 --> 02:52:06,100
Scientology. So she had juice,
still took her away from

2976
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:11,310
her parents and senator when all child
colony where she was raised and then

2977
02:52:12,401 --> 02:52:15,430
brought to Hollywood. So to
live, they kept moving around.

2978
02:52:15,431 --> 02:52:17,800
Every time she gets settled in,
they just uproot her,

2979
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:21,640
separated from her brother
centered a fucking Florida,

2980
02:52:21,641 --> 02:52:24,160
Sandra de la,
the desert.

2981
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:29,140
And she talked about how the kids built
the entire colony that they lived in.

2982
02:52:29,141 --> 02:52:32,680
They did all the, they would just
put them out to work every day.

2983
02:52:32,681 --> 02:52:37,330
They work like eight hours just weeding
and gardening and building fences and

2984
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:41,410
all this crazy shit. And they would
get schooled for like two hours a day.

2985
02:52:41,411 --> 02:52:45,610
And it was mostly Scientology schooling.
What's the name of the book? Uh,

2986
02:52:45,611 --> 02:52:49,660
raised by you remember the woman?

2987
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:55,360
Hmm. I get the worst fucking memory. I
can look it up, Jamie. You'll find it.

2988
02:52:55,361 --> 02:52:59,950
He'll fire and it's, I got to
read that and it just tracks
how, you know, then she,

2989
02:52:59,951 --> 02:53:00,251
they,

2990
02:53:00,251 --> 02:53:05,170
they don't want you to procreate because
babies are a burden on the church.

2991
02:53:05,170 --> 02:53:10,030
They want you to work. They want to create
worker bees and they discourage the,

2992
02:53:10,150 --> 02:53:14,110
you know, how much does someone like
Tom Cruise have to pay? They pay 10%.

2993
02:53:14,530 --> 02:53:19,420
I think it's tithing. Yeah. It's
probably like a 10% tithe Straw.

2994
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:23,760
And they got some videotapes. If you
don't want to pay or, you know, the,

2995
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:27,400
they make it worth your while
to pay the benefit. You, they,

2996
02:53:27,730 --> 02:53:30,910
they throw rose petals wherever that guy
walks and this and they're a publicity

2997
02:53:30,911 --> 02:53:35,550
firm. They, they, they, whatever
you want changed about your, uh, uh,

2998
02:53:35,570 --> 02:53:38,890
p is this the book beyond
belief? Yeah, that's it.

2999
02:53:38,920 --> 02:53:43,740
My secret life inside Scientology and my
heroine escape by Jenna Miscavige. Yes.

3000
02:53:43,810 --> 02:53:47,350
Miscavige and Miscavige is the name of
the guy who's the head of Scientology.

3001
02:53:47,400 --> 02:53:49,300
Wow. Yeah, that's crazy. I mean,

3002
02:53:49,301 --> 02:53:53,740
it's really crazy that she wrote it
because she was, when she left the church,

3003
02:53:54,070 --> 02:53:57,190
she was threatened by, I mean,
this is her fucking family.

3004
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:01,330
And they would come down and like
threatened her, threatened her, uh,

3005
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:04,270
her brother who was still inside
the church, threatened her mother.

3006
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:09,140
They don't fuck around.
Yeah.

3007
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:12,780
You could've been born there, you know,
I could have been born there and that's,

3008
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:16,240
that's the luck of the draw. I was
born Catholic. It's not, uh, as was,

3009
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:19,990
I could have been, could have been better.
Did you do Catholic school? Oh yeah. No,

3010
02:54:19,991 --> 02:54:24,130
no. I did Catholic school on
Wednesdays and then church on Sundays.

3011
02:54:24,190 --> 02:54:28,840
I did one whole year. Catholic school.
What grade first. Oh, that's not too bad.

3012
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:33,530
They smack you around a little bit. Scared
me. Yeah. Maybe hit me very gently. Hmm.

3013
02:54:33,710 --> 02:54:35,170
Nothing serious.
Nobody beat me up,

3014
02:54:35,171 --> 02:54:40,150
but scared the fucking shit out of me
and just saw a row because the walls were

3015
02:54:40,151 --> 02:54:43,300
soaked with sorrow.
Yeah. Awful, awful place.

3016
02:54:43,330 --> 02:54:47,400
Who's the bloody guy hanging on
the wall? That's the guy that, uh,

3017
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:51,580
you're supposed to be more like, oh, I
should end up like him. And you're good

3018
02:54:53,230 --> 02:54:56,470
if you're lucky. We're out
of time. Greg Fitzsimmons uh,

3019
02:54:56,500 --> 02:55:00,910
did you read off all your dates? I
did. Were coming up in Denver, Addison,

3020
02:55:01,090 --> 02:55:04,220
wherever you go to site again,
fits dog.com

3021
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:07,460
and in the podcast fits dog
radio twice a week tonight.

3022
02:55:07,461 --> 02:55:10,250
Greg Fitzsimmons is also going to
be at the Ice House in Pasadena.

3023
02:55:10,251 --> 02:55:13,790
Probably sold out.
It was very close earlier this morning.

3024
02:55:13,791 --> 02:55:18,680
So most likely it's going to be fun to
