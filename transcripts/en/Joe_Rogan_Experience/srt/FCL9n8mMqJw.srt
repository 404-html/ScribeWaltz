1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,180
It's fucked up.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,063
Do it.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,150
Kevin Smith.
We did it again.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,560
Is it happening?
Yes sir.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,210
We're there.
We're here with live.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Um,
this took a while to bring together.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,870
So nice to see you.
They see you before we go any farther or

8
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:24,590
far at all or do anything.
Let me just throw out there.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,540
I was telling somebody like,
what are you doing today?

10
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,000
I was like,
I'm going to go talk to Joe Rogan.

11
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:34,001
Then I launched into my leg 10 minute 
Joe Rogan pitch and at the end of it the

12
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,560
person I was talking to goes,
oh,

13
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:37,394
like you,
you've known him a long time as I've 

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,640
talked to him like twice.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,953
She was like,
you just went on a passionate tirade 

16
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:47,550
about them and I said,
I got it.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,550
I don't know how to explain it,
but I love the way he lives.

18
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,384
Like every I've,
I've loved the man since news radio and 

19
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:53,174
then I like meeting the man and,
and speaking with them on a previous 

20
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:59,690
podcast,
both his mind but not just that.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,330
And I love your philosophy.
I love the way you do life.

22
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:06,440
You handle it like the way I would if I 
was you,

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,120
like this is the best compliment I could
give,

24
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:08,954
but I'm not using them gutless and I 
lived through your instagram like I was 

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,360
like,
this is how a man lives.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,730
If only I could be this man.
So coming here is.

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,630
It's an absolute fucking pleasure.
I thought we're going to your house.

28
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,464
But that happened years ago apparently 
moved out of the house so people got 

29
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,450
creepy.
This is too many.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,420
Too many creepy people like when you 
don't want them coming to your house,

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,590
but you do want them on the podcast and 
shit.

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,103
When I went like this,
it must have been awhile ago because 

33
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:36,164
Megan was still working for me and she 
drove me and she like had to take a 

34
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:40,760
leak.
Pissed outside.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,250
Our podcast was so long and then I felt 
bad.

36
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,084
I was like,
maybe that's why he's not having to be 

37
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:48,724
back at the house.
He's like bringing him to a satellite 

38
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:53,300
office because he let's his assistant 
void in the yard.

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,670
I'm feeling fucking dope,
sir.

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,653
Let me tell you why I made this movie 
called Yoga hosers that just finally 

41
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:01,994
came onto Netflix and I took it to 
sundance in January and they bent me 

42
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:09,380
over and just critically speaking and 
we're just hate fucking it.

43
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:10,214
They hated this movie.
A lot of people were viewed it from the 

44
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,250
moment we announced it,
I'm like,

45
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,293
Hey,
I'm going to make a movie with my 

46
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,734
daughter and giant depths in his 
daughter's going to be a two and right 

47
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,030
away I saw like fucking long sharp 
knives now and so as expected it goes to

48
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,864
sundance and you know,
so I'm not saying this movie is for 

49
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,090
everybody.

50
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,220
It's for like 10 people in the world,
but the 10 people that love it,

51
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,490
love it.
Like religion.

52
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:31,324
And so have you always done that though?
You just kind of do what you like to do 

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,350
in my life.
I could turn it around.

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,253
Turn on you.
What I like about what you do is you 

55
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,504
are,
you're very much an accepted inside guy 

56
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,043
who lives like some guy from Jersey who 
is trying to break into the business 

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,233
like this is useful because you never 
really understand how people 

58
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,300
professional,
see you know,

59
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,620
how the world sees you because they'll 
tell you in any given moment,

60
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,780
Joe,
Joe,

61
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,950
normal or sally,
normal people live in the real world and

62
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,580
shit,

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,130
but your peers and people like we work 
in entertainment and shit.

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,760
How you tell your very unaffected.
You're a uniquely unaffected Casa.

65
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:11,110
Like ineffective.
Same time.

66
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,740
I know you're very effective.
You're effective at doing what you enjoy

67
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,693
and that's why you have such a unique 
and loyal fan base is because they know 

68
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,150
that.
It's like in this world,

69
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,540
there's not a whole lot of unique 
visions.

70
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,553
There's a lot of ideas.
They get brought to producers and 

71
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,973
executives and a bunch of people pile in
and it becomes more of a an idea where 

72
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:34,924
it's trying to appeal to a broader 
audience and it switches up and then 

73
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,724
someone wants to bring a love interest 
or there's all sorts of influences that 

74
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,270
happen that homogenize as you drink some
milk.

75
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,280
I know that was a different time.
Is Milk.

76
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,480
Oh my Lord.
That was perfect.

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Perfect timing of a standup comic.

78
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,650
Loving my.
It does really.

79
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,500
That's the best word for it because even
though if it's good like you,

80
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,334
you,
you don't feel like that guy like 

81
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,240
Tarantino is one of the unique guys 
were,

82
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,750
even though it's movies,
have these gigantic mega blockbusters,

83
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,560
it feels like he's doing his own thing 
yet.

84
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,403
Feels like this crazy fucker just got 
the money and the wheels and they're 

85
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,084
listening to him because he's Tarantino.
Your movies at the same kind of feel 

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,240
connects with more people.
There's more of a like,

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,410
oh yeah,
that's cool.

88
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,244
It's cinema of cool because you could 
just look out even if you don't have an 

89
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,780
experiential connection to it,
like,

90
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,643
oh,
I once went to a fifties cafe as per 

91
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,913
your,
just like that looks bad at St John 

92
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,531
Travolta,
dancing on the Thurman.

93
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,364
That's bad as all the way.
Everything about it is just like cinema 

94
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:41,410
of cool and fed by a lifetime of movie 
loving and a movie diet.

95
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,420
Yeah,
so if you love movies,

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,430
here's a guy that distills everything.
That's the essence of Cool of cinema and

97
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,980
I don't want to keep hitting the cool 
belks people like,

98
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:52,060
come on.
It's a hipster term,

99
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:52,894
but it.
It does distill it down to those 

100
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,460
moments.
Not so much like massive arcs,

101
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,080
but whew,
this feels awesome.

102
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,100
That's dope.
Oh,

103
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,990
that's metal.
Well,

104
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,810
yeah,
you have that same kind of thing.

105
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,470
Your.
Your movies are very.

106
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,780
Well,
it's.

107
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,600
You're the only one like comedies in 
particular,

108
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,613
like that was one of the more 
interesting and unique things about red 

109
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:16,510
state because I had no,
you didn't tell me a word about it.

110
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,920
He said,
I don't want you to know nothing.

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,993
His coincide here that I meant to me and
me and Marilyn sit there and watched it 

112
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,730
and at the end of it we were like,
Holy Shit.

113
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,520
Like Holy Shit.
Like what the fuck was that?

114
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,130
He was crazy.
He wasn't a comedy.

115
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,450
Adam.
It's nice like throw them a curve and be

116
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,021
like,
oh,

117
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,670
he's not.
We thought we saw everything.

118
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,190
Like I always felt.
Most people saw me as like,

119
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,053
oh,
he did clerks and then he's done about 

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,110
96 variations.
People need to see red state.

121
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,590
If you haven't seen red state,
that is A.

122
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,170
I don't want to say too much because I 
want people to go into it the way I went

123
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,510
into it.
Just go see that fucking movie.

124
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,590
But that's another movie where even 
though it wasn't like the same,

125
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,980
it was

126
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,470
still a unique voice.
You know?

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,230
It's like,
I think,

128
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,640
I don't know what it's like to make a 
movie,

129
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,474
but it's got to be.
The lot of people have a lot of say 

130
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,370
emerges is bigger.
The budget,

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,233
the more you know you have to listen to 
a bunch of more people and you can't be 

132
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,114
unreasonable about if you get him 
tremendous amounts of success like jj 

133
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,830
Abrams and you're a nice guy at the same
time,

134
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,570
you know you can get away with being 
like,

135
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:20,990
I'm going to do whatever I want and 
people like what you want tends to work,

136
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,600
so here go nuts,
but generally speaking,

137
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,434
the more money you accept,
the more input you also have to accept 

138
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,470
lower the budget and if it's coming out 
of your pocket,

139
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,810
you don't gotta say Shit to anybody.
Nobody can tell you anything,

140
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,973
but you know,
if you're putting together something 

141
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,610
small,
it's still a smaller circle of people.

142
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,380
It's kind of answered.
She's.

143
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,610
You always have to be willing to hear 
what they're saying.

144
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,473
If somebody is willing to give you 
ungodly matrimony and make pretend mind 

145
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,080
you,
this is not like,

146
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,183
I'm going to give you funds and you're 
going to give me eggs and I'm going to 

147
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,150
sell those eggs and I'm going to make 
more money selling those eggs.

148
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,100
They're like,
we're going to give you money and you're

149
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,993
gonna.
Take this goofy fucking idea you have 

150
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:59,810
and try to make it real and turn it into
a movie that may work or may not work.

151
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:00,644
It's all a crapshoot.
It's like buying a lottery ticket to 

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,833
much degree.
No guarantees that they'll ever be an 

153
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,224
audience for it.
So I learned that midway my career and 

154
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,680
realized,
well,

155
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
just work for you.
It sounds masturbatory,

156
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,600
but it's like if you are the audience 
that you're trying to hit,

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,390
then you'll always be satisfied.

158
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,313
You know?
It's like if you want other people to 

159
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:20,894
like it,
it's subjective and you may not find 

160
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,310
that people dig what you're doing and 
you know,

161
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,800
if you're looking for monetary success,
good luck.

162
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:28,634
Nobody can guess that.
Like even when marvel releases a new 

163
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,190
movie and we know marvel is exceptional 
at what they do,

164
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,480
put them in Pixar,
marvel,

165
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,160
pixar,
and care the best of the best.

166
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,473
Even when they release a movie,
they clench a little bit because 

167
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,720
anything could happen,
anything could happen at all.

168
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:45,554
So generally speaking,
they're a little more insulated from 

169
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:48,351
like,
Oh shit,

170
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,184
we lost money because actually those 
marvel movies are so expensive now 

171
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,130
because dude,
it's like,

172
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,093
same thing with the animated movies.
The animated movies are ungodly 

173
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:59,534
expensive to make,
but they print money and they print 

174
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,880
money,
not just the first time they come out at

175
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:05,714
the box office.

176
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,600
They print money through all the 
licenses.

177
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,434
They print money where you know 
sometimes you go like they're doing a 

178
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,010
sequel to that.
Why,

179
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,960
why don't they do something new?
Because they've already built the world.

180
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,640
It's already there in a computer and 
they're like,

181
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,070
oh,
we need a new script and we're good.

182
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,860
We've done our infrastructure.
Like when you think about it,

183
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,993
if you building something,
you built all this massive 

184
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,214
infrastructure and spent three years 
putting it together and did it once and 

185
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,701
they were like,
okay,

186
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,230
everybody,
goodbye forever.

187
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,050
It's kind of a waste of everything you 
put together.

188
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,850
That's why they immediately go for a 
sequel.

189
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,500
A,
they know they're gonna make money,

190
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,633
but B,
they're gonna make more money because 

191
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:41,450
they don't have to invest as much time 
and money as they did the first time.

192
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,400
So that's what makes the studio go like,
oh,

193
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,234
that's easier,
that's low hanging fruit and everyone's 

194
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,580
happy,
you know,

195
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,590
it's not like they're making art films 
that only a few people,

196
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:49,424
like generally they tend to make flicks 
that a bunch of people want to go see 

197
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,383
and that riles up people that want to 
see newer films or something like that 

198
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,470
because like why is it always the same 
movie over and over again?

199
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,970
But you know,
I submit to you,

200
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,590
if you're going to see a superhero 
movie,

201
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,293
expect a little fucking sameness.
It's a story of like an exceptional 

202
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:07,704
being with powers that others don't and 
hopefully that person will use it for 

203
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,930
good.
You know,

204
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,773
you can only cut that cheese so many 
fucking times where and say it's 

205
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,464
something new.
I think to watch men took it to a new 

206
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:22,830
place and I love the watch,
but at the end of the day it's just like

207
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,530
people in mass doing the right thing and
you they fucked in space,

208
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,440
but other than that there was people in 
mass trying to do the right thing.

209
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,170
They were murdered.
The murdered each other.

210
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,690
Does that get caught up in Batman v 
Superman?

211
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,130
I heard there were some murders in that 
movie,

212
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:35,851
that movie.
I was like,

213
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:40,140
did they say somebody fucking died in 
prison and over Batman,

214
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,670
you know,
they went in strange directions,

215
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:46,230
but after a year of a like just taking 
it over a movie that nobody saw,

216
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,060
it didn't really come out.

217
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,510
Eventually restored it and stuff like 
that.

218
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,990
Yoga is just finally goes to Netflix and
I just want to go back and like,

219
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,323
here,
let me just assure people there's 

220
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,080
something you want to do.
Do it.

221
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,520
Like as long as it doesn't hurt 
somebody,

222
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,743
especially if it's something like make 
something like a movie or fucking comic 

223
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:05,580
book or whatever.
Fuck.

224
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,160
Don't worry about the consequences.
There was a moment throughout this year,

225
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,073
I was like,
fuck,

226
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,780
what was I?
Why would I was stoned?

227
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,390
Why did I make that movie?
Like,

228
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,233
Oh my God,
I'm a fucking idiot and stuff and I 

229
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,204
forgot somewhere along the way that like
when I made it and this isn't a cop out 

230
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,880
of like I didn't make it for everybody,
but I did kind of targeting audience for

231
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:24,714
it and I knew going in that it was going
to have this weird life to get to where 

232
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,390
it is.

233
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,200
I made it for tween girls specifically.
I was like,

234
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:33,790
maybe other people could enjoy it,
but this is for tween girl the way.

235
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,330
Like when I was a boy,
I was clicking on cable.

236
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,750
I found strange brew starring Bob and 
Doug Mackenzie and I was like,

237
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,240
oh my God,
like I've never heard of this before.

238
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,490
How come nobody ever heard of this?
This is mine.

239
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:46,160
Like you have a sense of ownership to 
it.

240
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,293
It changed my life.
It's one of my favorite movies and 

241
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,524
informed what I would become in life.
The conduct kind of comedy that 

242
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,750
afterwards by Bob and Doug Mckenzie.
Think about a dude I made Jay and silent

243
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,584
Bob.
You don't get to Jay and silent Bob 

244
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,494
Without Bob and Doug.
Mackenzie is not a direct line from 

245
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,930
cheech and Chong.
Jay and Bob,

246
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,600
right.
That's like I want to make a movie.

247
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,434
I got a daughter and she's 17 now,
but for years I was always trying to 

248
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,530
take her to like flicks where it's not 
iron man,

249
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:14,940
spiderman,
superman,

250
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,420
Batman.

251
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,971
It's like,
hey,

252
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:16,804
is are fucking lady up in the mix here.
That's not just like and black widow 

253
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,740
somebody who's now they're making a 
wonderful movie.

254
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,050
But.
So I said,

255
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,330
you consider I don't curse the darkness 
or you can make light a candle.

256
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:27,991
So I was like,
all right,

257
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:28,824
like let's make this thing that I'm 
trying to take the kid to that I could 

258
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,690
never find and shit.
And she got an acting.

259
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,420
So she's in it and she's.
The reason I did it,

260
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,980
if wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have tried it and shit.

261
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,290
But she had a small role in Tusk.
I thought she did good.

262
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,124
So I spun off her character and her 
friendly rose's character into this 

263
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:44,424
whole movie.
So when I was making it as being good 

264
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,351
for like,
you know,

265
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,880
you want to talk about playing a game of
darts,

266
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,150
it's like you're not going after anybody
between girls.

267
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,013
And I knew in that moment I was like,
it's going be a long time before they 

268
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,624
get it.
They're not going to find it in 

269
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,760
theaters.
A fucking weird hybrid.

270
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,910
Midnight moved to stone or flick.
The villains are one foot tall.

271
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:03,200
Canadian Nazis made a bratwurst called 
razzies,

272
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,113
like a fucked up weird ass movie.
So they'll find it like the way I found 

273
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:09,184
strange brew on cable.
I had this dream like too simple dreams 

274
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,810
in regard to this poster I want in 
regards to this movie.

275
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,673
I want to post or two girls just 
standing next to each other and they're 

276
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,090
not like fighting over a fucking boy or 
something like that.

277
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,933
But just hanging out the way.
Like Dante and Randall hung out on my 

278
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:26,280
clerks poser and then like that,
it eventually wind up on Netflix or some

279
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,260
streaming service.
That's like a midst hundreds,

280
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:33,220
thousands of other movies and some tween
girls clicking through one day,

281
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,054
bored as shit and watched everything and
suddenly sees the picture of like two 

282
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:37,790
girls,
10 next to each other,

283
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,540
the hockey stick and little sausage men 
and going like,

284
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,200
what's that?

285
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,950
And it becomes their religion,
their strange brew or something.

286
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,480
You know,
you can't always go for the world.

287
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,563
I'm,
it'd be nice if you can satisfy 

288
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,190
everybody,
but you're trying to satisfy yourself.

289
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,350
It sounds very massive betrayal,
but the same time it's like,

290
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,400
I hope people go on the journey.
Um,

291
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,920
but I understand if they can't,
like sometimes we go in directions where

292
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,590
the audience,
the entire audience can follow us.

293
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,630
I'm sure you got some people who love 
you are like,

294
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,400
yeah,
I don't dig on mma,

295
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:10,120
but I love everything else you do.
It's like they could go partially.

296
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,310
They can't go all the way with you 
sometimes.

297
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:13,144
And I get that,
especially lately I've been making 

298
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,290
movies that are real,
like fucking dare,

299
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,363
like not daring,
but like I dare you to fucking get 

300
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,011
through this.
You know,

301
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:21,844
it's a real like clearly he's given,
doesn't give a shit about the audience 

302
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:24,370
anymore.

303
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,580
He's just making shit to watch their 
reaction change and it's not true.

304
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:28,414
There's something there and stuff,
but I know that it's a used to be a 

305
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:31,444
wider bridge people could cross to get 
to me and now the bridge is getting 

306
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,580
smaller and smaller because I'm like,
you gotta like this,

307
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,590
you got to be interested in this.
Like Tusk,

308
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:42,370
the movie I made after redstate is a 
movie about a guy tried to tries to turn

309
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,204
another guy into a walrus.
You really got to be in the mood to see 

310
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:45,694
a fucking weird batshit stupid movie 
that's intentionally like was this 

311
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:51,490
fucking dumb.
He's serious and like it plays.

312
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,410
It's so straight and shit like we're 
argo.

313
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,740
So clearly I'm in a very experimental,
like,

314
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,100
let me fuck around.
I've done enough.

315
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,300
I feel good.
Let me fuck around.

316
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:01,360
And it finally paid off as the point of 
this whole story.

317
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,590
Like after a year get mass kicked online
and people being like,

318
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,433
he fucking lost it and shit.
Now that audience is starting to find 

319
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,360
it.
Now that it's on Netflix,

320
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:11,194
all of a sudden I'm hearing from fucking
tween girls that like the movie and 

321
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:15,970
parents have twin girls.
They're like,

322
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:16,804
oh my God,
how many of them are like 40 year old 

323
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:20,080
dudes?
Pretend I hope it is.

324
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,070
I hope it's all of them do.
I don't give a shit.

325
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,333
It's I'll take them all if they were all
40 year old dudes that said Nice things 

326
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,970
about it.
After a year of people being like,

327
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,160
it blows.
It's nice to have people being like,

328
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,470
oh,
it blows on purpose or oh,

329
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,670
I get it,
or blah blah blah.

330
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,780
I got.
I gotta ask you this.

331
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,840
How much of your thought process when 
you make something is worrying about how

332
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:44,320
it's going to be received or or dealing 
with the people that don't like it?

333
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,080
Lately?
Not Anymore.

334
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,923
About about either,
but sooner or later there's a factor of 

335
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,280
wanting to see because that has to do 
with whether the thing makes money or it

336
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,114
goes at the box office.
How something makes money is completely 

337
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,220
different now.
You never counting on like,

338
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,083
oh,
people will come out and see it in a 

339
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:04,550
theater and shit like that.
Um,

340
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,384
you know,
there's a bunch of different revenue 

341
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:09,860
streams at this point and stuff thanks 
to the digital age,

342
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,120
but at that point when I'm making it,
you know,

343
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,271
of course you think,
hey,

344
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:16,420
somebody going to see it.
It's not like you're doing it in a,

345
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,420
in a,
you know,

346
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,020
kind of like an abyss and nobody's there
for you or something like that.

347
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,510
But at the same time,
you know,

348
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,250
you're,
when it's all done,

349
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,800
just stupid questions.
Like,

350
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,990
what do you know?
Uh,

351
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,260
what do you want the poster to look 
like?

352
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,040
Dictates a commercial thought,
you know,

353
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,874
I can't say like,
I never think about that shit because 

354
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,950
sooner or later somebody is going to ask
me a question that I have to,

355
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,611
you know,
where the like,

356
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:41,444
hey man,
we get it.

357
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,870
You may get it for you,
but you did take a few million bucks.

358
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,480
Like how do we sell this shit?
I don't get our money back.

359
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:48,920
You know,
so you know,

360
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,750
then you,
that's when you start going,

361
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,960
okay,
how do we get it to the right audience,

362
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:54,794
know more like how do we tailor it or 
how do we fucking trick him into seeing 

363
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,460
and,
or something like that.

364
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,790
Like put it on front street and then 
dealing with the fallout.

365
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,160
Yeah.
I used to have to deal with a lot more.

366
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:08,360
I used to choose to deal with it a lot 
more and now it's just like I'm 46.

367
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,203
I don't know what to tell you.
Like there was a person who came to one 

368
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:15,050
of the screenings on the road.
We had the screening at fuck,

369
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:15,884
I forget where we were,
I want to say New Orleans and of Yoga 

370
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,790
hosers I was doing q and a afterwards 
and you know,

371
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,860
everyone's getting up and like,
oh,

372
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:22,970
it's fun,
it's fucking stupid.

373
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,560
And asking questions and then one guy 
gets up and he is like tight dude.

374
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:30,220
He's very serious and he's just like,
uh,

375
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,123
okay.
You told the big long story before that 

376
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,290
movie began.
There was a big intro for the movement,

377
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,880
began to like an hour long story of how 
we got there.

378
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,133
And he goes,
that story did not match the movie I 

379
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,470
just watched.
And I said,

380
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,640
no.
And he goes,

381
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,380
not at all.
And he goes,

382
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,080
why did you make that movie?
He's gone.

383
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,320
I found that unwatchable and everyone in
the audience has gone.

384
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,250
Oh.
And I was like,

385
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:53,084
no many,
he paid like he overpaid to see this 

386
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:58,010
movie if I'm sitting here talking.
So yeah,

387
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:00,020
let him say what he wants and I'm a big 
boy and fine.

388
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,543
And so he goes,
I just don't think you ever should have 

389
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:03,680
made it.
It's terrible.

390
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,581
And I said,
well,

391
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,110
you understand that subjective,
right?

392
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:09,680
Like you're surrounded by a bunch of 
people that feel like the opposite way.

393
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,110
So you know,
when people were applauding and shit.

394
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,740
And then some guy behind him in line 
jumps in front of the mic and goes,

395
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,060
you want me to kick his ass?
And I was like,

396
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,740
Oh fuck no.
I was like,

397
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,843
everyone's entitled to their opinion,
but his opinion is I never should have 

398
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,510
done this.
And you know,

399
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,360
my answer to that is like,
that's ridiculous.

400
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,040
Like if I wanted to make it,
like that's the only reason we're here,

401
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,950
I just want to see it.
Like you can choose not to see it.

402
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,440
And in this instance I'm really sorry 
that you didn't,

403
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:37,274
our tastes didn't coincide,
but every time I go to do one of these 

404
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:40,550
things,
I do it the same way,

405
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,620
whether it was clerks have to the most 
recent one,

406
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,813
I just make the movie I want to see and 
hopefully others like it and sometimes 

407
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,110
they do.
And that's amazing.

408
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,350
It feels great and you're like,
Holy Shit,

409
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,184
my fingers on the pulse

410
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,190
and sometimes you're fucking alone,
but at least you're like,

411
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:55,320
I'm happy with the thing that I made.
I said,

412
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:58,170
but I feel heartbroken that you came out
here looking for something I didn't give

413
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,004
you.
So I said I'm going to give you your 

414
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:02,040
money back.
And I gave him 40 bucks and I was like,

415
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,950
put it on the,
there's like a riser speaker.

416
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,780
And he goes,
I don't want that.

417
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,561
And I was like,
no man.

418
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,181
Honestly,
it take,

419
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,014
it's not a trick,
it's not like Jason Who's going to come 

420
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,850
out and hit you with a hammer,
just take it like I feel bad.

421
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:14,080
I want you to have a good time and shit 
like that.

422
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:14,491
And he goes,
no,

423
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,840
I don't want that.
And I was like,

424
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,280
dude,
it makes for an excellent story.

425
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,690
Like I told him his movie fucking blue 
to his face and I fucking took his money

426
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:22,890
and walked out and he goes,
no.

427
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,400
And he went and sat down and crossed his
arms and just stayed there for another,

428
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,234
like half hour during the q and a.
So for him it was worth the 40 bucks 

429
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:30,744
just like I'm going to visual verbal,
just sit here and fucking hate on this 

430
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,210
and let you know and then sit down 
again.

431
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,590
So you know,
you deal with that.

432
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,740
But that's the memorable one because 
that never happens.

433
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,100
Generally speaking,
like when we toured the movie,

434
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,170
you're touring and you're in a safe 
zone.

435
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,810
It's like going out and doing a club 
night.

436
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:52,260
It's like people there are there because
they love you.

437
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:56,820
They're not going to wonder if this 
fucking tween sausage movie is for me,

438
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,880
like they're already dialed in on some 
part of the journey,

439
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,241
like,
oh,

440
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,300
I've loved task,
or have been with him since clerks or so

441
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,190
forth and so on.
I feel like I'm rambling.

442
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,060
Let's talk about.
No,

443
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,290
no,
you're not rambling at all.

444
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,470
It's interesting because the 
relationship that you have to the people

445
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,760
that buy your stuff is very direct.
You know,

446
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,530
I mean,
you also have a podcast,

447
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,364
so you talk about things in a pretty 
open and honest way like this and you 

448
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,520
know,
you expressed vulnerability,

449
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,653
which,
uh,

450
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,260
makes people super uncomfortable that 
your experience,

451
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,000
not,
not,

452
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,833
it doesn't make me uncomfortable,
but in the world and just tell people 

453
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,051
like,
oh,

454
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:36,690
I fucked up and I'm stupid,
or fat or my small.

455
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:37,411
They're like,
hey man,

456
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,460
hey,
that's too much.

457
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,550
But I think there's,
there's two factions.

458
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,190
There's one faction that that enjoys it.
And they go,

459
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,660
Hey,
Kevin Smith is just like me.

460
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,530
He's kind of fucked up just like I am.
Nobody ever gets it together.

461
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,950
And then there's like,
there's the facts.

462
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,530
And like God,
I wish she was like,

463
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,960
will Smith Will Smith just seems to have
his shit together.

464
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,883
Always like will smith just keeps 
knocking it out of the only reasons 

465
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,843
because we share that last name.
That's why there's an expectation 

466
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,720
connecting with a guy who never failed.
Anyone I've talked to says you should be

467
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,430
more like will smith had never failed 
guy like name and time.

468
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,310
Wilson?
Yes.

469
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,091
Look,
I'm with you.

470
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,270
Generally speaking,
he always gets jiggy with it,

471
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,960
but there have been,
there have been moments where he too,

472
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,940
you know,
we saw him be mortal.

473
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,923
Wild.
Wild West was one of the first ones to 

474
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,030
tiny,
but they still got to a point,

475
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,760
but there've been a couple of flicks 
recently,

476
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:36,594
including the one he did with his kid.
He got punished for making a movie with 

477
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,500
this kid as well and he's raising those 
kids in a real interesting way.

478
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,960
That's where,
that's where he gets most of his flag.

479
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,070
His son,
his

480
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,520
son's all about star dust and shit.
His daughters not that far off.

481
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,181
Really?
Yeah.

482
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,400
They're both.
They're both really creative kids,

483
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:59,401
but they have been raised in a world 
level much different than the world that

484
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,630
most people are raised and nothing wrong
with that,

485
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:04,090
but it's produced very interesting 
results.

486
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,800
Yeah,
and it's when you're.

487
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,720
If you're,
I guess if you had that sheltered,

488
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:10,390
like your data,
some super movie star type character,

489
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,224
your transition to regular,
ordinary adulthood has probably like 

490
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,780
super confusing.
I got,

491
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,880
I got one kid and I'm not fucking will 
smith by any stretch of the imagination.

492
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,714
I ain't even fucking Joe Rogan,
which is not saying you ain't will 

493
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,080
smith,
but that's a kind of.

494
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,200
It's so.
But I got,

495
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:29,601
you know,
I've,

496
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:30,434
I've done some shifts and some people 
know me and stuff and I got a kid and I 

497
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:39,340
was talking to her recently and it came 
out that she was like,

498
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,650
well it's,
yeah,

499
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,060
it can be hard to be your daughter.

500
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,980
And I was like,
what are you talking about?

501
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,780
I was like,
I put you in things.

502
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:48,130
I'm Megan and stuff.
And she goes,

503
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:48,911
no,
it's not the.

504
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:49,744
You make it hard.
It's that there's this expectation like 

505
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,450
you did something and now if I don't do 
something,

506
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,370
what the fuck?
And I'm like,

507
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,570
oh,
don't worry about that.

508
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,404
I said,
no,

509
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,280
I did one thing like 22 fucking years 
ago and,

510
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,370
and that's,
that's it.

511
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,233
Like all you have to do is find one 
tricky can take your whole life if you 

512
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:06,844
need to.
But I said nobody expects you to be me 

513
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:09,004
and this is a common theme.
But like I've had a moment like this 

514
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,244
before once with like Scott Mosier,
the guy that I do smart cast with and I 

515
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:21,040
made like all the early flicks with 
like,

516
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,020
he would always say,
it's tough to live in your shadow.

517
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,501
And I was like,
what?

518
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,000
Shadow?
We make everything together.

519
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,160
And he goes,
well we make your stuff.

520
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,560
And every time I think about going to 
make something,

521
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,200
I got to compare it to the shit that we 
made together.

522
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,360
And it makes me go,
well maybe I'm not ready to try it.

523
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:34,961
And I was like,
well I'm,

524
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:35,890
that's not my fault.
He's like,

525
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,230
I'm not saying it's your fault,
it's just tough to,

526
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,590
to live in your shadow and you know,
I thought maybe that was his thing years

527
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,870
later,
the same shit from my wife.

528
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,570
She's like,
it's just tough to live in your shadow.

529
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,750
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

530
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,340
We don't even do the same things.
And she's like,

531
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,090
but I can't even think about doing 
things now without thinking,

532
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,733
well he's kind of done something like 
that or is it going to be compared to 

533
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:58,900
something he does and I'm like,
you're already your mind.

534
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,770
Everything I do fails and nobody ever 
holds it as a high watermark.

535
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:03,604
So it's not like they would hold you to 
some same high standard that they don't 

536
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:07,654
even hold me too.
So there's a bit of that man now my kid 

537
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:14,680
is echoing in a little bit where through
no fault of my own,

538
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,360
not like I've created this,
you know,

539
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,610
like live up to my standard.
I'm like,

540
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,930
everyone do what you want,
man.

541
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,700
Even with the kid,
I've never talked to her like a kid.

542
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:25,000
I've always talked to her like an adult,
but now even my kid is just like,

543
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,133
yeah,
it makes it tough to go do something 

544
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,370
because of you and it's not like you did
it but you do a lot and,

545
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,760
and there's a high bar and I'm like,
ain't got you.

546
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,030
It makes me feel bad.
It makes me go like,

547
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:37,630
alright,
do less.

548
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,970
But then like I got one life.
You know what I'm saying?

549
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:42,520
Like I got to accomplish a lot before my
man died.

550
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,354
60 seven.
Like I don't know how long I'm going to 

551
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:45,974
live,
but I want to accomplish as much as I 

552
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,594
can and create and do shit and 
experience things and enjoy your time 

553
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,660
here.
It's like,

554
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,350
and I don't want to take away from all 
these other people's time.

555
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,230
You know what I'm saying?
I want her to enjoy her time and my wife

556
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,840
to enjoy her time and Scott to enjoy his
time.

557
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:03,350
But the sad fact of the matter is in 
order for you to rise,

558
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,070
usually someone in your life falls and 
it's not a precipitous like,

559
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,600
oh,
I've fucking broken.

560
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:12,290
But they can't be rising like you when 
they're helping you build your shit.

561
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,530
That's something I had to learn to deal 
with way early on in my career.

562
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,480
I used to take advantage of people and 
not in the way of like,

563
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,850
well I'm trying to take advantage of 
you,

564
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:20,900
but I was like,
oh,

565
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,570
we're just working on my thing because 
what else would we be working on?

566
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,404
And Hey,
isn't this all great that we're working 

567
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,054
period and stuff and you forget that not
everybody started wanting to do your 

568
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,220
thing.
Like Scott's whole thing was,

569
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,443
you know,
I didn't go to film school to become a 

570
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:34,094
producer of your movies.
I went to film school to write and 

571
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,480
direct and I've been having a great time
doing your stuff,

572
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:39,314
but that meant 10 years of me not even 
trying to do the thing that I went to 

573
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,150
keystone.
So it's a weird feeling.

574
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,600
Men especially because I never really 
feel successful.

575
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:48,500
I've never like,
well,

576
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,710
I understand what I understand.
I cast a wide shadow,

577
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,900
but I don't think it's a very long 
shadow because I'm like,

578
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,910
there is no high bar here.
Kids,

579
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,810
there's a high bar and as much as like,
you know,

580
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,360
a smuggler,
but there's no like,

581
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,523
well he made the Matrix motherfucker 
like how you're going to be the kid or 

582
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:03,944
the guy who made the matrix or,
or the ladies that made the matrix now 

583
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,500
like,
that would be tough.

584
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:12,140
I imagined growing up their kids like,
Amen your,

585
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,040
your parents made the matrix like,
yeah.

586
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,680
Hey,
let me ask you this because you probably

587
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,514
wouldn't know the answer to this before 
we get back to the subject because the 

588
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:20,110
subject is really important.
Obviously I'm using you like a therapist

589
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:22,420
and whatever the fucking happened to 
that lawsuit.

590
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,680
Remember there was a lady who wrote a 
book and she said that she had submitted

591
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:27,514
that book to those brothers that made 
the matrix and that is the exact same 

592
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:31,890
story.
And then it,

593
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:32,990
uh,
it went to court.

594
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,510
It did go to court.
Yeah,

595
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,290
it did go to court.
It's really interesting how similarities

596
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,390
between remember road in the actual 
thing.

597
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,340
I don't remember because it was quite a 
few years ago,

598
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,540
but I thought maybe you would,
you would know about this.

599
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,900
Snopes says it's false.
Snopes is a Hillary Clinton.

600
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:50,630
She'll organization.
They call the white man town.

601
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,480
I'll get political man.
This is the one place people should run.

602
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,000
It's not even real.
It's not real.

603
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,200
It's saw your instagram posts on 
election day.

604
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,000
Were you.
What happened?

605
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,460
It was a picture of the results.
Yeah.

606
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,623
I think that might've been the place 
where I actually learned about the 

607
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:09,700
results because I enjoy chaos to a 
certain extent.

608
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,250
So I'm looking forward to this.
I really am.

609
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,143
I wouldn't be living at times is that I 
would not have been interested in 

610
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,070
Hillary Clinton doing the same goddamn 
thing that she's been doing.

611
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,400
I just,
I don't,

612
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,390
I'm not a big fan of how he behaves as a
human.

613
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,180
What's up?
It's not false that uh,

614
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,940
it's false.
It's false that she won the,

615
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,230
the large judgement in 2005.
There was a case,

616
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:37,470
there was a court case and she,
I guess she never showed up to court for

617
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,790
her,
were a illuminary hearing.

618
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Maybe because she was in the matrix.
Maybe they paid her,

619
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,220
disconnected her,
and she was fucking trapped and shit.

620
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,560
She saw cat on the way there twice and 
she was like,

621
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,770
fuck,
it's entirely possible that she just got

622
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:52,590
paid.
That's the other option.

623
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,580
Like,
you know,

624
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,683
what was she,
how much was she necessarily what she 

625
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:58,980
like,
I want half or she'll give me 50 grand.

626
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:03,020
I'll go away and make a good question.
But the Matrix obviously is a pretty God

627
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:03,854
damn big movie.
Apparently her story was remarkably 

628
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:06,864
close.
I mean I look and I'm not taking 

629
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:09,474
anything away from them or her,
but you know like they're archetypal 

630
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,500
story and that movie is brilliant of 
course,

631
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,210
but it's like nobody can really go like,
well,

632
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,260
I've never seen anything like that 
before.

633
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,560
I mean it is Kinda like go to the Bible.
It's a Jesus story on some level,

634
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,370
right?
Like,

635
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,960
yeah,
messianic in nature,

636
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:31,440
but if you're talking about boogers or 
in big batteries,

637
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,410
that power of fucking machine that we're
all in and plugs in our head,

638
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,840
then it gets very,
very close and that even.

639
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,673
But even that concept,
that of of one day we're going to live 

640
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:44,070
in some sort of a virtual reality that 
that's not new concepts.

641
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,600
Concepts and explored like you remember,
have you watched?

642
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,730
Are you watching westworld?
Oh yeah.

643
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,783
That's,
that is discussing that very subject 

644
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,120
while being vastly entertaining and 
you're like,

645
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,740
oh my God,
this is a great idea.

646
00:27:58,741 --> 00:27:59,574
But also they are going into the idea of
consciousness and there are a few times 

647
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,890
as you watched that show,
not where you're like,

648
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,180
are we in someone's fucking game?
But you start sitting there,

649
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,014
gone.
Everything we know about what we 

650
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,594
understand to be reality except to be 
reality is a social contract in many 

651
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:21,660
ways like ideas and thoughts that we all
agree on and stuff about what is real,

652
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:25,140
what is important.
Like that's why when you meet people who

653
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:27,620
are like,
don't want to have kids,

654
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:29,550
you know,
some people like that's fucking weird.

655
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,383
It's like no,
their reality is kids are not a part of 

656
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,360
the reality.
Never were like,

657
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,670
it's just not in them.
And stuff like that.

658
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,470
Um,
I think,

659
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,910
I think,
you know,

660
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:41,220
this year with the election we've seen 
literally,

661
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,054
we've seen reality challenged.
The thing that we all understood to be 

662
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,390
apparently was not.
And now,

663
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,520
you know,
things are vastly different.

664
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,800
Um,
I don't know where I'm going with that.

665
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,050
Saved me.
It's just,

666
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,003
it's just the,
the unique thing about it is that we 

667
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,353
have been living under this illusion 
that it either had to be one of these 

668
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,364
people,
like a Democrat or one of these people 

669
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,273
are Republican and that these people are
politicians and these are the people 

670
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,650
that one presidencies I think,
you know,

671
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,963
I don't want us,
there's a faction out there and I don't 

672
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,334
want to,
we should really just stay away from 

673
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:20,400
this.
But I will look,

674
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:23,340
I'm a guy always tries to find the 
silver lining to a situation.

675
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,743
So I did not vote for this president,
but I did not campaign against this 

676
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:28,840
president and stuff,
you know,

677
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,253
one another way didn't work out.
So not the first election where I voted 

678
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:37,320
for somebody that did not win that spot.
Being the person I'm out,

679
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,700
you know,
I'm not gonna sit there and be like,

680
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,330
fuck the next four years.
Like,

681
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,140
no,
like,

682
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,100
you know,
I've lived

683
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,130
through presidencies that I didn't agree
with and things work out.

684
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,540
I hope that it's going to work out this 
time,

685
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:51,541
but this is what I'll say.
It's new.

686
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,283
We might see,
and I'm not saying burn it all down and 

687
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:56,554
see what happens,
but we've had how many years of of two 

688
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:00,760
party system essentially where it's 
like,

689
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,410
yeah,
there's lip service to a Green Party and

690
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:06,190
lip service to another party,
but we for all intensive purposes,

691
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,740
I mean I know it was claimed by the 
Republican Party,

692
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:09,574
but we saw a huge upset.
Have a third party candidate could 

693
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,740
happens once.
They didn't want him in.

694
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,400
If it happens once,
that means it could happen again.

695
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,260
There's not a new model.
There's a new path.

696
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,960
He was always a Democrat his whole life.
That's what I thought.

697
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,720
Yeah.
He was fine because I grew up in jersey,

698
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:29,950
so I was very familiar with the man and 
his work throughout my life and stuff.

699
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,020
He was a prominent figure in the press,
always,

700
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:32,854
always.
He always seemed very liberal leaning 

701
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,430
and democratic.
Well,

702
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:37,264
what he did is essentially,
and he played a certain group of people 

703
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:42,904
in this country and he got to this 
ultimate position and power and we're 

704
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:49,000
not sure.
I mean look at 70 years old,

705
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,983
you don't think he's a crafty guy.
Like he's probably pretty good at 

706
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,890
getting people to like him as a certain 
person who he really is like,

707
00:30:58,891 --> 00:30:59,724
I think you probably got to get to know 
him to find out who the fuck he really 

708
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,090
is,
but also feel like to some degree it's.

709
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:05,590
And I'm not taking anything away from 
him,

710
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:09,550
but anybody could have just popped up 
and been like,

711
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,580
I'm the other person.
I'm not her,

712
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,133
not him.
She carries so much baggage and that's 

713
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,674
the thing too.
And they were asking and essentially 

714
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,390
Democratic Party was going,
come on America,

715
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,010
let's vote a woman in.

716
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,760
Come on like,
we just had the black president.

717
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,220
That was amazing.
Let's have a woman president.

718
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:28,054
And I think if they'd gone with almost 
any other candidate that didn't have as 

719
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:33,310
much baggage,
it'd be a different story.

720
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,144
But they were asking you to like 
somebody who I didn't have an issue 

721
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,890
with,
but a lot of people got a big issue.

722
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,920
If she was a man that it would be a 
giant problem,

723
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,440
but we gave her or what do you mean?
Well,

724
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,300
if she had all those problems,
if she,

725
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:48,940
you know,
all the shit.

726
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,200
I mean we saw a guy with a lot of 
problems,

727
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,693
but I'm saying if he was,
she was a man and she was up against 

728
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:59,080
trump and she had all those problems 
just crushed.

729
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:01,540
You have no chance.
But because she was a woman,

730
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,730
oh you think she got further because Oh,
100 percent.

731
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,490
And it was a lot of people that will see
as well.

732
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,353
They wanted to make history.
They wanted to make history because 

733
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,820
look,
from a social standpoint,

734
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,893
Barack Obama was very important because 
here was a super articulate guy who's 

735
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:17,890
really calm and he just,
he has a very,

736
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,420
even a presence about him always.
He never seen riled up.

737
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,750
You never see him crazy.
Even like he gets heckled.

738
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,790
You can just see that thing with a trump
supporter was heckling him.

739
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:31,450
And he handled it with Grace Hill,
said graceful God.

740
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,130
It's like probably the best way to 
describe them,

741
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,493
you know,
like that was important for the country 

742
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,560
because that represented like,
wow,

743
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,130
hey,

744
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,050
here's this black guy who's super 
articulate and so calm.

745
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:49,850
And so like the way he expresses himself
is so perfect for a president.

746
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,713
So presidential.
Like there's a what a what a perfect 

747
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,830
example for our country.
This is us.

748
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,173
And then I think a lot of people felt 
like Hillary Clinton would be another 

749
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,060
one of those things.
Like,

750
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,040
look,
we can have a woman running.

751
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,410
Things were not sexist.
Like,

752
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:09,530
look we look,
we are a really articulate,

753
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,423
incredibly well experienced woman who's 
been in business for a long time with 

754
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:18,380
the government.
She's deep inside the public service and

755
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,150
she was a teenager.
Yes,

756
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,010
but it was just too much.
It was just too much shit for people.

757
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,210
But I think if that was a man and she 
had all those same problems,

758
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,044
it was a man and tied to some foundation
that was getting all these people that 

759
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:38,510
eventually got arms deals and they 
donated and the.

760
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,440
They're all part of this weird sort of 
incestuous political world.

761
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,363
A man would be skewered with that same 
record because trump was running as an 

762
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,860
outsider,
you know,

763
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,694
what he had going against him as he's 
borish and he says ridiculous shit and 

764
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:54,524
you know,
they could,

765
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,393
they could point to that,
that recording of him talking about 

766
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,300
grabbing pussies and they'll like,
look,

767
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,200
look,
look who we have here like that.

768
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,333
That was the big thing against him,
but at least to these people that hate 

769
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:08,990
the system,
he was an outsider.

770
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,290
If she was a man,
she would've represented even more of an

771
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,440
insider,
you know,

772
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,320
I think to a lot of people,
I think her,

773
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,560
her actions and what she's done in the 
past versus her as a woman.

774
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,883
That was like sort of a situation there 
because like you ever seen the video 

775
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:26,840
where she was talking about a Kadafi 
being killed.

776
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,980
No crazy video man,
because she's joking around.

777
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,620
It's before they interview her and she 
goes,

778
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,840
was like before the official interview 
starts.

779
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:36,674
Like she.
Yeah,

780
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,383
she had just found out that Kadafi had 
been killed and she was like laughing 

781
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,110
about it.
She goes,

782
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:42,944
we came,
we saw he died and she throws her head 

783
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:49,970
back and she's laughing.
She was kind of hawkish.

784
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,110
She was hawkish.
If that was a guy,

785
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,063
if a guy did that,
he would have been thought to be a 

786
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:00,200
fucking serial killer.
A sociopath.

787
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,030
Right?
If a guy did that,

788
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,580
like say if Joe Biden,
like we came,

789
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:08,600
we saw he died.
People would be like,

790
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,930
do you want that guy in charge of the 
fucking news?

791
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,630
But we let her go.
We'll give her a pass.

792
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,210
There's a lot of stuff that she's done 
where people give her a pass.

793
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,590
They put a more interesting cat and 
charge of the duke's.

794
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,850
Oh,
there should be no president.

795
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,620
This is what I say.
Everybody's like,

796
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:25,454
well,
who would you think should be the 

797
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:28,780
president if you have a problem with 
trump or if your problem,

798
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,040
no human being should be in control of 
$350,

799
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,380
million human beings.
It's a postural job.

800
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,010
Explain this this way.

801
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,690
Too many of us.
It's in the hospital.

802
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,030
Would it be done?
Can we don't have to do it this way?

803
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:45,360
The world is the idea.
I don't have one,

804
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,540
but we can't have an Alpha channel 
figured out right here were smart.

805
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,100
The Internet.
What about,

806
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,680
what about education?
The Internet mind reading.

807
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,620
Well,
essentially it as it come down to a.

808
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,720
What was the.
Was that movie with the girl?

809
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,130
Shoots,
bows and arrows and shit.

810
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,290
Oh,
a hunger games or games.

811
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,310
Can we district the country and then 
there are heads of district or.

812
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,810
Same thing.
We'll go to war with each other.

813
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,130
Your App can't do that.
All right,

814
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:08,964
so that's gone.
This is the think tech is eating every 

815
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,340
idea to get there.
That was one.

816
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,470
States are problematic.
So then once people like,

817
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:18,390
Fuck Utah,
this is Texas Sun.

818
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,710
That's true.
Yes.

819
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,603
I grew up in New Jersey and New York 
hated us and fucking everybody hates 

820
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:23,400
everybody.

821
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,080
Hated bonds.
The Banya Oh yeah,

822
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:27,000
you hated Pennsylvania.
New York hated Boston.

823
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,660
Connecticut got a pass.
Okay.

824
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,660
So it was like some little kid with a 
limp,

825
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,640
like Ah,
don't pick on.

826
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,830
Say Connecticut doesn't get mentioned in
the tri state area.

827
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:36,900
Whenever the graph shows,
that would be like New York,

828
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:37,920
New Jersey,
Pennsylvania.

829
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,880
Exactly.
I didn't know.

830
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,803
I thought Connecticut was New Hampshire,
Ohio and years and years like 

831
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:45,750
Connecticut is a highway to highway 
between Boston and New York,

832
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,060
but we can like a poet.
Connecticut's I will everyone connect.

833
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:49,110
It's like,
fuck you.

834
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,280
They are like,
fuck you,

835
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,310
but you know what I'm talking about this
bitch.

836
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,700
You know I'm right.
All right.

837
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,790
Wait no states because we war with each 
other.

838
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,330
Yeah.
Can you something?

839
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,680
Somebody has to govern?
No.

840
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,670
They have to be policed and shit like 
that.

841
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,623
I think the best way to probably handle 
it is let every human being have a say 

842
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,253
every human being that's of adult age 
and I think registering to vote should 

843
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,350
be just as fucking easy as getting an 
email.

844
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,400
It should be just as easy as doing 
everything else that you do online.

845
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,590
You had a twitter handle,
you should be able to vote.

846
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,920
You should be able to use your id,
like whatever,

847
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,500
whoever you are,
whatever your name is,

848
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,730
you know,
call yourself.

849
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,000
Who are the fuck you want.
That is one individual vote.

850
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,163
That's what I think and I think as long 
as we could figure out how to make that 

851
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,820
system pure or people can't hack it,
do it.

852
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,830
He can't log in from 15 different 
computers.

853
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:41,664
If you have a fucking birth certificate 
and your birth certificate aligns with 

854
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:47,760
this number and that's this and this is 
you,

855
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,490
as long as they could figure out how to 
make it so people don't hack into it.

856
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,503
Everybody who was an adult should be 
allowed to vote for the we've gone to 

857
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,210
jail.
I think people that have gone to jail,

858
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:58,044
the idea that someone goes to jail for 
four years and now they can't vote for 

859
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:00,924
the rest of their life.

860
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,660
I think that's fucking crazy too.
That's ridiculous.

861
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,650
You pay your debt to society back and 
you should be able to reenter society.

862
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,533
Exactly.
You telling me you can't be a 20 year 

863
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:10,674
old and do something stupid and rob 
somebody or something and then I'm 

864
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,560
supposed to think of you a certain way 
for the rest of your life.

865
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,170
You're 80 now.
You Rob Somebody when you were 20.

866
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,423
That's still you.
Dangerous men talk about tear down 

867
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,010
institutions,
but institutions are a problem no matter

868
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,720
what.
There are always a problem.

869
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,660
I think the real issue is government,
right?

870
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,523
Governing us,
so the real issue is what everybody 

871
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,490
wants is safety,

872
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,800
security,
protection,

873
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,570
and unity.
That's what everybody wants.

874
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,733
All the other stuff.
In terms of restrictions on your 

875
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:46,420
behavior,
we have to just figure it out.

876
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:47,254
Cut it down.
The middle between hurts other people 

877
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,593
and hurts yourself and hurt yourself.
You're on your own just like you're on 

878
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:56,230
your own with rock climbing,
just like you're on your own with bungee

879
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:57,090
jumping.
So wait,

880
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,870
give me an example.
Bmx Riding,

881
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,223
you're your role as a hobby.
Drone in high school they'd call them 

882
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:04,890
elective.
Yeah.

883
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,873
Yeah.
How come you could just go to the roof 

884
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,470
and jump off,
but you can't do heroin like no one will

885
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:12,304
stop you.
You can go to your roof and practice 

886
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:14,590
backflip.
Megan.

887
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,360
So much fun.
I'm ready to boot,

888
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:18,490
dude.
I'm ready to fucking jacket needle in my

889
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:19,960
12.
Gauge it right now.

890
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,440
You have people tickets telling other 
people what to do.

891
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,230
You've got a tyranny.
You got a fucking problem,

892
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,093
even if even if they sort of can get 
away with it because it's written down 

893
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,690
on paper.
Did you agree to it?

894
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,830
No.
You weren't.

895
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:36,100
Nobody asked you about like child labor 
laws.

896
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:36,370
You've,
uh,

897
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,360
you've never.
No one's,

898
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,790
no one's pulled you aside and saying 
that for years,

899
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,760
since I was a child,
no one pulled you aside and decided,

900
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:43,150
well,
you know,

901
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,983
you and you,
you have decided with them how old you 

902
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:48,000
should be when you drink.
No,

903
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,110
it's already been done.
It's all.

904
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,183
Most people don't have a say.
It's all written down somewhere and the 

905
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,144
amount of people that vote versus the 
amount of people that are affected by 

906
00:39:57,131 --> 00:40:00,910
that vote completely disproportionate.
It's fairly weird,

907
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,020
man.
It's really weird.

908
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:07,021
We have a ton of systems that are set up
completely to do two things.

909
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,050
One,
to control people and to,

910
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,870
to ensure the survival of these systems.
And that's what bureaucracy is.

911
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,990
That's a giant problem with government.
Like the Dea.

912
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,853
The dea wants so badly to keep arresting
people for marijuana because if they 

913
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:23,470
don't,
they don't have to shut up.

914
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,304
I'm like,
I better not light is perfect timing 

915
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:27,190
again.
You and I are in sync.

916
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,420
Um,
what do you mean?

917
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:29,110
Why?
Why?

918
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,150
Because they have jobs.
They're jobs are going to go away.

919
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:32,770
There's no,
there's plenty of other drugs and it was

920
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,890
a small little 46 percent of all 
arrests.

921
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,883
They said what was the number of more 
people or arrested today or have been 

922
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:48,661
arrested today for marijuana than all 
other arrests combined?

923
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,200
You see we smoking man.
You want me to watching the door for the

924
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,610
next hour when I'm like,
what is that?

925
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,200
I heard a noise.
What are you doing?

926
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,590
But we live in the correct state right 
yet,

927
00:40:58,591 --> 00:40:59,700
right in telling me I'm right.
Well we're,

928
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,603
we live in.
If you're going to scare me then throw 

929
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,170
me of a dick.
Tickle a little bit.

930
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,240
Like tell me everything's going to be 
okay.

931
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,230
We're here.
Uh,

932
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,320
Washington state,
Oregon with the west coast since DC.

933
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,440
Large Smoking section,
Washington DC and Boston.

934
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,460
Now Massachusetts and state Florida is 
as medical medical,

935
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:23,560
legal bunch of medical step though for 
Florida.

936
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,240
What are the other legal state?
Alaska.

937
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,590
Alaska is legal.
Fuck.

938
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:27,424
Yeah.
Alaska,

939
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,060
so are gangsters to the north.
Do you believe the love Alaska Dj?

940
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,210
Do you believe the theory that as goes 
California,

941
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,044
so goes the union,
like for years they said if California 

942
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:43,560
goes legal,
there you go.

943
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,460
Go.
Ah,

944
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,323
that's interesting.
I think there's going to be states that 

945
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,240
resisted still.
There's guys like that Jeff,

946
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,220
Jeff sessions guy who's coming into the 
office with trump who's,

947
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,083
who could be an issue,
but I don't think it will be because I 

948
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:58,550
think trump as a businessperson,
he's a businessperson.

949
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,730
He's not just a business person.
He's a populist,

950
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:01,330
right?
He's gonna.

951
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,130
He's gonna want people to like them and 
you know,

952
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,680
and it doesn't make sense.
It's not a logical move.

953
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,470
You know,
it's weird as he is,

954
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,333
he's not illogical.
Like Hillary Clinton was illogical and 

955
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,330
this is why I say that,
and people like [inaudible],

956
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,120
I got a lot of shit from people that are
like super pro Hashtag.

957
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:18,070
I'm with her and I'm like,
look man,

958
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,970
she didn't support gay marriage until 
2013.

959
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,690
Do you know how crazy that is?
Until 2013,

960
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:29,830
Hillary Clinton was saying that she 
believed that marriage was between a man

961
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:30,664
and a woman.
It was a sacred union and it should be 

962
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:36,220
protected and so it's one of two things.
Either she actually believed that or she

963
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:39,760
was in bed with people who were forcing 
her to behave that way or say that,

964
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,960
or she thought that she had to say that 
in order to get elected or.

965
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,220
Well,
you're not getting to know.

966
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,010
No,
you can't.

967
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,630
You can't.
You can't be a part of that.

968
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:50,320
I attended

969
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,180
my first gay wedding in 1994 right 
before clerks came out.

970
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,610
My brother married his husband,
Jerry.

971
00:42:56,611 --> 00:43:00,910
There's still married to this day,
so they'd been married for 22 years,

972
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,160
which is like 108 years and straight 
people years.

973
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:03,994
Yeah man,
because it's the part of the going 

974
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:06,034
outside the box is like,
I don't have to live like the normies 

975
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:09,520
man.
I could just.

976
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,930
Yeah.
I can't even get you pregnant,

977
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:11,764
bitch Goggins I can.
I can roam this earth like fucking cane 

978
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:17,890
and come down.
But they've been committed to each other

979
00:43:17,891 --> 00:43:19,540
and been in a marriage for like a long,
long time.

980
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,940
And the best thing about that wedding,
like it was great,

981
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:23,470
number one,
seeing my brother happy and,

982
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,300
and,
and get married and stuff,

983
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:29,500
but like a part of the wedding when the 
shit gets slow and you're like,

984
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:30,910
Oh man,
let's get outta here.

985
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,570
Yeah.

986
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,030
You know,
and it's just middle midway.

987
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:36,370
Once everyone's toasts,
everybody that dances beginning,

988
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:40,750
that's not for everybody.
A drag show started like all of a sudden

989
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:45,430
donna summer and Diana Ross came down 
staircase and it wasn't a real thing,

990
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:46,264
but boy they fucking looked at and put 
on a huge town and my father was still 

991
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:53,350
alive and he just had a heart attack at 
that point or a couple heart attacks.

992
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,650
Stroke as well to architects in a couple
of strokes.

993
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,950
So he walked with a cane and one of his 
hands is like a Bob Dole,

994
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:02,920
like just kind of hanging there and 
stuff like that.

995
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,503
So him and my mom are at this Gig at my 
brother's wedding and there we are like 

996
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,950
on the dance floor watching the,
uh,

997
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,083
the drag show and you know,
the performers or lip sinking like 

998
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,720
famous songs.
And my mom was,

999
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,940
she had a lot of drinks,
dinner.

1000
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,310
My mom is like fucking bug in and she's 
got like,

1001
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,144
you know,
extra fucking weight like every Smith 

1002
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,241
and so,
you know,

1003
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:29,074
she's,
she jiggling here and there and stuff 

1004
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:31,680
like that.
And her sleeveless dress.

1005
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,013
My old man was dressed in a suit that 
didn't fucking match is put it together 

1006
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:41,451
and shit like that,
but he had his hand on my mom's back and

1007
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,260
with his weekend was kind of leaning on 
the camera using her more for stability.

1008
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,440
So his hands on her back while she's 
dancing and stuff.

1009
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,210
And I watched,
you know,

1010
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,044
I'm standing right behind him.
I watched through the course of the 

1011
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:54,714
fucking Song Mall Man's hands slide down
my mom's back then spin in a pretty 

1012
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:04,900
fluid motion for God,
a couple of strokes and go right for the

1013
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,030
last cup and not

1014
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,143
dive deep

1015
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,710
spelunking for gold.
He went right inside a cup.

1016
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,600
It like this shit's minds,
Christ and,

1017
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:18,580
and I will never forget that.
I told my brother,

1018
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:19,620
I was like,
my God,

1019
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:23,010
like you don't realize that it's never 
going to happen in any other wedding,

1020
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,350
but yours man.
Like my father was just like,

1021
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:28,180
I'm free motherfucker.
And he started grabbing my owl,

1022
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,900
his wife,
my mother now they were married,

1023
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:32,280
so that's okay.
She wanted it.

1024
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,750
She invite him.
She was just like,

1025
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,970
she was a,
she was.

1026
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,420
I've had discussions with my mother 
since about that next.

1027
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:42,910
Now I'm a grown adult and talk to her 
about getting scooped tough course do.

1028
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:45,720
Of course I wouldn't want to leave this 
earth not knowing.

1029
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:46,291
It's like,
you know,

1030
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,530
I don't want to have a relationship with
my mother.

1031
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:50,070
I've had her on the podcast.
We're talking about shit,

1032
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,660
but I asked.
I was like,

1033
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,580
Dad,
you guys looked randy that night.

1034
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:54,630
Did you guys have sex?
She said,

1035
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:55,700
Oh yes.
And that was like

1036
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,470
randy.
Randy is a weird word.

1037
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,304
What if your name was randy?
Be All bummed out that people expect my 

1038
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,310
dad.
She's like,

1039
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,090
I feel randy all the time.
Nah,

1040
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,420
film in certain places,
others hold on bump.

1041
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,491
Uh,
where,

1042
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:12,930
where are we grabbing pussies?
President,

1043
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,760
president hops grabbing pussies.
Oh,

1044
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:17,600
uh,
people that aren't truthful,

1045
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:18,434
and this is like a,
another thing I want to say to people 

1046
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:24,330
that think that I hate Hillary Clinton 
will not leave the person alone.

1047
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:27,230
It's your show because this is what I,
that's not even a politics thing.

1048
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:31,290
It's a human thing.
I think we owe ourselves like as,

1049
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:36,291
as human beings to not accept like 
blatant lies.

1050
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,890
And I don't think it's good for her 
either.

1051
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,510
I don't think it's good for everybody.
I mean the,

1052
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:41,821
the,
the,

1053
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:42,654
the rob is supposed to be the ones who 
are in your sixties or something like 

1054
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:45,650
that,
that you're done.

1055
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,710
You're done developing.
You're done growing that.

1056
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,920
True.
I don't know.

1057
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:51,350
I don't think so.
I think you're alive if you're alive,

1058
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,540
you're a person,
but we have categories of people,

1059
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,280
right?
We have people that were 20.

1060
00:46:55,281 --> 00:46:55,881
Oh,
he's young,

1061
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:57,500
he's stupid.
He made a mistake.

1062
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,410
And then we have categories like in your
60.

1063
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,470
Oh,
you're never gonna.

1064
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,350
Learn anything.
You're,

1065
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:03,740
you're,
you're done developing.

1066
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,780
They're stubborn,
they're stuck in their ways,

1067
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,180
like let's just accept the fact that she
lies all the time.

1068
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,083
Right.
Like there's this video of when they 

1069
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:14,180
were talking about the emails and 
there's video of the director of the FBI

1070
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:15,014
talking versus her talking,
like she would say what the director 

1071
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:19,040
said and then he would say what he 
really said.

1072
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,053
It was ridiculous and it's just,
it's just like you see that she's being 

1073
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,090
dishonest.
That's not good for anybody.

1074
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:27,110
Mad.
It's so good for her.

1075
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,100
It's not good for us.
And I think for a person like her,

1076
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,413
this is probably just a system that 
she's been competing in forever and 

1077
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,293
that's how this system operates.
Makes sure she's really good at it and 

1078
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:39,724
she was a lawyer and she knows what you 
can say and what you can't say and how 

1079
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:43,804
you can kind of distort things to make 
them seem like they were better than 

1080
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:49,060
they were still talking about her at 
this point.

1081
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:49,650
Yeah.
Okay.

1082
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,230
Yeah,
because that sounds like him as well.

1083
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,610
All of them doing that.
When you do that,

1084
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,340
when you do that and we see that that's 
not good for us.

1085
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,740
If we say yes to that,
it's bad for us.

1086
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,900
It's bad for us as a culture.
No,

1087
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:05,530
it does not exist as a nation.
Just as a group of human beings.

1088
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,640
We're one person at a very high level is
supposed to be expressing for us.

1089
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,170
Like if you're going to be the person 
who's expressing things,

1090
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,640
that's impossible like exactly as you 
said at the beginning.

1091
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,830
Oh yeah.
But I mean it's.

1092
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:20,650
So then what's the.
Do you have a binary presidency?

1093
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,740
One President is who speaks for the.
For one half,

1094
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:25,090
one president speaks with the other 
hand.

1095
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:27,640
I don't think we should have resident 
marrying factions.

1096
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:28,474
I don't think we should have a unique 
individual or even a small group that 

1097
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,440
runs this thing.
I think it's done before we got here.

1098
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,303
Native apart from is it was done in 
small groups because everybody was a 

1099
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:41,950
small group.
There were tribes and at the end,

1100
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,813
even if you came over on a boat,
you came out in our boat with all those 

1101
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,090
other psychopaths that we're willing to 
hop across the ocean with you.

1102
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,920
How many could get on the boat?
A thousand.

1103
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,933
I mean,
what's the most amount of people they 

1104
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:55,180
had on like one of those boats.
Once you google that,

1105
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,740
like you got to really have a sense of 
adventure to get over here to be a crazy

1106
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:00,460
person.

1107
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,060
Right?
So it's all really hated small towns,

1108
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,070
small groups,
little villages.

1109
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,410
I mean that's essentially what we had 
representative government.

1110
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:11,890
The first place was because these guys 
in Utah couldn't really talk to the guys

1111
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:13,900
in DC,
like somebody had to talk for you.

1112
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,970
You're over there.
We'll take you months to get there.

1113
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,520
So they have to decide how the fucking 
thing runs.

1114
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:21,640
So you have to vote in your little spot 
and this guy sends his vote.

1115
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,300
One hundred and two passengers.
Jesus Christ,

1116
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,233
which watch one,
the mayflower hundred and two 

1117
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:29,110
passengers.
That's it.

1118
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,740
Half died.
The first we got 151 shit.

1119
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:39,670
Half died the first winter.
They fucking froze to death.

1120
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,563
Just think about that when you're like,
how come I can't fucking get Wifi and 

1121
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,700
the subway train God.
One hundred,

1122
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,320
two people sailed the ocean blue.
Oh my God.

1123
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,670
That it probably was back then.

1124
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,340
And then came here with an idea to fuck 
it up.

1125
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:53,070
Let's start America.
Yeah,

1126
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,820
imagine what the ocean was like back 
then.

1127
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,863
Probably amazing.
None of those little plastic bead 

1128
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:03,040
islands out in the middle of the year.
So I have to not only beautiful but very

1129
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,410
disturbing and birds choke on it and 
shit.

1130
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:06,244
I read an article that said that 
seagulls are birds in general are 

1131
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:11,410
attracted to the smell of plastic will 
be.

1132
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,363
Well,
I've read it something they're saying 

1133
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,023
because a lot of plastic has food on it,
like even if it's like a in a 

1134
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:18,900
microscopic,
that would make sense to me.

1135
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:20,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

1136
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,660
Well a lot of our plastic comes in 
contact with food for sure.

1137
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,523
But I,
I read another thing about a certain 

1138
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,130
type of bird that lives on this one 
island.

1139
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,063
It's a real epidemic that these mama 
birds are bringing back plastic and 

1140
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,950
feeding it to their babies.

1141
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,970
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1142
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:37,850
This is super villain plot.
It's awful.

1143
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,713
There's these bodies of these birds and 
their stomachs are filled with plastic 

1144
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,910
and you know,
they're rotting.

1145
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,780
Their bodies are decomposing and the 
plastic is just sitting there exposed.

1146
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,180
Yeah,
it's super dark.

1147
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,673
Can we talk about some of your hardship?
I was in Hawaii recently married and I 

1148
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:58,760
was with this dude when he was on a very
positive thing either.

1149
00:50:58,761 --> 00:50:59,594
Unfortunately,
he's been a commercial fisherman for a 

1150
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:03,200
long time.
His name's Steve.

1151
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:04,690
Shout out to Steve.
Uh,

1152
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,270
Steve and scooter took me out fishing.
Um,

1153
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,810
but he,
uh,

1154
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,530
when we were fishing he was telling me 
that he's been doing this forever and he

1155
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,010
lived in Costa Rica and you know,
ran a,

1156
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,873
uh,
like a fishing camp out there and now 

1157
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,880
he's doing it out of Hawaii.
And I was like,

1158
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:20,714
well,
how much of a difference have you seen 

1159
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,040
like over the last,
you know,

1160
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,020
few goes,
oh,

1161
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:24,890
it's huge.

1162
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,040
It's a huge difference.
He's like a tree now,

1163
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,380
like 10,
20 years ago.

1164
00:51:28,381 --> 00:51:30,380
Like 30 years ago,
the amount of fish he's like,

1165
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,130
it's just totally different.
He's like way less fish.

1166
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,993
He's.
And then he sort of explained to me all 

1167
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:41,501
the different methods that these 
commercial fishing corporations use like

1168
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,590
that,
how they go like hundreds of miles off.

1169
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:46,424
See they have these massive nets.
They capture these tuna and they can 

1170
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,574
them on the boat.
Like they have this system where there 

1171
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,660
are just thousands and thousands of 
pounds.

1172
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,210
Tuna just scooping it up,
killing them.

1173
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,500
Canning.
I'm like,

1174
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:06,860
you don't think about it when you go to 
the store and you see canned tuna,

1175
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:10,070
you think I'd like some canned tuna.
I remember starkist,

1176
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,890
I could go for a tuna salad sandwich 
early with whole wheat and some nice uh,

1177
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,810
Alfalfa sprouts on them.
They do this.

1178
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,873
Then I'm like,
and of this or how about a grilled 

1179
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:22,334
cheese sandwich with tuna where you 
butter the outside of the bread and you 

1180
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:25,694
put some tomato on that bitch and you 
put some tuna and you put a bunch of 

1181
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:32,450
slices of a sharp Cheddar and you cook 
that Shit.

1182
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,820
Come on man.
Well,

1183
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,673
the problem is you're thinking about 
you've surrounded the meal with so many 

1184
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:37,184
cool adjectives and made it us that we 
forgot to tell them this is a dead fish 

1185
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,950
killed at sea and candidacy dude with 
relatives looking up,

1186
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,080
going like,
there's hell hell on a boat.

1187
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,820
I don't know what kind of bitch ass shit
you're talking about.

1188
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:52,850
I'm talking about tuna melt.
That's delicious.

1189
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:54,410
American sandwich.
What the fuck?

1190
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,603
Truly American fucking this guy was.
He was describing it to me and I was 

1191
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,933
seeing it in my mind like a horror film 
playing I was seeing in my mind like 

1192
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:07,040
that obviously the oceans giant.
It's gigantic,

1193
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:12,041
but it's been going on these large scale
efforts for so long that it's just chop,

1194
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,293
chop,
chop and away the number of fish and he 

1195
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:19,040
was really scared of it.
He was really scared of it.

1196
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,933
He was like,
I just don't know how much longer it's 

1197
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:21,884
going to last.
So there could be an insufficient or 

1198
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,950
lifetime the.
Well,

1199
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,980
there's a lot of speculation that by 
2050 we literally would have killed like

1200
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:35,550
most of the fish in the sea if we 
continue escalating the way we have from

1201
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,830
1960 to 2016 population now.
Seven billion.

1202
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,660
We're,
let's just assume it's going to double,

1203
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,520
you know,
by 2050.

1204
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,210
I mean I don't know what the number is.
What's the projected population by 2050.

1205
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,610
I got to imagine it's was the most 
interesting questions,

1206
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:52,500
right?
Is that a weird thing?

1207
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:53,334
I always ask people shit.
Like who is that guy who played that 

1208
00:53:55,981 --> 00:54:00,900
wizard once to what's the population?
Could it be by the year 20,

1209
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:01,734
50.
It's like you're making big decisions 

1210
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:05,100
now.
Almost 10 billion.

1211
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:10,130
So I was 11 billion by 2100.
Oh Jesus.

1212
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,430
Nine point $7 billion in 2050.
If there's not enough fish,

1213
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,130
there's no way.
Does it go to soylent green?

1214
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,860
Were like we got to start consuming the 
dead.

1215
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,783
Well,
they have a method now apparently where 

1216
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:29,040
they can make petri dish,
you know,

1217
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:33,450
like stem cell created meat.
I don't know how the fuck they do it.

1218
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:35,460
I have zero understanding of the 
process,

1219
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:36,294
but I know that they did it a long time 
ago and it was so expensive that they 

1220
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:43,730
did it like one cheeseburger would to 
cost like a quarter million dollars,

1221
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,753
like so expensive to produce,
but it was more of like sort of a test 

1222
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,220
subject like okay,
now we know that we can do this,

1223
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,233
let's make the process more efficient.
Let's figure out how to large scale 

1224
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,330
people if they can do that a lot,
but if they can do that,

1225
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,820
they can literally grow meat with no 
body.

1226
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,340
There won't be a body attached to the 
meat.

1227
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,233
It would just be me.
I don't understand how it works so I 

1228
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:05,730
don't understand.

1229
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,910
Like what do you fuel that meet with 
like how does it grow?

1230
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:09,744
Like what is he eating or while it's 
growing it has to take something in 

1231
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,223
order to get larger,
but it's not just pulling air out and 

1232
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:15,834
getting bigger.
So what are you feeding it and how's 

1233
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:19,830
that work and is that ethical and what 
we watch?

1234
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,450
Yeah.
Can we watch made it works?

1235
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,930
You can suck my Dick.
How far can you take this warm?

1236
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,980
Is it.
There's a lot of questions that we would

1237
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:31,020
want to ask,
but I mean that's some westworld shit.

1238
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,680
I mean that they're there.
If you can make a leg of a fucking cow,

1239
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,330
you can make a leg of a fucking person.
You can just do it.

1240
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:40,440
It just takes some time.
I know a guy with a metal femur.

1241
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,230
He has an artificial femur.
He got bone cancer.

1242
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:43,891
Okay.
Yeah,

1243
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:44,724
and so one of his legs is a is like a,
like a metal rod that goes down to his 

1244
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:53,130
knee,
like they replaced his femur with a bone

1245
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,353
with a metal bone.
Like they can start doing that to the 

1246
00:55:57,241 --> 00:56:00,870
whole body,
which means if you can make some sort of

1247
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:05,190
a nervous system,
you're like halfway to a person.

1248
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,820
You can make meat and you can make 
artificial bones.

1249
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,430
You make an artificial scarcity and you 
cover it with meat.

1250
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,730
You've got a westworld thing going on 
here.

1251
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:18,000
True hearts.
They showed you the westworld characters

1252
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,000
underneath their skin.
It's all robotic.

1253
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:22,260
You're talking about is an organic form 
of.

1254
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,980
Yeah.
I think the westworld thing

1255
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,110
is a little off on how it's going to go 
down.

1256
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,860
I think it's probably gonna go down,
but that's going to go look at hbo show.

1257
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:31,910
Got It wrong.
I think they're bullshitting us.

1258
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:32,943
Okay.
I think it's a part of the elite 

1259
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:34,774
strategy.
They found they figured out a way to 

1260
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:37,144
make a human heart in a petri dish of 
fucking beating human heart with stem 

1261
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,430
cells.
Really?

1262
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,860
Yeah.
See if he could find associated at all.

1263
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,240
It's insane to the Russian scientist or 
the German size,

1264
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,850
the one that you just cut off dog heads 
and I'm sure.

1265
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:54,790
I'm sure ever see that gun never held us
to a burn victim.

1266
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:57,710
Three P or re heal.
What Day is it?

1267
00:56:57,711 --> 00:56:58,780
Says?
I've seen that.

1268
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,190
I've seen that.
It's insane.

1269
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:01,024
It's sprays.
Stem cells like a little mister and 

1270
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,720
those stem cells cling to the zones.
The tissue,

1271
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:12,721
especially like when they're recently 
injured and it heals up super quick.

1272
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:17,110
Holy Crap.
It's fucking crazy,

1273
00:57:17,111 --> 00:57:17,741
dude.
I mean,

1274
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:21,100
that was one of the most devastating 
injuries a person could get because it's

1275
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:21,934
a giant Oregon,
like a big burn like that or see 

1276
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,640
gestating minute.
That's insane.

1277
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:32,140
Permanent results within days as a stem 
cells regenerate the skin,

1278
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:33,820
leaving no scars.
Fucking,

1279
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,890
hey man,
if you're giving your own stem cells,

1280
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,780
nobody can get all shitty about that.
Well,

1281
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:38,614
the stem cells that they're using now,
they can get them from women when they 

1282
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:43,390
have secession sections,
they take it out of the placenta.

1283
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,300
I've had a shot into my shoulder.
I had a shoulder injury.

1284
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,930
I had a shot into my shoulder and to 
heal like wolverine.

1285
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,793
It's the craziest fucking thing ever.
I was like that close to getting 

1286
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:56,020
shoulder surgery.
I had this real issue with my shoulder,

1287
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:56,854
like probably that I had probably 
dislocated it at some point in time and 

1288
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:00,664
I didn't know and then just years of 
doing Jujitsu and lifting weights and 

1289
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,920
fighting out a arm bars and shit,
it was just always bothering me.

1290
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,670
So I go to a doctor,
I get an Mri and he says,

1291
00:58:12,671 --> 00:58:13,840
man,
he goes,

1292
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:15,550
you got a tear here?
He got a tear here,

1293
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:18,120
he got a tear in your labor room,
you got a tear in your biceps tendon,

1294
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,740
like you know,
you might need surgery,

1295
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,790
like see how long you can go now,
just do little rehab and you know,

1296
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,600
and if it gets to a point where it's 
unmanageable,

1297
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,830
then you'd go under the knife.
So I go and it's always annoying me,

1298
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,843
like it was always [inaudible] at me and
then I go and get these shots in my 

1299
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:38,260
shoulder and like three weeks later I'm 
like,

1300
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,960
am I imagining this or is this fucking 
thing?

1301
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:41,794
Feel Great.
I'll just get you skipped over the big 

1302
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:44,420
step.
How do you get to the shots?

1303
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:47,380
And the shoulder was the doctor like Dr 
the UFC doctor,

1304
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,513
the UFC doctor who had had um,
Dr Davidson had shoulder surgery and 

1305
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,710
after shoulder surgery he was still in 
pain months,

1306
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:56,950
months later.

1307
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:57,783
And he went and got the stem cell shots 
and he said within weeks his shoulder 

1308
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:03,340
felt amazing.
Like it was crazy.

1309
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,060
So who tells him about that?
Like how he's a doctor,

1310
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:07,943
you know,
so he's just up on the late in the 

1311
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:09,880
doctor community.
They'll look,

1312
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,200
yeah,
these are stem cells aren't good.

1313
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:12,034
You get yelled at.
A lot of pro athletes are doing it and 

1314
00:59:14,911 --> 00:59:16,840
they're doing it to help their body,
or no,

1315
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:17,740
you can.
There's,

1316
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,110
there's a bunch of ways to do it.
You could get it from your own fat.

1317
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,010
They suck your fat to do a light bulb on

1318
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,821
you.
God,

1319
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:25,190
I'll live forever.
Just keep sucking it out.

1320
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,024
And you go intravenous with the stem 
cells so I can out intravenous stem 

1321
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:30,200
cells.
It's more net boom.

1322
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,430
Say it again because that I'm going 
home,

1323
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,300
getting new right now on American 
myself.

1324
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,220
A million times.
That's illegal right now in America.

1325
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:38,830
But Damn,
that sells.

1326
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,471
No,
no,

1327
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,071
no.
To,

1328
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:40,904
uh,
to intravenously inject it back into 

1329
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:45,740
your body has supposed to have some 
magnificent effect.

1330
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,383
Intravenous stem cell injections.
Explain to your whole body like 

1331
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,960
intravenous drug,
like heroin.

1332
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,240
They can somehow or another do that with
stem cells and you're like,

1333
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,900
I've known to people that have done it 
boss route and end bill's area.

1334
00:59:57,901 --> 00:59:59,390
And they're both like,
holy shit,

1335
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:00,224
this was amazing.
Boss said that felt like he had energy 

1336
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,070
coming off his fingers.
He was like,

1337
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:04,911
dude,
he was like,

1338
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:06,440
my whole body was charged.

1339
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,180
Like,
ah,

1340
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,410
this is closest.
We get to superhuman ability,

1341
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,470
but it's with our own.
With your own stem cells,

1342
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,060
you can do it with your own stance 
house.

1343
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:15,350
They do.
That's one method.

1344
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:16,184
Another method that another friend of 
mine did is they drilled into the bone 

1345
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:24,140
in his hip and they pulled marrow out 
and use that marrow,

1346
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:28,220
use the stem cells from his hip marrow 
and inject that into his knee.

1347
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:30,100
And it had a pretty remarkable effect 
too.

1348
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:35,430
It's the opinion is divided over which 
stem cell therapy is the most effective,

1349
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,023
but one of them that seems to be very 
effective is one that I did and that's 

1350
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,743
in section.
They take a woman who's given birth by 

1351
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,440
section and if they're young,
I think they have to be within a certain

1352
01:00:48,441 --> 01:00:49,274
age limit.
Then they take their placenta and they 

1353
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:51,824
extract stem cells from the placenta and
then they have some sort of a process 

1354
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:56,420
that I'll never understand.

1355
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,403
And then they inject the stem cells into
the injury itself and your body starts 

1356
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:02,114
regenerating tissue.
So that's the difference between this 

1357
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,233
and any other sort of form of therapy is
that it actually allows your body to 

1358
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:10,724
regenerate tissue.
So things that are torn can actually 

1359
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:17,240
heal and thick and strengthen like 
you're seeing what those burn victims.

1360
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,083
Again,
don't listen to me because I don't know 

1361
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:19,784
what the fuck I'm talking about.
I just know how it's been explained to 

1362
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:22,740
me.
But uh,

1363
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,850
it had a pretty profound effect.
What?

1364
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:29,300
So if you're,
if you've got nothing wrong with you and

1365
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:31,680
you just inject stem cells,
I was like,

1366
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,780
Ooh.
Yeah.

1367
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:33,980
Well he had something wrong with them 
though.

1368
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,740
You who's recovering from a pretty 
serious injury.

1369
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,810
Bas rutten was at least.
But yeah.

1370
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,360
Um,
well one of the things we're finding out

1371
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,750
is that,
um,

1372
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:43,723
with mice,
they're taking the blood of young mice 

1373
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,863
and they're injecting it in older mice.
And these older my start acting like 

1374
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:54,440
young mice again,
and they start literally like going back

1375
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:55,274
in age.
And this is some crazy vampire show 

1376
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,100
really is,
do.

1377
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,580
That's very close.
This is totally vampire shit.

1378
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,060
Do University off the blood of young 
mice isn't an excellent fucking.

1379
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,340
It is novel.
I think we got your next movie.

1380
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,320
It's a great punk rock band.
Great.

1381
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,890
It's a great idea for a movie gone 
wrong.

1382
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:16,910
Right?
Well,

1383
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,410
you're talking to the guy made test so I
can make that work.

1384
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,630
Do you know what the battery is?
No.

1385
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:22,893
Elizabeth batteries like one of the most
infamous serial killers in human 

1386
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:26,484
history.
And her gig was she would kill young 

1387
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:30,930
women in bathing their blood blood.
Okay.

1388
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:32,070
Then I did her.
She's,

1389
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,620
she was a noble woman and uh,
where,

1390
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,860
where was she from?
Slovakia.

1391
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,790
What?
Hungry.

1392
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,680
Hungry.
And uh,

1393
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,693
she just killed a ton of pretty girls.
She would go find these peasant girls 

1394
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:47,400
and bring it back to a castle,
torture them,

1395
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:48,243
kill them and cut them up.
And all the people that worked with are 

1396
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:54,690
just horrified buyer because she just 
had like a dungeon of dead women and she

1397
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,780
would just slaughtered them and then 
bathe in their blood and.

1398
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:00,240
But because of the fact that she was a 
noble woman,

1399
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,150
she never even got executed.
They just put her in house arrest,

1400
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,290
so they locked her in some fucking 
chamber up in the top of some castle,

1401
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,540
like some monster by herself until she 
died.

1402
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,540
How old?
She was old when she died.

1403
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:13,340
She,
you know,

1404
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,173
she didn't die at 30,
but as she's a real mom question that 

1405
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:18,434
will.
Yeah,

1406
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,820
it's good question.
She was 54 when she died,

1407
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,290
which back then,
which right now,

1408
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,490
think about it.
You've loved 16,

1409
01:03:26,491 --> 01:03:28,560
10,
whatever you liver love that.

1410
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:32,580
Didn't make it to 54 and just realize 
that the blood bather butchered.

1411
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:33,414
All those women made it to 54.
How old was she when they locked her in 

1412
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:38,370
the hole?
Did the process work?

1413
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,230
No Blood?
No.

1414
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:42,360
It didn't work because she didn't know 
what the fuck she was doing.

1415
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,194
She had the right idea.
I mean in a way like there's the right 

1416
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,120
idea.
She was the mice before the mice,

1417
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,250
but you don't have to kill people.
You dumb cunt.

1418
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,610
They just believe that young kids to 
donate blood,

1419
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,490
to do what she did wrong was bathed in 
the blood.

1420
01:03:59,491 --> 01:04:01,020
What he's supposed to do,
what she did wrong.

1421
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,380
She's a fucking fucking serial killer.
I'm kidding.

1422
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,223
But her idea was somehow or another that
she was going to get the younger 

1423
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,333
juvenile age and that's been a theme 
that people have sort of like repeated 

1424
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:14,580
over and over again and it makes you 
wonder,

1425
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,440
maybe we mean no,
some,

1426
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:17,363
somewhere in the maybe it's just 
ridiculous and I'm and bloods of 

1427
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,613
illiquid and you can contain it and 
measure it and we just get our heads 

1428
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:25,620
wrapped around this idea that that's 
what makes you younger.

1429
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:29,250
Or maybe like we inherently knew that's 
the source of aging.

1430
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:34,080
It's the blood and then chased it away 
during civilization just because like,

1431
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,910
well there's only one way around that or
out of others.

1432
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,260
Maybe it's not something that we knew or
didn't know.

1433
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,010
But it's inherent knowledge.
Like maybe your system,

1434
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:44,844
sort of like how your body knows when 
it's thirsty to drink water without 

1435
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,100
anybody even telling you like you just 
kinda know.

1436
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:50,963
Right?
But it's like certain things that you 

1437
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:53,370
know,
you see a snake,

1438
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:55,440
even if you've never seen one,
you're going to back up.

1439
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,453
There's things that you just know.
It could be highly possible that we'd 

1440
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:00,384
have some sort of a subconscious 
understanding of some aspects of our 

1441
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:07,630
body,
some needs that our body has that we,

1442
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,543
we've never been able to see it written 
anywhere because no one's written it 

1443
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:11,754
down,
but maybe you kind of know things and 

1444
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,540
maybe somewhere just,
yeah,

1445
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,610
maybe somewhere in the back of the,
the human DNA.

1446
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,430
We know that the blood,
when the blood goes bad,

1447
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,370
your body starts to get old and starts 
to fall apart,

1448
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:27,820
but if you pump that young blood 
backhand Doodoodoo Doodoo too.

1449
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,790
Like we just kind of has to happen 
eventually.

1450
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:32,290
Right?
That's the scary thing,

1451
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,120
man,
because that's the number one thing that

1452
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:38,380
people are hoping science can stop 
people getting old and dying.

1453
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:40,070
That's the number one thing.
Because you said,

1454
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,880
I understand going like a,
hey man.

1455
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,793
Um,
wouldn't it be great if we could do all 

1456
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:47,230
this without a president?
But it's tough to be like,

1457
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:48,640
hey man,
when did this all be better?

1458
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:51,670
If we couldn't die?
I'm not saying it would be better.

1459
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,610
I definitely think it's possible.
Like everything.

1460
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,320
There's everything ages in one 
direction.

1461
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:58,230
The road goes in one direction,
sewer,

1462
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,073
slow it down and you can make the path 
comfortable for yourself as comfortable 

1463
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:03,280
as you can,
the journey even more so,

1464
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:06,940
but I don't think you could extend the 
road forever.

1465
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:07,843
You know that certain jellyfish are 
essentially a mortal explain they live 

1466
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:14,200
here so don't have a head,
heart and lungs,

1467
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,083
but,
but if we really can regenerate all the 

1468
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,890
tissue in your body and let,
except for trauma,

1469
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,490
except for accidents and somebody,
somebody killing you,

1470
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,780
there could be only one.
It's there's no physical reason why they

1471
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:29,614
shouldn't be able to figure out how to 
stop the aging clock and literally turn 

1472
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:34,630
it back.
No physical reason.

1473
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:36,670
What about the brain?
Both that.

1474
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:40,040
I mean that is also an Oregon does it,
Tom,

1475
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,270
there's going to be a real question as 
to where you know,

1476
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,133
where your memories are actually stored 
and who are you and once they start 

1477
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:51,470
getting to that ray Kurzweil's shit of 
storing consciousness and some sort of a

1478
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,830
data bank watch black mirror.
Oh No,

1479
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:54,990
I haven't,
but I heard I have to.

1480
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,900
You got it.
You would love it.

1481
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,210
I watched one episode when they made the
politician,

1482
01:06:58,211 --> 01:07:00,380
fuck the pig was amazing.
It's pretty bad ass.

1483
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,233
Amazing episode.
What the fuck you watched that you were 

1484
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:07,430
good enough?
That brilliance and be like,

1485
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,490
oh my God.
And that was their first episode.

1486
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,380
Let me see what the next one.
It's not that I'm opposed to it.

1487
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,530
I just had to wait to have this one 
episode and the second season about,

1488
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,240
you know,
they don't telegraph it up front,

1489
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,560
the smart tv that make it work for it.
But they,

1490
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,170
uh,
essentially the idea is they take people

1491
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,004
who are dying and you can download your 
consciousness into this digital 

1492
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:33,580
playground,
look the way you want.

1493
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:35,180
And it looks like,
like,

1494
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,053
you know,
every spring break you've ever seen and 

1495
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:38,074
stuff.
And so these two people meet up and 

1496
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:43,660
they're both young women and you find 
out one is an old woman and the other,

1497
01:07:43,661 --> 01:07:44,470
they're both old women.

1498
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,080
One's been a vegetable.
So she was like a teenager.

1499
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:52,370
But in this virtual world they can drop 
and be free and to be whoever they want.

1500
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,740
But it's generally considered like,
uh,

1501
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,613
if you could choose to just die,
pass onto whatever you think is out 

1502
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:03,940
there if there's a heaven or something 
like that,

1503
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,860
or you could choose to go to the server 
as they call it and stuff.

1504
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,230
And so the,
you know,

1505
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,250
the two women who fall for one,
another,

1506
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,040
one is like,
stay here forever.

1507
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,681
Like,
you know,

1508
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:19,840
we can be like this forever.
And the older woman was like,

1509
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,880
I had a life with a husband and a kid 
and I watched him get old and die and he

1510
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:31,220
chose not to do this.
Now I'm going to choose to live forever.

1511
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:34,490
And her friends like where you're going,
you don't even know where you're going.

1512
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,323
But what if he's not there?
That gets you nowhere or alert 

1513
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,540
somewhere.
Good point.

1514
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,433
Good point.
I don't know where you're going with 

1515
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:41,871
kids.
Sorry.

1516
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:44,450
It's deep.
Hilton smoke another joint.

1517
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,284
Forget this one of many episodes,
but I got to keep going with this 

1518
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,760
because it's good.
And we got to talk about the arrival.

1519
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:51,000
Have you seen arrival?
No.

1520
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,040
Oh my gosh,
I haven't seen it yet.

1521
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,440
I've already preordered it on itunes.
It's genius.

1522
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,313
May Tell you what,
I'm not watching anymore as a walking 

1523
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:01,604
dead done.
Why don't be that one episode of the 

1524
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:05,901
latest season of the new season.
I'm like,

1525
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:07,610
fuck,
what the first one?

1526
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:09,620
Yeah.
Fuck you had to do that.

1527
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:11,780
Everyone's waiting to see what what 
Nagan dead man.

1528
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,300
I'll be like that as a.
This is our soap operas.

1529
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,360
Torture show.
Just torture.

1530
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,203
Show the zombies.
All of a sudden they're totally 

1531
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,630
insignificant.
They charge you.

1532
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,553
You can just kick them away.
They tear open horses with the raw 

1533
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:27,254
hands,
but they charge you just kind of like 

1534
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:29,400
fucking highs.
Minimum.

1535
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:34,190
A group of thousands of them surrounding
a van and he figures out it.

1536
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,430
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1537
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,240
You Killed Glen.
You Killed Glen.

1538
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,720
Like that boiler like that.
But that way,

1539
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:46,010
but they also to live on was expecting 
when they did shit.

1540
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,570
Fuck that show.
You got a high bar.

1541
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:51,321
Rogan?
No,

1542
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:53,080
I don't.
Yeah,

1543
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:53,914
I do feel like don't.
It's just if you're going to fucking 

1544
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,930
Zombie tree consistent,
it's torture.

1545
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:02,960
Think the idea was to show as bad as we 
think the zombies are.

1546
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,610
The humans are always going to be worse.
You can't kill Glenn.

1547
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,870
Is that.
Is that your big beef?

1548
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,950
I love that guy.
I know,

1549
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:12,020
but this show is that going like,
Hey,

1550
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,970
I'm sorry we got to kill someone you 
love.

1551
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:14,803
Every once in awhile.
I'm spoiler alert in the fuck out of 

1552
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:18,170
that show.
If you're not watching it,

1553
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,250
pause this.
I'm done.

1554
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,143
I won't do that anymore.
Can't tell you the end of the other 

1555
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:22,930
thing.
No,

1556
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,180
come on dude.
Jesus Christ on.

1557
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,660
It's good.
It's good to talk.

1558
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:28,940
I'll cover my ears and then I'm talking 
to nobody.

1559
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,550
I'm the.
Let's talk arrival.

1560
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:33,910
I want to keep saying the arrival 
arrival just arrived.

1561
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,020
Did you ever see the other one with 
Charlie Sheen?

1562
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,303
The arrival.
That's why I keep wanting to say the 

1563
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:39,441
Bible.
Yeah.

1564
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:44,360
That's an old video store flick from 
when I was renting sling and videos back

1565
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:45,194
in the day.
I remember him that quite often people 

1566
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:48,170
come in and be like,
you got the arrival,

1567
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,840
Chuck Sheen Son.
I was like,

1568
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:51,920
super high.
I was like,

1569
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,813
God,
I feel embarrassed to have liked that 

1570
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,960
and then Dave Foley released me.
Of My father was like,

1571
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,960
that was a really good science fiction 
movie.

1572
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,950
Yes.
Yeah.

1573
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,860
One smart guy.
Do you know Dave?

1574
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,630
No,
I met him once on a game show,

1575
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:07,340
but you know,
big news radio fan.

1576
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:08,174
But even going back pre news radio,
probably the reason I get to news 

1577
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,060
radio's because that was a massive kids 
in the hall fan,

1578
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,220
so I met Dave twice.

1579
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,053
He only remembers probably the one time 
on the game show recently that the 

1580
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,660
Hollywood game night,
but I met him back in like 95.

1581
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:22,494
I went to a kids in the hall show in 
Kitchener Ontario and then went back 

1582
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:29,040
backstage after the show and I've never 
done that before,

1583
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,420
but I was a big fan of.
My friend was like,

1584
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,740
oh,
they'll fucking love it.

1585
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:32,820
My friend Malcolm,
he's wonderful.

1586
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,160
God very much a blowhard.
He has bug guest called blower,

1587
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:38,740
but he's the guy that's just like,
fuck a Batman v Superman.

1588
01:11:38,741 --> 01:11:40,190
It's a certain amount of abortion,
you know?

1589
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,033
He's just got opinions and shit.
Some a man took me to see the kids in 

1590
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:45,020
the hall and he's like,
we'll go backstage.

1591
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,560
They'll fucking love it.
You made clerks,

1592
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:47,394
this will be amazing and they just 
finished an amazing show and we go 

1593
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,090
backstage and,
you know,

1594
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:52,463
I don't know how you are after show,
but I now know how I am after show and 

1595
01:11:54,891 --> 01:11:58,200
generally speaking the show was there 
and now I just like,

1596
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:58,560
it was fun.

1597
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,380
Grab some milk and drive home or grab or
something like that.

1598
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,910
Um,
and,

1599
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:04,320
and,
and instead,

1600
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,640
you know,
you're not like,

1601
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:08,340
hey.
So I met them and they were all like,

1602
01:12:08,341 --> 01:12:09,270
hey,
you know,

1603
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:10,104
and not,
they didn't fucking see clerks to know 

1604
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,630
who I was as early,
early on in my career,

1605
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,853
but,
you know,

1606
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,400
they just give it all up on the stage 
and they're like,

1607
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,263
oh shit,
we gotta fucking do another mini show 

1608
01:12:19,141 --> 01:12:20,640
and stuff.
So,

1609
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:21,631
you know,
I don't,

1610
01:12:21,631 --> 01:12:22,930
I'm not like,
what a let down.

1611
01:12:22,931 --> 01:12:24,360
It was.
The show was amazing,

1612
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,333
you know,
it's just not like a doubt he'd even 

1613
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:27,504
remember meeting me,
but I did meet him on that Hollywood 

1614
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:31,950
game night show and talked to them for a
long time.

1615
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,580
But I'm a deep fan going way back.
That's awesome.

1616
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:37,260
The long answer to your question,
sorry,

1617
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,340
I don't remember what the question was 
you like.

1618
01:12:39,341 --> 01:12:40,174
Do you meet that guy?
He's literally one of the smartest 

1619
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:46,530
people I've ever met in my life arrival.
Let's talk about the new arrival.

1620
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,180
You gotta see it.
You would love it,

1621
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,780
but Dave Foley,
I wanted to talk about data.

1622
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,230
Let's go deep on.

1623
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,930
He's a secret producer of Newsradio.
What do you mean?

1624
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:56,730
Explain?
Is this deep cuts newsradio?

1625
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,713
Yeah.
Yeah.

1626
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,200
Here we go.
I'm I'm listening mode.

1627
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,070
This is not a knock against the writers 
as writers are brilliant.

1628
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:04,110
Paul Sams go created it.
Another one,

1629
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:08,220
the smartest people I've ever met and 
just completely unique,

1630
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,113
like there's a lot of guys that pretend 
to be that eccentric Weirdo writer Guy 

1631
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:18,510
Paul Sams is that motherfucker.
He's such an eccentric guy.

1632
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,790
Like they didn't start writing until 
like 3:00

1633
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,100
in the morning.
They would hang out,

1634
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:22,943
play video games and foreign each 
other's faces and they literally didn't 

1635
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:26,994
start writing until the middle of the 
night because Paul like had a strategy 

1636
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,773
of getting like everybody,
like really tired and silly and then 

1637
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:36,510
they would write all night and then a 
lot of times we would get like the first

1638
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,430
draft,
the day of the table read,

1639
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:41,310
we would get the first draft.
They would just be like,

1640
01:13:41,311 --> 01:13:43,520
Josh Lieb would come down barefoot and 
he,

1641
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,473
these guys would be up all night and Lou
Martin and all these writers and I was 

1642
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:50,070
like,
you guys fucking crazy.

1643
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:52,190
Like you didn't even sleep like this.
He goes like,

1644
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,280
no,
we've been writing all night.

1645
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,173
This is how we do it.
And they were just silly because they 

1646
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:58,260
were.
They were almost without doing drugs.

1647
01:13:58,261 --> 01:14:03,261
They were getting high by keeping 
[inaudible] for inhibition

1648
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,103
there up.
The more they're like anything goes and 

1649
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:09,440
as you're sitting there,
if your welfare or your,

1650
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,590
you know,
in the middle the day,

1651
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:16,591
perhaps you're less a apt or less,
less likely to be like,

1652
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,110
Hey,
I got a fucking stupid.

1653
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:22,980
I don't want someone to be like,
you asshole.

1654
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,780
That's a fucking funny.
Nobody wants to get judged.

1655
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:27,730
So for me,
I smoke weed.

1656
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,920
Not because it gives you a better ideas,
but because it's,

1657
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,813
you know,
it lowers your inhibitions where you're 

1658
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:32,570
like,
I'm,

1659
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:35,050
I don't give a fuck.
If people think it's stupid,

1660
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:37,360
I'm going to try it.
And if that don't work,

1661
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,920
I'll try something.
I'll say another way.

1662
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:40,840
You can express yourself more.
Honestly.

1663
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:41,674
You feel freer to express yourself more.
I must be the same idea that people 

1664
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:47,110
fucking up and then just getting them 
tired and they'd be like now.

1665
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:47,590
Right.

1666
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:50,500
It's a strategy.
It really is very,

1667
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:51,830
very specific.
It's very,

1668
01:14:51,831 --> 01:14:52,664
it was very silly.
It was a silly show and that's one of 

1669
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:56,140
the reasons why I think there's a lot of
silliness going on,

1670
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,350
but which is a strong suit when you 
can't,

1671
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:04,380
when you don't have the card to play of 
like let's say cock or fuck shit.

1672
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:07,190
Like you can't even do the basic cards.
So you like,

1673
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,043
what do you replace those cards in the 
deck width and that show replaced it 

1674
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:10,931
with like,
oh,

1675
01:15:10,931 --> 01:15:11,764
we're going to have the,
we're going to up the silly question in 

1676
01:15:13,511 --> 01:15:15,610
a way that doesn't look like other 
sitcoms.

1677
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,320
Silly.
Like they're silly.

1678
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:21,340
Was bill getting a cane where it's like,
that's a real fucking silly episode.

1679
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:24,700
They built a whole episode around him 
walking to everybody loves a cane.

1680
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,630
Like that's not,
it's not the same bill.

1681
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,610
No,
it was very,

1682
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:30,330
very top shit.
Like your last name's girly,

1683
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,280
like just repeating that for,
for,

1684
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:35,890
for five fucking years.
That was like every time it happens.

1685
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,100
Like your last name's grilling.

1686
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,670
That's genius.
That show was,

1687
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,820
it was.
It was a very weird show.

1688
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,120
And a lot of ways I'm like,
Paul was a,

1689
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,073
he's such a unique guy that he would 
essentially let anybody come up with 

1690
01:15:50,131 --> 01:15:53,370
another line if like they were doing a 
table read or a,

1691
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,690
not a table read rather.
But uh,

1692
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:55,980
um,
a run through.

1693
01:15:56,370 --> 01:16:00,370
If you would get a hold of the script,
Dave would come up with an alternative,

1694
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,593
an alternative line.
And like right away the show was in 

1695
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:05,994
trouble like,
because like the first year that we are 

1696
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:10,620
filming,
like it wasn't really doing very well in

1697
01:16:10,621 --> 01:16:13,380
the ratings and they couldn't figure out
how the show.

1698
01:16:13,381 --> 01:16:15,150
I bet you that number would be.
Well,

1699
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:19,080
it was weird.
We moved nine times in f five,

1700
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:20,730
five years.
But um,

1701
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,440
there was this um,
or four years,

1702
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:25,770
whatever we did and it was this moment 
when they were,

1703
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:28,380
they were just trying to figure it out 
constantly.

1704
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:33,381
It was a lot of work and they would all 
get together and try to rewrite scenes.

1705
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,600
But Dave Foley would rewrite scenes like
on the floor.

1706
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:37,703
And as the show kept going,
it became more and more of a thing like 

1707
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:42,540
we were,
he was like a secret producer.

1708
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:45,540
Like,
but not that it was a secret because the

1709
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:49,080
writers were so open minded that they 
just wanted to see the best job.

1710
01:16:49,081 --> 01:16:49,380
He's

1711
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,213
the best kind of actor though.
He's the actor that you love because 

1712
01:16:51,931 --> 01:16:52,764
he's a writer as well.
So it comes to set and he's not just 

1713
01:16:54,661 --> 01:16:55,494
doing your script.
He can give you five other scripts just 

1714
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:01,560
as funny if you want them,
and if he's like the good ones,

1715
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,620
he's not jamming my shit's better than 
yours and your throat.

1716
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:07,530
He's like,
if there's an opening gracefully,

1717
01:17:07,531 --> 01:17:08,364
it goes in.
But that in the beginning of my career 

1718
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:10,040
is

1719
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,800
to reject people that were like that 
because I'm like,

1720
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:14,090
no,
if it's not my writing,

1721
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:16,070
then what is it?
And then the older you get,

1722
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:17,460
the more comfortable getting you 
realized,

1723
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,190
dude,
you're going to get credit regardless.

1724
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,053
Like go ahead.
Like I remember for me it was Chris 

1725
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,800
Rock.
There was a moment in dogma,

1726
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,250
a Chris Rock.
There was a line in the script,

1727
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:32,200
a line in the movie where,
uh,

1728
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,740
you know,
he falls out of heaven.

1729
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:37,300
He's Brewfest the 13th apostle.
And then having this conversation though

1730
01:17:37,301 --> 01:17:38,134
the road,
him and Linda Fiorentino playing 

1731
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,850
Bethany,
Jane Santa Barbara there.

1732
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,650
And he references knowing Jesus and 
she's like,

1733
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:47,870
Christ,
you knew Christ.

1734
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,511
And he goes,
no,

1735
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:50,180
I'm shit.
And he used the n word.

1736
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:50,720
He goes,
oh no,

1737
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,800
it's been 12 bucks,
Nigga,

1738
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,860
12 bucks now.
I didn't write that line.

1739
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,650
I wrote dogma,
every piece of it,

1740
01:17:56,651 --> 01:17:57,710
but I didn't write that line.

1741
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:00,290
I would never put that light in front of
Chris Rock and be like,

1742
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:04,910
look what I did.
My line was Nomi owes me 12 bucks.

1743
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:08,990
Chris was able to dress it up in such a 
way and I told them,

1744
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:10,050
I was like,
Oh God.

1745
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:11,690
Because I was crying when he did.
I was like,

1746
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:14,390
that's hysterical.
But I was bittersweet about it because I

1747
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:15,350
was like,
I can't include it.

1748
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,610
And I said to him,
I was like,

1749
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:17,444
dude,
that's the funniest thing I think I've 

1750
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:20,210
ever put on film and I can't use in the 
movie because why?

1751
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,160
That was like,
because I didn't write it.

1752
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:22,994
How am I supposed to do the credits now?
Written by Kevin Smith and one line by 

1753
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:25,940
Chris Rock.
He goes,

1754
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,700
I don't give a shit.
Don't you know how this works?

1755
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,160
He's going,
you'll get credit for it.

1756
01:18:30,161 --> 01:18:31,340
He's going to fit with funny.

1757
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,230
Take it.
I don't need credit for that.

1758
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:34,820
I say a lot of shit.
And I was like,

1759
01:18:34,821 --> 01:18:35,750
Oh,
oh really?

1760
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:37,350
And then the next guy I worked with was 
like,

1761
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:38,223
that was a will ferrell on Jay and 
silent Bob Strike almost an alien idea 

1762
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:47,231
that you would not accept a really funny
addition to had to do the job dude,

1763
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,343
because I was.
So I came through indie film and so I 

1764
01:18:50,511 --> 01:18:52,730
didn't come up through the world of 
comedy.

1765
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:56,540
I backdoored into the world of comedy.
But I came up through any film and indie

1766
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:57,650
film was like,
Hey man.

1767
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,020
Oh tour,
right.

1768
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,700
And direct your stuff.
It's your statement and stuff.

1769
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:03,590
And I've,
since nobody taught you,

1770
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,360
there's nobody to teach you.
This shit is no book.

1771
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,850
You have your own process where you're 
like,

1772
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:09,080
well,
you know,

1773
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,510
I guess to be pure it should all be my 
stuff.

1774
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,760
That way when I see it say written by 
Kevin Smith,

1775
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:16,310
it's not a lie.
Just like I was raised Catholic.

1776
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:19,700
So for the longest time,
like I,

1777
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:20,534
you know,
I thought I was a virgin until I was 

1778
01:19:22,311 --> 01:19:25,280
about 17.
Really?

1779
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:30,281
I lost my virginity at 13.
Like I was inside a girl at age 13.

1780
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:33,500
She was also the same age.
So it's not creepy.

1781
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,350
It's creepy to talk about now,
but never.

1782
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,213
I never came.
And in Catholic school there's no class 

1783
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,880
where they're like,
you know,

1784
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,910
sex is penetration.
They don't tell you shit,

1785
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,260
so you know,
I was like,

1786
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:49,310
well we make rules for yourself and you 
just buy them as those are the rules.

1787
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,780
So for years I was like,
well,

1788
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:51,221
I,
you know,

1789
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:54,950
I never came inside a girl so I've not 
had sex yet.

1790
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:57,320
And then when I finally had sex I was 
like,

1791
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,540
oh,
I guess penetration counts.

1792
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:00,374
And hence I had sex a long time ago.
It was a problem for a minute with my 

1793
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,340
current girlfriend.
And she's like,

1794
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,360
you said you were a virgin.
I was like,

1795
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,560
I thought it was a virgin,
but she was like,

1796
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,160
you better inside

1797
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,960
somebody else's again,
but I didn't come.

1798
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,330
Isn't that the like if you don't come 
and don't count.

1799
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:13,640
And she's like,
where'd you get that?

1800
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,130
Super impressive.
Anytime a 13 year old doesn't come,

1801
01:20:17,131 --> 01:20:18,980
should be super impressive.
You know,

1802
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:23,670
I kind of put out to fear you've got the
Catholic fear of not like,

1803
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,900
oh,
she'll have a baby.

1804
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:27,240
But the very catholic fear of,
I can't believe I'm sending,

1805
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:28,410
not even that,
like,

1806
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,240
Oh really?
You,

1807
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,220
she may have to get an abortion than 
your Catholics.

1808
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:33,510
I don't think.
I think any faith,

1809
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,220
you know,
you could send,

1810
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:36,870
you know,
especially with Catholicism,

1811
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:39,050
they had a built in get out of jail free
card.

1812
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,670
Like you can do what you need to,
but you come into church,

1813
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:45,300
you'd tell the strange man your dirty 
little secrets in a booth with no lights

1814
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:48,510
and you leave and everything's going to 
be fine with Jesus.

1815
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,400
It made sense all throughout my 
childhood.

1816
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:51,240
I was a catholic.
So,

1817
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:52,861
um.
All right.

1818
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:55,680
So wait,
where were we before we got into the.

1819
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,330
I don't know,
I don't have to be anywhere man.

1820
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,320
I know,
but I like,

1821
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,440
we were on a good thread man.
Like we were talking about you.

1822
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,760
It is what you think it is.
Like you build the rules for yourself.

1823
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:07,510
So I said to myself,
if,

1824
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:12,640
if I include Chris,
Chris Rock's amazing Ad Lib in my movie,

1825
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:16,920
then I've taken from another writer and 
hence it can't say written,

1826
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:21,940
but absolutely in my head.
I understand why you would think that he

1827
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:23,004
got that out of me.
It didn't make sense to me just because 

1828
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,093
I was really lucky in the,
the only real comedy that I did that 

1829
01:21:28,771 --> 01:21:30,530
lasted any,
you know,

1830
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,411
uh,
was,

1831
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:34,470
was news radio and it was a crazy 
environment like that.

1832
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,850
Where this based on you though,
right?

1833
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:36,684
Like Joe Garelli,
the character was very loosely based on 

1834
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:40,344
me.
Your stand up and said fucking do that 

1835
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:43,704
on the show.
Paul was just like really good at 

1836
01:21:45,271 --> 01:21:46,104
picking out the goofy shit that you do 
and like exaggerating it because I was 

1837
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:50,964
always into stupid ufo stories.
So it would always be some conspiracy 

1838
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:59,280
theory or some gadget because I've 
always been a dork when it comes to like

1839
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,143
technology.
I'm fascinated by all sorts of gadgets 

1840
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:03,234
and shit,
but I don't like flashing in moments 

1841
01:22:05,881 --> 01:22:06,714
where you're like,
you see this and it's just a card and 

1842
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,293
you're like,
uh,

1843
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:10,483
from the elevator.
But I don't know which one it was like 

1844
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:16,830
during raise period and stuff is all the
girly moments are washing over me as you

1845
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,450
say that.
I probably don't even remember him,

1846
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,970
but I bet you I no more about that show 
than you.

1847
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,270
If you and I went head to head Newsradio
Radio Trivia.

1848
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,670
I bet you I bet you would to like Andy 
Dick was a perfect sample.

1849
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:30,690
Andy Dick is a super exaggerated version
of Andy Dick,

1850
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,430
of Andy Dick.
That's what his character was.

1851
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:35,520
Matthew when I think it was just a super
exaggerated version of Eddie Dick,

1852
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:36,623
but like in ways andy almost sometimes 
at his craziest was like more of an 

1853
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:42,480
exaggeration,
but in a totally different way.

1854
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,760
He was partying,
getting crazy,

1855
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:45,983
but that the silliness of that character
was really handy tech and really it 

1856
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:53,330
wasn't him.
I could see that because I'm.

1857
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,683
Matthew takes off like he's funny,
but he becomes the matthew that he is 

1858
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:02,310
for the rest of the show.
About six episodes,

1859
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:06,310
four to six episodes in.
You see him start

1860
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,120
to become the matthew that you.
When you,

1861
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:10,690
when you think of news radio.
Oh yeah.

1862
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:12,010
Matthew.
Um,

1863
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:13,660
so it feels like.
Same thing with you.

1864
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:15,250
Well you weren't even the first guy,
right?

1865
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:16,510
Pilot.
They had a different guy.

1866
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,750
And then you,
Ray Romano,

1867
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,220
was he the guy?
Ray Romano,

1868
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,810
who was the,
you know,

1869
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:25,690
he was the guy before me.
This is what happened.

1870
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:26,524
Ray Romano was casting it originally and
then I guess while they were shooting 

1871
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:30,934
the pilot,
they decided to go a different 

1872
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:33,940
direction.
I don't know what that means.

1873
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:37,750
So they brought in another guy and that 
guy did it and then after the pilot they

1874
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:38,584
said we want to replace that guy.
And so then they had this open casting 

1875
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:43,360
call thing and then I got involved in 
that.

1876
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,130
And what had you been doing at that 
point?

1877
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:45,964
Stand up?
I was thinking about moving back to New 

1878
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,063
York and thinking I should've got,
shouldn't have got a fucking apartment 

1879
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:49,900
in la.

1880
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:50,733
Oh my God,
that's what I came out here for a show 

1881
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:56,230
called hardball.
It was a show by this guy.

1882
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,133
I'm Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran,
these two guys who wrote for married 

1883
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:01,534
with children and they also wrote for,
I think they role for the simpsons and 

1884
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,650
they wrote for a lot of shit.
They were really funny guys.

1885
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,133
They came up with a great pilot.
Me and Jim Brewer and a bunch of other 

1886
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:18,260
great guys were in it and then Fox got 
ahold of it and just sort of fist it and

1887
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,370
just came in it's eyeballs and just 
twisted it all around,

1888
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,320
a really hacky it just a really hacky 
version,

1889
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:28,540
what it once was and then eventually got
canceled.

1890
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:32,170
So I thought being a young dumb guy that
I was,

1891
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:32,981
I thought,
ah,

1892
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:34,780
this,
this show is definitely gonna be a hit.

1893
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,890
I should get an apartment.

1894
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,020
I'm going to live out here.
I might as well got a year lease,

1895
01:24:38,021 --> 01:24:39,550
you know,
everything's going great.

1896
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,900
And then all the sudden the show gets 
canceled.

1897
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:42,170
I'm like,
what am I doing out here?

1898
01:24:42,171 --> 01:24:45,100
Like I don't have any friends out here,
I don't know anybody.

1899
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,050
My friends were all back home.
And I was like,

1900
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:49,690
Gosh,
she just moved back to New York and then

1901
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,123
I got a development deal.
It's like NBC got in touch with my 

1902
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:55,414
management and they asked me if I wanted
to do my own show or if I wanted to do 

1903
01:24:59,981 --> 01:25:02,440
this show that they have already.
Um,

1904
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:06,700
this show called news radio.
So I got to watch the pilot before,

1905
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,250
I had no idea what it was before anybody
ever saw it.

1906
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:10,084
I got a vhs tape of the pilot before the
ever aired on TV and so I got to watch 

1907
01:25:14,231 --> 01:25:16,510
that and then I auditioned for it.

1908
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:17,523
So it was a big advantage and that like 
I kind of understood like the style 

1909
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:22,264
rhythm of the show that they did,
but it was really interesting was what 

1910
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:25,940
he did was the first,
um,

1911
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,290
the first audition wasn't funny 
necessarily.

1912
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,880
It was just a scene and I was like,
this is weird.

1913
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,430
Like,
because the pilot was really funny,

1914
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:34,264
but this seems like they did it on 
purpose to see if people would ham it 

1915
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:37,804
up.
Like they did just didn't want anybody 

1916
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,153
wasn't playing it real.
And so they weeded people out by making 

1917
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:45,850
something that wasn't really that funny.
I'll fucking crazy.

1918
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,510
And then the second time I come back and
it's hilarious.

1919
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:52,480
The second time the banter is just 
genius.

1920
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:53,800
And I'm like,
oh,

1921
01:25:53,801 --> 01:25:56,680
these clever pitches.
Like I see what they did,

1922
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:57,543
they just whittled it down for people 
who down to people who could play it 

1923
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:01,690
straight.
That's,

1924
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,070
that's.
I mean I'm not insidious in

1925
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,530
a negative way,
but that's ingenious.

1926
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:10,040
Maybe is the word I'm looking for.
So instead of insidious that's like,

1927
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:12,160
I don't think like that.
Now I'm just like,

1928
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:13,583
we cast clerks.
I still kept the same weight when we 

1929
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:19,580
cast clerks.
We had a first avenue playhouse,

1930
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,250
was a little theater dinner theater in 
Atlantic Highlands,

1931
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,323
New Jersey,
and so we put an ad out like I think in 

1932
01:26:25,761 --> 01:26:26,594
the free paper and I hung up ads any 
place where like college kids 

1933
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,750
congregated and stuff.
Mom with college at the time,

1934
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:33,584
now it's a mum with university.
So we have this open casting call and 

1935
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:38,840
you know,
as we were,

1936
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:39,763
as people are coming through,
we're seeing people do things that like 

1937
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,450
we're blowing us out of the water.
I had no experience.

1938
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:48,523
Maryland Gagliardi the girl that plays 
Veronica and the movie she got cast 

1939
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:52,304
because she like cried during the 
audition and I remember like looking at 

1940
01:26:55,191 --> 01:26:57,140
my friend's going like,
who could do this?

1941
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,183
Who could just like cry like this and 
none of them audition with comedy like 

1942
01:27:01,821 --> 01:27:04,430
Bryan,
Ohio and underplayed Dante audition with

1943
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:07,100
a piece from like,
don't be afraid of the dark at.

1944
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:09,830
No not there'll be afraid of the dark.
Oh fuck yeah.

1945
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:14,150
Maybe don't be one more.
Alan Arkin is like a stocking.

1946
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:14,984
Audrey Hepburn and she's blind and he's 
like robbing the place alone in the 

1947
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:18,974
dark.
Maybe this will go,

1948
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,340
but it's a real like killer monologue.
That's nothing like his character.

1949
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,320
So we were like,
this guy's fucking.

1950
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:26,090
We can act.
If he could act like that,

1951
01:27:26,091 --> 01:27:28,850
he can fucking say I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

1952
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:30,650
And stuff like that.
So yeah,

1953
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:33,710
I could see that was my process.
Just I'm blown away.

1954
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:36,340
I'm easily impressed.
Like so people come through.

1955
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:38,180
I'm like,
you cried like,

1956
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,250
oh my God,
he's the greatest actor,

1957
01:27:39,251 --> 01:27:40,720
cyber so in my life,
or you know,

1958
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,923
crazy,
crazy person who could pretend that 

1959
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:46,220
something is real when it's not,
no doubt,

1960
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:46,940
God dammit.

1961
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,830
That's part of the problem.
And the ability.

1962
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:51,350
Men is not a part of the problems and 
this is it.

1963
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:54,590
You have to be a little fucking cuckoo.
Genesis Rodriguez,

1964
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,400
who was an actress in a couple of 
months.

1965
01:27:57,401 --> 01:27:58,190
I did,
she,

1966
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,120
she came from Telanovela.
So she,

1967
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,800
uh,
the Spanish Tele Novella.

1968
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,480
So,
uh,

1969
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,433
you know,
we were t,

1970
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,720
she did a scene and Tusk and she's 
crying and I was like,

1971
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:10,010
that was amazing,
man.

1972
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,570
It was crazy.
Like,

1973
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:14,720
it's like you orchestrated a tear for 
the right line.

1974
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:16,520
It just rolled and hit at the right 
time.

1975
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:17,930
And she's going,
yeah,

1976
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,793
she's going on Tele.
You've got to know how to cry like 

1977
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:22,250
crazy,
like every episode,

1978
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:25,460
somebody crying and stuff.
And she also described the process.

1979
01:28:25,461 --> 01:28:26,294
She was like,
you know,

1980
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,530
well first she was like,
here,

1981
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,770
like,
just give me a sec,

1982
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:30,604
say something funny.
And so Jason Muse was there and Jason 

1983
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:33,774
who started telling him it was fucking 
funny story and she just starts bawling 

1984
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,340
and laughing while she's balling but 
literally looks like she's crying.

1985
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,770
I was like,
that's fucked up and shit.

1986
01:28:42,771 --> 01:28:43,604
And she said,
you have to do that on Telanovela while 

1987
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:50,990
somebody is on an in an earwig in your 
ear reading you the dialogue,

1988
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:53,480
you will,
they get scripts,

1989
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:54,800
this thick,
thick is a dick.

1990
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,850
So they can't learn all that dialogue 
and they shoot like 20,

1991
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,190
30 pages a day.
So they stick in their ears,

1992
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,580
a little,
a little a receiver

1993
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:07,360
and essentially the directors and 
control room and you know,

1994
01:29:07,361 --> 01:29:09,250
they should have like a soap opera.
There's multiple cameras,

1995
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:13,960
but they are giving them the lines and 
they are saying it's simultaneously.

1996
01:29:13,961 --> 01:29:16,240
And I was like,
how do you fucking do that as your brain

1997
01:29:16,241 --> 01:29:17,590
work like that?
And she goes,

1998
01:29:17,591 --> 01:29:20,170
say anything to me,
give me a nice long sentence.

1999
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:21,423
And so I went for the sentence in 
English language has all the letters in 

2000
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:24,224
it,
the quick Brown Fox jumps over the lazy 

2001
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:28,540
dog.
And as I got to quick,

2002
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,220
she,
it's true.

2003
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,150
She,
uh,

2004
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:36,180
she started following me and finished at
the exact same time like it was,

2005
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:41,910
it was pretty fucking impressive.
She doesn't seem crazy by stretching the

2006
01:29:42,011 --> 01:29:42,940
imagination.
I asked her,

2007
01:29:42,941 --> 01:29:44,050
I said,
how can you fucking do that?

2008
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:44,980
She's like,
I don't know.

2009
01:29:44,981 --> 01:29:46,300
It's just a family thing.
She's like,

2010
01:29:46,301 --> 01:29:48,340
my dad.
She said her dad,

2011
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,900
her dad's a big performer,
singer.

2012
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,260
She said,
my dad can make his hair stand up on his

2013
01:29:53,261 --> 01:29:56,200
arm and get goose bumps just by looking 
at it.

2014
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,460
Oh.
And it's like,

2015
01:29:57,461 --> 01:29:57,851
wow,
that's.

2016
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:58,540
I mean,
what a,

2017
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,880
what a weird super power to have.
But like,

2018
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:01,923
cool,

2019
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:02,903
well there are definitely things,
weird things like that where people 

2020
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:09,240
inherit them from their parents,
like ice data girl who couldn't even see

2021
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:11,430
a needle in a movie.
She would faint,

2022
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,030
like if she saw someone getting a shot 
in the movie,

2023
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,880
she was squeamish,
but she was like woof.

2024
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:20,580
And Her dad,
who I believe was a dentist.

2025
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,800
So like you would think the guy saw a 
lot of needles.

2026
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,430
That guy will do the same thing.
Like he,

2027
01:30:26,431 --> 01:30:28,770
if,
if he saw something bad he would faint.

2028
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:29,973
So even though he normally saw neil,
he probably stuck needles into guns and 

2029
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:35,020
shit like that.
In his job he was a dentist.

2030
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:36,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

2031
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:39,070
So he,
he's doing shit.

2032
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:41,060
And then watching trauma until she was 
telling

2033
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,880
me that are her,
um,

2034
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:45,730
her brother had like a real severe 
sunburn.

2035
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,170
The point where you're like,
blisters,

2036
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:47,650
you know,
like,

2037
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,483
where it's like,
Whoa,

2038
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,700
you really fuck this up.
He saw it and he fainted.

2039
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,680
And they were like,
what the hell?

2040
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,390
Like he couldn't help it.
It was just,

2041
01:30:55,391 --> 01:30:56,170
he was.
So,

2042
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:59,610
you know,
you love your buddy if you don't like,

2043
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,000
you react like that.
It's like,

2044
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:02,130
you know,
sunburned.

2045
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:04,720
It's been so weird.
I don't think it's his fault.

2046
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,340
So what I'm saying,
I don't think it's selection.

2047
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,860
Yeah man.
There's something in the system.

2048
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,960
If something bizarre in the system,

2049
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:11,903
like,
act when people tell stories when 

2050
01:31:13,061 --> 01:31:13,930
they're just like,
you know,

2051
01:31:13,931 --> 01:31:17,370
and then fucking tour this,
do that and shit.

2052
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:20,980
The idea of I'm not,
I'm low tolerance for threshold for pain

2053
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:21,814
myself.
And I like hearing people tell stories 

2054
01:31:23,201 --> 01:31:24,034
about injuries.

2055
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,131
I,
you know,

2056
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:27,000
I react.
Yeah,

2057
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,220
well everybody does,
right?

2058
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:30,800
Like you watched those videos.
I watched some poor guy,

2059
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,650
oh my God,
who let this fucking guy do this.

2060
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:34,603
This guy who was like ridiculously 
overweight and they set up a skateboard 

2061
01:31:38,841 --> 01:31:41,690
up on a ramp.
Like balancing it on this.

2062
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,020
They just see that,
oh my God,

2063
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:46,910
it's awful.
It's awful.

2064
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,110
But when you watch someone like that 
where you know they're going to get hurt

2065
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,390
and then when they get it get hurt,
it's really bad.

2066
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,150
You know that feeling that you get like 
a sharpness,

2067
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,223
like almost like a sharpness and 
yourselves where your whole body is 

2068
01:31:59,771 --> 01:32:00,220
like,
fuck

2069
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,320
Jesus.
Sometimes at great heights,

2070
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:04,390
I get that.
If I look inside of a building,

2071
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:05,224
I'm like,
Jesus,

2072
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:07,690
that runs right through you,
like move back.

2073
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,010
It's almost like the adrenaline becomes 
like stalagmites coming off of a fucking

2074
01:32:12,011 --> 01:32:12,844
ceiling.
Just they say that that is built and 

2075
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:15,274
even babies have that.
They did a test with babies that a long 

2076
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:18,844
table like this and then in the middle 
here instead of it being would that 

2077
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:27,070
plexi glass and it was clear so that the
mother went under the table and the baby

2078
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:28,960
at the other and she was like,
come on and the baby would crawl,

2079
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:31,930
but as soon as the baby got to the clear
part,

2080
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:36,010
which is still a table right,
went back and would not go forward.

2081
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,890
Good.
That's built into us for some reason.

2082
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,390
Good.
Someone posted,

2083
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,350
someone posted it shows is that fucking 
thought,

2084
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,333
but somebody posted a picture today from
a playground in the 19 twenties and I 

2085
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:56,500
don't know if it's real because I really
probably shouldn't be talking about it,

2086
01:32:56,501 --> 01:32:57,334
but if it is real like Jesus Christ,
these bars were like 50 feet off the 

2087
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:01,510
ground.

2088
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:03,640
These kids are just climbing ladders and
shit.

2089
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:05,290
These metal ladders.
I mean the.

2090
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:08,850
The way the setup look like today.
There's not a chance in hell.

2091
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:12,490
You let your kids play on this thing.
He would freak the fuck out.

2092
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:14,620
Like look at this.
Look at this God damn thing.

2093
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:16,743
Look at this.
How many kids got hurt before they were 

2094
01:33:18,101 --> 01:33:20,750
like,
maybe we should died every day.

2095
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:22,660
We should bring it in and they'll look 
at that height.

2096
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,513
Dude,
they're dead because even if it's all 

2097
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,060
sand,
you're still hitting something hard.

2098
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,010
They didn't care.
They didn't want you to live.

2099
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,250
Look at the all riding bikes back.
There were no cars.

2100
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:35,340
So yours is early 1980 [inaudible] 
callback.

2101
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,660
Is that a body?
Is that a one falling from the sky?

2102
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,860
That's not real.
Is it?

2103
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:43,890
Or the hanging from something as a swing
that swing that swinging off the fucking

2104
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:44,680
ground.

2105
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,850
It looks like a body though,
doesn't it?

2106
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:46,684
If you don't look at the lines,
the lines are like those falling marks 

2107
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:49,954
at a cartoon because it's hanging,
hanging off a fucking kids are playing 

2108
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,420
around.
It's a crazy picture though,

2109
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:57,460
isn't it?
Look at that.

2110
01:33:57,820 --> 01:33:59,620
Yeah.
Things were a lot more dangerous and art

2111
01:33:59,621 --> 01:34:01,360
and that's even before our day.
Yeah,

2112
01:34:01,361 --> 01:34:03,190
that's before our different back east,
you know,

2113
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:04,930
Action Park.
No,

2114
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,580
I was just going to say I broke my arm 
on one of those things.

2115
01:34:07,581 --> 01:34:08,351
Did you really?
Yeah.

2116
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,930
When I was a little kid,
I fell off the monkey bars,

2117
01:34:10,931 --> 01:34:14,410
snapped my arm and posted on it,
snapped it.

2118
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,990
And so you got your first cast.
At what age?

2119
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:19,460
I think I was six.
You have people sign it?

2120
01:34:19,461 --> 01:34:22,270
Do you have a lot of friends?
I believe I had people sign it many.

2121
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,590
Was it like there's no room.

2122
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,000
Sorry.
I don't remember.

2123
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,450
Or was it a lot of like love you mom?
Probably.

2124
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:29,730
Mostly,
yeah.

2125
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,723
Mostly that.
But those things are fucking dangerous 

2126
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:36,880
shit on the bottom of it.
In New Jersey there's a theme.

2127
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:40,150
Park is closed now.
I'm all grown up,

2128
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:41,020
man.
We'd go there.

2129
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:46,470
They would do shit like a water slide 
that people got fucking hurt on.

2130
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:50,110
They would do these things.
It was before insurance,

2131
01:34:50,111 --> 01:34:51,910
I guess where,
you know,

2132
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,230
they had a wave pool.
Um,

2133
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,113
so a wave pool is big pool and then like
they've got these giant beaters in the 

2134
01:34:59,211 --> 01:35:00,044
underwater at the end that are huge,
that just constantly make fucking waves 

2135
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:07,670
and people would get crushed under them 
and get killed.

2136
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:11,810
They had this like slalom,
race a thing,

2137
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:15,020
whereas you kind of sitting on this 
cement track,

2138
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:18,320
there you go.
New Jersey's action park offered fun and

2139
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,390
injury for the whole family.

2140
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,610
Jesus,
that was a waterslide.

2141
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:23,503
Look at that water slide.
You were completely in a bluetube that 

2142
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:27,194
went down a mountain.
It did a a loop in the dark where a lot 

2143
01:35:30,651 --> 01:35:33,110
of people were getting hurt,
like they didn't make the full loop.

2144
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:35,750
They just got jammed and then people 
Clyde into you bang,

2145
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,610
Bang,
back injuries.

2146
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:38,900
Couple dead.
Oh my God.

2147
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:40,340
A couple times.
But that was.

2148
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:42,530
That was fun.
When we were kids,

2149
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,730
you know,
you didn't want to get hurt,

2150
01:35:43,731 --> 01:35:46,580
but like nobody told you,
you might get hurt that badly.

2151
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:48,380
Some things were sensible.
Like I was a child.

2152
01:35:48,381 --> 01:35:50,240
If I saw monkey bars that,
hi,

2153
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:52,730
I'm number one.
I didn't even go near the fucking monkey

2154
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:54,430
bars,
but if I saw them that high,

2155
01:35:54,431 --> 01:35:56,270
it'd be like,
this is ridiculous.

2156
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,880
Like this is clearly.
Clearly we're being filmed or something.

2157
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,253
Yeah,
right.

2158
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,673
It'd be like,
this is.

2159
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:04,280
This was built by somebody who doesn't 
know the child,

2160
01:36:04,281 --> 01:36:05,114
looks like or hates them,
tricked him into going high so they can 

2161
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:11,630
fall and die.
The more blood I get,

2162
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,890
young child,
blood to Bay,

2163
01:36:12,891 --> 01:36:13,724
then the younger one could look.
They subscribed to the theory of what's 

2164
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:17,174
her fuck.
But that was a real concern back then 

2165
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:19,754
about mouths to feed.
I mean we're talking about the 

2166
01:36:20,871 --> 01:36:21,704
depression.
So you think they built the playgrounds 

2167
01:36:23,031 --> 01:36:25,180
like that.
So out the week real.

2168
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:28,490
No Way.
Well then you have to agree that we live

2169
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:32,540
in a better time because nobody ran on 
that platform and the election of like,

2170
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:35,180
hey man,
only the strong survive.

2171
01:36:35,181 --> 01:36:37,130
So you know,
if your kid goes to the playground,

2172
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:39,530
falls off the monkey bars.
That's on you.

2173
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,170
Well,
um,

2174
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,540
we certainly are more protective of our 
children today and we'll just understand

2175
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:49,660
child rearing and understand mortality 
and we understand like the,

2176
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,240
the bad things that you can do to your 
kid while you're developing them.

2177
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,073
But it's,
it's a weird catch 22 and you'll 

2178
01:36:56,091 --> 01:36:57,860
probably agree with me as a parent and 
my kids,

2179
01:36:57,861 --> 01:36:59,600
you got three,
you know more than me.

2180
01:36:59,601 --> 01:37:00,434
I got one,
but go ahead.

2181
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,313
But I was just gonna say is like there's
a weird catch 22 in that you want to 

2182
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:06,374
give them all the love in the world.
You want to support them as much as you 

2183
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:10,274
can.
You want to be there 100 percent for 

2184
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:14,810
them.
But you also realize that everyone,

2185
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:16,210
you know,
that's interesting,

2186
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:17,833
had to overcome some bizarre childhood,
overcome some crazy for all my favorite 

2187
01:37:22,941 --> 01:37:23,774
people.
Like all my favorite people tell me 

2188
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:30,850
terror stories about like growing up and
what their parents or what their dad did

2189
01:37:31,341 --> 01:37:32,510
or like,
Holy Shit.

2190
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:36,050
So many people,
especially the comedians that I know,

2191
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:38,450
it was all just like,
oh fuck.

2192
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:41,510
And then what happened?
Oh fuck dude.

2193
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,553
And they're the funniest fucking people.
They're the most interesting kids that 

2194
01:37:45,921 --> 01:37:47,660
aren't,
uh,

2195
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,950
well,
I know I look,

2196
01:37:48,951 --> 01:37:49,784
I'm not a helicopter parent and I know 
I'm the guy that paves the way for his 

2197
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:53,690
kid.
She wants to act.

2198
01:37:53,691 --> 01:37:54,021
I'm like,
oh,

2199
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:55,500
let's make a movie.
You don't really,

2200
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:56,130
you know,
that's not

2201
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,300
normal,
but you know what,

2202
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:58,830
man,
the only thing that's wrong with that,

2203
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:00,240
this is the only thing that's wrong with
that,

2204
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,133
and this is where we have a problem of 
human beings is the only thing that's 

2205
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:05,214
wrong with that is the idea that she's 
not going to have to start making a 

2206
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:09,954
living on her own.
She's going to be able to carry forth 

2207
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:16,350
under her dad's momentum,
but the only reason why that's a problem

2208
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:17,184
even remotely has because we have this 
absurd idea that it should be super 

2209
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:23,490
important for you to take care of 
yourself.

2210
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:27,930
That it should be super important for 
you to financially carry yourself.

2211
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,400
You know,
I explain,

2212
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:30,243
explain.
I've been fucking with this idea more 

2213
01:38:32,131 --> 01:38:34,290
and more lately.
So I fuck with it.

2214
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:35,124
Is this my,
my buddy Eddie Wong who's a chef and a 

2215
01:38:38,461 --> 01:38:42,610
really fucking interesting,
cool guy was on a podcast and uh,

2216
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:46,530
Eddie was talking about universal basic 
income.

2217
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,590
And at first I thought,
why you're going to,

2218
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:52,590
you're going to give people free money.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2219
01:38:52,591 --> 01:38:54,180
That's so stupid,
dude.

2220
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:57,150
You can't do that.
Then the more I thought about it,

2221
01:38:57,151 --> 01:38:57,841
the more I said,
well,

2222
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:00,390
it seems like when you give people 
money,

2223
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:02,940
like it kills their motivation for a lot
of folks,

2224
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,880
but what if that's just like your needs 
are covered?

2225
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:06,723
Okay.
Is that really true that if you give 

2226
01:39:08,431 --> 01:39:11,070
people something and you give them 
security,

2227
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,280
that it takes away their creativity?
Or is this just.

2228
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:17,460
I mean the only we don't know because 
everybody's always been in need.

2229
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:20,220
They overcame that need and then they 
became successful.

2230
01:39:20,221 --> 01:39:21,054
Right,
and that's the story that we hear over 

2231
01:39:21,571 --> 01:39:22,770
and over again,
but what if.

2232
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:25,560
What if all your needs were taken care 
of?

2233
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:26,640
Like food,
shelter,

2234
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:29,940
like you have basic stuff,
you know you're not going to get rich,

2235
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:32,640
but you have enough to eat and you 
always have a roof over your head,

2236
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,970
which is first of all,
wouldn't we all like each other more?

2237
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,340
If that was the case,
if we didn't have to worry,

2238
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:41,970
if nobody had to worry about how much 
money they had.

2239
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,830
Nobody had to worry about not being able
to eat.

2240
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,440
Nobody worried about not having a place 
to sleep.

2241
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,603
That sounds Utopian right,
but that's almost doable financially if 

2242
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:52,734
you look at the amount of money we have 
versus the amount of people we have 

2243
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:57,840
versus how much money people make.
It's like,

2244
01:39:58,230 --> 01:39:59,910
Ooh,
it's kind of close.

2245
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:02,040
Like we would have to restructure a lot 
of shit,

2246
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:06,090
but it seems like they might be able to 
give every person $12,000

2247
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:07,560
a year,
something like that.

2248
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:13,700
And I think if we could figure out some 
sort of a way to do things like that,

2249
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:15,923
I think we would have a giant 
alleviation of tension and struggle at 

2250
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:24,400
its base level survival shit.
Like to elevate us as a,

2251
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:27,210
as a people just above the survival 
thing.

2252
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:31,440
So then we can relax more and get better
at all this other shit.

2253
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,810
But we got to get past the survival 
thing.

2254
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:37,320
And the base of the survival is what bay
basic food,

2255
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,030
basic shelter.
Uh,

2256
01:40:39,031 --> 01:40:39,930
you know,
having,

2257
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:41,820
having a roof over your head and having 
food.

2258
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:42,843
Well,
if you could just guarantee that if we 

2259
01:40:43,861 --> 01:40:46,290
could all collectively say,
let's figure out,

2260
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:48,390
let's pile all this fucking money 
together,

2261
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:51,330
let's figure out how we can make this 
better.

2262
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:52,164
What's number one with God?
We gotta figure out a way to make it 

2263
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,540
easier to figure out what the fuck you 
want to do with your life.

2264
01:40:58,850 --> 01:40:59,683
You don't.
You shouldn't have to just dive into 

2265
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,860
some job and be desperate.
I mean,

2266
01:41:02,861 --> 01:41:04,180
we were talking today,
Jamie,

2267
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:05,103
about people that we know that you know,
that may be wanting to do something 

2268
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:09,394
else,
but they played it safe and now they're 

2269
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:11,644
kind of stuck in this weird place where 
they can't get out of playing it safe 

2270
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:16,210
because they have bills and they get 
trapped.

2271
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:21,430
I feel like if we had some sort of like 
universal basic income,

2272
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:22,264
it's totally possible that way less 
people would do that and then more 

2273
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:30,070
people would try to make independent 
films or more people would try to become

2274
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:30,904
standup comics or more people would try 
to write books or more people would try 

2275
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:36,670
to build cars or do whatever the fuck 
they're compelled to do.

2276
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:39,900
How did you do it without getting 
$12,000?

2277
01:41:39,901 --> 01:41:42,370
$3 a year?
I got lucky.

2278
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:47,371
I worked while you wait for it to show 
up at your door.

2279
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,870
You actually went out into the world and
had to.

2280
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:54,730
You had to move some elements around in 
reality to make a new reality.

2281
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:56,500
Yeah,
I guess man,

2282
01:41:57,030 --> 01:42:00,130
but I mean I honestly didn't have a lot 
of ourselves and exceptional.

2283
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,990
I consider yourself an exceptional human
being.

2284
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:02,824
Now.
That's what you consider yourself an 

2285
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:04,630
exceptional human being.

2286
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:08,750
Then I knew I was good at taekwondo.
That was about until had a skill.

2287
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:12,250
I was good at one thing.
I knew I was good at one thing.

2288
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:13,200
I was like,
God dammit.

2289
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,460
If I can get good at that,
it's totally possible.

2290
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,580
I can get good at life.
SMART,

2291
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,513
smart way to look at it,
but at the very least you're a hired 

2292
01:42:20,141 --> 01:42:20,974
hand.
Definitely taking care of people's 

2293
01:42:23,111 --> 01:42:25,200
problems with your bare fists and Shit.
No.

2294
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,053
Well,
I wasn't really taking care of any 

2295
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:30,670
competing,
but if you had to society clubs,

2296
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:33,100
they'd have any competitions.
I'd already realized that I could get my

2297
01:42:33,101 --> 01:42:36,820
ass kicked too easy by wrestler or by a 
a good boxer.

2298
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:39,790
I was having problems already.
So inspiring problems.

2299
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,200
But you have,
you built,

2300
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:44,170
you built a world and I'm not saying 
like,

2301
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:45,573
I like your idea,
but at the same time it's like not 

2302
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:49,744
anybody can do exactly what you did,
but anybody can take the steps that you 

2303
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:52,450
did.

2304
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:52,950
Well,
I'm just.

2305
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:57,230
I'm not saying that the same thing that 
anybody can take opportunity.

2306
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:58,283
Yeah.
This world we live in offers ample 

2307
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:01,210
opportunity.
That's not what I'm saying.

2308
01:43:01,211 --> 01:43:03,470
I'm not saying 12 grand more a year.
Maybe.

2309
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,790
I really feel like it's possible that 
we're doing it wrong.

2310
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,060
I just think it collectively,
and I've said this before,

2311
01:43:10,061 --> 01:43:12,250
so if you heard me say it before anybody
listening,

2312
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:13,084
I apologize,
but I always say that if we looked at 

2313
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:18,280
ourselves as an organism,
if we looked at society as an organism,

2314
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,293
what would we.
What would we want to fix other 

2315
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,273
organism?
Would we want to make the muscle 

2316
01:43:22,281 --> 01:43:24,940
stronger or would we want to kill the 
cancer?

2317
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:27,490
Would we want to figure out what's wrong
with it?

2318
01:43:27,491 --> 01:43:30,310
We want to cure the disease.
Well,

2319
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:34,570
the disease has got to be poverty,
like it's the number one problem that we

2320
01:43:34,571 --> 01:43:36,010
have as crime and poverty.

2321
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:40,540
Like we've got to focus on that area of 
our world and instead of thinking of is,

2322
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,413
oh,
they should pull themselves up by their 

2323
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:43,240
bootstraps,
or oh,

2324
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:44,610
they need the fucking,
you know,

2325
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:47,140
realize there's opportunity out there.
You just got to go get it.

2326
01:43:47,141 --> 01:43:52,070
Everybody's go their own path.
I think collectively as a human species,

2327
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:57,250
we have to look at the world's problems.
Like the world is like real deep poverty

2328
01:43:57,681 --> 01:43:58,514
and social problems and look at it 
almost like as if we're a living 

2329
01:44:00,831 --> 01:44:01,664
creature.
If we're living creature and there's 

2330
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:06,380
parts of us that are starving to death,
you got to get that part food.

2331
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,150
Right.
I mean that's universal.

2332
01:44:08,151 --> 01:44:10,310
That's why those commercials with Sally 
Fields,

2333
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,160
Sally struthers selling brothers were so
compelling.

2334
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:13,994
Right.
Because you would see those babies and 

2335
01:44:15,681 --> 01:44:16,210
they did

2336
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:18,090
somebody who's hungry and I've got some.

2337
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,880
You're like,
Holy Shit,

2338
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,463
these are.
I feel like we only have a certain 

2339
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:25,640
amount of time,
you know,

2340
01:44:25,641 --> 01:44:26,474
just as a,
as an organism that has a finite 

2341
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:31,370
lifespan,
you have like 100 years if you're lucky,

2342
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,653
you know,
and this thing that we're doing now 

2343
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:36,920
where we have a president,
you know,

2344
01:44:36,921 --> 01:44:40,910
and you have to fucking go out there and
earn your keep boy and you know,

2345
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:41,744
you get a job in oil,
looks like you're going to have to get 

2346
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:46,340
married now you're a dad and then you 
just,

2347
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:48,350
you're just like,
all of a sudden I'm dying.

2348
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,570
Like I was living.
I worked in a factory,

2349
01:44:50,571 --> 01:44:51,740
now I'm dying.
Right.

2350
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:52,963
I don't know if that's the right way to 
make the most productive society or the 

2351
01:44:59,211 --> 01:45:01,410
most enjoyable experience for the people
that are living in.

2352
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,460
It's like a little more jewelry,
mom.

2353
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,780
Hi.
A little bit.

2354
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:08,500
A little,
a little more joy would,

2355
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:09,363
would,
uh,

2356
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,670
the American experience would benefit 
from a little more jewelry.

2357
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,670
There's so much toil.
And as you said,

2358
01:45:15,671 --> 01:45:17,350
there's so much.
You can do anything here,

2359
01:45:17,351 --> 01:45:18,184
but you got to do it.
And we spend so much time chasing 

2360
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:22,683
something that makes life easier.
I'm not going to argue that money makes 

2361
01:45:25,571 --> 01:45:27,500
things easier to do,
um,

2362
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:30,080
but chasing,
you know,

2363
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,880
the idea of prosperity and one direction
as opposed to spiritual prosperity.

2364
01:45:33,881 --> 01:45:34,714
Not saying religion,
saying prosperity of one's soul growing 

2365
01:45:37,301 --> 01:45:40,510
as a person,
something that doesn't have to stop just

2366
01:45:40,511 --> 01:45:42,250
because now you've entered the 
workplace,

2367
01:45:42,251 --> 01:45:43,084
now you're married and now you're 
falling into place with the model for 

2368
01:45:47,081 --> 01:45:48,190
society.
Like,

2369
01:45:48,191 --> 01:45:49,024
you know,
there's still a space in there for 

2370
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:52,943
while.
And I think maybe this is where I'm 

2371
01:45:54,401 --> 01:45:56,320
coming around to your free $12,000
a year.

2372
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,930
It's not my idea by any stretch of the 
idea of three,

2373
01:45:58,931 --> 01:45:59,764
$12,000
a year because maybe it does leave a 

2374
01:46:01,241 --> 01:46:05,290
little breathing space where suddenly in
that space somebody like,

2375
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:07,930
oh I want to do this and this would make
me happy.

2376
01:46:07,931 --> 01:46:10,570
And when I'm happy at this,
it'll trickle down at work.

2377
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:11,404
Like so many people.
Like I go from one job to this job and 

2378
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,850
you know,
and then I get the weekends,

2379
01:46:15,851 --> 01:46:18,940
maybe in my weekends are Tuesday and 
Thursday or something like that.

2380
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,500
So yeah,
you're right,

2381
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:24,800
I was thinking like I even,
I got privileges and,

2382
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:27,300
and fucking breaks that a lot of people 
wouldn't get.

2383
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:30,580
I came from a poor white people,
but it didn't matter.

2384
01:46:30,581 --> 01:46:33,580
It was white people and so there are 
breaks for me out there somewhere in the

2385
01:46:33,581 --> 01:46:35,500
world and I always think through that 
prism.

2386
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:36,843
But you're right man,
there's a lot of people out there that 

2387
01:46:38,951 --> 01:46:41,050
would benefit from like,
here's a cushion.

2388
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,690
Here's something to start with.
Where do you go from there?

2389
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,080
And,
and what does that $4,000

2390
01:46:47,081 --> 01:46:49,030
a month just for being an American?
Yeah,

2391
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,220
mean it sounds like thinking,

2392
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:50,761
oh,
you know,

2393
01:46:50,761 --> 01:46:52,830
everybody's scamming to try to get 
welfare money.

2394
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:56,760
How about just give it to them,
how just give them enough to survive.

2395
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:59,400
Just give everybody enough to survive 
and then let's work this shit out.

2396
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:01,800
And then when you make more than x 
amount a year,

2397
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:02,910
you can,
you know,

2398
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:05,550
if you're like Kevin Smith or me,
you know,

2399
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:06,271
you would say,
look,

2400
01:47:06,271 --> 01:47:08,850
I don't want my 12 grand.
Put it back into the system.

2401
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,380
Exactly.
Pay All your taxes,

2402
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:11,214
all that stuff.
But this would make us feel like we're 

2403
01:47:14,281 --> 01:47:16,230
looking out for each other a little bit.
I mean,

2404
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:17,340
it's not.
I'm not.

2405
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:18,513
I'm not fully formed on this idea.
It's just something on battering around 

2406
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:22,164
in my head,
but I'm battering it around in my head 

2407
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:24,204
the same way I'm batting around this 
idea that there shouldn't really be a 

2408
01:47:26,701 --> 01:47:27,534
president like this.
Just it's only there because we've been 

2409
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:34,140
doing it this way for 300 years,
but if it didn't exist,

2410
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,120
there's no way that's how you would run 
it.

2411
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:37,163
There's no way we would all agree,
but what we should do because once you 

2412
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,353
get one person who knows the most people
with the most money who have been doing 

2413
01:47:42,781 --> 01:47:43,614
this the longest and that person will 
have a giant advantage over everybody 

2414
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:46,584
else and get that person backed up by 
these huge corporations that would 

2415
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:50,484
benefit by this person being an office 
because you'd make laws and make 

2416
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:53,424
environmental rules a little bit lax 
because we can get away with some shit 

2417
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,870
and we could make more money.
There's no way we would say,

2418
01:47:57,871 --> 01:47:58,800
yeah,
let's do it that way.

2419
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,630
There's no fucking way.
We would say,

2420
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:02,490
no,
we want the geniuses of the world.

2421
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:04,860
We want the the professors,
the,

2422
01:48:04,861 --> 01:48:05,241
the,
the,

2423
01:48:05,241 --> 01:48:06,720
the,
the Elon musks,

2424
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:08,340
we want the,
the Bill Gates,

2425
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:12,570
the people that are very wise and very 
intelligent and very rational.

2426
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:16,980
You want to talk to giant groups of them
and we want to form our own opinions and

2427
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:19,590
we should all be voting collectively as 
a group.

2428
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:22,050
There shouldn't be some representative 
government,

2429
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:22,884
some electoral college.
What are you going to fucking wear a 

2430
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:26,640
powdered wig to?
You can't.

2431
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:30,720
You got to ride around on a fucking 
horse with some homemade horseshoes with

2432
01:48:30,721 --> 01:48:33,300
your powdered wig and your electoral 
college.

2433
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:36,180
We're going to read it on a scroll and 
the talents square,

2434
01:48:36,181 --> 01:48:38,730
standing on an apple box.
Fuck off.

2435
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:39,773
That shit is old,
so you make me feel bad because I get 

2436
01:48:42,091 --> 01:48:44,550
high and I'm like,
let me write a movie about.

2437
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:45,384
A guy turns to go to a Walrus.
You get high and you want to change the 

2438
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:48,750
world.
You're a dreamer.

2439
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:51,810
Dreamer of a day sometimes.
Sometimes not at all.

2440
01:48:51,811 --> 01:48:53,970
Sometimes I just want to go watch that 
Hawaiian movie.

2441
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,480
Rwanda.
It's a good movie.

2442
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:56,460
It was good.
It's good.

2443
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:58,850
Let me ask you,
let me ask you about archery,

2444
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,330
which you seem to have fallen in love 
with.

2445
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:01,950
Yes.
I love our fucking hard.

2446
01:49:01,951 --> 01:49:05,340
Is it to pull back a bone arrow?
It's not easy,

2447
01:49:05,341 --> 01:49:10,341
but they make bows for people is like 
little kids like field film.

2448
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,550
It goes back with the and shit depends 
entirely on what you're trying to do.

2449
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:18,360
If you want to shoot a target,
they make bows that a little kid like my

2450
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:21,120
little kids were shooting bows.
Like when my daughter was three,

2451
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,250
I got her a bow and Arrow that she could
kind of pull back.

2452
01:49:23,251 --> 01:49:24,084
I kind of help her or I would have to 
hold onto it and she could pull it back 

2453
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:28,410
and then I go,
we're getting ready to go and one,

2454
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:29,790
two,
three and she would let it go.

2455
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,020
So you could have a redo that later 
before.

2456
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:36,120
That's the way I would need to be 
handled.

2457
01:49:36,121 --> 01:49:36,954
But then for a compound bow you have to 
two possibilities that you're using it 

2458
01:49:40,561 --> 01:49:41,640
for.
One,

2459
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:44,490
which is target archery,
which is what I do more than anything.

2460
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,220
I shoot targets just in my yard and with
friends

2461
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,053
and I'll go to some ranges and there's a
place in Vegas I go to that's really 

2462
01:49:51,611 --> 01:49:52,810
cool.
Um,

2463
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:53,763
and doing that is like you don't need 
that much power because it's just about 

2464
01:49:56,561 --> 01:49:59,320
figuring out where the Arrow's going to 
go and be an accurate about it.

2465
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,040
But then when you get to,
if you wanted to hunt an animal with it,

2466
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,053
then you have a certain obligation to 
make sure that your bow is at least a 

2467
01:50:07,751 --> 01:50:10,090
certain amount,
has a certain amount of power to it.

2468
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:15,080
And most people agree that somewhere 
around 45 or 50 pounds it's,

2469
01:50:15,081 --> 01:50:16,420
it's,
it's debatable.

2470
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:17,403
But in Texas I know they're like,
I think they fought back a law because 

2471
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:23,710
they were trying to keep kids from 
bowhunting unless they could pull back,

2472
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:26,410
I think it was 35 pounds or 45 pounds.
I forget what the weight.

2473
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:28,760
So there's a measure of strength in 
order to do something.

2474
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:30,330
They don't have to do that for driving.
Well,

2475
01:50:30,331 --> 01:50:32,580
the only reason why you gotta be strong 
enough to drive

2476
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:33,763
dad,
it's because it's not ethical because 

2477
01:50:35,571 --> 01:50:36,404
you really almost don't have enough 
kinetic energy to actually penetrate an 

2478
01:50:38,811 --> 01:50:40,750
animal and kill it.
So you wouldn't be,

2479
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:43,640
they'll like harold would stick out of 
him,

2480
01:50:43,730 --> 01:50:45,530
you know,
and it does happen.

2481
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:46,873
So you have a certain amount of 
requirement of the kinetic energy where 

2482
01:50:51,501 --> 01:50:54,300
it's ethical to bowhunt I remember it.
I'm

2483
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:55,163
trying my father in law,
my wife's a step that buyer and a great 

2484
01:51:00,091 --> 01:51:01,810
guy.
Um,

2485
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:06,330
he was uh,
a bone Arrow enthusiast.

2486
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,000
I wouldn't go into a bowhunter because 
then go out and hunt anything.

2487
01:51:09,001 --> 01:51:12,060
But he was good at it.
He won medals and shit like,

2488
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,470
oh wow.
So um,

2489
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:15,530
I was writing Green Arrow at the time 
and I was like,

2490
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,710
you know what man,
I should,

2491
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:20,010
if I'm going to write,
he shoot.

2492
01:51:20,011 --> 01:51:23,940
He knocks and fires and are,
you should try knocking an arrow.

2493
01:51:23,941 --> 01:51:26,550
Just maybe,
maybe there's something there about like

2494
01:51:26,551 --> 01:51:28,680
you can describe it rather than make it 
up.

2495
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,760
And he took me into the backyard with a 
bow and Arrow and a target,

2496
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:36,630
big hate target with thing on it and no 
compound or anything.

2497
01:51:36,631 --> 01:51:38,970
Just a longbow and you know,
I'm like,

2498
01:51:38,971 --> 01:51:40,770
God,
this is gonna be easy.

2499
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,290
Green Arrow Knox,
like six of these at a time and shit and

2500
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,050
knocked one Arrow and went to pull back.

2501
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:50,880
And like the shake began in my arm 
pretty fucking quickly.

2502
01:51:50,881 --> 01:51:52,200
I didn't get very far back for.
I was like,

2503
01:51:52,201 --> 01:51:54,780
Oh shit,
serious Boho.

2504
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,720
Pretty serious fucking bow.
But you know,

2505
01:51:56,721 --> 01:51:57,750
it.
Number one,

2506
01:51:57,751 --> 01:51:58,584
I was like,
I'm not the man I thought I was and I 

2507
01:52:00,301 --> 01:52:01,740
didn't think I was much of a man to 
begin with.

2508
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:03,930
But number two,
I was just like,

2509
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,793
um,
I don't think anyone would ever choose 

2510
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:10,950
this to fight crime.
Oh my God.

2511
01:52:10,951 --> 01:52:11,784
One of those things where you know,
you confront as much as I love this 

2512
01:52:14,101 --> 01:52:15,050
shit.
I love comic books.

2513
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:17,010
Went to,
that was the moment where I was like,

2514
01:52:17,011 --> 01:52:17,844
this shit falls apart.
Like you always find yourself defending 

2515
01:52:19,621 --> 01:52:21,030
the notion of a Batman.
Many people like,

2516
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,133
come on dude,
if you out all the money and you lost 

2517
01:52:23,971 --> 01:52:27,030
your parents had all the time to commit 
to your body,

2518
01:52:27,031 --> 01:52:30,780
turning it into a weapon.
You could be Batman or superman.

2519
01:52:30,781 --> 01:52:31,614
He got,
he comes from,

2520
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:36,480
but there could be a bad thing and then 
all you have to do is try pulling back a

2521
01:52:36,481 --> 01:52:41,481
bone Arrow once and you realize like,
well there couldn't be a green Arrow and

2522
01:52:41,701 --> 01:52:45,770
he's got it easier than a Batman.
So if he could give that can exist,

2523
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:46,070
then

2524
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,903
this probably can't exist.
Although like we were talking about an 

2525
01:52:49,761 --> 01:52:52,370
episode of podcast the other day.
Could,

2526
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,133
could you,
like I saw a video they did on Penn and 

2527
01:52:57,531 --> 01:53:01,700
teller of Penn and teller were doing it 
were somebody shot a bullet at a Samurai

2528
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:02,534
sword and you know,
they had a calibrated so it was hitting 

2529
01:53:05,331 --> 01:53:09,460
directly into the middle of the blade 
and it split the bullet into.

2530
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:12,260
And then the idea was could a butter 
knife to the same thing?

2531
01:53:12,261 --> 01:53:14,060
And of course the butter knife did the 
same thing.

2532
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:16,580
It's split the bullet.
So it didn't matter if it was a hammered

2533
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:20,030
a thousand times razor's Edge Samurai 
sword or a butter knife,

2534
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:21,163
that bullet hitting that target split.
And so we were talking about on the 

2535
01:53:24,571 --> 01:53:25,340
podcast,
I was like,

2536
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,173
well that to me,
I said that to me is proof now that you 

2537
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:32,390
could fight crime with a Katana sword.

2538
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:33,363
Like you have to be super fucking fast.
I said to Scott Leggett and Scott's 

2539
01:53:37,071 --> 01:53:37,904
like,
yeah,

2540
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:40,460
making fun of me because he's gone.
Because I said,

2541
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:42,800
I'm not saying you have to be Batman.
He's like,

2542
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:45,050
and then I'm saying you do have to be 
better.

2543
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:49,070
But I'm saying like if you were the guy 
held a sword and somebody fired a bullet

2544
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:51,650
and it's split with the kickback of the 
bullet,

2545
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,650
throw the sword into you or you know,
like,

2546
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:55,380
well,
could.

2547
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:58,460
This was a concrete block,
was holding the Samurai Sword.

2548
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:00,590
So you know,
we talked about the pockets and then God

2549
01:54:00,591 --> 01:54:01,424
bless the Internet.
Somebody sends us a link of some other 

2550
01:54:03,251 --> 01:54:07,070
fucking show where they had a guy 
holding a sword,

2551
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:12,570
a Samurai swordsman like modern day 
swordsman and cuts of baseball and half.

2552
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:17,090
No fucking metal.
Bb Pellets did.

2553
01:54:17,091 --> 01:54:19,400
It was fucking nuts.
Now the other thing I watched,

2554
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:20,560
it was like,
you know,

2555
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,433
they had the gun calibrated on a hinge 
and a laser scope so that it would hit 

2556
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:29,510
exactly where they were going for this 
guy handwrite it,

2557
01:54:29,511 --> 01:54:30,344
man.

2558
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,350
This is from the 15 hundreds.
That's a Legit Samurai sword.

2559
01:54:35,370 --> 01:54:37,480
Feel how heavy that is.
Like I'm fine.

2560
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:42,260
I didn't live back then I'd be dead.
That's a Legit Samurai sword from the 15

2561
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:44,650
hundreds.
Oh yeah,

2562
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:46,160
that's sharp.
Careful bitch.

2563
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:49,040
Don't do it.
Now.

2564
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:51,920
This guy pulled one agent and he was 
like this,

2565
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:53,893
ready?
And then the guy fired the gun and he 

2566
01:54:56,691 --> 01:54:57,524
went swipes to the air and so you know.
Then they rolled back the footage and 

2567
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:01,724
God damn,
if he didn't fucking split that thing 

2568
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:06,530
and dude like,
are you sure it's not CGI was,

2569
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:07,401
no,
this was real.

2570
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:08,234
You got to look it up.

2571
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:11,240
No,
I haven't.

2572
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:14,130
I supposed to live in a constant world 
of snowpack.

2573
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,070
We must.
We must,

2574
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:17,600
because we didn't think about our 
childhoods when we were kids.

2575
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,820
Some of them would be like the lochness 
monster.

2576
01:55:19,821 --> 01:55:20,601
You'd be like,
fuck yeah,

2577
01:55:20,601 --> 01:55:23,210
it's real.
If you could have snope that shit,

2578
01:55:23,211 --> 01:55:24,950
you've got no imagination in your 
childhood.

2579
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,180
This.
Look at this guy.

2580
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:27,681
Okay.
That was it.

2581
01:55:27,681 --> 01:55:31,130
Right now they play.
He just whipped it out and fucking cut.

2582
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:33,980
Now wait until they play a scam.
First of all,

2583
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:34,843
the of Japanese guy looks like a cock 
block and this guy and his girl leaning 

2584
01:55:38,571 --> 01:55:39,820
over the shoulder like,
hey bro,

2585
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,990
he's about to earn it.
I fucked this guy.

2586
01:55:41,991 --> 01:55:42,830
Watch this

2587
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:46,620
shit.
Yo.

2588
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:50,470
I see CGI.
That's why I ended up there.

2589
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:52,790
See all that red stuff that.
See,

2590
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,090
this is CGI,
bro.

2591
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:55,003
We know for sure the CGI is there.
Is there to maybe remove the ranch and 

2592
01:55:58,831 --> 01:56:00,920
now the Hollywood bowl.
Shit.

2593
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,920
That's real.
That's got to be real.

2594
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:04,950
Look,
they talked to Dr Ramani.

2595
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,150
She's hot,
right?

2596
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:08,640
And then she got to be smart.
They got her there in the desert.

2597
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:12,180
Check out the one where the guy cuts the
softball and baseball rather.

2598
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,670
It's one of those baseball machines.
Pretty big pitches.

2599
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:16,250
I could do it,
but like.

2600
01:56:16,251 --> 01:56:16,740
Yeah,
no,

2601
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,960
I agree to bb man.
I just don't believe that's real.

2602
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,190
You don't think so.
He can be in hoaxed.

2603
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:22,860
C'Mon man.
Believe in big foot.

2604
01:56:22,861 --> 01:56:24,480
When you were a kid.
You're kidding me.

2605
01:56:24,481 --> 01:56:25,314
I lived for bigfoot.
I went looking for bigfoot for a TV 

2606
01:56:26,941 --> 01:56:29,370
show.
I spent a week for bigfoot,

2607
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:31,930
so if you can believe in bigfoot bucket 
and you believe you can't believe in big

2608
01:56:31,931 --> 01:56:33,580
foot because I spent a week later we can
looking for.

2609
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:35,750
I had a bit in my act.
I was doing well.

2610
01:56:35,870 --> 01:56:37,890
You know what you don't find when you go
looking for bigfoot.

2611
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:41,370
Black people are more likely to find big
foot.

2612
01:56:41,371 --> 01:56:43,620
Then you are black people out looking 
for bigfoot.

2613
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:44,191
I go,
well,

2614
01:56:44,191 --> 01:56:46,540
you find it's unfuckable white dudes 
camping,

2615
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:52,750
trying to work out whatever's in their 
heads about big foot.

2616
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:56,490
If you gave everybody $12,000,
a lot more people go look for big.

2617
01:56:56,550 --> 01:57:01,290
Maybe they'd find them.
They should at least find something new.

2618
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:02,161
You're like,
you know what,

2619
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:03,660
dude?
You haven't thought this through.

2620
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:07,740
12 k a year could find big foot.
You know?

2621
01:57:07,741 --> 01:57:12,741
When I knew that I always had a feeling 
that it was probably horseshit,

2622
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:17,430
but what does that cover Yeti and about 
adult abominable snowman.

2623
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:20,060
They used to be an animal called a 
gigantic pithy gets.

2624
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:21,390
That's what a lot of this is based on.

2625
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,970
The gigantic pythius lived as recently 
as 100,000

2626
01:57:23,971 --> 01:57:28,280
years ago.
Eight or man or a bipedal hominid in the

2627
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:32,550
Orangutang family that was potentially 
eight feet tall.

2628
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:33,583
Sky,
ape giant fucking big standing freaky 

2629
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:38,513
ape thing.
And the reason why they figured out it 

2630
01:57:40,531 --> 01:57:43,320
was by people.
Yeah,

2631
01:57:43,321 --> 01:57:47,640
well like bigfoot really would be.
It would be big foot.

2632
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:52,760
I mean it was short like us and they 
don't know if that's true or not because

2633
01:57:53,651 --> 01:57:54,484
we only have some job bones and see what
happened was this guy found a tooth in 

2634
01:57:58,171 --> 01:57:59,004
an apothecary shop in China.
I don't want to say the 19 twenties and 

2635
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:06,750
he was an anthropologist and a.
When he was there,

2636
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:07,590
he looked good.
So like,

2637
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:08,700
uh,
what's this?

2638
01:58:08,701 --> 01:58:09,534
Where'd you get this?
And they took him to the place where 

2639
01:58:11,071 --> 01:58:13,310
they got to eat.
You saw the tooth and he recognized that

2640
01:58:13,311 --> 01:58:14,144
as a primate tooth,
but far larger than a gorilla is far 

2641
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:17,340
larger than a human being.

2642
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,360
She's like,
whoa.

2643
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:20,940
Like this is like a giant tubes.
Like what the fuck's going on?

2644
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:22,103
They took them to this spot and he found
more bones and then it was eventually 

2645
01:58:25,051 --> 01:58:27,630
recognized as an actual animal and they 
call it Jack Canto,

2646
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,920
Pythagoras.
Um,

2647
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:31,270
they just don't know that there's been 
big foot.

2648
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:32,143
Yeah.
Let me show him the picture of gigantic 

2649
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,820
[inaudible] next to a Bush area of the 
world was,

2650
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:38,460
which I found the baseball gets the same
guy.

2651
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:40,230
Okay.
I can do it just right now before we get

2652
01:58:40,231 --> 01:58:41,064
to the baseball guy.
You show the picture of gigantic pithy 

2653
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:45,050
gets next to a human being.
I just,

2654
01:58:45,051 --> 01:58:47,070
this is what this is,
you know,

2655
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:50,830
scientists believe this.
So this is not like big foot researchers

2656
01:58:50,831 --> 01:58:54,850
that are claiming this is a real animal.
This is like actual scientists.

2657
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,833
There's a picture of one standing right 
next to a dude is like a statue of 

2658
01:58:59,201 --> 01:59:01,270
gigantic pythagoras covered in hair.

2659
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,560
You got it.
It's huge.

2660
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:05,230
So this was a real answer for that right
there.

2661
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:07,960
Again,
that's Harry and the Hendersons.

2662
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,600
That is big foot.
I mean if that is what I mean.

2663
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:12,910
And again,
this is not big foot researchers.

2664
01:59:12,911 --> 01:59:13,744
They didn't create this.
This is created by actual 

2665
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:16,054
anthropologists.
And did this exist as recently as 

2666
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:19,624
100,000
years ago with no chance that there's 

2667
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:23,470
one still hanging out?
Oh,

2668
01:59:23,471 --> 01:59:25,630
there's definitely a chance.
It's just been.

2669
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:26,643
Unless we comb every inch of the earth,
we give an audit on every single living 

2670
01:59:31,331 --> 01:59:34,300
creature that is in the densest of dense
forests.

2671
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:35,253
We can't really say that that's true 
because they find that we find new shit 

2672
01:59:39,371 --> 01:59:42,340
all the time and the Pacific northwest 
where these things.

2673
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:43,263
The reason why it works,
the way it works geologically are 

2674
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:49,120
geographically because that animal 
existed in Asia.

2675
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:53,440
We know that humans came from Asia,
like literally American Indians,

2676
01:59:53,441 --> 01:59:55,510
native Americans there from Siberia.

2677
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:59,680
Like they have the same DNA as people 
who came from Asia.

2678
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:02,370
They came across thej or something like 
that.

2679
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,513
The whole thing has been connected at 
separated for as long as humans have 

2680
02:00:06,491 --> 02:00:07,324
been humans.
Right?

2681
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:08,343
So if we came from that area,
we know that a bunch of other animals 

2682
02:00:12,191 --> 02:00:13,024
came from that area too,
and they think that it's entirely 

2683
02:00:14,621 --> 02:00:15,454
possible that that big ass monkey thing 
came from that area to somebody brought 

2684
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:20,680
it with him.
It just came like all these other things

2685
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:24,640
to make the walk.
That could be where the whole yeti thing

2686
02:00:24,641 --> 02:00:27,070
comes from.
The yeti thing is one of those living in

2687
02:00:27,071 --> 02:00:29,170
an extremely cold climate during the ice
age.

2688
02:00:29,490 --> 02:00:30,323
I mean it's entirely possible when 
people either saw a remanence of it or 

2689
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,620
but never alive.
They would have never crossed paths.

2690
02:00:35,730 --> 02:00:37,840
Ip.
I bet they did back in the day for sure.

2691
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:39,250
Are you.
Are you serious?

2692
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:40,150
Yeah.
A hundred percent.

2693
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:42,520
We will cross paths with all the other 
great apes.

2694
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,310
We cross paths with Orangutans.
Why would we think we'd cross paths with

2695
02:00:45,311 --> 02:00:47,170
a gigantic [inaudible]?
I get some.

2696
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:49,840
You'd see a you'd fucking run.
If it's really smart,

2697
02:00:49,841 --> 02:00:50,674
it would have a fucking house in a cell 
phone or it's not smart enough to hide 

2698
02:00:53,171 --> 02:00:54,940
from us.
Like get the fuck out of here.

2699
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,010
If we could find a gorilla like,
wait,

2700
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,690
this is the problem.
We could find a gorilla,

2701
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:00,910
we could find a champ.
We find the howler monkey should be able

2702
02:01:00,911 --> 02:01:04,270
to find it so slick.
It's still a monkey.

2703
02:01:04,271 --> 02:01:05,104
It doesn't even have pants.
This stupid fuck he doesn't have shoes 

2704
02:01:07,431 --> 02:01:10,110
is that doesn't have a.
your barometer for intelligence.

2705
02:01:10,111 --> 02:01:13,810
You like pants and you got a man with no
pants.

2706
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,580
You're gonna freeze to death.
You're going to figure out fire.

2707
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:17,980
You're walking around on two legs like 
you're the shit.

2708
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,570
Come on Bro.
Figure it out.

2709
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:23,740
So if he could figure out nothing except
escaping people,

2710
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:24,581
it'd be like,
wow,

2711
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:27,970
what an extraordinarily animal.
Extraordinarily intelligent animal.

2712
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:28,863
It's figured out at least how to get the
fuck away from people to have a house 

2713
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:32,883
like,
come on,

2714
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:35,830
I'm not buying it.
I don't think it's a real thing.

2715
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,020
I'm with you.
But I think it was a real thing.

2716
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,910
I think it was things based on.
I

2717
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:42,390
think it is a real thing.
So do you think the.

2718
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:43,423
Somebody sees one of those frozen in a 
cave and then it's passed down or they 

2719
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:51,110
could have encountered it if people have
been around for I think,

2720
02:01:51,111 --> 02:01:52,970
what did we decide the other day in this
forum?

2721
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:56,000
I think the consensus is like at least 
250,000

2722
02:01:56,001 --> 02:01:59,840
years we've been in this form.
That means for 150,000

2723
02:01:59,841 --> 02:02:00,674
years we lived around those fucking 
things and that has got to be in her 

2724
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:06,860
head because most likely they're 
probably peaceful because they're so big

2725
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:07,694
like a rang of tans,
but if that wanted to it would just 

2726
02:02:09,921 --> 02:02:10,754
throw water.
Balloons would splatter against the 

2727
02:02:14,301 --> 02:02:17,230
coconut tree and that'd be the end of 
that and you'd imagine the be similar in

2728
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,021
our history.
We were like,

2729
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:20,570
and then there was the great April or we
probably killed them.

2730
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:21,703
We probably figured out bows and arrows 
and we probably started fucking killing 

2731
02:02:23,811 --> 02:02:24,644
him from a distance and we're alive and 
they're not and nobody remembers nobody 

2732
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,293
too long ago.

2733
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:30,433
How can we know his chip passed down?
People don't know shit about my 

2734
02:02:33,441 --> 02:02:36,290
grandmother and grandfather.
We know we killed those hobbit people.

2735
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:37,213
That's a.
that's a really a fairly new revelation 

2736
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:44,000
is my favorite part island of Flores.
There's a small being that they found on

2737
02:02:44,001 --> 02:02:44,834
the island of Flores that's in the human
species that they're literally calling 

2738
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:51,860
the hobbit people.
It's called like Homo floresiensis cysts

2739
02:02:51,861 --> 02:02:54,140
or something like that,
and this is.

2740
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:55,333
This is a hundred percent confirmed now.
I mean this is 100 percent accepted by 

2741
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:04,331
mainstream science that this was an 
actual type of human being are typos.

2742
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,670
The third one is type of.
Yeah,

2743
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,600
the third one,
and that was a real animal.

2744
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:12,070
It wasn't a human in necessarily like a 
homo sapiens,

2745
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:17,350
but it was some human ed or Hominid.
Some human light based on funding school

2746
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:20,570
funding.
A bunch of them they found,

2747
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,900
they found quite a bit,
but there was a bunch of resistance.

2748
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,823
Now when I say that it definitely lived.
There are people to this day that don't 

2749
02:03:28,461 --> 02:03:29,294
think it lived,
but the vast consensus amongst these 

2750
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:35,330
anthropologists that this is a real 
animal,

2751
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,313
but there's always gonna be people that 
are willing to debate it and they found 

2752
02:03:40,911 --> 02:03:43,550
a bunch of bones of these little tiny 
people like things.

2753
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:44,384
And what they think is that these are 
like literally like hobbit people and 

2754
02:03:48,161 --> 02:03:51,130
that there was always been a legend of,
and uh,

2755
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:52,950
I forget what part of the world is,
but the,

2756
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:56,060
there's a thing called the Orang pendek 
think that's how you say it,

2757
02:03:56,061 --> 02:03:56,894
or in pen deck.
And that was a little tiny apelike 

2758
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:04,810
person and they think that this legend 
of these little tiny a black people,

2759
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,400
it was the species that this was a real 
species.

2760
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:08,383
And they think that this real species 
might've even been preyed on human 

2761
02:04:10,851 --> 02:04:11,660
children.

2762
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:13,910
They might've been competing for 
resources.

2763
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:17,120
We might've cannibalize them.
Yeah.

2764
02:04:17,121 --> 02:04:21,350
It's entirely possible that we can 
belies the of story.

2765
02:04:21,351 --> 02:04:22,184
The grimm fairy tales come from like the
troll who comes to steal your baby and 

2766
02:04:26,031 --> 02:04:26,864
shit like that.
I had this guy Dr Jordan Peterson from 

2767
02:04:29,181 --> 02:04:31,460
the University of Toronto the other day 
on the podcast.

2768
02:04:31,461 --> 02:04:32,294
And he was telling me a story about how 
when the fall of the Soviet Union or in 

2769
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:38,010
Russia in the 19 thirties and doing 
during Marxism,

2770
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:39,263
that they had signs.
They had made signs telling people not 

2771
02:04:41,941 --> 02:04:44,010
to eat their children.
Why?

2772
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:45,990
Because people were so starving to 
death,

2773
02:04:45,991 --> 02:04:50,010
they were eating their fucking children,
so they had to make billboards saying,

2774
02:04:50,011 --> 02:04:52,980
don't eat your children.
Okay,

2775
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,610
we just want a different track.
I thought we were talking about the hub.

2776
02:04:55,611 --> 02:04:57,000
It's still what we are.
I mean,

2777
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:00,070
I'm talking about cannibalism.
Human beings have been known to you that

2778
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:03,930
he was in the 19 hundreds through the 
20th century in our ear in Russia.

2779
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:05,700
They were telling people,
don't eat your children.

2780
02:05:05,701 --> 02:05:06,534
I mean,
however many had happened to three 

2781
02:05:07,531 --> 02:05:08,580
people,
ate their kids for.

2782
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:09,503
I don't know what the numbers were,
but if that was enough to the point 

2783
02:05:11,431 --> 02:05:13,200
where the government wanted to have a 
sign that said,

2784
02:05:13,201 --> 02:05:14,280
please don't eat your children.
Like,

2785
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:16,770
Holy Shit.
That's pretty metal dude.

2786
02:05:16,771 --> 02:05:18,240
It's,
it's as metal as it gets.

2787
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:21,930
People have been eating people for a 
long ass time.

2788
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:23,340
Uh,
and then we stopped.

2789
02:05:23,490 --> 02:05:26,310
Why?
Because before you were mad.

2790
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:28,260
Cow Disease comes from.
Did you know that?

2791
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,423
Oh my God,
thank God I cleared out a bunch of my 

2792
02:05:32,101 --> 02:05:34,800
head so I could walk out of here with a 
bunch of more knowledge.

2793
02:05:34,801 --> 02:05:39,801
Go fire cow disease comes from something
called the brain.

2794
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:40,733
It comes up the other,
the brain tissue of your of other human 

2795
02:05:45,301 --> 02:05:46,980
beings.
That's one of the ways you get it.

2796
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,770
Like at Papa New Guinea,
the cannibals of New Guinea.

2797
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,050
They develop,
I think it's called Jacob Corks,

2798
02:05:52,051 --> 02:05:54,780
Feld,
which is technically mad cow disease.

2799
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:57,660
It's the exact same thing.
We're getting it because they're feeding

2800
02:05:57,690 --> 02:06:00,240
cows cows,
they're feeding cows,

2801
02:06:00,241 --> 02:06:01,074
ground up brain matter,
which they're not supposed to fucking 

2802
02:06:03,001 --> 02:06:04,500
eat.
The cows eat that.

2803
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:08,700
They developed these prions that people 
eat that tainted beef in the prize given

2804
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:09,643
by our own brains and does damage and 
he's fucking prions can exist in like a 

2805
02:06:12,661 --> 02:06:13,494
thousand degree temperatures.
They're like these indestructible 

2806
02:06:15,421 --> 02:06:19,110
organisms and they invade your central 
nervous system thing.

2807
02:06:19,111 --> 02:06:19,944
You feed a cow and another cow,
but you're saying would have existed 

2808
02:06:22,801 --> 02:06:26,010
prior to mad cow disease called 
something else in human beings.

2809
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:26,993
Well,
it's probably set up to discourage 

2810
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:34,400
predation amongst the same species that 
you you are a part of because of council

2811
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:35,493
meeting council essentially to not eat 
ourselves each other and especially the 

2812
02:06:39,511 --> 02:06:40,344
brain tissue,
the brain tissues apparently where we 

2813
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:43,290
could really differentiate it.

2814
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:47,010
Like if you eat someone else's brain 
tissue that's like the new Guinea,

2815
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:50,380
a neurological Jacobs Crutchfield,
which,

2816
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:54,030
which affects cannibals.
Like literally a fucking disease affects

2817
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:56,670
cannibals.
That's a good neurological disease.

2818
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:59,490
When you eat brain matter from your own 
species,

2819
02:06:59,491 --> 02:07:00,324
that's how they get it and that's.
And so that's maybe that's the reason 

2820
02:07:03,361 --> 02:07:05,570
why people stopped eating people.
Oh yeah.

2821
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:09,350
I mean,
I think it's nature discouraging that,

2822
02:07:09,351 --> 02:07:11,190
that this is an aberrant behavior.
This is not.

2823
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:12,223
It's not what we want.
It's not conducive to the survival of 

2824
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:14,370
the species.
I said,

2825
02:07:14,371 --> 02:07:16,040
well wait,
if I could I,

2826
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:18,300
other than a cow where it gets weird.
Yeah,

2827
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:20,010
champ,
cow brain.

2828
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,990
Like a brain.
Let's say there was normal cal.

2829
02:07:21,991 --> 02:07:24,410
Brandon didn't have mad cow disease,
no prions.

2830
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:26,430
Could I eat that brand?
Is that okay for me?

2831
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:29,160
Can I eat the normal rate?
And you most certainly can eat,

2832
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:31,470
people eat lamb's brains,
calves,

2833
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:32,640
brains.
It's like very,

2834
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:34,480
very common that people eat brains.
Why?

2835
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:36,460
Because its delicacy.

2836
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:37,293
It's tickets.
Dog Seats in Oregon that some people 

2837
02:07:39,161 --> 02:07:39,994
even prefer for some meals.
But some people love eating like lambs 

2838
02:07:43,091 --> 02:07:44,500
brain cows,
brain.

2839
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:45,640
Yeah.
It's trippy.

2840
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:46,740
Do you?
Uhm,

2841
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:49,720
but do you get any.
Is there any disease from it?

2842
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,890
Well,
nutrient from.

2843
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,920
Do you get something that you don't get 
from meeting another meat?

2844
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:56,100
That's a good question.
Um,

2845
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:59,230
I'm not saying make me smarter datalabs 
brain.

2846
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:02,170
But I am saying like,
will it make some part of me stronger?

2847
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:05,460
What if it did what it did make you 
smarter than smart?

2848
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:07,450
I would be.
It's not like that wouldn't be bad.

2849
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:09,120
What if you.
Sorry.

2850
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:11,980
How dare you,
you if you ate like,

2851
02:08:11,981 --> 02:08:15,460
um,
if you wait a really intelligent thing,

2852
02:08:15,461 --> 02:08:18,220
I wonder if you'd get more intelligent.
Well,

2853
02:08:18,221 --> 02:08:20,920
obviously it would have to be something 
outside of your species.

2854
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:21,813
Imagine.
Imagine if there was like magic and 

2855
02:08:24,101 --> 02:08:27,340
brains and the more brains you ate,
the more power your brain had.

2856
02:08:28,650 --> 02:08:30,380
People have believed that it was an 
amazing time.

2857
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:33,010
Well,
the zombies,

2858
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:35,740
I used to want brain that's called for 
brains in the.

2859
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,600
Not In the Romero flick.
Nah.

2860
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:42,070
We'll think about Ramiro's the modern 
father of zombies,

2861
02:08:42,071 --> 02:08:42,904
right?
Yeah.

2862
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:44,013
I mean there have been a.
The concept of undead human has been 

2863
02:08:46,991 --> 02:08:49,660
around forever,
but calling it a Zombie,

2864
02:08:49,661 --> 02:08:52,390
it comes out of the graveyard.
It wants to eat your brains.

2865
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:55,630
I don't think they ever said brains and 
then moving the zombies.

2866
02:08:55,631 --> 02:08:57,730
Never say brains.
Who did say brains?

2867
02:08:57,731 --> 02:08:58,564
Who Do you think said brains?
First one that might have happened and 

2868
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:03,130
you could look it up,
but I think it's a.

2869
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:04,753
is it revenge of the living dead,
which had nothing to do with the living 

2870
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,870
dead.
Remember the scene in the cemetery where

2871
02:09:10,871 --> 02:09:13,300
the girl has sex?
She takes her gear off like.

2872
02:09:13,301 --> 02:09:14,134
Yeah,
I remember watching that in early days 

2873
02:09:14,981 --> 02:09:15,400
of cable.

2874
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,061
I'm like,
oh my gosh,

2875
02:09:16,061 --> 02:09:17,380
she's going to have sex right here in 
the graveyard.

2876
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:20,620
And then there's a Zombie attack.
That movie was great.

2877
02:09:20,621 --> 02:09:21,454
Really wonderful.
That was a fun movie and he's like 

2878
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:25,010
tongue in cheek.
It did.

2879
02:09:25,011 --> 02:09:27,340
It had like a hipness to it.
Something Fun and Shit.

2880
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:29,560
But it was pretty committed to it's Gore
as well.

2881
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:31,290
I've got to write that down.
Revenge of the living dead.

2882
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:32,883
My childhood.
I can't hate on zombies because I'm 

2883
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:36,694
bailing on the walking dead.
You go like I got to fulfill my Zombie 

2884
02:09:39,641 --> 02:09:41,350
logos.
Where is that?

2885
02:09:41,351 --> 02:09:42,940
What it's called?
Return of the living dead.

2886
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:44,380
Nineteen 85.
That's right.

2887
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:47,440
And what did say?
Uh Oh.

2888
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:49,310
Oh.
Because it was made by John Russo.

2889
02:09:49,311 --> 02:09:50,144
Parted ways and reach the agreement that
Russia would retain the rights to the 

2890
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:53,673
living dead suffix while Ramiro use 
agreed to use of the dead in any 

2891
02:09:57,431 --> 02:09:59,180
subsequent out.

2892
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,583
Funny Man.
Those are the two dudes came up with 

2893
02:10:01,661 --> 02:10:03,670
night the living dead.
So he's like,

2894
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:08,420
you take a living dead and I'll take of 
the whatever.

2895
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:09,800
That's hilarious.
Split.

2896
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:12,550
Negotiated it.
That's hilarious.

2897
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:14,560
That seems rational though.
Not Bad.

2898
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:16,870
I like to think they did that with a 
smile and they shook hands.

2899
02:10:16,890 --> 02:10:19,000
And do you think George Romero is like,
man,

2900
02:10:19,001 --> 02:10:22,360
I wish I'd put my zombies on TV.
I don't know man.

2901
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:23,203
So that was what I was saying.
The problem is it's not about zombies 

2902
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:26,700
anymore.
The zombies like there,

2903
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:27,663
go back to the little people,
little people could they need human 

2904
02:10:30,431 --> 02:10:30,971
brains.
Yeah.

2905
02:10:30,971 --> 02:10:33,030
That was the problem.
One of the things that we're.

2906
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:33,990
We got

2907
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:36,650
to finish that.
One of the things that were human brains

2908
02:10:36,651 --> 02:10:40,340
is that those things might have preyed 
on people and that we might've prayed on

2909
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:44,090
them and that that might be also what we
did to the neanderthals.

2910
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:45,103
They found the end of towels apparently 
that had some scouring marks inside 

2911
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:51,950
their heads,
like we might have some one in the past,

2912
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:52,963
might have killed a neanderthal and then
ate him and broke his brain open and a 

2913
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,220
scoop of Greens cooked it.
Yeah.

2914
02:10:58,760 --> 02:10:59,940
Whoa.
Yeah.

2915
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:01,910
Super,
super,

2916
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:05,690
super hard to survive.
Five hundred thousand years ago,

2917
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,380
the person that I wanted to win the 
prisons who didn't win the presidency.

2918
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:11,733
There was a time,
dude where you'd be eating neanderthals 

2919
02:11:13,491 --> 02:11:16,460
brains and you're sitting there going,
I never thought I'd be here,

2920
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:18,260
but you'd be doing it,
and by the way,

2921
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:22,160
you would be one of the lucky ones 
because most people,

2922
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:23,280
they beat in your brain.

2923
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,130
True.
If you were eating the animal brains,

2924
02:11:25,131 --> 02:11:26,120
you've survived.
Dude,

2925
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:29,030
you clubbed in with that mastodon bone 
over the fucking head while I was trying

2926
02:11:29,031 --> 02:11:32,130
to rape your mom or whatever the hell 
went wrong with those dark.

2927
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:35,570
Can it just be just be like a first 
Thanksgiving story where like me and the

2928
02:11:35,571 --> 02:11:37,460
neanderthals like come to a common 
ground.

2929
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:38,323
You're eating is bread.
Give me his brain and I give them some 

2930
02:11:40,311 --> 02:11:43,390
wavy,
like a dude who just fell here.

2931
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:46,880
We have no need for me to his brain and 
like once a year we'll only do this once

2932
02:11:46,881 --> 02:11:47,430
a year.
Right?

2933
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:48,860
We imagine if that was the deal,
like,

2934
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:50,060
look,
we're not going to kill you.

2935
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:52,190
Please don't kill us,
but if one of your guys dies,

2936
02:11:52,191 --> 02:11:53,560
can we eat them?
That's not.

2937
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:55,640
I mean call me crude,
but that's not a bad deal.

2938
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:56,990
Right?
It's not the worst deal.

2939
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:58,340
And think about this.
It's like,

2940
02:11:58,341 --> 02:11:59,660
why?
What are you going to do with them?

2941
02:11:59,661 --> 02:12:00,261
I know,
I know.

2942
02:12:00,261 --> 02:12:02,170
There's the sentimentality and the 
histology of like,

2943
02:12:02,210 --> 02:12:02,691
oh,
the debt,

2944
02:12:02,691 --> 02:12:04,400
but it's like you're just going to put 
them in the ground is going to rock.

2945
02:12:04,401 --> 02:12:05,690
What?
A waste of energy.

2946
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:06,853
So you give us your dead will give you 
are dead and that will keep peace 

2947
02:12:09,951 --> 02:12:11,150
amongst the living.
Dude.

2948
02:12:11,151 --> 02:12:11,984
We're onto a movie writer or a better 
version of government in a world where 

2949
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:16,340
you were like,
who needs a president?

2950
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:17,203
Maybe this.
This is the civilization civilization 

2951
02:12:19,611 --> 02:12:20,444
stabilizer.
Have you ever heard of a Tibet and sky 

2952
02:12:22,491 --> 02:12:23,660
funeral?
No.

2953
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:27,080
Do tell them here to freak the fuck out.
Here we go.

2954
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:29,150
[inaudible] the way they handle it in 
Tibet,

2955
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,820
the Himalayas,
they take the body out,

2956
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:35,420
a score it,
they chop it up into chunks and then the

2957
02:12:35,421 --> 02:12:36,254
vultures come in and they get it down to
the bone and then they smash the bones 

2958
02:12:40,581 --> 02:12:44,870
up and then the vultures come in and 
they consume the bones and they do it.

2959
02:12:44,871 --> 02:12:47,100
All the images of it.
You could watch it here.

2960
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:48,050
Pull.
It blew my mind.

2961
02:12:48,051 --> 02:12:50,910
As much as I'm less kind of a let down,
not at the end of the day.

2962
02:12:53,070 --> 02:12:53,903
This is how they deal with their dead.
They feed them to literally feed them 

2963
02:12:56,931 --> 02:12:59,480
two vultures and they film it and they 
take photos of this.

2964
02:12:59,481 --> 02:13:01,660
It's like,
this is like this intense ceremonies.

2965
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:04,190
That's what they do now.
Who Will,

2966
02:13:04,191 --> 02:13:06,770
you could see it like,
that's why I'm having Jamie pull it up.

2967
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,390
I thought this was like the pictures of 
the little.

2968
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:09,253
Oh No,
no.

2969
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:13,100
This is happening right now too.
So I'm not going to put it up.

2970
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:16,790
No cemetery with the images because 
there's a bunch of websites.

2971
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:19,460
Skytap,
some Tibetan sky funeral.

2972
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:21,590
I mean we don't want to watch it 
necessarily.

2973
02:13:21,591 --> 02:13:23,000
It's just like look at some of the 
images.

2974
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,710
But there's,
they filmed them now.

2975
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:25,603
It's like people can see the watch one,
like if I have to choose between the 

2976
02:13:28,881 --> 02:13:29,331
two.
Yeah,

2977
02:13:29,331 --> 02:13:31,370
you don't want to be,
there might be a little weird.

2978
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:33,000
I'd write it up on youtube either 
though,

2979
02:13:33,001 --> 02:13:34,890
but just give me the images so that we 
could see them.

2980
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:36,780
So um,
that's just a,

2981
02:13:36,781 --> 02:13:40,650
a spinal chord in the left corner.
Show the motherfucker,

2982
02:13:40,651 --> 02:13:43,500
this is just one of their dead monks.
Just a regular person.

2983
02:13:43,501 --> 02:13:44,334
So rather than bury them in the ground 
and this guy just getting picked apart 

2984
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:50,160
and then after they pick them apart,
like these,

2985
02:13:50,161 --> 02:13:50,994
almost down to nothing,
then they have the bones and they'll 

2986
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:54,203
take the bones and smash them and the 
birds would come in and eat the bones 

2987
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:58,590
and the birds know,
like if you,

2988
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:01,260
what you just clicked on Jamie up above 
right there.

2989
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:03,990
Like where you see the body right next 
to that.

2990
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:04,824
Yeah,
look at that.

2991
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:07,740
So they taken this guy and they just,
they treat them.

2992
02:14:07,830 --> 02:14:08,940
Is that a dead human being?
Now?

2993
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:10,230
It's a bunch of debt to human beings.

2994
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:14,100
They take these human beings that die in
wherever part of the world.

2995
02:14:14,101 --> 02:14:15,510
This is in,
uh,

2996
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:20,560
in Tibet and they cut their bodies up 
for the vultures and they wear gloves.

2997
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:21,773
I mean these are modern people.
If he's got Levi's on and a belt and 

2998
02:14:24,511 --> 02:14:27,690
he's chopping up this,
this person's body.

2999
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:28,763
And then they leave it out there.
And if you go through those series of 

3000
02:14:30,061 --> 02:14:30,691
pictures,
Jamie,

3001
02:14:30,691 --> 02:14:32,590
there's a whole series of them,
oh my God.

3002
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:34,590
And you see,
oh yeah,

3003
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:35,483
I wasn't ready for that.
It's tendency that shit just throwing 

3004
02:14:38,551 --> 02:14:40,380
dead bodies out of the ball just become 
clean.

3005
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:41,740
Well,
they got harder to.

3006
02:14:41,950 --> 02:14:42,783
Yeah,
they help because they want it to be 

3007
02:14:43,591 --> 02:14:47,790
done within a good amount of time and 
the more it's chopped up like that,

3008
02:14:47,791 --> 02:14:50,760
the more vultures that will attract and 
the quicker the whole process will be.

3009
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:52,140
What is the reaction?

3010
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:55,380
Do you think it's Ooh squeamish or do 
you think it's a ego?

3011
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,750
Do you think it's just like what?
Like,

3012
02:14:57,751 --> 02:14:59,400
no,
I'm far more complex.

3013
02:14:59,401 --> 02:15:01,680
Like I've got way more going on in my 
head and body.

3014
02:15:01,681 --> 02:15:04,170
I can't wind up as bird food,
but at the end of the day,

3015
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:06,450
your fruit for something.
Yeah man,

3016
02:15:06,451 --> 02:15:08,970
it's not the worst way to go because 
you're gone.

3017
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:12,090
Well,
I mean as long as you don't fucking like

3018
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:14,640
at the mouth of something while you're 
still alive.

3019
02:15:14,641 --> 02:15:16,050
But if they were like,
look,

3020
02:15:16,051 --> 02:15:19,680
when you dead however you pass,
we want to feed you to something else.

3021
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:22,610
I'm going to think I'm okay with that 
particular life.

3022
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,550
Eat a lot.
Motherfucker.

3023
02:15:23,551 --> 02:15:24,660
They'd remember me.
They'd be like,

3024
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:26,640
oh,
he fed the village for like men months.

3025
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:29,430
You'd be amazed how quick they put you 
down.

3026
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:34,260
They'd eat you so fast.
Take the elephant like due to go fast.

3027
02:15:34,270 --> 02:15:36,000
You'd you'd.
You'd disappear in a second.

3028
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:36,893
Yeah.
I know a dude who was in Africa when 

3029
02:15:38,041 --> 02:15:38,874
someone is shot an elephant,
he said they just trumped that elephant 

3030
02:15:40,531 --> 02:15:43,950
up to like a million pieces and handed 
them out to all these villages that came

3031
02:15:43,951 --> 02:15:46,500
from far and wide to get elephant meat.
I was like,

3032
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:47,850
whoa,
so everyone could eat.

3033
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:48,541
I was like,
Hey,

3034
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:50,720
I'll go have a bunch of people eating 
nuts.

3035
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:52,500
Some asshole was just like,
hey man,

3036
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,210
just to kill something.
Well,

3037
02:15:54,211 --> 02:15:55,240
I don't know.
The Guy,

3038
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:56,143
the guy who killed the actual elephant,
it might've been one of those guys that 

3039
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:01,510
will just went there to kill an elephant
and then.

3040
02:16:01,740 --> 02:16:05,190
But when they killed the elephant,
so it's such a catch 22,

3041
02:16:05,191 --> 02:16:06,024
but when they kill the elephant,
it's very beneficial to the environment 

3042
02:16:08,011 --> 02:16:08,844
because they have more.
They can pay for more of the park 

3043
02:16:10,891 --> 02:16:11,724
rangers to protect the elephants against
poachers and then the people all around 

3044
02:16:14,431 --> 02:16:15,650
the village get the meat.

3045
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:19,380
This is the real thing is someplaces 
elephants are endangered,

3046
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:22,800
but some places they decide,
the people decide there's a surplus.

3047
02:16:22,801 --> 02:16:23,634
Those elephants,
because they're trampling on people's 

3048
02:16:24,871 --> 02:16:27,030
crops,
are eating people's stuff.

3049
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:29,460
You know,
automatically you say like,

3050
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:30,303
Hey,
you should never kill off offense for 

3051
02:16:31,151 --> 02:16:31,984
sure,
but the real problem is with some of 

3052
02:16:34,091 --> 02:16:37,300
these extremely poor people were 
elephants invade their crops.

3053
02:16:37,301 --> 02:16:38,134
You can't do a God damn thing,
and those are the people that want help 

3054
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:43,390
and then they hire someone to come and 
kill an elephant.

3055
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:45,400
Very.
The whole thing is very fucked up.

3056
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:47,320
Way more complex than way more 
complaint.

3057
02:16:47,321 --> 02:16:49,470
My teenage daughter may painted.
Well,

3058
02:16:49,471 --> 02:16:50,304
I mean we would all like to think that 
human beings and elephants live so far 

3059
02:16:53,561 --> 02:16:55,240
away from each other,
that it was a nonissue.

3060
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:59,260
When we just let the elephant survive 
out there in the wild and leave them the

3061
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:00,550
fuck alone,
that's what we'd all like,

3062
02:17:00,551 --> 02:17:01,240
right?

3063
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:02,073
The problem with that,
as they do live with people and they 

3064
02:17:04,481 --> 02:17:05,314
live with people that are super poor and
they live with people that have houses 

3065
02:17:07,721 --> 02:17:08,554
that are made out of fucking hey,
and there are people too in this bill 

3066
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:12,180
though.
Yeah.

3067
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:14,000
If it's like a.
it's just like,

3068
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:16,480
you know,
it's not all.

3069
02:17:16,481 --> 02:17:20,230
I mean it's not always that there's a 
lot of it is trophy hunting.

3070
02:17:20,231 --> 02:17:23,620
There's a lot of it is poachers trying 
to steal ivory and there's a lot of real

3071
02:17:23,621 --> 02:17:24,454
darkness to killing elephants,
no doubt about it and ideally no one 

3072
02:17:27,881 --> 02:17:29,620
should ever have to kill an elephant,
but if,

3073
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:30,473
if you're.
If you don't want those people to kill 

3074
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,450
elephants,
he,

3075
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:33,513
someone's got to figure out a way to at 
least capture them and make it valuable 

3076
02:17:38,801 --> 02:17:39,634
to transport them to some other part of 
Africa where they're not going to kill 

3077
02:17:41,921 --> 02:17:44,290
this guy or tramples and eat all of his 
crops.

3078
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:45,313
Unless you don't give a fuck about the 
guy you know and you don't care and you 

3079
02:17:49,210 --> 02:17:49,901
say,
well,

3080
02:17:49,901 --> 02:17:50,734
that guy's going to have to starve to 
death because the elephant is just as 

3081
02:17:53,081 --> 02:17:55,510
important as a living organism as the 
guy is.

3082
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:56,650
Which is another argument,

3083
02:17:56,930 --> 02:17:59,420
something to fall in order for you to 
rise.

3084
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:03,030
I see how people think that way.
I understand.

3085
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,370
I understand where they're coming from.
I,

3086
02:18:04,430 --> 02:18:05,580
I disagree.
You know,

3087
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:07,350
I'm,
I'm more into people.

3088
02:18:07,410 --> 02:18:09,120
I like people more than any other 
animal,

3089
02:18:09,570 --> 02:18:11,700
but I love other animals too.
So I get where they're coming from.

3090
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:13,270
I just think that,
uh,

3091
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:15,040
it's complex.
Yeah.

3092
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:16,093
Eight in any animals complex.
Like my buddy Brian just kill a rat in 

3093
02:18:20,551 --> 02:18:23,280
his house.
He had a rat trap and kill a rat.

3094
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:24,690
And I was like,
Whoa,

3095
02:18:24,691 --> 02:18:26,130
you got them.
Well that's good.

3096
02:18:26,131 --> 02:18:27,690
And I sent them a text message,
got them.

3097
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:29,063
And then I was thinking,
let's one of the few animals so you 

3098
02:18:30,331 --> 02:18:31,950
could cheer for it's murder

3099
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:35,160
and people back up.
Everybody backs you up.

3100
02:18:35,161 --> 02:18:38,250
You showed a picture of a rat,
you killed with a trap.

3101
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:39,580
Like,
ah.

3102
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:41,130
It must have been satisfying.
Yeah.

3103
02:18:41,131 --> 02:18:43,350
Well done man.
Fuck Outta grosses me out.

3104
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:44,243
If you're watching TV and you hear stop 
and you're like motherfucker and you go 

3105
02:18:48,601 --> 02:18:51,870
in the kitchen and you got a fat rat,
you are happy.

3106
02:18:52,610 --> 02:18:53,241
I've,
you know,

3107
02:18:53,241 --> 02:18:54,074
we live out in the.
We live in the Hollywood hills and 

3108
02:18:55,491 --> 02:18:58,130
sometimes it gets dry and you know,
rats fucking.

3109
02:18:58,131 --> 02:19:00,050
It's crazy.
It's one of those things that like,

3110
02:19:00,051 --> 02:19:02,630
I grew up in New Jersey and you would 
imagine that,

3111
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:03,553
you know,
according to every joke you've ever 

3112
02:19:04,641 --> 02:19:05,474
heard,
that's where I would have encountered a 

3113
02:19:06,111 --> 02:19:08,090
rat.
Never encountered a rat in my life until

3114
02:19:08,630 --> 02:19:09,463
I lived in Los Angeles.
And so you're living in the hills and 

3115
02:19:11,451 --> 02:19:12,201
the desert.
Yeah,

3116
02:19:12,201 --> 02:19:13,034
I lived in the suburbs of Jersey.
There weren't a lot of rats and we by 

3117
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:16,060
the water too.
Flow.

3118
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:17,910
So the rats,
if there were rats,

3119
02:19:17,930 --> 02:19:19,970
they lived in the rocks by the water and
shit.

3120
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:23,210
Um,
there were a lot more efficient in those

3121
02:19:23,210 --> 02:19:25,880
days as opposed to lately.
But um,

3122
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:26,953
but yeah,
fuck.

3123
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:30,500
Was I going with the rats?
So until,

3124
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:31,453
until I got to Los Angeles,
they come out of the hills because it's 

3125
02:19:32,751 --> 02:19:36,950
dry and we got a pool and water tracks 
like that cream.

3126
02:19:36,970 --> 02:19:38,480
Then you know,
you think like,

3127
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:40,640
oh my God,
if I ever had a rat in my house,

3128
02:19:40,641 --> 02:19:43,460
I'd fucking go ape shit.
And then suddenly you know,

3129
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:44,773
you're like,
oh,

3130
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:46,103
we are a house that gets rats in it.
And it's not like the stereotype that 

3131
02:19:49,431 --> 02:19:53,600
you always think of where it's like we 
live like pigs and the filth everywhere.

3132
02:19:53,601 --> 02:19:57,140
It's just like they're looking for 
fucking food and yeah,

3133
02:19:57,141 --> 02:19:57,974
that's the creepy thing.
You'd be sitting in your office and you 

3134
02:19:59,481 --> 02:20:02,010
hear some things in a wall.
Yeah.

3135
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:03,460
And you realize,
oh my God.

3136
02:20:03,461 --> 02:20:05,390
And they got,
once they get in,

3137
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:08,180
they get the inside of your house down 
to a system in science,

3138
02:20:08,181 --> 02:20:09,014
unless you plug all the holes and we've 
had to go through that thing where you 

3139
02:20:10,341 --> 02:20:12,620
plug all the holes and then the 
skittering stops.

3140
02:20:12,621 --> 02:20:13,454
You never hear it again.

3141
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:16,340
Motherfuckers,
they will camp out in your house if it's

3142
02:20:16,341 --> 02:20:18,500
a safe spot to like,
this is where we live now.

3143
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:19,363
Didn't make it a little nest in there,
especially if you have insulation in 

3144
02:20:21,171 --> 02:20:26,030
your attic like the nest and that stuff 
happens.

3145
02:20:26,031 --> 02:20:26,631
But you're right,
man.

3146
02:20:26,631 --> 02:20:28,070
People get like,
yeah,

3147
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:29,660
that's an animal that you're allowed to 
kill.

3148
02:20:29,661 --> 02:20:32,090
So like elephant,
no rat.

3149
02:20:32,091 --> 02:20:33,200
Yes.
You know,

3150
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:34,660
like tiger?
No.

3151
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:37,730
You know like mouse.
Yes.

3152
02:20:38,750 --> 02:20:40,910
Comes back to we have rules.
It's true.

3153
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:41,803
Yeah.
There's always gonna be a guideline 

3154
02:20:42,141 --> 02:20:42,974
there.
I found a mouse the other day and I've 

3155
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:50,420
got one of those little pills with a mop
for barbecuing a little in the mop thing

3156
02:20:51,951 --> 02:20:52,784
was sitting there and I saw this little 
motherfucker run up the top and go into 

3157
02:20:55,311 --> 02:20:56,480
the bucket.
I was like,

3158
02:20:56,481 --> 02:20:58,610
God damn it.
I got a mouse in that thing.

3159
02:20:58,611 --> 02:20:59,720
Fuck,
like,

3160
02:20:59,721 --> 02:21:00,260
that's gross.

3161
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:01,790
He's going to shit all over that little 
brush.

3162
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:04,220
So I took them over to the.
I picked up the bucket.

3163
02:21:04,221 --> 02:21:05,054
I took them over to the fence and just 
emptied them out on the other side and 

3164
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:10,370
he fell and he just hit the ground and 
just stand there like,

3165
02:21:10,371 --> 02:21:11,204
what the fuck this guy?
And he just slowly started walking off 

3166
02:21:16,191 --> 02:21:17,024
and like,
I don't think he knew what the fuck 

3167
02:21:17,481 --> 02:21:18,314
happened.
Right.

3168
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:20,030
But immediately I thought,
damn,

3169
02:21:20,031 --> 02:21:22,940
I should have fed them to my chickens.
What do you mean a chicken?

3170
02:21:22,941 --> 02:21:25,820
Would he have mouse?
Oh dude,

3171
02:21:25,821 --> 02:21:28,220
would they eat a mouse?
They go after them,

3172
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:31,310
like raptors,
like raptors in Jurassic Park.

3173
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:33,620
Like what you would imagine should get 
us to eat.

3174
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:34,873
Mice are straight up dinosaurs.
If you remember that scene in Jurassic 

3175
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:42,013
Park.
What is that?

3176
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:43,620
A chicken with the mouse?
Yeah,

3177
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:45,290
pull it back so we can see it.

3178
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:48,560
They'll fuck a mouse up dude.
And they fight over them.

3179
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:51,110
They all know.
And so they run after each other,

3180
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:54,170
like they stole it from the fucking cat.
Look at that cat.

3181
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:55,780
That's like pitch.
Like,

3182
02:21:55,830 --> 02:21:58,040
that was mine.
That was mine.

3183
02:21:58,220 --> 02:21:59,780
What the fuck.
And then he's going to eat that.

3184
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:02,120
I've seen chickens eat mice.
My chickens,

3185
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,310
I see.
I've seen them meet one that I fed them.

3186
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:06,890
Me.
Oh,

3187
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,150
they don't want to stare.
They fight.

3188
02:22:08,151 --> 02:22:09,380
They,
they peck at each other.

3189
02:22:09,381 --> 02:22:12,080
They fucking,
they bite off each other's skin.

3190
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:13,760
Trying to get at the mouse,
they steal.

3191
02:22:14,210 --> 02:22:18,350
Little got a little piece there like 
remember that scene?

3192
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:19,230
A

3193
02:22:19,230 --> 02:22:23,020
video of a snake?
No,

3194
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:26,040
a bunny mother bunny fighting a snake.

3195
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:30,900
This video starts with the snake over a 
little patch of baby bunnies.

3196
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:32,123
A nowhere.
This fucking mother rabbit smokes in 

3197
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:35,273
dude.
And you've never seen anything fight 

3198
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:40,730
like this and you're laughing.
You abby goes into the UFC ship,

3199
02:22:40,731 --> 02:22:44,140
but this or the mother rabbit went after
the snake and wouldn't stop it.

3200
02:22:44,141 --> 02:22:44,974
She wasn't like,
I'm going to get the snake away from my 

3201
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:46,880
baby.
The snake fucked off.

3202
02:22:46,881 --> 02:22:47,880
It's like I get it.
I get it.

3203
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,090
And the rabbit wanted revenge.
The rabbit was like,

3204
02:22:51,091 --> 02:22:53,900
fuck you.
And kept going like it was something I'd

3205
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:55,440
never seen before.
Generally,

3206
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:57,000
you know,
unless you're a bear,

3207
02:22:57,001 --> 02:22:57,960
right?
You defend.

3208
02:22:57,961 --> 02:23:00,420
Get the thing away from you and then you
go take care of your fucking young.

3209
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:01,830
This rabbit,
chase it.

3210
02:23:01,850 --> 02:23:02,641
See,
here it is,

3211
02:23:02,641 --> 02:23:03,690
bitch.
Watch this shit.

3212
02:23:03,691 --> 02:23:05,280
This is crazy.
So I'm sitting there,

3213
02:23:05,281 --> 02:23:07,980
gone into at eight the bunny already.
I don't know if it did anything,

3214
02:23:07,981 --> 02:23:10,710
but it's just right now on top of all.
Is that squeezing the bunny?

3215
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:11,880
Look at it.
Oh Wow.

3216
02:23:11,881 --> 02:23:13,620
So it's the babies in there,
uh,

3217
02:23:13,621 --> 02:23:15,300
killed the baby.
It looks like it killed one.

3218
02:23:15,301 --> 02:23:17,250
Right?
That one's pretty quiet.

3219
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:18,570
It killed a couple of them.
Look.

3220
02:23:18,571 --> 02:23:20,760
So watch her go fucking ape shit dude.

3221
02:23:22,130 --> 02:23:24,500
It just smothered.
Or fucking babies,

3222
02:23:24,501 --> 02:23:26,510
man.
Imagine are coming back and seeing that.

3223
02:23:26,870 --> 02:23:29,020
And this is why this is crazy,
but do it.

3224
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:30,830
It goes on for at least a minute and a 
half.

3225
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:35,300
Even when the gets away.
Did you know that a rabbit could do this

3226
02:23:35,301 --> 02:23:36,380
shit?
No.

3227
02:23:36,590 --> 02:23:37,423
Look at that.
Look at how many times have I bank with 

3228
02:23:38,491 --> 02:23:39,324
those kids,
biting it and kicking it at the same 

3229
02:23:40,851 --> 02:23:41,684
time.
She's like,

3230
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:44,083
tore up its body.
It's body's got all these holes in it 

3231
02:23:45,501 --> 02:23:47,300
now.
Wow.

3232
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:48,590
Not done.
Watch.

3233
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:52,100
Wait til it gets to the wall and there's
a fucking three 60.

3234
02:23:52,101 --> 02:23:56,840
Watch this shit.
Oh whoa.

3235
02:23:57,050 --> 02:23:58,360
It's trying to kill it.
Yes.

3236
02:23:58,370 --> 02:24:00,650
Pull.
It's going after it and pulling it down.

3237
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:01,493
Yes.
It doesn't want it to get away at wants 

3238
02:24:02,361 --> 02:24:03,530
to kill it.
Revenge Dude.

3239
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:04,423
Like that's shit.
You see it flip because it almost 

3240
02:24:07,611 --> 02:24:09,950
bitter.
Wow.

3241
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:12,200
That's not done.
Poisonous snake rabbits not done.

3242
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:15,600
Wow.
That is amazing man.

3243
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:17,060
Where,
what part of the world I live in?

3244
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:17,940
Uh,
the,

3245
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:19,110
there's a.
where is it?

3246
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:21,780
Because you hear kids talking and it's 
definitely got.

3247
02:24:21,781 --> 02:24:22,614
They got an accent.

3248
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:28,253
You hear kids talk.
They have an accent or they could hear 

3249
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:33,230
the kids going do it.
Bonnie and stuff like that.

3250
02:24:33,231 --> 02:24:36,000
Like England or some shit.
Not Quite England,

3251
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:38,940
but like definitely Europe.
But look to even on the rocks.

3252
02:24:38,941 --> 02:24:42,240
This motherfucker's not done from hell's
hard.

3253
02:24:42,241 --> 02:24:45,600
I stab at the.
She doesn't say it says save babies.

3254
02:24:45,601 --> 02:24:48,020
She didn't save him.
That fucking thing.

3255
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:50,190
Killed a couple of them.
She might've saved one.

3256
02:24:50,370 --> 02:24:53,820
Maybe click on and see if like somewhere
there's an explanation or something like

3257
02:24:53,821 --> 02:24:55,380
that.
Or maybe that's what they told the kids.

3258
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:58,860
She saved the babies,
but I didn't see any movement there.

3259
02:24:59,310 --> 02:25:01,200
To me that was the story of a mother 
coming home.

3260
02:25:01,201 --> 02:25:03,660
Seeing your kids dead and was like,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

3261
02:25:03,661 --> 02:25:06,480
And that's a very human story.
You don't really think about that in the

3262
02:25:06,481 --> 02:25:09,000
animal kingdom.
But like that's very human.

3263
02:25:09,250 --> 02:25:10,083
I mean there it is,
there is revenge or whether she just 

3264
02:25:12,271 --> 02:25:13,104
knew that if that thing was alive,
it presented a threat to the other baby 

3265
02:25:16,201 --> 02:25:18,150
and she had to kill it because if she 
let it go,

3266
02:25:18,151 --> 02:25:18,984
eventually she would have to leave to 
come back to get food and maybe it'd be 

3267
02:25:21,601 --> 02:25:23,290
gone.
It would find out where it was.

3268
02:25:23,291 --> 02:25:24,100
Maybe she knew that

3269
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,970
it was in the middle of like the worst 
moment of your fucking life.

3270
02:25:27,030 --> 02:25:29,050
We've just lost two kids and you're 
like,

3271
02:25:29,051 --> 02:25:31,180
I still have to fucking kill this thing 
to death.

3272
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:35,140
Otherwise it'll come back and take my 
other baby may be me in the night.

3273
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:35,993
Oh.
And like so poorly equipped for battle 

3274
02:25:38,201 --> 02:25:39,034
to the death.
All fluffy and shit with nothing but 

3275
02:25:41,351 --> 02:25:43,520
like,
but look what happens.

3276
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:47,860
Like almost unleashed.
Just like grabbing and kicking,

3277
02:25:47,861 --> 02:25:52,050
scratching like apparently until you're 
just going that fucking room.

3278
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:54,280
And that snake was a pretty nasty 
customer,

3279
02:25:54,281 --> 02:25:55,330
but he was still like,
I'm done.

3280
02:25:55,331 --> 02:25:56,510
Fuck it.
I'm fucking done.

3281
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:03,480
Serpents and snakes and lizards and all 
those unfeeling cold things.

3282
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:08,920
You know that that existed before time.
Chickens are in that group,

3283
02:26:08,921 --> 02:26:09,754
bro.
Really?

3284
02:26:09,790 --> 02:26:10,690
Yeah.
They're in that group.

3285
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:11,771
Do you?
Don't.

3286
02:26:11,771 --> 02:26:13,960
You don't realize it until you see them.
Tear of mouse,

3287
02:26:13,961 --> 02:26:14,980
part primordial.

3288
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:17,590
They're like raptors there.
Jurassic Park.

3289
02:26:17,591 --> 02:26:19,030
Raptors,
they're just little.

3290
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:21,610
You see them in the kitchen.
Opened doors and shit with lucky.

3291
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,070
They're not that smart,
but they're smart enough to like if I,

3292
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,740
if I have rocks around my house,
but pick up a rock,

3293
02:26:26,741 --> 02:26:29,140
the chickens will go towards it because 
you know the bugs under it.

3294
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,790
Oh really?
Figured that out.

3295
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:32,920
Yeah.
But it's not about being smart.

3296
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:37,250
It's about that lizard brain.
Like they mostly are there.

3297
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:38,213
They're omnivores.
They mostly eat grain because most of 

3298
02:26:40,181 --> 02:26:41,014
them are being kept by people.
That's the best way for you to feed 

3299
02:26:43,091 --> 02:26:43,924
them,
but when you let them lose feed every 

3300
02:26:45,161 --> 02:26:48,460
fucking thing that moves everything,
every bug,

3301
02:26:48,490 --> 02:26:50,000
dead,
every state,

3302
02:26:50,001 --> 02:26:51,250
snails,
dead,

3303
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:52,640
anything,
whatever.

3304
02:26:52,641 --> 02:26:54,970
Whatever's on the ground dead.
And apparently they caught a mouse.

3305
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:57,790
The fight to the death over that mouse.
It chase each other,

3306
02:26:58,110 --> 02:26:58,943
clawed out of each other's mouths.
They're little eating machine with a 

3307
02:27:00,881 --> 02:27:02,650
chicken.
Oh yeah.

3308
02:27:02,651 --> 02:27:05,350
They need each other for sure.
They pick holes in each other.

3309
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,790
But I mean,
is that just picking holes?

3310
02:27:06,830 --> 02:27:09,220
A few chicken.
They'd eat the shit out of it.

3311
02:27:09,221 --> 02:27:10,054
Really.
He cooked some chicken and let it or 

3312
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:14,110
made raw chicken and put it out there.
They get the fuck out of it.

3313
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:16,950
They wouldn't even think it would.

3314
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:23,860
Then they go open a kitchen door.
They're not smart.

3315
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:25,573
I'm 22.
Does it irritate you to watch Jurassic 

3316
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:30,730
Park where you're like,
where to fucking feathers,

3317
02:27:30,731 --> 02:27:33,490
bro.
We all know these things now.

3318
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,870
Now drastic world just recently did have
feathers.

3319
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:38,763
No,
no feathers.

3320
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:39,161
No.
Well,

3321
02:27:39,161 --> 02:27:39,994
it's probably too hard like CGI wise 
because you can't use just one big 

3322
02:27:42,941 --> 02:27:45,550
texture that's going to definitely 
flowing cash grab.

3323
02:27:45,610 --> 02:27:48,660
Like when they reboot the franchise,
that's going to be the best source.

3324
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:50,260
We finally got feathers on.
Now.

3325
02:27:50,261 --> 02:27:52,510
It's fucking historically accurate 
memory.

3326
02:27:52,511 --> 02:27:53,344
When we were kids,
Columbus discovered America and 

3327
02:27:55,151 --> 02:27:56,820
dinosaurs were green.
Yeah.

3328
02:27:57,360 --> 02:28:01,620
The good old days were the days,
the days and now they're off.

3329
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:05,500
There's a museum of Montana dinosaur 
thing.

3330
02:28:05,501 --> 02:28:06,334
I'll be honest with you,
I understood it and was that in as much 

3331
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:12,010
as you find a bunch of bones and then 
you extrapolate what it looked like?

3332
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,993
Well,
you mean it depends on the extent of 

3333
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:15,933
what you're finding on the lake there.
There has to be like some sort of 

3334
02:28:19,031 --> 02:28:22,190
consensus on what actually is a 
dinosaur.

3335
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:24,470
Like how much of this belongs to the 
same animal,

3336
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:25,543
especially because you're dealing with 
fossilized remains and the problem with 

3337
02:28:27,981 --> 02:28:30,560
fossilized remains or it's not really 
the bone anymore.

3338
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:31,823
Like the bone disappears.
It's replaced by minerals and it makes 

3339
02:28:33,771 --> 02:28:34,820
us rock.
Right?

3340
02:28:34,821 --> 02:28:38,090
So you can't really do DNA tests on it 
for the most part.

3341
02:28:38,091 --> 02:28:41,990
So you've got to find enough of them 
laid out in the same way where you agree

3342
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:44,030
this was this animal,
you know,

3343
02:28:44,031 --> 02:28:44,864
and they've changed that over the time 
from the beginning of the first 

3344
02:28:47,961 --> 02:28:48,794
discoveries of dinosaurs to today,
but now they've been doing it for so 

3345
02:28:50,631 --> 02:28:52,130
long.
They were pretty good idea.

3346
02:28:52,131 --> 02:28:54,170
And then every now and then they find a 
new one and they go,

3347
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:55,370
we'll check out this motherfucker.

3348
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:57,140
What does he.
But again I got get,

3349
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:58,820
I'll grant you.
Hey Liz,

3350
02:28:58,821 --> 02:29:00,830
would his bones would look like if we 
put it together?

3351
02:29:00,831 --> 02:29:03,260
But how do they get to like it's skin 
was like this.

3352
02:29:03,261 --> 02:29:04,520
They don't,
they don't.

3353
02:29:04,521 --> 02:29:09,320
So it was all bullshit speculation for 
us and now at least they're gone.

3354
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:11,900
We think it's got feathers.
I'm pretty sure it's got feathers.

3355
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:15,390
One guy had a really cool idea about t 
rex.

3356
02:29:15,391 --> 02:29:18,870
The t rex would have like vulture colors
the t rex did it because it was.

3357
02:29:19,010 --> 02:29:19,843
They think that T-rex,
like some people think that he was a 

3358
02:29:22,821 --> 02:29:25,580
Predator and other people think that it 
was a scavenger.

3359
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:28,580
And if one of the reasons why they think
that he's a scavengers,

3360
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:30,410
they,
they look at it the way his body's built

3361
02:29:30,550 --> 02:29:32,840
that like you couldn't possibly run very
fast.

3362
02:29:32,841 --> 02:29:34,700
He couldn't really possibly chase things
down.

3363
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:37,970
He's really super awkward.
But then there's other people that point

3364
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:38,804
to the idea that the atmosphere itself 
was very different back then and it 

3365
02:29:42,291 --> 02:29:43,124
might have been much richer and thicker 
and it actually might have been able to 

3366
02:29:46,161 --> 02:29:51,161
support an animal like that easier in 
terms of its size in terms of its size,

3367
02:29:51,561 --> 02:29:54,170
in terms of the amount of life on the 
planet itself,

3368
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:57,680
that that animal was so large and 
consumed so much,

3369
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:58,753
but everything was so large back then 
and everything consumed so much back 

3370
02:30:00,981 --> 02:30:01,814
then.
There were so many examples of these 

3371
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:04,610
mega animals,
right?

3372
02:30:04,611 --> 02:30:05,444
Like brontosaurus fucking Allosaurus,
t rex and these crazy gigantic fucking 

3373
02:30:10,941 --> 02:30:14,450
things roaming the earth.
This speculation is that life was.

3374
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:15,313
There was more richness of life.
There was more life and so the animals 

3375
02:30:18,591 --> 02:30:21,440
that consumed life,
whether it's in the form of plants,

3376
02:30:21,441 --> 02:30:23,940
like a brontosaurus or in meet like an 
a,

3377
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:24,783
a t rex,
they just got bigger and bigger and 

3378
02:30:26,031 --> 02:30:27,890
bigger because there was so much to 
consume.

3379
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:30,950
There was no need to like hold back 
their size.

3380
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:33,450
Whereas like if you're a champ or if 
you're a human,

3381
02:30:33,451 --> 02:30:35,600
like there's only so much you can eat.
The more you eat,

3382
02:30:35,601 --> 02:30:38,990
we've shown the more people eat and the 
more prosperous nation,

3383
02:30:38,991 --> 02:30:40,730
the larger the people start to get.
Right,

3384
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:41,893
and so I think that it's entirely 
possible that that's the case with the 

3385
02:30:45,291 --> 02:30:47,450
world back then that the whole world was
like.

3386
02:30:47,451 --> 02:30:50,360
It just supported bigger things.
It was just more life,

3387
02:30:50,390 --> 02:30:53,480
more green life,
more animals for t rex to eat and it was

3388
02:30:53,481 --> 02:30:54,314
just this big fucking thick oxygenated 
soup of life that nobody was lizard 

3389
02:31:02,060 --> 02:31:02,893
looking.
We'll more probably bird in lizard 

3390
02:31:05,811 --> 02:31:06,644
because today we have crocodiles,
we have Komodo dragons and we have 

3391
02:31:10,491 --> 02:31:15,491
chickens and we have eagles and Eagle is
fucking clearly a lot like a dinosaur,

3392
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:16,603
right?
It's crazy ass thing with swords on its 

3393
02:31:18,681 --> 02:31:19,980
fingers and death

3394
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,980
in its eyes and it swoops down and it's 
got the strength to catch a fucking fish

3395
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:28,530
in the water and pull it out and fly 
with it.

3396
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:29,573
They can catch goats and pulled them off
the side of cliffs and watch them fall 

3397
02:31:32,611 --> 02:31:36,230
and smash on the rocks below.
They do it as a strategy in order to get

3398
02:31:36,570 --> 02:31:38,130
to eat.
It will knock it down.

3399
02:31:38,750 --> 02:31:39,750
I've,
I've heard,

3400
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:43,110
I've never seen videos,
videos of Eagle,

3401
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,890
not gonna catch a mountain goat,
they pull them off the side of the cliff

3402
02:31:46,891 --> 02:31:50,640
and then they let them go and they smash
on the rocks down below.

3403
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:53,940
Golden Eagles in particular because 
there's some of the largest eagles.

3404
02:31:54,510 --> 02:31:57,930
Yeah,
giant fucking easy span.

3405
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:02,510
Flying Demons the way they snatch them 
and doing it just because that's the.

3406
02:32:02,511 --> 02:32:03,570
Yeah,
that's how they get meat.

3407
02:32:04,350 --> 02:32:05,790
Watch this shit.
This is crazy.

3408
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:10,300
Look a Golden Eagle eyes and that thing,
that evil,

3409
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:15,440
but it looks very much like a,
like a dinosaur to sweat this.

3410
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:18,360
He swoops down and they know what's 
coming to they buggy.

3411
02:32:18,510 --> 02:32:19,920
They're like,
fuck this.

3412
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:24,390
He swoops down God's Shitty resolution.
This must drive you nuts.

3413
02:32:24,391 --> 02:32:25,740
As a filmmaker,
I'm fine.

3414
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:28,170
A swooped down.
Clerky drops down.

3415
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,810
Boom.
He gets one or they takes it.

3416
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:37,680
Watch this snatch up,
up and away.

3417
02:32:38,601 --> 02:32:42,620
I am a beautiful,
beautiful balloon.

3418
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,820
Oh my God.
This poor thing.

3419
02:32:43,821 --> 02:32:47,630
It's like,
oh my God,

3420
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:48,913
look at that.
He literally follows it to the rocks to 

3421
02:32:51,651 --> 02:32:55,520
make sure it lands on its head and then 
boom all the way to the ground.

3422
02:32:55,521 --> 02:32:56,354
So this is a strategy.
This is a strategy for eating these 

3423
02:32:58,731 --> 02:33:01,220
goats.
So he'll go down there and now,

3424
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:04,100
easy pickins.
Easy pickins means he earned it.

3425
02:33:05,560 --> 02:33:06,393
Caught a caught.
A goat's leisure is red in tooth and 

3426
02:33:08,141 --> 02:33:08,974
claw to.
He carries it right to the rocks and 

3427
02:33:10,901 --> 02:33:13,840
then lets it go.
Watch this right here,

3428
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:19,440
but wow.
Flow so far with that one.

3429
02:33:20,210 --> 02:33:22,340
Look how far he flew.
That's incredible.

3430
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:23,593
With a goat.

3431
02:33:24,980 --> 02:33:27,740
Maybe if he got a good hold of it,
he doesn't have to throw it.

3432
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:29,970
If you couldn't carry,
I couldn't carry it.

3433
02:33:29,990 --> 02:33:33,800
Go that far with them.
What are majestic animal?

3434
02:33:33,801 --> 02:33:34,550
Do you think?
The goat.

3435
02:33:34,550 --> 02:33:35,930
There's any part of the goats.
It's like,

3436
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:40,990
maybe I'll survive this story.
I'll have to tell some amazing man.

3437
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:48,250
Amazing fucking life form flying 
monster.

3438
02:33:49,071 --> 02:33:49,904
Predator.
Do you think now that's not an American 

3439
02:33:51,471 --> 02:33:52,310
Eagle.
That's a what?

3440
02:33:52,370 --> 02:33:53,203
That's a Golden Eagle.
I think the largest eagles are these 

3441
02:33:56,211 --> 02:34:00,950
Venezuelan eagles called Harpy Eagles 
and those motherfuckers kill monkeys.

3442
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:02,420
Really?
Yeah.

3443
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:04,113
That was that a mountain goat that was a
mountain goat because it looked bigger 

3444
02:34:06,711 --> 02:34:08,750
than a mountain goat.
Some mountain go here pretty big.

3445
02:34:09,260 --> 02:34:10,093
I'm sure if you killed,
kill killing a chimpanzee that killed 

3446
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:16,670
wolves.
So just swooped down here in Mongolia,

3447
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:17,533
the have trained eagles,
Golden Eagles to attack wolves and 

3448
02:34:21,851 --> 02:34:24,010
killed them,
and then they use their for.

3449
02:34:24,750 --> 02:34:25,583
Oh,

3450
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:27,330
there's video of that too.
Can we?

3451
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:29,650
Oh yeah.
For makes you feel lazy.

3452
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:31,570
It makes you feel like it should make 
us,

3453
02:34:31,571 --> 02:34:36,571
but we should go kill something.
No sweat this.

3454
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:39,153
He swoops in.
Eagle swoops in and the wolf knows 

3455
02:34:41,411 --> 02:34:45,580
exactly what the fuck is going on.
I look at that guys face.

3456
02:34:45,581 --> 02:34:47,480
That guy is a direct descendant of 
gangs.

3457
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:48,353
Con.
I mean they have the traditional Mongol 

3458
02:34:51,790 --> 02:34:54,810
were on and these eagle swooped down.

3459
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:58,390
They see the wolf.
They know exactly what to do.

3460
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:01,820
He's got the little things.
This guy like,

3461
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:05,710
fuck this.
You can't really defend against that.

3462
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:10,090
I would have never thought that eagles 
were so fearsome to wolves.

3463
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:13,670
They thought wolves would fucking eagle 
up if you would turn around and bite it,

3464
02:35:13,671 --> 02:35:14,504
set up at the right time.
I believe a wolf dude wolfs are for 

3465
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:17,713
Rochus,
but this wolf is way bigger than the 

3466
02:35:19,721 --> 02:35:20,554
Eagle too.
Like if you look at the actual body 

3467
02:35:22,451 --> 02:35:23,350
size,
the Eagle,

3468
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,480
I mean it's like the wolf site three or 
four times bigger.

3469
02:35:25,610 --> 02:35:26,980
How small he is.
Look,

3470
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:31,870
he just grabs the back of his fucking 
neck and pierces him with his claws.

3471
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:35,820
It's amazing.
The second bird of the same team,

3472
02:35:35,830 --> 02:35:36,663
this poor dog double Jack on,
but the first one is already handled 

3473
02:35:38,651 --> 02:35:39,221
them.
Look,

3474
02:35:39,221 --> 02:35:40,054
he just grabs a hold of his head with 
those knives and just sticks those 

3475
02:35:44,021 --> 02:35:46,020
knives in his neck.
Are they eating?

3476
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:48,220
Start eating the fucking wolf.

3477
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:51,060
You would've never thought I would have 
said,

3478
02:35:51,061 --> 02:35:51,894
dude,
why didn't they ever show this shit in 

3479
02:35:52,711 --> 02:35:54,060
Milan?
This looks amazing.

3480
02:35:55,950 --> 02:35:59,670
So he gets his eagle friends that dogs 
definitely dead ranks boys.

3481
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:00,930
Oh yeah.
The Wolf's dead.

3482
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:01,853
Dead as fuck.
Look,

3483
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:05,250
another one's coming in.
How come the hands right on his arm.

3484
02:36:05,251 --> 02:36:08,610
This is amazing.
Why don't they try to eat the man?

3485
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:11,070
I don't know.
That's a good question.

3486
02:36:11,130 --> 02:36:13,110
You know what I'm saying?
Like how long before they're like,

3487
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:15,450
you know,
we could keep attacking these walls that

3488
02:36:15,451 --> 02:36:16,830
we could turn it.
Hit the dude in the hat.

3489
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:18,900
Well maybe if the dude keeps bringing 
them wolves,

3490
02:36:18,901 --> 02:36:19,880
they're like,
look guys,

3491
02:36:19,890 --> 02:36:20,850
she seems pretty cool.
Yeah.

3492
02:36:20,851 --> 02:36:23,790
But if the bird figures out like he 
didn't bring me a fucking wolf.

3493
02:36:23,791 --> 02:36:26,060
There are wolves out there for the 
taking just like they're humans.

3494
02:36:26,061 --> 02:36:26,894
I could be picking the spool off.
I can turn around and you just fucking 

3495
02:36:28,411 --> 02:36:29,820
eyes out to.
Good point.

3496
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:31,650
Damn,
you're making a lot of sense today.

3497
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:38,180
Hi,
I'm well.

3498
02:36:38,181 --> 02:36:40,350
What are we going to look up before?
We're going to look up that.

3499
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:43,233
Oh,
the Harpy Eagle that swoops down and 

3500
02:36:44,310 --> 02:36:47,940
kills monkeys as one of the reasons why 
we look up all the time.

3501
02:36:47,941 --> 02:36:48,774
Apparently people look up,
they have a consistent like instinct to 

3502
02:36:52,231 --> 02:36:54,090
look up like you're in the forest or 
something like that.

3503
02:36:54,091 --> 02:36:54,924
You look up.
One of the main reasons is they think 

3504
02:36:56,971 --> 02:36:57,804
that there's an ancient instinct that we
have to protect ourselves from flying 

3505
02:37:01,231 --> 02:37:04,200
raptors because they found,
you know,

3506
02:37:04,710 --> 02:37:07,200
old hominids,
like not necessarily humans,

3507
02:37:07,201 --> 02:37:08,034
but in the human tree that had predation
marks from eagles and the inside of 

3508
02:37:11,461 --> 02:37:15,240
their skulls.
So it came from that.

3509
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:16,550
Yeah.
From Eagles,

3510
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:20,510
from Eagle swooping down and you know,
especially in larger equals.

3511
02:37:20,511 --> 02:37:21,490
Yeah,
look up a shit.

3512
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:22,131
No,
no,

3513
02:37:22,131 --> 02:37:24,560
not look up shit.
Do you look for danger?

3514
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:27,110
Yeah Bro.
I'll use google to like,

3515
02:37:27,111 --> 02:37:28,510
come on mother fucker.
I Google everything.

3516
02:37:29,870 --> 02:37:31,550
I need references.
No I don't,

3517
02:37:31,551 --> 02:37:34,280
but apparently it's an instant.
I'm not mostly in the woods,

3518
02:37:34,281 --> 02:37:35,114
like looking around in the forest,
but apparently when you go to the 

3519
02:37:36,591 --> 02:37:37,280
forest,
right,

3520
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:41,430
there's an instinct to look up that's 
connected to cats to potentially,

3521
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:44,090
you know,
most of the time big cats are not hiding

3522
02:37:44,091 --> 02:37:47,340
in the trees and they come down and get 
fucking cats.

3523
02:37:47,350 --> 02:37:49,740
I'm worried about the ticks up because 
I'm like,

3524
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:51,440
ticks ticks in my hair,
man.

3525
02:37:51,441 --> 02:37:53,840
Somebody you have to use a big later 
burned lyme disease.

3526
02:37:53,841 --> 02:37:56,300
Man,
that's a dark and silent killer.

3527
02:37:56,810 --> 02:38:00,070
And it was something we shit develop in 
our lifetime.

3528
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:02,420
I right about that didn't exist when I 
was a kid.

3529
02:38:02,421 --> 02:38:04,790
And then one day somebody was like,
if you get bit by a deer tick,

3530
02:38:04,791 --> 02:38:06,590
it'd be fucked up for a long time.
I was like,

3531
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:08,650
mono times a thousand.
Yeah.

3532
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:11,540
I know a guy who got lyme disease,
misdiagnosed.

3533
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:12,403
Steven Kotler.
I'm a guest on the podcast really 

3534
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:14,684
recently misdiagnosed for about a year.
Wound up spending three years in the 

3535
02:38:19,281 --> 02:38:20,114
hospital because of it,
three years in the hospital because of 

3536
02:38:23,331 --> 02:38:26,120
lyme disease,
wrecked his immune system because of the

3537
02:38:26,121 --> 02:38:29,390
misdiagnosis of over a year and all 
these different doctors had told them it

3538
02:38:29,391 --> 02:38:31,580
wasn't.
It wasn't that that's what it is.

3539
02:38:31,581 --> 02:38:33,020
You're,
you might be going crazy.

3540
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:37,280
One doctor told him he had aids,
are you fucking Dr you have aids?

3541
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:38,123
And he's like,
what?

3542
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:39,250
Like the,
it was,

3543
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:40,333
you know,
during the time where a lot of people 

3544
02:38:41,211 --> 02:38:43,220
had aids and he was saying like,
this is what it was like.

3545
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:44,053
No,
I think,

3546
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,740
I think it's lyme disease.
Like was like,

3547
02:38:45,741 --> 02:38:46,490
no,
you have a.

3548
02:38:46,490 --> 02:38:48,500
it's like,
Holy Shit,

3549
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:50,210
you know,
because your immune system is devastated

3550
02:38:50,211 --> 02:38:55,100
when you have lyme disease and you just 
wasting away like to get the fuck out of

3551
02:38:55,101 --> 02:38:56,090
everybody.
Jesus,

3552
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:56,953
he didn't tell us the numbers,
but I believe he got so as Damon Wayans 

3553
02:39:03,141 --> 02:39:03,974
would say.
It had to go through a lot to get there 

3554
02:39:05,121 --> 02:39:06,650
though.
It was easier ways.

3555
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,720
I'm sure he wouldn't have chosen.
He didn't want it,

3556
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:10,340
but I think he learned a lot about 
himself,

3557
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:12,500
like overcoming this incredible health 
crisis.

3558
02:39:12,501 --> 02:39:15,770
But I've had many people that I'm 
friends with get lyme disease.

3559
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:16,933
I know at least.
But you go out in the woods alone for 

3560
02:39:19,530 --> 02:39:20,340
hunting.
Yeah.

3561
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:22,370
So that's.
And that's where they're all contracting

3562
02:39:22,371 --> 02:39:23,990
it.
I know several people who have gotten it

3563
02:39:23,991 --> 02:39:25,180
from that for sure.
Yeah.

3564
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:28,650
But I know other people that have gotten
it just from a don't say just from state

3565
02:39:28,690 --> 02:39:29,420
New York,
you know,

3566
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:30,253
you're just like,
well I don't go fishing or something 

3567
02:39:31,251 --> 02:39:32,100
like that.
I mean,

3568
02:39:32,101 --> 02:39:34,160
he doesn't have to be upstate New York 
and be North Carolina.

3569
02:39:34,190 --> 02:39:35,110
It could be,
you know,

3570
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:36,170
a lot of doors though,
right?

3571
02:39:36,410 --> 02:39:37,243
Almost all outdoors.
Almost all ticks ever happened here in 

3572
02:39:39,081 --> 02:39:41,240
California.
Yes,

3573
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:43,070
yes.
It's not as prevalent,

3574
02:39:43,130 --> 02:39:46,340
but it has happened here in California,
like tick so fucking bad news,

3575
02:39:46,341 --> 02:39:47,174
man.
Their carriers and that disease is 

3576
02:39:49,641 --> 02:39:50,474
insidious and it's.
It's a tricky one too because it's 

3577
02:39:52,041 --> 02:39:52,874
oftentimes misdiagnosed or especially 
when he was talking about Caitlyn was 

3578
02:39:57,051 --> 02:39:57,884
saying that the doctors in California 
weren't really hip to it because it's 

3579
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:03,350
not common,
but aids was more common,

3580
02:40:03,351 --> 02:40:08,310
so that's one of the reasons why this 
guy was also insurance and you know,

3581
02:40:08,311 --> 02:40:09,144
like it was a shitty deal with a doctor,
wasn't get paid very much for each 

3582
02:40:12,171 --> 02:40:14,190
person that came to him,
so it wasn't very motivated.

3583
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:18,570
We kind of went through the full gamut 
of explaining how it came to be,

3584
02:40:18,571 --> 02:40:20,580
but yeah,
misdiagnosed for a year.

3585
02:40:20,581 --> 02:40:23,890
One US bank three years in the hospital.
Yeah,

3586
02:40:23,891 --> 02:40:24,724
I,
that's a losing that much time to 

3587
02:40:26,971 --> 02:40:29,760
something where you're like,
what Pitney of fucking.

3588
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:30,863
Again,
that's where human arrogance or ego 

3589
02:40:31,831 --> 02:40:34,740
would come in.
We're going to be like a fucking bug put

3590
02:40:34,741 --> 02:40:36,120
it's dirty,
spit on me,

3591
02:40:36,121 --> 02:40:38,100
and now I'm going to be in a hospital 
three fucking years.

3592
02:40:38,101 --> 02:40:42,240
This isn't fucking fair,
and then you remember their guys out and

3593
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:47,820
fucking Tibet voltage drops to the 
vultures can eat and while you're making

3594
02:40:47,821 --> 02:40:49,580
movies and smoking weed,
you relax.

3595
02:40:49,630 --> 02:40:53,340
Yeah,
relax file I think seems pretty awesome.

3596
02:40:53,341 --> 02:40:57,390
I'm not sweat the ticks anymore and 
that's when Shit tastic.

3597
02:40:57,420 --> 02:41:00,810
I came back from recently.
I was in Vancouver.

3598
02:41:00,811 --> 02:41:01,644
I've been at.
I haven't been in the woods lately 

3599
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,930
through a directed two episodes of the 
flash one last season,

3600
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:09,000
which was fucking fun.

3601
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,640
And that one episode,
the second episode.

3602
02:41:10,670 --> 02:41:11,780
He's now,
uh,

3603
02:41:11,790 --> 02:41:12,451
yeah,
I think so.

3604
02:41:12,451 --> 02:41:14,160
The old episodes,
but it's a CW show.

3605
02:41:14,220 --> 02:41:15,350
I need to watch that show.
It's,

3606
02:41:15,410 --> 02:41:18,330
it's dope if you like DC comics.
Oh my God.

3607
02:41:18,331 --> 02:41:19,810
I love movies.
I'm,

3608
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:24,000
I'm much more into them now as I get 
older than I was when I was younger.

3609
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:27,480
It's a show.
It's the center is about a boy runs very

3610
02:41:27,481 --> 02:41:28,314
fast to solve all those problems,
but at the really it's just soap operas 

3611
02:41:31,861 --> 02:41:34,750
for boys and girls.
I'm not even gonna limit it to.

3612
02:41:34,810 --> 02:41:36,810
It's just,
they're very soap operatic.

3613
02:41:36,811 --> 02:41:37,351
It's,
you know,

3614
02:41:37,351 --> 02:41:40,500
it's like very episodic and they thrown 
an adventure each week,

3615
02:41:40,501 --> 02:41:43,170
but it's more about the relationship 
between the characters and stuff.

3616
02:41:43,171 --> 02:41:44,730
That's kind of what you keep coming back
for.

3617
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:47,790
It's good balance of heart humor and 
heroics.

3618
02:41:47,791 --> 02:41:48,450
Like,
you know,

3619
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:50,900
the got the family stuff or friendship,
stuff like that.

3620
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:51,733
It's important to be friends.
Then it got some laughs and then the 

3621
02:41:53,611 --> 02:41:54,960
heroics is like,
Holy Shit,

3622
02:41:54,961 --> 02:41:55,780
look at them,
run fast.

3623
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:56,790
Holy Shit.
Look at her fly.

3624
02:41:57,180 --> 02:41:58,013
I did an episode of supergirl as well,
so I was in Vancouver like three times 

3625
02:42:01,711 --> 02:42:04,460
in the span of the last year.
Um,

3626
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:08,610
and we were at one point out in the 
woods and I remember being kind of like,

3627
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:12,110
uh,
can I get some protection and like,

3628
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:13,620
so you're going to get laid out here in 
the woods.

3629
02:42:13,621 --> 02:42:15,960
And I was like,
no for like ticks and stuff like that.

3630
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:17,820
Like last night,
a real big problem here.

3631
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,073
I don't know if it is,
I'm from the Pacific north woods you 

3632
02:42:20,131 --> 02:42:20,964
would imagine,
but I don't think it's a real big 

3633
02:42:21,901 --> 02:42:24,900
problem in the Pacific northwest.
I think it's more,

3634
02:42:24,990 --> 02:42:26,280
it's more of an east coast problem.
Well,

3635
02:42:26,281 --> 02:42:28,530
they named it after lyme,
Connecticut.

3636
02:42:29,130 --> 02:42:31,050
That's where all the.
Where it originated.

3637
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:34,170
That's where the original diagnosis of 
it was.

3638
02:42:34,171 --> 02:42:36,440
How long had existed before.
That is anybody's guess.

3639
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:37,523
I don't know,
but I do know it's also connected to 

3640
02:42:38,791 --> 02:42:41,710
other neurological disorders like I'm 
more jealous.

3641
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:43,213
Magellan's is a weird one where people 
think they have strands of fibers 

3642
02:42:46,411 --> 02:42:51,411
growing out of their body and oftentimes
they have these crazy delusions and what

3643
02:42:51,601 --> 02:42:52,434
Kotler was saying was that it has a 
neurological effect and he didn't have 

3644
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,753
more gallons disease,
but I'm one of the doctors that I 

3645
02:42:59,131 --> 02:42:59,964
interviewed about more jealous.
He was telling me that he believes it's 

3646
02:43:03,241 --> 02:43:04,074
connected to lyme disease because lyme 
disease has some sort of neuro toxicity 

3647
02:43:07,051 --> 02:43:07,884
effect.
It has some sort of an effect where it 

3648
02:43:09,331 --> 02:43:12,250
distorts reality and Kotler had a real 
problem

3649
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:13,083
member he was talking about.
He couldn't figure out whether a 

3650
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:15,633
greenlight meant go or he didn't 
understand how to drive anymore like 

3651
02:43:19,151 --> 02:43:20,620
his,
his body out of nowhere,

3652
02:43:20,621 --> 02:43:22,420
nowhere out of nowhere.
And he's realizing,

3653
02:43:22,421 --> 02:43:23,254
wow,
something's really wrong and this neuro 

3654
02:43:25,271 --> 02:43:26,104
toxicity effect this,
this whatever it was doing to pollute 

3655
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:31,510
his brain's ability to function 
correctly,

3656
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:32,893
the more jealous people think.
It's also what makes you claw at your 

3657
02:43:34,751 --> 02:43:38,840
skin and think there's fibers in there 
and you start seeing shit that it's.

3658
02:43:39,230 --> 02:43:40,063
And then they get like fibers from their
clothes stuck to their scabs and they 

3659
02:43:42,881 --> 02:43:47,680
think that's growing out of their body,
but it's more likely just an offshoot of

3660
02:43:47,681 --> 02:43:49,900
lyme because apparently when you get 
lyme,

3661
02:43:50,050 --> 02:43:50,883
you're not getting one bacteria.
It's one of the reasons why the results 

3662
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:57,550
that people have when they,
when they get bitten,

3663
02:43:57,610 --> 02:43:58,443
vary so widely.
It's like there's a gang of different 

3664
02:44:01,001 --> 02:44:01,834
ones and there's a bunch of different 
also like a neighboring poisons and 

3665
02:44:07,121 --> 02:44:10,300
toxins that this,
this tick could have in its body.

3666
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:13,660
It might just not be the simple lyme 
disease,

3667
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:14,530
Oh,
here's that one.

3668
02:44:14,531 --> 02:44:15,364
Bacteria that tick hasn't number tick.
The tick might have a host of different 

3669
02:44:18,371 --> 02:44:21,400
pathogens that affect you as a lyme 
disease.

3670
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:22,383
Like it's not.
This is this guy who has it explaining 

3671
02:44:24,421 --> 02:44:27,720
it to me and I'm shitting my fucking 
pants because I know so many people

3672
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:30,250
gotten this and there's no one like,
Hey,

3673
02:44:30,251 --> 02:44:31,870
take this antibiotic and knocks it out.

3674
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:32,621
No,
no,

3675
02:44:32,621 --> 02:44:32,921
no,
no.

3676
02:44:32,921 --> 02:44:36,640
And it varies widely how your body 
reacts to it when you get it.

3677
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:37,790
My friend's son,
my friend,

3678
02:44:37,791 --> 02:44:39,020
Steven Rinella,
his son got it.

3679
02:44:39,250 --> 02:44:42,760
The doctor misdiagnosed.
The kid wound up getting bell's palsy.

3680
02:44:42,761 --> 02:44:45,290
Where face started going numb in child.
Yes,

3681
02:44:45,350 --> 02:44:46,490
yes,
yes.

3682
02:44:47,330 --> 02:44:49,060
He was in his fifties.
Well,

3683
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,600
most likely the young body could 
probably bounce back from it better than

3684
02:44:52,601 --> 02:44:54,520
the old body,
but for a lot of people,

3685
02:44:54,521 --> 02:44:58,240
like my friend cody has it.
He's like 26 I think,

3686
02:44:58,300 --> 02:45:02,110
and he says his fucking joints hurt all 
the time and that it's from,

3687
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:04,450
from having lyme,
like from that point on,

3688
02:45:04,451 --> 02:45:05,180
like his joints,
right?

3689
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:06,013
Always achy.
I've no have not been bit by a tick and 

3690
02:45:08,871 --> 02:45:09,704
I don't have lyme disease,
but lately I've noticed I'm 46 now so I 

3691
02:45:13,551 --> 02:45:14,384
have noticed aging in a way that I 
haven't before my knee lately doing 

3692
02:45:17,901 --> 02:45:19,640
nothing and I'm not an active guy at 
all.

3693
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:20,833
Has been being fucking weird and 
somebody said it's from descending a 

3694
02:45:23,511 --> 02:45:24,800
hill.
I walk every day,

3695
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:27,530
walk the dogs like a mile and a half a 
pill and back down.

3696
02:45:27,531 --> 02:45:30,380
That's like my exercise routine and the 
down the hill.

3697
02:45:30,381 --> 02:45:32,690
They said that's what's doing it to you 
that like how do you walk?

3698
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,553
And I was like,
I don't know like this and like you 

3699
02:45:34,161 --> 02:45:37,010
don't do heel toe.
And I was like I don't,

3700
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:38,440
I don't know,
don't know.

3701
02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:40,880
Look.
And I apparently I walk ball,

3702
02:45:40,970 --> 02:45:44,240
he'll ball heel up is the way to go.
Yes.

3703
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:45,373
Well apparently is what they're saying,
but I don't know anybody like unless 

3704
02:45:49,221 --> 02:45:50,054
you're,
unless you're thinking about walking 

3705
02:45:51,561 --> 02:45:52,394
heel toe,
I don't know if you necessarily fall 

3706
02:45:54,231 --> 02:45:55,700
into a heel toe type pattern.

3707
02:45:56,170 --> 02:45:57,003
The real issue is there's a big issue 
with shoes like the way we have 

3708
02:46:00,431 --> 02:46:04,040
constructed shoes,
we've created a gate that's an unnatural

3709
02:46:04,041 --> 02:46:04,874
like heel toe forward gate,
like people always used to walk on the 

3710
02:46:07,451 --> 02:46:08,284
ball of their foot because the ball of 
the foot acts as like a shock absorber 

3711
02:46:10,750 --> 02:46:13,730
and it allows you to slowly lower your 
heels down to the ground,

3712
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:17,120
which is why a lot of like those 
barefoot runners,

3713
02:46:17,330 --> 02:46:18,163
they do so well,
like if you're running barefoot all the 

3714
02:46:20,091 --> 02:46:20,924
time,
you're developing these incredibly 

3715
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:23,870
strong feet and they,
they,

3716
02:46:23,900 --> 02:46:26,810
they're springing and they don't need 
like these big thick cushions.

3717
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:29,450
But we,
and I guess it was like the 19 seventies

3718
02:46:29,451 --> 02:46:32,600
when Nike came out with a running shoe,
they developed that big fat ass.

3719
02:46:32,601 --> 02:46:35,210
He'll and then people started running on
the heel.

3720
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:36,183
They started bouncing on the hill 
instead of using the natural shock 

3721
02:46:38,481 --> 02:46:43,220
absorbing motion of lending shoe change 
the way we walk as human beings.

3722
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:44,720
It changed our running gait.
Wow.

3723
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:45,800
Yeah.
Which were also,

3724
02:46:45,801 --> 02:46:47,660
would it effect your walking gait?
Sure.

3725
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:48,680
Yeah,
sure.

3726
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:52,160
Yeah.
Because prior to the the sneaker who,

3727
02:46:52,161 --> 02:46:54,170
what was that guy's name?
Phil Knight or something like that,

3728
02:46:54,171 --> 02:46:56,280
or if I don't know who invented Nike Gym
years.

3729
02:46:56,470 --> 02:46:57,780
Phil Knight Champion Gym.
He goes,

3730
02:46:57,880 --> 02:46:58,713
yeah,
he's.

3731
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:01,610
He's a sneakerhead film.
That literally changed.

3732
02:47:01,611 --> 02:47:03,460
Was it?
He buys yeezys with A.

3733
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:04,880
Exactly.
Thank you.

3734
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:09,200
God bless his soul in there.
And I was like,

3735
02:47:09,201 --> 02:47:10,440
maybe that's kind of your west.
Yeah,

3736
02:47:10,441 --> 02:47:12,260
it's amazing and you don't know that.
Thank you.

3737
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:16,250
I try to keep my head firmly lodged up 
the ass of the nineties.

3738
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:18,080
That's where shit was good for me.
He was like,

3739
02:47:18,081 --> 02:47:20,330
you don't know what yeezys are like,
you get away from me,

3740
02:47:20,970 --> 02:47:21,803
you're not poisoning.
Always keep your finger on the pulse 

3741
02:47:23,511 --> 02:47:24,344
chairs.
But meanwhile people will look at this 

3742
02:47:25,011 --> 02:47:25,641
Nigga,
hey yo,

3743
02:47:25,641 --> 02:47:26,500
fresh cheese.

3744
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:27,620
And he's like,
yeah,

3745
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:30,980
Jamie gets out and he looks over at me 
like how many people have done it?

3746
02:47:30,981 --> 02:47:34,220
Like five or six years.
A lot.

3747
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:35,300
No,
look,

3748
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,160
I'm not saying it's me.
Your big sneaker head.

3749
02:47:37,270 --> 02:47:38,300
Oh,
he's a dork.

3750
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:39,253
We had a pair of sneakers growing up.
We had a smog cast pair of sneakers for 

3751
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:43,340
podcasts.
He's a super sneaker Dork,

3752
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:45,470
seekers are awesome and I loved them,
but uh,

3753
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:46,210
only like,
sorry,

3754
02:47:46,210 --> 02:47:50,330
I got to tell me man,
those converse two's fell apart on me.

3755
02:47:50,331 --> 02:47:51,164
Quick kind of shocked,
like converse ones virtually 

3756
02:47:54,261 --> 02:47:55,770
indestructible,
you know,

3757
02:47:55,790 --> 02:47:56,623
converse,
two's fell apart on me pretty fucking 

3758
02:47:57,771 --> 02:47:58,604
quick.
You tend to do a lot more active shit 

3759
02:47:59,990 --> 02:48:03,200
than the average bear though to be fair.
But like these,

3760
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:04,413
these are the shit converse ones.
These are the shit chuck Taylors to the 

3761
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:10,880
shit.
They have no soul.

3762
02:48:10,881 --> 02:48:12,770
There's like,
just like the rubber soul,

3763
02:48:12,860 --> 02:48:13,850
but there's no cushioning.

3764
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:18,500
It was like very little like sponge fans
were like that as well.

3765
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:20,210
Yeah,
sort of.

3766
02:48:20,211 --> 02:48:21,320
Yeah,
like those thin,

3767
02:48:21,530 --> 02:48:22,580
thin,
soled shoes.

3768
02:48:22,970 --> 02:48:25,160
To me it's like that's how you're 
supposed to walk.

3769
02:48:25,430 --> 02:48:28,130
You're not supposed to walk with this 
crazy cushion on the bottom.

3770
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:29,293
You know,
like whenever I do the UFC I wear dress 

3771
02:48:30,501 --> 02:48:31,334
shoes and dress shoes have like a heel 
and if you stand in them with that heel 

3772
02:48:35,121 --> 02:48:38,030
for like a while,
it kind of makes your feet feel weird.

3773
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:40,460
I don't feel good.
They want to get out of them.

3774
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:42,950
Like if you weren't like converse all 
stars,

3775
02:48:43,750 --> 02:48:44,910
you get out of them.
It's like,

3776
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:46,910
not like your feet were hurting,
you know,

3777
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:50,300
second skinny slippers.
There's so minimal.

3778
02:48:50,540 --> 02:48:51,373
They're like,
they're the best sneaker my mind for 

3779
02:48:52,611 --> 02:48:53,444
like just wearing,
just walking around where I'm not even 

3780
02:48:55,221 --> 02:48:59,660
getting paid by converse with though I'm
advocating the same way.

3781
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:00,710
You'd be like,
look,

3782
02:49:00,711 --> 02:49:03,290
we should all be nicer to each other.
We should all get $12,000

3783
02:49:03,291 --> 02:49:05,090
a year and you can all have a pair of 
these.

3784
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:08,880
You can't pretend you too fancy.
She wearing converse all stars.

3785
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:10,500
You can't pretend you like a super 
fancy,

3786
02:49:10,501 --> 02:49:13,290
easy wearing man.
He's a caring man.

3787
02:49:13,291 --> 02:49:14,730
He might sell his.
He's like,

3788
02:49:14,731 --> 02:49:17,310
you might sell them as they've been worn
for awhile.

3789
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:19,670
There's a secondhand yeezy market.
So there's.

3790
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:21,510
You can.
Somebody will buy Warren sneakers.

3791
02:49:21,511 --> 02:49:22,980
Eyebrows were up looking at music,
cyber.

3792
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:26,730
I've got some Simpson's bands from back 
in the day.

3793
02:49:26,731 --> 02:49:29,520
The people that buy your offer for,
for,

3794
02:49:29,521 --> 02:49:31,330
for those as well.
Who I bet with him,

3795
02:49:31,350 --> 02:49:32,183
that dude who didn't want to take the 40
bucks balm with running shoes looked 

3796
02:49:36,711 --> 02:49:38,260
like 1920.
Wow,

3797
02:49:38,340 --> 02:49:40,460
that's crazy.
It's got a heal.

3798
02:49:40,500 --> 02:49:42,690
They have cleats on them for their dress
shoes.

3799
02:49:42,691 --> 02:49:43,524
That's amazing.
Did they have tracks or were they just 

3800
02:49:44,761 --> 02:49:48,240
running in the dark circle?
Probably had heels.

3801
02:49:48,270 --> 02:49:49,103
The Spencer Shoe.
Possibly the first pair of specialized 

3802
02:49:52,201 --> 02:49:56,640
running shoes ever made all my God old 
timey pictures.

3803
02:49:56,641 --> 02:49:57,410
Dude.
Dude,

3804
02:49:57,410 --> 02:49:58,770
that's amazing though.

3805
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:02,560
Look at those stupid things.
This is off the topic,

3806
02:50:02,561 --> 02:50:03,394
but old timey picked your trigger to me.
Have you ever heard of the cuttings 

3807
02:50:05,830 --> 02:50:06,663
fairies now?
So I guess maybe turn of the century or 

3808
02:50:10,241 --> 02:50:12,640
the beginning,
like 1900 or something like that.

3809
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:13,703
There are these little girls in England 
that photographed themselves playing 

3810
02:50:17,951 --> 02:50:19,640
with fairies.
Whoa.

3811
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:24,780
And the world was exposed to it.
Uh,

3812
02:50:26,290 --> 02:50:30,670
not this wasn't the only person,
but uh,

3813
02:50:30,671 --> 02:50:32,860
what's his name sir?
Arthur Conan doyle.

3814
02:50:33,010 --> 02:50:35,350
There's a picture Sir Arthur Conan 
doyle.

3815
02:50:35,440 --> 02:50:39,880
The writer of Sherlock Holmes was a 
spiritualist.

3816
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:44,680
And so he actually wrote an article 
defending that picture.

3817
02:50:44,710 --> 02:50:46,240
Go.
You'd go through all the pictures.

3818
02:50:46,241 --> 02:50:48,970
Those are the [inaudible] ferry picture.
You don't want to take a leak.

3819
02:50:49,290 --> 02:50:50,100
Go ahead.

3820
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:52,920
Paid for quite a while ago,
but it needs to be debunked.

3821
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:54,390
Jamie,
tell him about your sneakers.

3822
02:50:57,490 --> 02:51:00,330
I was going to say keep talking,
but there was a will that says museum of

3823
02:51:00,331 --> 02:51:01,630
hoaxes.
I wonder what they talk about.

3824
02:51:01,631 --> 02:51:03,590
Oh,
this is a fucking hoax bedtime

3825
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:04,490
hoax.
The,

3826
02:51:04,491 --> 02:51:05,324
uh,
the kids years later admitted that they 

3827
02:51:10,101 --> 02:51:13,160
had kind of cut the picture.
They admitted something that if you look

3828
02:51:13,161 --> 02:51:14,600
at these photos,
you'll be like,

3829
02:51:14,990 --> 02:51:17,540
that had to be admitted.
Like to us.

3830
02:51:17,541 --> 02:51:22,010
It's very clearly she cut pictures out.
Those are pictures.

3831
02:51:22,011 --> 02:51:22,844
There's a two dimensional images of 
fairies and pretty traditional fairy 

3832
02:51:26,511 --> 02:51:27,650
imagery.
Um,

3833
02:51:28,550 --> 02:51:29,383
years later they revealed that they 
traced the images that have a popular 

3834
02:51:33,261 --> 02:51:37,670
book and put their own spins on them and
then cut them out and took pictures with

3835
02:51:37,671 --> 02:51:40,370
them.
But Arthur Conan doyle,

3836
02:51:40,371 --> 02:51:44,930
the guy that wrote Sherlock Holmes,
like really defended this shit.

3837
02:51:44,931 --> 02:51:45,351
Go.
No,

3838
02:51:45,351 --> 02:51:46,184
there are ferries,
there is another world and it's trying 

3839
02:51:48,111 --> 02:51:51,860
to break through and these little girls 
have been in contact with it.

3840
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:54,080
Um,
you know,

3841
02:51:54,081 --> 02:51:54,914
and he was ridiculed by over half the 
population because a lot of people 

3842
02:51:58,791 --> 02:52:00,980
looked at that picture and saw what we 
see,

3843
02:52:00,981 --> 02:52:04,820
which is kids with little cutouts,
pictures of fairies.

3844
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:10,140
But there was a time where almost half 
the world was like,

3845
02:52:10,691 --> 02:52:11,650
oh no,
that's real.

3846
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:13,060
Yeah,
that could be real.

3847
02:52:13,820 --> 02:52:14,653
The cunningly fairs or pictures of these
kids fucking took Joe and the clearly 

3848
02:52:18,491 --> 02:52:20,380
just blow one up.
Clearly fake as fuck.

3849
02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:21,283
Exactly.
But there was a time because you had 

3850
02:52:23,111 --> 02:52:25,270
somebody like Arthur Conan doyle going,
no,

3851
02:52:25,271 --> 02:52:26,104
this is real and spiritualism is a real 
thing and there are other races and 

3852
02:52:28,781 --> 02:52:29,614
other beings and fairies are real out 
there in the world defending it and 

3853
02:52:32,441 --> 02:52:33,274
stuff.
And then finally late in their lives 

3854
02:52:34,721 --> 02:52:36,310
when they were like,
nearly passed,

3855
02:52:36,980 --> 02:52:37,870
you know,
they said,

3856
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:39,093
yeah,
we cut them out of a book and they 

3857
02:52:40,601 --> 02:52:45,190
admitted to something that you knew 
right away just by looking at the photo,

3858
02:52:45,270 --> 02:52:45,611
like,
oh,

3859
02:52:45,611 --> 02:52:48,950
that's fake as shit.
But in the twenties or whatever,

3860
02:52:48,951 --> 02:52:50,710
or back in the day,
oh yeah man,

3861
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:52,690
oh my God.
You could show somebody a picture.

3862
02:52:52,691 --> 02:52:54,820
And they were like,
that's fucking real,

3863
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:55,863
but you can only imagine,
I mean how gullible people were before 

3864
02:52:59,201 --> 02:53:01,820
photos,
but when you look at it,

3865
02:53:01,890 --> 02:53:02,920
I'm like,
that's bullshit,

3866
02:53:02,921 --> 02:53:04,840
but I still think of the big foot video 
and I'm like,

3867
02:53:04,841 --> 02:53:05,674
that Shit's real.
Like when he walks past the camera and 

3868
02:53:07,361 --> 02:53:08,770
then he suddenly looks at the camera,

3869
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:12,800
a thought on this,
on this topic recently,

3870
02:53:12,801 --> 02:53:13,720
like if you,
uh,

3871
02:53:14,050 --> 02:53:14,883
at like five years from now,
if like photoshop was erased from the 

3872
02:53:17,151 --> 02:53:18,740
Internet's,
remember memories,

3873
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:22,220
how could you explain photoshop pictures
to somebody?

3874
02:53:22,221 --> 02:53:23,054
It's a good question.
Like if we live to be a few thousand 

3875
02:53:24,711 --> 02:53:25,544
years from now,
like if society goes down and then they 

3876
02:53:27,321 --> 02:53:28,154
re build computers a thousand years from
now and they look at these old images 

3877
02:53:31,581 --> 02:53:33,770
but they don't have the capability then.
Yeah,

3878
02:53:33,830 --> 02:53:34,670
totally possible.

3879
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:36,033
There'll be like,
there was somebody standing on top of 

3880
02:53:37,901 --> 02:53:38,734
one of the twin towers when a plane kid.
I remember seeing that picture and be 

3881
02:53:42,581 --> 02:53:43,780
like,
holy fucking shit.

3882
02:53:43,781 --> 02:53:46,540
How'd they find that camera?
And then I was like,

3883
02:53:46,541 --> 02:53:47,500
wait a second,
dude.

3884
02:53:47,570 --> 02:53:48,850
Yeah,
we live in the age of Photoshop.

3885
02:53:48,851 --> 02:53:49,684
Do you know the guy who created 
photoshop created with his brother is 

3886
02:53:52,631 --> 02:53:53,464
the guy that created the store,
came up with a story for this new star 

3887
02:53:56,141 --> 02:53:58,740
wars movie,
rogue one special effects wizard,

3888
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:00,130
right.
And so one day,

3889
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:00,620
you know,
they,

3890
02:54:00,620 --> 02:54:03,100
they work in the special effects because
him and his brother like,

3891
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:06,520
you know,
this would be helpful like in a,

3892
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:08,800
in a kind of home use setting,
you know,

3893
02:54:08,801 --> 02:54:11,890
like being able to take a photograph and
manipulate it.

3894
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:13,840
So in their spare time,
dude,

3895
02:54:14,350 --> 02:54:16,840
like because they were working on motion
pictures and shit.

3896
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:20,440
In their spare time they invented 
photoshop.

3897
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:21,873
Jesus Christ,
they must be gazillionaires Scott 

3898
02:54:26,440 --> 02:54:26,640
Walker.

3899
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:29,760
No,
John Carmack is John Carmack is the,

3900
02:54:29,761 --> 02:54:30,594
uh,
he's one of the original owners of ID 

3901
02:54:33,801 --> 02:54:34,750
software.
Okay.

3902
02:54:34,870 --> 02:54:37,090
He's the head programmer lead 
programmer.

3903
02:54:37,091 --> 02:54:37,924
He created quake and doom and,
and a bunch of different awesome video 

3904
02:54:41,921 --> 02:54:45,040
games.
And now he also works on Oculus rift.

3905
02:54:45,041 --> 02:54:46,270
The uh,
yeah,

3906
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:47,104
he's working on that.
A hero to the game community because he 

3907
02:54:50,411 --> 02:54:53,560
created like arguably the greatest three
d shooter of all time.

3908
02:54:53,561 --> 02:54:55,300
A series of them doom,
quake,

3909
02:54:55,330 --> 02:54:56,380
quake one,
quake two,

3910
02:54:56,410 --> 02:54:58,240
quake three.
He,

3911
02:54:58,560 --> 02:54:59,393
uh,
in his spare time made rockets in his 

3912
02:55:01,661 --> 02:55:03,500
spare time.
He was a rocket scientist.

3913
02:55:03,501 --> 02:55:03,980
So he

3914
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:08,060
was,
he was coding the most complicated three

3915
02:55:08,061 --> 02:55:11,300
d graphics engines known to man for 
video games.

3916
02:55:11,301 --> 02:55:12,134
Right.
Then in his spare times he's making 

3917
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:15,673
rockets.
He's a fucking rocket scientists for 

3918
02:55:17,661 --> 02:55:18,494
fun.
Then he would take Ferrari's and turbo 

3919
02:55:21,911 --> 02:55:24,500
charged them.
So we'd get these Ferrari's because he's

3920
02:55:24,501 --> 02:55:25,334
got ungodly sums of money for making all
these fucking crazy video games that 

3921
02:55:27,741 --> 02:55:29,480
have sold millions of copies.
Right.

3922
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:30,733
He's buying Ferrari's and reengineering 
their fucking engines and his spare 

3923
02:55:35,750 --> 02:55:36,860
time.
What do you mean?

3924
02:55:36,861 --> 02:55:41,150
What were you engineering twin turbo 
charging for robberies.

3925
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:44,360
So that makes a gigantic.
This was a long time ago,

3926
02:55:44,361 --> 02:55:46,400
man,
where a Ferrari would have,

3927
02:55:46,401 --> 02:55:48,950
like if it came from the factory,
maybe 400 horsepower,

3928
02:55:49,100 --> 02:55:54,100
he would jack them bitches up to like a 
thousand his spare time.

3929
02:55:55,551 --> 02:55:55,740
Right.

3930
02:55:55,740 --> 02:55:58,350
He was making renaissance man of a real 
life.

3931
02:55:58,351 --> 02:55:59,184
Buckaroo Banzai if you will,
a guy who you and I are barely in the 

3932
02:56:03,241 --> 02:56:04,350
same speech to.
Yeah,

3933
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:05,460
exactly.
Barely.

3934
02:56:06,150 --> 02:56:07,410
That's true.
In a moment like that,

3935
02:56:07,411 --> 02:56:07,831
you're like,
well,

3936
02:56:07,831 --> 02:56:11,730
I can't do any of those things by being 
like,

3937
02:56:12,090 --> 02:56:12,923
well,
he probably can't make a real good Dick 

3938
02:56:14,701 --> 02:56:17,880
joke and then that's not enough.
I'd much rather be him than me.

3939
02:56:17,910 --> 02:56:20,820
Better off to not balance yourself out.
How not to go.

3940
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:21,691
Well,
he can't do it.

3941
02:56:21,691 --> 02:56:24,720
I better off to just go look at this 
crazy motherfucker.

3942
02:56:25,470 --> 02:56:27,270
Appreciate someone else's ability.
Yeah.

3943
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:30,990
The less time you compare yourself to 
other people,

3944
02:56:31,270 --> 02:56:34,800
the better off you'll be.
Just enjoy how amazing people are.

3945
02:56:34,950 --> 02:56:35,880
Don't think,
man,

3946
02:56:35,881 --> 02:56:38,330
I wish I was at a managing that.
Well,

3947
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:40,350
I think.
Well that's what I was going back to the

3948
02:56:40,351 --> 02:56:43,830
$12,000
a year for $12,000

3949
02:56:43,831 --> 02:56:44,664
a year for everybody.

3950
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:45,833
I think what gets in the way,
it's human nature because you have some 

3951
02:56:47,791 --> 02:56:50,780
people who were like,
why is he he don't deserve that 12,000

3952
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:51,633
or he gets a lot.
He's got a nicer house and he's also 

3953
02:56:53,521 --> 02:56:55,440
getting the $12,000
I'm getting.

3954
02:56:55,700 --> 02:56:56,311
Oh yeah,
for sure.

3955
02:56:56,311 --> 02:56:58,380
I think that would start seeping in.
Yeah,

3956
02:56:58,381 --> 02:57:02,350
but he gets a lot because he makes money
on top of the 12,000,

3957
02:57:02,550 --> 02:57:04,670
so like his needs are taken care of.
Bucharest,

3958
02:57:04,740 --> 02:57:07,980
logical human animal doesn't always see 
things logically.

3959
02:57:07,981 --> 02:57:09,240
Sometimes they'd just be like,
why?

3960
02:57:09,241 --> 02:57:14,060
Then when we get selfish that I was 
12,000

3961
02:57:14,090 --> 02:57:16,010
years comes into problem when it comes 
into.

3962
02:57:16,060 --> 02:57:18,090
Oh,
we don't know because I don't think it's

3963
02:57:18,091 --> 02:57:20,730
ever been really,
at least on a wide scale.

3964
02:57:20,731 --> 02:57:22,350
It's ever been practiced.
I'm with you.

3965
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:25,430
I just don't think our system.
How many people did you say we had an in

3966
02:57:25,460 --> 02:57:28,470
this country?
300 something million plus Mexicans.

3967
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:31,230
So do quick math.
What does that,

3968
02:57:31,231 --> 02:57:32,930
how much?
I'm sure they've done it out.

3969
02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:34,403
There was an argument by an economist 
like a really well respected economist 

3970
02:57:37,170 --> 02:57:37,900
for

3971
02:57:37,900 --> 02:57:42,190
universal basic income and I think the 
number they were going by was $12,000

3972
02:57:42,191 --> 02:57:43,060
a year.
See,

3973
02:57:43,090 --> 02:57:47,110
I'm surprisingly supports universal 
basic income.

3974
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:49,960
Just Google that.
And because there was some,

3975
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:50,823
um,
pretty prominent economist who actually 

3976
02:57:54,191 --> 02:57:55,550
understands the system,
uh,

3977
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:56,930
except for you and I,
they're like,

3978
02:57:56,950 --> 02:57:58,600
oh,
I got enough money I can do my thing.

3979
02:57:59,220 --> 02:58:01,890
Is this like Noam Chomsky,
Noam Chomsky,

3980
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:02,850
he's,
um,

3981
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:04,420
he's a linguist,
right?

3982
02:58:04,650 --> 02:58:05,800
So He's not a,
uh,

3983
02:58:05,960 --> 02:58:06,793
not going to be talking about.
Are you ever trying to follow Noam 

3984
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:11,910
Chomsky stuff on language to,
to like,

3985
02:58:12,050 --> 02:58:13,320
it's,
it makes you,

3986
02:58:13,950 --> 02:58:16,650
it feels like doing exercise with your 
brain.

3987
02:58:17,230 --> 02:58:19,310
It feels like you're doing a workout.
Um,

3988
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:23,820
the easiest way to I think take in some 
Chomsky is,

3989
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:26,100
is uh,
there was that movie they did.

3990
02:58:26,101 --> 02:58:30,660
It was a documentary.
Is the tall man happy,

3991
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:33,510
I think is the name of it is the man who
is tall,

3992
02:58:33,511 --> 02:58:35,020
happy.
Um,

3993
02:58:35,050 --> 02:58:37,380
and it was directed by,
um,

3994
02:58:37,470 --> 02:58:39,590
the guy that,
oh,

3995
02:58:39,740 --> 02:58:41,940
this isn't my Michel Gondry the 
director.

3996
02:58:41,970 --> 02:58:42,803
He made a very interesting documentary 
that was partly animated in a 

3997
02:58:46,021 --> 02:58:48,340
conversation with about Chomsky.
Yeah.

3998
02:58:48,350 --> 02:58:51,060
What was it called again?
Is the man who is tall,

3999
02:58:51,061 --> 02:58:52,860
happy,
I believe is the title.

4000
02:58:54,270 --> 02:58:55,140
And it's wonderful.

4001
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:55,973
It's like beginners.
It's Chomsky for beginners because it's 

4002
02:58:58,681 --> 02:59:01,950
very colorful and breaks it down.
But I've watched the other morning I got

4003
02:59:01,951 --> 02:59:02,784
up and blazed and watch three interviews
with him talking about postelection and 

4004
02:59:07,111 --> 02:59:11,760
stuff and his take on everything.
And Oh my God,

4005
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:12,970
like even at the,
and he's,

4006
02:59:13,010 --> 02:59:16,500
he's advanced in age at this point,
but that mind is,

4007
02:59:16,800 --> 02:59:17,633
you know,
sharp as a tack and it's one of those 

4008
02:59:19,021 --> 02:59:19,890
magic and be like,
Ugh,

4009
02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:22,230
it's going to be a loss to lose that 
money.

4010
02:59:22,231 --> 02:59:23,064
He's thinking about things that a lot of
others aren't in his thing that spooked 

4011
02:59:26,311 --> 02:59:27,660
me.
Big Deal was a,

4012
02:59:28,710 --> 02:59:31,140
uh,
he said right now the whole world should

4013
02:59:31,141 --> 02:59:31,974
be focused on the,
on the Russian front on Russia and the 

4014
02:59:35,611 --> 02:59:40,170
Russian front because that's where your 
hotspot of activities like United States

4015
02:59:40,171 --> 02:59:42,030
and Russia have come in conflict 
recently,

4016
02:59:42,090 --> 02:59:44,820
recently in a way that they haven't 
since the Cold War.

4017
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:47,460
And he's going in there.
You're talking about Su two super powers

4018
02:59:47,461 --> 02:59:48,294
with the ability to destroy the planet 
shit that we haven't really thought 

4019
02:59:50,311 --> 02:59:53,400
about since the fucking eighties.
And all of a sudden you're like,

4020
02:59:53,430 --> 02:59:54,263
oh,
is that what they meant by make America 

4021
02:59:54,961 --> 02:59:55,651
great again?
Like,

4022
02:59:55,651 --> 02:59:59,430
let's be scared of the popular possible 
nuclear annihilation.

4023
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:01,830
Because I thought about that in years.
I'll be honest with you.

4024
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:04,050
That was another thing that bummed me 
out about the Clinton campaign.

4025
03:00:04,320 --> 03:00:05,153
They were Russian fearmongering.
One of the big things that she kept 

4026
03:00:07,501 --> 03:00:08,334
saying during the election was they were
talking about being hacked and she's 

4027
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:11,793
saying it was the Russians,
so she was implying to Donald Trump 

4028
03:00:13,801 --> 03:00:14,634
supports the Russians because he 
supports the hacks and there's no 

4029
03:00:17,371 --> 03:00:18,810
evidence to the Russians did it?
None.

4030
03:00:19,210 --> 03:00:20,043
I've looked at it.
People got mad at me and so that I've 

4031
03:00:22,111 --> 03:00:23,040
looked into a deeply.

4032
03:00:23,180 --> 03:00:24,013
He.
There's no one has proven that the 

4033
03:00:24,961 --> 03:00:27,090
Russians have done it,
but they're saying it is.

4034
03:00:27,091 --> 03:00:28,680
If they proven the Russians have done 
it.

4035
03:00:28,860 --> 03:00:31,160
So one of two things,
either progressions.

4036
03:00:31,190 --> 03:00:32,850
They're not that they actually tinkered 
with short.

4037
03:00:32,851 --> 03:00:33,684
I would admit it too,
but there's no evidence that they did 

4038
03:00:35,151 --> 03:00:35,640
it.
Okay.

4039
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:36,473
I mean who knows if they did fair point,
but the problem is if you say they did 

4040
03:00:39,541 --> 03:00:41,250
it,
you got to know for sure they did it.

4041
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:42,113
Otherwise I'm going to listen to you 
every time you say you know something 

4042
03:00:44,611 --> 03:00:45,840
for sure.
And I'm like,

4043
03:00:45,841 --> 03:00:47,550
this bitch definitely doesn't know for 
sure.

4044
03:00:47,610 --> 03:00:50,550
You can't know for sure because you 
don't have the information.

4045
03:00:50,551 --> 03:00:53,880
If you did he tell us what it was like,
you don't know.

4046
03:00:54,030 --> 03:00:54,863
And the FBI and the CIA doesn't say they
know there's a likelihood there's a 

4047
03:00:58,381 --> 03:01:00,340
possibility,
there's a high probability,

4048
03:01:00,610 --> 03:01:01,443
but you don't know.

4049
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:03,850
So until you don't know,
until you know you can't say,

4050
03:01:03,851 --> 03:01:05,200
you know,
because as soon as you do,

4051
03:01:05,201 --> 03:01:07,270
because you might be full of shit about 
other things,

4052
03:01:07,390 --> 03:01:08,650
you might,
you know,

4053
03:01:08,710 --> 03:01:11,650
you might fill in the blank on a bunch 
of other important stuff and pretend you

4054
03:01:11,651 --> 03:01:12,820
know,
when you don't know,

4055
03:01:12,821 --> 03:01:13,810
because that's what you're,
you're doing.

4056
03:01:13,990 --> 03:01:15,480
And I think that's another thing as 
like,

4057
03:01:15,490 --> 03:01:17,800
as a civilization,
we can't allow that.

4058
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:20,380
We can't allow that.
Like in Donald Trump,

4059
03:01:20,381 --> 03:01:22,720
when he keeps talking about these 
millions of voters that,

4060
03:01:22,721 --> 03:01:23,554
uh,
that the illegally voted and kept him 

4061
03:01:24,821 --> 03:01:25,654
from winning the popular vote.
You can't say that you can't do that 

4062
03:01:28,781 --> 03:01:29,614
anymore.
Why?

4063
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:31,810
Because you can't lie when number one 
lie.

4064
03:01:31,870 --> 03:01:34,450
Number one,
you couldn't do that before.

4065
03:01:35,430 --> 03:01:38,920
He kinda seems to have brought it back 
and it hasn't killed him.

4066
03:01:38,980 --> 03:01:42,160
He is in fact the president.
What you do this thing when you put your

4067
03:01:42,161 --> 03:01:44,590
hand on the ancient book,
Dude,

4068
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:45,360
I'm with you,
but we're.

4069
03:01:45,360 --> 03:01:46,193
We're in the episode daisy him now.
Like it doesn't matter what used to be 

4070
03:01:49,181 --> 03:01:50,014
and there is no more.
You can't because of things like that 

4071
03:01:51,971 --> 03:01:53,530
where you're like,
well you couldn't,

4072
03:01:53,531 --> 03:01:55,510
but he did and everything worked out 
fine.

4073
03:01:57,610 --> 03:01:58,443
I'm totally with you in terms of like 
you shouldn't write fucking say that 

4074
03:02:01,901 --> 03:02:03,790
because that starts breaking the system 
down.

4075
03:02:03,791 --> 03:02:05,410
But then again we were just talking 
about like,

4076
03:02:05,411 --> 03:02:08,380
is this a system that you even want to 
place in a world where you're like,

4077
03:02:08,381 --> 03:02:10,630
do we need a president?
Who Cares?

4078
03:02:10,690 --> 03:02:11,910
What's being said?
Then like,

4079
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:12,753
why?
Why does it matter if somebody being 

4080
03:02:13,751 --> 03:02:14,584
like the really?
There was a people that voted that 

4081
03:02:16,061 --> 03:02:17,130
didn't vote.
Yeah,

4082
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:20,680
because he's the guy now see like if you
want that position,

4083
03:02:20,710 --> 03:02:23,170
you have to be under oath all the time.
That's what it's got to be like.

4084
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:24,033
Totally.
Like if you really want to say that you 

4085
03:02:24,851 --> 03:02:28,330
are so noble or you're so powerful or 
wise or whatever you are,

4086
03:02:28,331 --> 03:02:30,100
that you have,
whatever your attributes are,

4087
03:02:30,250 --> 03:02:32,200
you're so awesome that you should be the
president.

4088
03:02:32,590 --> 03:02:36,880
I know you can't be lying about illegal 
voters unless you have some data.

4089
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:38,590
You can't say it until you have some 
data.

4090
03:02:38,591 --> 03:02:39,424
You can't say it.
And once you say you got to have some 

4091
03:02:40,901 --> 03:02:41,734
data,
but he got a lot of things with no data 

4092
03:02:43,121 --> 03:02:44,000
whatsoever.
I know,

4093
03:02:44,030 --> 03:02:46,480
but we understand anything to get 
elected.

4094
03:02:46,481 --> 03:02:47,314
But now we're beyond that.
I know still playing the same kind of 

4095
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:50,013
game.
I'm just,

4096
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:52,570
I've just not grown comfortable with.
But I think,

4097
03:02:52,571 --> 03:02:55,450
um,
I have to learn to accept the fact that,

4098
03:02:56,790 --> 03:02:57,623
you know,
what I used to consider a fact is no 

4099
03:02:59,201 --> 03:03:00,034
longer fact.
People talk about facts in this real 

4100
03:03:01,631 --> 03:03:03,580
loose way now where they're just like,
well,

4101
03:03:03,581 --> 03:03:04,414
what is the fact?
The fact that you may not be effect to 

4102
03:03:05,561 --> 03:03:06,011
me?
And it's like,

4103
03:03:06,011 --> 03:03:07,750
well that's not the definition of fact 
at all.

4104
03:03:07,751 --> 03:03:09,790
The fact is a fact,
but people go,

4105
03:03:09,791 --> 03:03:12,190
what's factual for you may not be 
factual for me.

4106
03:03:12,640 --> 03:03:15,430
We're on such a fucking slippery slope 
now that a matrix,

4107
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:20,170
that's the least egregious thing at this
point of him being like 2 million people

4108
03:03:20,171 --> 03:03:21,004
voted illegally because the dude was 
literally saying he won the popular 

4109
03:03:22,721 --> 03:03:23,500
vote.
Like right.

4110
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:26,250
That's the first big kind of untruth.
Well,

4111
03:03:26,251 --> 03:03:27,084
as he said,
a lot of things that like sometimes he 

4112
03:03:28,361 --> 03:03:29,800
chucks up to like,
I was kidding.

4113
03:03:30,490 --> 03:03:32,230
It's the same kind of thing.
It's,

4114
03:03:32,231 --> 03:03:33,064
you know,
someone saying that the Russians hacked 

4115
03:03:34,420 --> 03:03:37,900
the Democratic National Conference or 
committee or whatever the fuck it is.

4116
03:03:37,901 --> 03:03:40,860
Dnc W are you sure?
You know,

4117
03:03:40,870 --> 03:03:43,720
that's the same thing.
Like saying that like these are all like

4118
03:03:44,020 --> 03:03:44,853
whether the little tiny lies or whether 
they're a leaps of faith or leaps of 

4119
03:03:47,681 --> 03:03:49,990
judgment or whether they're just full 
fabrications,

4120
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:51,820
a,
you can't do any of them.

4121
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:53,950
Shouldn't be able to do any of those.
I agree.

4122
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:57,280
Like if anybody catches you,
like if you're in big government and you

4123
03:03:57,281 --> 03:03:57,980
know,
there's a video

4124
03:03:57,980 --> 03:03:58,813
of the FBI saying one thing and then you
say another thing when the Fbi told me 

4125
03:04:01,161 --> 03:04:01,994
this and the FBI saying explicitly what 
they told you and those things don't 

4126
03:04:04,041 --> 03:04:04,874
match.
There should be a trial and she'd be 

4127
03:04:06,621 --> 03:04:07,820
like,
are you a liar?

4128
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:08,660
Like,
do you,

4129
03:04:08,660 --> 03:04:11,750
do you,
do you get interviews extended to people

4130
03:04:11,751 --> 03:04:12,441
that are like,
you know,

4131
03:04:12,441 --> 03:04:15,920
the president was born and should only 
be when you have power Muslim countries.

4132
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:17,390
Like if you,
if you're have like,

4133
03:04:17,391 --> 03:04:18,224
yeah,
he's a perfect example when he was 

4134
03:04:19,131 --> 03:04:21,590
saying that,
that he was born in Kenya,

4135
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:23,930
like trump was like a major league 
birther.

4136
03:04:24,140 --> 03:04:25,560
Like that's a perfect example.
Yeah,

4137
03:04:26,170 --> 03:04:31,170
he was some theorize I've read that he 
kind of jumped onto the birther movement

4138
03:04:32,140 --> 03:04:33,670
because he was like,
well,

4139
03:04:33,970 --> 03:04:36,580
if I ingratiate myself with this crowd,
that will be helpful.

4140
03:04:36,970 --> 03:04:38,500
If I want to run for president.

4141
03:04:38,970 --> 03:04:41,540
He might've like watched a youtube video
and it.

4142
03:04:42,470 --> 03:04:45,510
I'd like to think that.
I mean,

4143
03:04:45,511 --> 03:04:46,344
I don't like to think,
but I choose to think that he's smarter 

4144
03:04:49,411 --> 03:04:51,210
than that.
Oh man,

4145
03:04:51,211 --> 03:04:53,910
he could have just been him like 
recently he tweeted,

4146
03:04:54,390 --> 03:04:57,270
anyone who burns the flag should go to 
jail and be rested.

4147
03:04:57,271 --> 03:04:58,104
And then they found out I read an 
article online that they had just run a 

4148
03:05:01,591 --> 03:05:02,424
piece on Fox News about flag burning.
So he was kind of informed by something 

4149
03:05:07,291 --> 03:05:10,930
he just watched on TV.
Did you know tell most people tweet,

4150
03:05:10,931 --> 03:05:12,180
right?
They see something go like that,

4151
03:05:12,181 --> 03:05:15,720
but that's not what you want out of the 
chief executive of a country.

4152
03:05:15,721 --> 03:05:17,730
At least that's traditionally not what 
people want it.

4153
03:05:17,731 --> 03:05:20,040
But this time that seems to be what 
people want.

4154
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:20,933
Digital.
Hillary Clinton had proposed that very 

4155
03:05:21,961 --> 03:05:22,794
same thing in 2005.
She proposed that flag burning should 

4156
03:05:26,401 --> 03:05:27,234
have a stiff fine in a year in jail.
Like she said that and she's not the 

4157
03:05:31,111 --> 03:05:33,780
president.
I know now that he is.

4158
03:05:33,781 --> 03:05:34,080
Yeah,
it's.

4159
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:37,440
Well the whole thing is uber,
Uber Bizarre.

4160
03:05:37,790 --> 03:05:40,400
Where do you feel like and an and,
and I don't want to,

4161
03:05:42,140 --> 03:05:43,970
you know,
paying it cynically,

4162
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:44,833
like this country has been here for 
awhile and probably be here for a lot 

4163
03:05:47,421 --> 03:05:50,330
longer than,
than our petty issues within,

4164
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:54,350
in the moment if we have issues with it,
but I just,

4165
03:05:54,380 --> 03:05:57,010
you know,
just it,

4166
03:05:57,160 --> 03:06:00,620
it became a different world in the span 
of six months.

4167
03:06:01,290 --> 03:06:02,810
Yeah.
I feel like it did to like,

4168
03:06:02,820 --> 03:06:04,040
you know,
in a way where,

4169
03:06:04,070 --> 03:06:05,610
you know,
I thought I had this down.

4170
03:06:05,630 --> 03:06:07,670
Like I think about this whenever I was 
in school.

4171
03:06:07,970 --> 03:06:10,310
You'd read your history books and you'd 
be like,

4172
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:14,270
how come they didn't stop this?
Why did they know this was going on?

4173
03:06:14,300 --> 03:06:15,133
Like,
what the,

4174
03:06:15,320 --> 03:06:17,720
are you serious?
Like I'm sitting here as a child reading

4175
03:06:17,721 --> 03:06:20,930
this and I know that this is wrong.
Why didn't someone step in?

4176
03:06:20,931 --> 03:06:21,860
Why didn't Blah Blah,
blah.

4177
03:06:22,070 --> 03:06:22,903
I remember going to Germany the first 
time with clerks and went to the Berlin 

4178
03:06:26,031 --> 03:06:29,240
film festival and before screening me 
and my friend Brian Johnson,

4179
03:06:29,241 --> 03:06:29,691
we were like,
well,

4180
03:06:29,691 --> 03:06:32,330
let's go see a concentration camp.
We're here.

4181
03:06:32,331 --> 03:06:34,220
Which goes,
he concentrated again and they're like,

4182
03:06:34,221 --> 03:06:35,054
dude,
you got to introduce a comedy in three 

4183
03:06:35,991 --> 03:06:37,340
hours.
You really don't want to do that.

4184
03:06:38,330 --> 03:06:39,440
Compartmentalize.
I was like,

4185
03:06:39,441 --> 03:06:40,640
let me,
I'm here.

4186
03:06:40,641 --> 03:06:42,710
I got to see history.
And so,

4187
03:06:42,711 --> 03:06:45,610
you know,
we went to a boot,

4188
03:06:45,690 --> 03:06:49,820
can walled the one that says at mocked 
fry over at work will make you free,

4189
03:06:49,821 --> 03:06:52,870
like the worst fucking lie.
And um,

4190
03:06:52,940 --> 03:06:53,661
it's,
you know,

4191
03:06:53,661 --> 03:06:56,340
obviously fucking sobering and horrible

4192
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:57,173
and you know,
and they,

4193
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:58,013
she seeing the dimensions and spaces 
where things happened and whatnot and 

4194
03:07:01,861 --> 03:07:02,694
you can't help but turn to the guy who 
was our cab driver who drove us for 

4195
03:07:05,761 --> 03:07:07,980
Berlin,
which was like 40 minutes out of Berlin,

4196
03:07:07,981 --> 03:07:11,520
maybe an hour out of Berlin and then 
drove us back and you know,

4197
03:07:11,521 --> 03:07:12,960
he was waiting with us while we're 
there.

4198
03:07:12,961 --> 03:07:13,794
So he went through the concentration 
camp and he was born and raised in 

4199
03:07:15,661 --> 03:07:18,210
Germany.
So I'm sure he's had to do this a number

4200
03:07:18,211 --> 03:07:19,800
of times with school or something like 
that.

4201
03:07:20,580 --> 03:07:22,230
But you couldn't help but on the ride 
back,

4202
03:07:22,231 --> 03:07:24,150
he didn't want to be that American Dick.
But it's like,

4203
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:28,140
did anyone in your family?
No.

4204
03:07:28,141 --> 03:07:28,974
Did you guys talk about this?
Like how do they handle this sort of 

4205
03:07:32,220 --> 03:07:33,053
thing over here?
Like how did you guys wake up after it 

4206
03:07:35,791 --> 03:07:36,624
was all over and go back to what was the
new normal like you realize this is 

4207
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:42,240
fucking heinous,
you know,

4208
03:07:42,241 --> 03:07:43,074
and the guy was just like,
it's taught to us in school and there 

4209
03:07:45,211 --> 03:07:46,270
was a moment when,
you know,

4210
03:07:46,310 --> 03:07:47,143
every young kid in school learns about 
Hitler and the Third Reich and the 

4211
03:07:50,071 --> 03:07:52,790
Holocaust that they go back to their 
parents and start saying like,

4212
03:07:52,800 --> 03:07:54,660
how much did you knew how much to 
grandma and Grandpa?

4213
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:55,493
No,
blah blah blah.

4214
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:58,890
So I think of moments like that where 
I'm just saying I'm not,

4215
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:02,700
I'm certainly not comparing this country
to the fucking Germany by any stretch of

4216
03:08:02,701 --> 03:08:03,534
imagination.
I'm just saying.

4217
03:08:04,230 --> 03:08:06,330
Not at all.
Not at all.

4218
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:10,980
All I'm saying is like there are moments
in history where,

4219
03:08:10,981 --> 03:08:13,110
you know,
I thought we were kind of passed it.

4220
03:08:13,111 --> 03:08:14,490
History happens all the time.
You know,

4221
03:08:14,491 --> 03:08:17,880
obviously September 11th is a very big 
historical moment in our lifetime.

4222
03:08:18,810 --> 03:08:20,130
But I really felt like,
well,

4223
03:08:20,310 --> 03:08:22,800
you know,
until like world war three,

4224
03:08:22,890 --> 03:08:25,050
we're probably done with history for a 
little bit,

4225
03:08:25,530 --> 03:08:26,363
which is ridiculous fucking statement,
but now I feel like we're living in a 

4226
03:08:29,881 --> 03:08:30,714
chapter in a history book.
Some kid in the future is going to be 

4227
03:08:32,311 --> 03:08:34,560
looking at this chapter and being like 
really?

4228
03:08:34,610 --> 03:08:35,443
Like they didn't know that's what they 
did and I'm not saying again like I 

4229
03:08:37,711 --> 03:08:39,720
expect horrible things from this guy or 
anything.

4230
03:08:39,720 --> 03:08:40,553
I'm just saying the world is vastly 
changed in a way that it's going to be 

4231
03:08:43,891 --> 03:08:47,100
recognized,
recognized now and it will be recognized

4232
03:08:47,190 --> 03:08:48,023
when they write the book on this year 
and when they write the book on this 

4233
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:53,880
year for years to come.
Suddenly we're kind of in that moment as

4234
03:08:53,881 --> 03:08:54,714
well.
But then again we probably were always 

4235
03:08:57,271 --> 03:09:00,010
in a moment of history and I don't even 
mean in a stoner way.

4236
03:09:00,011 --> 03:09:02,220
Like this is a moment of history and 
this is a moment in history,

4237
03:09:02,221 --> 03:09:05,460
but history is not always that loud and 
noticeable.

4238
03:09:05,461 --> 03:09:07,890
Sometimes it's quiet and they don't 
notice it until later on.

4239
03:09:07,900 --> 03:09:09,420
But we've gone through it.
I mean,

4240
03:09:09,510 --> 03:09:12,660
I'm a couple of years older than you,
but we remember Reagan.

4241
03:09:12,720 --> 03:09:15,630
Yeah,
we remember the Iran Contra affair.

4242
03:09:15,890 --> 03:09:18,390
Is that what it feels like culturally?
It felt like.

4243
03:09:18,391 --> 03:09:20,190
So I was just having this discussion 
with somebody else,

4244
03:09:20,191 --> 03:09:22,860
but in the seventies,
sixties,

4245
03:09:23,610 --> 03:09:28,170
sixties into the seventies,
you had this kind of progressive growing

4246
03:09:28,171 --> 03:09:30,080
America where suddenly,
you know,

4247
03:09:30,090 --> 03:09:31,980
maybe there wasn't as much segregation 
and,

4248
03:09:32,430 --> 03:09:33,490
and you know,
people were.

4249
03:09:34,230 --> 03:09:35,063
People were kind of developing and 
evolving and becoming more like the 

4250
03:09:39,631 --> 03:09:43,230
world we recognized now and it felt 
like,

4251
03:09:43,231 --> 03:09:44,064
you know,
like by showing you stuff like all in 

4252
03:09:45,331 --> 03:09:47,580
the family and whatnot,
you know,

4253
03:09:47,581 --> 03:09:48,414
arts and um,
tries to push the edge of the envelope 

4254
03:09:50,641 --> 03:09:53,770
at all times.
Try to put normalcy into something that,

4255
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:54,090
you

4256
03:09:54,090 --> 03:09:54,923
know,
a situation that you maybe don't find 

4257
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:58,180
normal.
But if you see it on TV enough,

4258
03:09:58,181 --> 03:09:58,780
you're like,
Hey,

4259
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:00,700
I'm over it.
And suddenly it's for real.

4260
03:10:00,701 --> 03:10:02,770
And stuff like that.
Felt like,

4261
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:05,410
you know,
the eighties and Reagan.

4262
03:10:05,411 --> 03:10:06,244
And again,
I'm not a political creature by any 

4263
03:10:07,061 --> 03:10:08,440
stretch of the imagination.
I lived through it,

4264
03:10:08,441 --> 03:10:11,380
but I was not active during it by any 
stretch of the imagination,

4265
03:10:11,381 --> 03:10:16,360
but it feels like that time was a 
reaction to the culture,

4266
03:10:16,390 --> 03:10:17,170
like,
hey,

4267
03:10:17,170 --> 03:10:19,780
things have gotten too loosey goosey 
around here,

4268
03:10:20,140 --> 03:10:23,450
and then things got conservative for 
eight years or.

4269
03:10:23,670 --> 03:10:24,503
Yeah,
and then it feels like things loosened 

4270
03:10:26,381 --> 03:10:26,891
up.
I mean,

4271
03:10:26,891 --> 03:10:28,210
again,
I'm no political analysts,

4272
03:10:28,211 --> 03:10:30,100
but it just seems like if you look over 
your history,

4273
03:10:30,940 --> 03:10:35,940
it contracts and it expands the 
contracts and it expands,

4274
03:10:35,981 --> 03:10:40,981
but the contractions don't seem to bring
it back to square one.

4275
03:10:41,560 --> 03:10:42,393
You know,
it may be a matter of of two steps 

4276
03:10:43,961 --> 03:10:45,280
forward,
one step back,

4277
03:10:45,281 --> 03:10:46,990
two steps forward,
one step back.

4278
03:10:46,990 --> 03:10:49,030
And if you do that enough of the course 
of a nation,

4279
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:51,820
there's growth and you'll see the 
balance.

4280
03:10:51,821 --> 03:10:55,930
But you've got a bunch of people that 
don't believe in the same things,

4281
03:10:56,170 --> 03:10:58,810
don't even see the world through the 
same prism.

4282
03:10:58,811 --> 03:11:00,040
So it just feels like,
I don't know.

4283
03:11:00,041 --> 03:11:02,470
I mean maybe the idea,
and again,

4284
03:11:02,490 --> 03:11:06,130
a couple stoners talking about how to,
how to do the presidency better.

4285
03:11:06,520 --> 03:11:09,400
Maybe you just have an agreement where 
it's like eight years of this,

4286
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:10,353
eight years of that,
and that's only if it's a two party 

4287
03:11:11,381 --> 03:11:12,214
system,
like what if you come up with a four 

4288
03:11:14,111 --> 03:11:15,580
party system and you're like,
okay,

4289
03:11:15,581 --> 03:11:17,710
you only get four years and then the 
next.

4290
03:11:17,750 --> 03:11:20,110
Then it goes to this party right after.
Then this part of this is a

4291
03:11:20,110 --> 03:11:20,943
multiple party system.
You can have a multiple independent 

4292
03:11:23,291 --> 03:11:24,910
parties.
If you look at the ballot,

4293
03:11:24,911 --> 03:11:27,340
a lot of other people wanting to run for
president,

4294
03:11:27,341 --> 03:11:30,010
right?
Like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein and I'm

4295
03:11:30,011 --> 03:11:31,800
sure there were a bunch of other ones 
that we don't know.

4296
03:11:32,110 --> 03:11:34,070
Yeah,
there was Zoltan Istvan who's the.

4297
03:11:34,350 --> 03:11:39,040
He's the trends in dent or transhumanist
party like a lot of people ran,

4298
03:11:39,041 --> 03:11:44,041
but that that's the system is just so 
old.

4299
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:48,610
It's just so goddamn ancient.
We're trying to patch up this thing that

4300
03:11:48,611 --> 03:11:51,460
we would never create today if it 
existed today.

4301
03:11:51,461 --> 03:11:54,340
There's no way we would ever let one 
person have all the fucking power.

4302
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:56,193
I just think that human beings are in a 
process of waking up and realizing how 

4303
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:06,100
bizarre our position is.
I mean,

4304
03:12:06,210 --> 03:12:07,043
and not just our position in America,
but our position on the planet earth as 

4305
03:12:10,481 --> 03:12:11,920
it hurdles through infinity.

4306
03:12:12,220 --> 03:12:13,053
We were on a spinning ball that's 
floating in the sky and hurling towards 

4307
03:12:16,301 --> 03:12:20,020
the cosmos or through the cosmos and we 
tend not to focus.

4308
03:12:20,021 --> 03:12:20,854
That alone is insane and we're 
concentrating on whether or not gay 

4309
03:12:25,211 --> 03:12:26,044
people should be able to marry or girls 
should be able to get abortions or 

4310
03:12:29,350 --> 03:12:30,183
whether or not black lives matter.
We're fucking hurling through infinity 

4311
03:12:34,060 --> 03:12:34,893
and I think this slow process of 
realization coincides with the 

4312
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:40,023
innovation that you're seeing from like 
all these different new technology 

4313
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:47,890
companies that are coming up with better
and better ways to communicate,

4314
03:12:47,891 --> 03:12:50,840
whether it's cellular or a video or 
whether they're.

4315
03:12:50,950 --> 03:12:54,710
They're using snapchat or virtual 
reality rooms where they can all meet in

4316
03:12:54,860 --> 03:12:57,920
and it's going to keep going and going 
and going and going and going and going.

4317
03:12:58,280 --> 03:13:01,550
Until we're in some sort of a matrix 
world.

4318
03:13:01,551 --> 03:13:04,070
It's inevitable.
It's going to fucking happen.

4319
03:13:04,070 --> 03:13:06,440
You think we go digital ventures hundred
percent,

4320
03:13:06,710 --> 03:13:07,543
100 percent,
and I think we might not even have a 

4321
03:13:10,161 --> 03:13:12,620
choice.
I think it's entirely possible.

4322
03:13:12,740 --> 03:13:14,510
We're going to create a new form of 
life,

4323
03:13:14,660 --> 03:13:15,493
some new artificial form of life,
and that thing is going to be what goes 

4324
03:13:19,431 --> 03:13:21,770
on from now.
We're going to merge with that somehow.

4325
03:13:22,400 --> 03:13:23,233
We're going to find out that they can 
give you new eyes when your eyes go bad 

4326
03:13:27,350 --> 03:13:31,940
and these eyes allow you to look at 
navigation screens and Google things and

4327
03:13:31,941 --> 03:13:35,540
you're going to be able to get to be 
able to stare straight at the sun.

4328
03:13:35,790 --> 03:13:36,623
There's it's,
it's inevitable that we're going to 

4329
03:13:38,511 --> 03:13:39,344
improve upon the human body.
They're already replacing people's hips 

4330
03:13:41,481 --> 03:13:42,314
and shoulders and knees.
They're growing fucking hearts in a 

4331
03:13:45,021 --> 03:13:47,420
laboratory with stem cells that actually
beat.

4332
03:13:47,660 --> 03:13:50,120
They create a woman's bladder at a stem 
cells.

4333
03:13:50,121 --> 03:13:52,370
She had bladder cancer.
They made her a bladder here.

4334
03:13:52,371 --> 03:13:54,020
We've got one for you.
Stitched it back in.

4335
03:13:54,021 --> 03:13:54,854
They're like,
whoa.

4336
03:13:55,070 --> 03:13:59,660
Like we're doing some crazy shit and 
it's going to keep going.

4337
03:13:59,930 --> 03:14:00,711
Fifty,
60,

4338
03:14:00,711 --> 03:14:01,730
70,
8,100

4339
03:14:01,731 --> 03:14:02,990
years from now.
Whatever it takes,

4340
03:14:03,140 --> 03:14:05,940
we're going to merge.
We're going to merge with technology.

4341
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:11,870
I heaven sitting here talking for a 
little while and normally when you're in

4342
03:14:11,871 --> 03:14:12,704
the world,
you've got that fucking device in your 

4343
03:14:14,361 --> 03:14:15,194
hand.
That's when I've noticed that my wife 

4344
03:14:16,161 --> 03:14:18,290
says that all the time.
She's like,

4345
03:14:18,291 --> 03:14:21,950
you never separated from that phone.
Like I get up from side of the bed,

4346
03:14:21,951 --> 03:14:23,960
I pick it up and go to the bathroom 
because I'm like,

4347
03:14:24,170 --> 03:14:25,003
well,
I might want to play a game or I might 

4348
03:14:25,551 --> 03:14:26,384
want to look up some information.
Like there seems to be a human need for 

4349
03:14:29,751 --> 03:14:33,410
data at all times.
Now we've trained ourselves to have debt

4350
03:14:33,411 --> 03:14:35,240
or to fingertips.
We no longer sit there and go,

4351
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:38,180
what does that person's name now you're 
just like,

4352
03:14:38,210 --> 03:14:39,320
oh,
I'll look it up.

4353
03:14:39,360 --> 03:14:41,750
Yeah.
So a lot of our thinking has been pushed

4354
03:14:41,751 --> 03:14:46,160
off to to technology that we've created,
so we feel comfortable with a gun like,

4355
03:14:46,161 --> 03:14:46,641
well,
you know,

4356
03:14:46,641 --> 03:14:50,180
we're smarter than that and it keeps 
getting better and faster.

4357
03:14:50,181 --> 03:14:51,014
Do you think about it like all those 
body parts you're talking about them 

4358
03:14:52,431 --> 03:14:53,570
doing,
that's the last,

4359
03:14:53,571 --> 03:14:54,404
what?
Twenty years,

4360
03:14:54,770 --> 03:14:55,603
like prior to that there was no like,
hey will grow you a new bladder or hey 

4361
03:14:57,741 --> 03:15:00,040
we can,
we can put skin on you again.

4362
03:15:00,070 --> 03:15:01,880
You know,
it wouldn't look like that and shit like

4363
03:15:01,881 --> 03:15:02,714
that.
So yeah.

4364
03:15:03,140 --> 03:15:04,190
What's going to happen?
Yeah,

4365
03:15:04,191 --> 03:15:05,990
you're right.
And the next 50 years

4366
03:15:06,400 --> 03:15:07,233
merge we're going to somehow,
there's this new Google assistant that 

4367
03:15:10,611 --> 03:15:11,510
comes with the,
uh,

4368
03:15:11,511 --> 03:15:12,344
the Google Pixel phone and it's like 
their version of Siri but it's superior 

4369
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:18,680
because it's contextual.
So I could say like,

4370
03:15:18,681 --> 03:15:20,120
uh,
how old is Kevin Smith?

4371
03:15:20,360 --> 03:15:22,220
And they'll say,
Kevin Smith is 46 years old.

4372
03:15:22,340 --> 03:15:24,920
Once you're working on these days.
Like it knows I'm talking about you.

4373
03:15:24,950 --> 03:15:26,210
I'll say,
what's he working on these days?

4374
03:15:26,390 --> 03:15:30,020
Kevin Smith just produced a movie.
It's called Yoga hosers.

4375
03:15:30,021 --> 03:15:32,250
But will tell you that about like,
yeah.

4376
03:15:32,290 --> 03:15:33,350
Great.
Same with my mom.

4377
03:15:33,351 --> 03:15:34,150
Like,
no,

4378
03:15:34,150 --> 03:15:34,983
I mean you have to be out on the 
Internet like all the data and details 

4379
03:15:38,630 --> 03:15:41,830
on the cruise and Craig's list trying to
get fucking cock.

4380
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:42,970
Okay.
What is Craig's list?

4381
03:15:42,980 --> 03:15:44,660
It will tell you Craig's list is this,
is it?

4382
03:15:44,840 --> 03:15:47,240
How many of you have people on 
craigslist or selling drugs?

4383
03:15:47,241 --> 03:15:49,220
Well,
we found a park something 5,000.

4384
03:15:49,400 --> 03:15:49,980
It's,
it's,

4385
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:52,860
it gives you like contextual make it 
much easier to like,

4386
03:15:52,980 --> 03:15:53,813
look,
I'm looking to have the girlfriend 

4387
03:15:54,511 --> 03:15:59,230
experience.
How many people including digital Djing.

4388
03:15:59,430 --> 03:16:01,020
Well,
if you could get like sort of,

4389
03:16:01,050 --> 03:16:01,883
you know,
how bitcoin has sort of enabled people 

4390
03:16:04,500 --> 03:16:06,330
still happening.
Oh yeah.

4391
03:16:06,331 --> 03:16:07,010
Oh yeah,
yeah,

4392
03:16:07,010 --> 03:16:09,370
yeah.
Don't you ever say that around and dress

4393
03:16:09,400 --> 03:16:11,460
Antonopoulos it's still going.
Curious that you.

4394
03:16:11,461 --> 03:16:12,294
Yeah,
we have this guy,

4395
03:16:12,630 --> 03:16:13,463
he prefers not to calm self bitcoin 
Jesus because he doesn't like how the 

4396
03:16:15,621 --> 03:16:17,420
story ends.
He likes bitcoin.

4397
03:16:17,430 --> 03:16:20,800
Buddha feels like it's better leads to 
enlightenment problem.

4398
03:16:20,810 --> 03:16:22,990
Like somebody fucking hack their account
or something like that.

4399
03:16:22,991 --> 03:16:23,520
Yeah.
Well that's,

4400
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:24,353
that's.
Well there's a long conversation if you 

4401
03:16:25,831 --> 03:16:26,820
want to go with no,
no need,

4402
03:16:26,830 --> 03:16:31,830
but that is actually an exchange that 
got tapped into is the magic,

4403
03:16:31,981 --> 03:16:34,770
the gathering exchange.
All right.

4404
03:16:34,771 --> 03:16:36,120
That's what it started out as.

4405
03:16:36,230 --> 03:16:37,063
You know that game magic.
The gathering started off as that and 

4406
03:16:39,091 --> 03:16:39,924
then during that time people started 
trading bitcoin on that when it was 

4407
03:16:43,441 --> 03:16:44,274
nothing.
And then that bitcoin became worth 

4408
03:16:45,721 --> 03:16:46,554
hundreds of millions of dollars and then
they got robbed so all the bitcoin got 

4409
03:16:48,901 --> 03:16:49,734
stolen out and this guy got in trouble 
because he ran the site that he was 

4410
03:16:52,141 --> 03:16:52,974
never know.
No one had any idea that I was going to 

4411
03:16:54,151 --> 03:16:57,270
be worth hundreds of millions of dollars
and that this guy would lose it all.

4412
03:16:57,660 --> 03:17:00,960
So it was the whole thing was like a 
really crazy and sort of fair,

4413
03:17:00,961 --> 03:17:05,961
but the spirit of Bitcoin is that you 
and I can exchange money for services.

4414
03:17:06,421 --> 03:17:09,810
But with no third party,
just you and I know bank of like,

4415
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:11,160
you want to buy this computer?
I say,

4416
03:17:11,161 --> 03:17:12,770
sure,
give me x amount of bitcoin.

4417
03:17:12,780 --> 03:17:14,010
And you sent it to my phone.
All right,

4418
03:17:14,011 --> 03:17:14,160
cool.

4419
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:16,740
We got a deal and then you're done.
And this,

4420
03:17:16,741 --> 03:17:17,574
this idea.
You mean if you could get to the point 

4421
03:17:19,860 --> 03:17:20,693
where are you're talking to your phone 
and you tell your phone to order you a 

4422
03:17:24,901 --> 03:17:28,680
pizza and pay for it in bit corn and 
it's doing everything digitally and it's

4423
03:17:29,010 --> 03:17:32,790
winter big corn.
The corn already buying shits,

4424
03:17:32,791 --> 03:17:36,030
bitcoin.
What is it when it's a hooker bit Quan?

4425
03:17:36,180 --> 03:17:37,950
Ah,
oh,

4426
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:40,040
that sounds great.
We'll have the corn,

4427
03:17:40,041 --> 03:17:44,430
but not everyone will have the quad.
What it was the climate meant like love,

4428
03:17:44,431 --> 03:17:46,000
respect everything.
MMM.

4429
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:47,370
I don't know.
What does that package?

4430
03:17:47,670 --> 03:17:49,680
What does that mean?
Remember Jerry Maguire,

4431
03:17:49,681 --> 03:17:50,680
man,
he was always talking about that.

4432
03:17:50,681 --> 03:17:52,290
Don't.
He said,

4433
03:17:52,291 --> 03:17:53,670
uh,
it was the full package.

4434
03:17:53,671 --> 03:17:55,500
It was love,
money,

4435
03:17:55,501 --> 03:17:57,560
respect,
endorsement.

4436
03:17:58,530 --> 03:18:00,360
Hm.
There was a bigger deal than just like,

4437
03:18:00,450 --> 03:18:01,290
okay.
All right.

4438
03:18:01,291 --> 03:18:02,790
But go back to bit coin.

4439
03:18:02,790 --> 03:18:04,080
So it's still going on,
you know?

4440
03:18:04,081 --> 03:18:04,621
Yeah,
yeah,

4441
03:18:04,621 --> 03:18:05,940
yeah.
There's some people who love it.

4442
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:08,780
Yeah.
Like the very,

4443
03:18:09,280 --> 03:18:13,890
very democratic way to like my money.
Why do I have to go through this,

4444
03:18:13,891 --> 03:18:14,461
this,
this,

4445
03:18:14,461 --> 03:18:15,294
and I understand those institutions and 
FDC is all built to protect your money 

4446
03:18:19,741 --> 03:18:20,574
but also seems engineered to keep your 
money and get your money and take a 

4447
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:24,773
percentage of it as well.
I have the weirdest abstract take on 

4448
03:18:27,181 --> 03:18:28,420
crypto currencies.
Okay.

4449
03:18:28,590 --> 03:18:32,370
I think that ultimately all money will 
be digital and since digital,

4450
03:18:32,890 --> 03:18:34,080
since money,
if it,

4451
03:18:34,220 --> 03:18:37,860
if it all becomes digital like that,
money is basically information.

4452
03:18:38,070 --> 03:18:42,000
And the one thing that's keeping people 
from each other,

4453
03:18:42,210 --> 03:18:43,043
like the re,
the one thing that separates us is the 

4454
03:18:44,491 --> 03:18:47,220
barrier of information.
Like I can't read your emails,

4455
03:18:47,350 --> 03:18:48,370
can't read my mind,

4456
03:18:48,700 --> 03:18:51,730
you can't see my pictures,
you can't,

4457
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:56,380
you can't know everything that you can 
possibly know instantaneously.

4458
03:18:56,381 --> 03:18:59,560
There's like this barrier and that 
barrier is all information,

4459
03:18:59,561 --> 03:19:00,700
right?
It's all trying to get,

4460
03:19:01,180 --> 03:19:04,060
trying to get like writing what,
what has someone written,

4461
03:19:04,240 --> 03:19:05,073
uh,
what is,

4462
03:19:05,140 --> 03:19:08,470
what is all the scholarly work on 
astrophysics,

4463
03:19:08,471 --> 03:19:12,610
what does all that stuff like,
the barriers between us and those things

4464
03:19:12,790 --> 03:19:13,623
are slowly being removed.
Like there's more and more like if you 

4465
03:19:16,031 --> 03:19:19,960
went on the Internet in 1996 and tried 
to get an education,

4466
03:19:19,961 --> 03:19:22,640
you'd be retarded.
Like you're not have that education,

4467
03:19:22,670 --> 03:19:23,503
you're not going to learn shit.
But now like you can legitimately get 

4468
03:19:26,471 --> 03:19:27,304
like a full college education online.
Plus you can read a million different 

4469
03:19:31,391 --> 03:19:32,224
papers on all sorts of different things,
especially if you want to pay for them 

4470
03:19:34,510 --> 03:19:35,343
on all sorts of different studies.
And actually in a classroom you could 

4471
03:19:39,940 --> 03:19:42,430
almost never run out of things to 
absorb.

4472
03:19:42,730 --> 03:19:43,563
Almost never run out of information and 
I think that that's the one thing that 

4473
03:19:46,391 --> 03:19:51,391
technology seems to be embracing is 
closing the gap between people and data.

4474
03:19:52,450 --> 03:19:53,283
Closing the gap between people and 
information will eventually that money 

4475
03:19:56,441 --> 03:19:59,860
is going to be the only bottleneck to 
reading each other's minds.

4476
03:20:00,010 --> 03:20:02,110
There's going to be like w,
there's what,

4477
03:20:02,140 --> 03:20:04,750
what money is if it's bitcoin or if it's
digital,

4478
03:20:04,751 --> 03:20:06,540
it's a one and a zero.
It's just a code.

4479
03:20:06,970 --> 03:20:08,950
So what's to stop me from getting into 
that code?

4480
03:20:08,951 --> 03:20:10,450
What's the.
How come I can't get that code?

4481
03:20:10,570 --> 03:20:11,650
Well,
that's somebody else's.

4482
03:20:11,980 --> 03:20:12,970
Oh,
okay.

4483
03:20:12,971 --> 03:20:14,470
Like what?
What does that mean?

4484
03:20:14,800 --> 03:20:16,330
Like what does that mean?
Is it information?

4485
03:20:16,390 --> 03:20:17,500
Like what is it?
Can I get it?

4486
03:20:17,501 --> 03:20:19,240
Can I copy it?
Now if you copy this.

4487
03:20:19,270 --> 03:20:20,080
No.
Good.

4488
03:20:20,080 --> 03:20:21,040
Oh,
okay.

4489
03:20:21,041 --> 03:20:21,874
So it's a finite resource,
but that's fucking ridiculous because 

4490
03:20:23,921 --> 03:20:24,754
it's not.

4491
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:29,950
We're not talking about oil or water or 
rocks or minerals or metals.

4492
03:20:30,070 --> 03:20:32,290
We're talking about some goofy fucking 
numbers.

4493
03:20:32,420 --> 03:20:35,350
They've got an a goddamn commuter.
It's information.

4494
03:20:35,650 --> 03:20:36,483
It allows us access to resources.
Like we should all have access to all 

4495
03:20:39,161 --> 03:20:44,050
the information and then it's going to 
be some weird merging of digital minds,

4496
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:49,320
some sort of a hive mind system created 
by something like Google or some company

4497
03:20:50,410 --> 03:20:51,243
that figures out a way to allow people 
to communicate thought that thought and 

4498
03:20:53,441 --> 03:20:55,960
it's going to have money attached to it.
All of it.

4499
03:20:55,961 --> 03:20:58,900
It's going to be a big fucking soup of 
information.

4500
03:20:59,320 --> 03:21:01,390
That's going to be the breakdown.
The breakdown is money.

4501
03:21:01,930 --> 03:21:03,130
Why?
Why?

4502
03:21:03,131 --> 03:21:05,870
Because it's information because if 
money becomes informed,

4503
03:21:05,871 --> 03:21:08,540
this is obviously super stoner talk 
good.

4504
03:21:08,590 --> 03:21:11,080
But if money just becomes one's and 
zero's,

4505
03:21:11,320 --> 03:21:14,020
what's coming?
What's happening with Wiki leaks?

4506
03:21:14,170 --> 03:21:14,591
Well,
you know,

4507
03:21:14,591 --> 03:21:15,251
these,
uh,

4508
03:21:15,251 --> 03:21:18,760
these emails getting hacked data,
getting out,

4509
03:21:18,800 --> 03:21:19,400
uh,
you know,

4510
03:21:19,400 --> 03:21:21,640
so many getting hacked,
all their data,

4511
03:21:21,641 --> 03:21:26,170
getting out all these people.
There's the barriers are falling between

4512
03:21:26,171 --> 03:21:27,490
people and information.

4513
03:21:27,950 --> 03:21:30,620
They said in the government right now,
our government,

4514
03:21:30,770 --> 03:21:31,603
the love of.
I say something retarded in someone 

4515
03:21:32,481 --> 03:21:33,020
nods,
like,

4516
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:34,100
yeah,
that's fucking,

4517
03:21:34,220 --> 03:21:36,920
that's dumb to them.
They said that there are,

4518
03:21:36,950 --> 03:21:39,830
there's a deep need for hackers in this 
country.

4519
03:21:40,250 --> 03:21:41,083
There's not enough because everywhere 
else like hacking as exponentially over 

4520
03:21:45,741 --> 03:21:49,670
the course of the last few years by 
double the amount that it was and that's

4521
03:21:49,700 --> 03:21:52,340
why you're seeing things like they took 
down Sony.

4522
03:21:52,400 --> 03:21:54,260
They took,
they took down this one,

4523
03:21:54,650 --> 03:21:57,230
so yeah.
I lately I've just been like,

4524
03:21:57,260 --> 03:22:00,140
do I really want to have all my world 
online?

4525
03:22:00,630 --> 03:22:02,510
I'm the.
I go the other way where I'm just like,

4526
03:22:02,511 --> 03:22:03,344
well how do you protect that stuff?
How do you protect what you think you 

4527
03:22:05,461 --> 03:22:08,620
will be able to for a while?
But I honestly,

4528
03:22:08,630 --> 03:22:09,590
the fact that you can't.

4529
03:22:09,670 --> 03:22:11,650
Well the trend is clearly going to the 
cloud.

4530
03:22:11,990 --> 03:22:15,400
If you look at these goddamn new macs,
they don't even have a slot for a USB,

4531
03:22:15,520 --> 03:22:19,300
like a hug or a thumb drive.
You don't have a DVD player.

4532
03:22:19,480 --> 03:22:21,880
There's no other way.
You have to do everything wirelessly.

4533
03:22:21,881 --> 03:22:24,280
Like wow,
this is weird.

4534
03:22:24,460 --> 03:22:26,680
So you have a very minimal high hard 
drives.

4535
03:22:26,800 --> 03:22:27,633
The hard drives of the new Mac.
Books are smaller than the old hard 

4536
03:22:30,731 --> 03:22:31,564
drives.
They've made them smaller so it can be 

4537
03:22:34,031 --> 03:22:36,550
lighter and lighter,
more compact,

4538
03:22:36,551 --> 03:22:40,060
but also you're not storing cheat on you
because they want to throw everything up

4539
03:22:40,061 --> 03:22:42,250
on the cloud and you're like,
Oh man,

4540
03:22:42,340 --> 03:22:43,173
where do you stand in it?
It's fascinating because on one hand I 

4541
03:22:46,721 --> 03:22:48,490
think it's inevitable.
On the other hand,

4542
03:22:48,940 --> 03:22:51,640
digging my heels in the dirt and I'm 
getting dragged along.

4543
03:22:52,190 --> 03:22:53,770
Sorry,
I got off the apple tip.

4544
03:22:54,040 --> 03:22:58,420
I've got a windows 10 laptop,
two terabytes of storage,

4545
03:22:58,810 --> 03:22:59,550
two terabytes.

4546
03:22:59,550 --> 03:23:02,010
You can't get the movies.
Any Mac whatsoever.

4547
03:23:02,440 --> 03:23:05,230
You could.
It cost you a fucking shit ton.

4548
03:23:05,950 --> 03:23:06,783
Way More.

4549
03:23:07,530 --> 03:23:09,570
Did they choose this upgrade?
Smooth.

4550
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:11,370
It's great.
Windows 10.

4551
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:12,800
So cat

4552
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:16,070
people need them for business there if 
they broke down all the time,

4553
03:23:16,071 --> 03:23:16,904
but just.
I just assumed they had to be better 

4554
03:23:18,221 --> 03:23:19,240
now.
So I said I'm gonna.

4555
03:23:19,241 --> 03:23:20,074
Give it a try.
I've only been using it for a few 

4556
03:23:21,280 --> 03:23:22,510
months.
Zero problems.

4557
03:23:22,640 --> 03:23:23,980
Super adorable.
Prior to this,

4558
03:23:23,981 --> 03:23:28,981
the whole time for like years since I'm 
like the nineties,

4559
03:23:29,730 --> 03:23:33,270
you were one of those cats that you know
when it all collapses,

4560
03:23:33,271 --> 03:23:36,170
you're going to be fucked.
I'm fucked your fucking.

4561
03:23:36,180 --> 03:23:38,430
You've unlocked and gone off the grid 
before anybody else.

4562
03:23:38,431 --> 03:23:41,460
You've thought about things that most 
people don't think you have big things.

4563
03:23:41,910 --> 03:23:44,460
You don't just smoke and be like,
dammit,

4564
03:23:44,490 --> 03:23:45,323
life's good you.
You smoke and go deep on the big thing 

4565
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:49,650
on stuff that like,
like you,

4566
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:51,390
like you pointed out,
very few people do.

4567
03:23:51,391 --> 03:23:55,860
It's usually stoners that the big issues
are that we all think of.

4568
03:23:55,861 --> 03:23:59,070
The big issues are nothing compared to 
like you do recall.

4569
03:23:59,071 --> 03:24:01,320
We're hurdling through space on a 
fucking rock.

4570
03:24:01,380 --> 03:24:02,213
Yeah.
Anything can happen and you're worried 

4571
03:24:05,341 --> 03:24:10,341
about this or this nonsense.
Fucking gender identity,

4572
03:24:10,711 --> 03:24:12,720
pronouns,
Netflix or something like that.

4573
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:14,023
Oh my God.
It's even the big things that people 

4574
03:24:15,091 --> 03:24:16,500
like.
This is everything in life.

4575
03:24:16,520 --> 03:24:17,353
Yes,
so you do the Kentucky take on 

4576
03:24:18,511 --> 03:24:21,450
everything beyond the.
Beyond the obvious,

4577
03:24:21,690 --> 03:24:25,920
beyond the temporal or the daily,
you're gone like what's next?

4578
03:24:25,921 --> 03:24:30,921
What happens 10 years from now?
What happens to us?

4579
03:24:30,931 --> 03:24:31,770
Not just,
Hey,

4580
03:24:31,771 --> 03:24:32,604
what happens to me?
Because that's very human nature to be 

4581
03:24:34,501 --> 03:24:35,400
like,
what happens to me,

4582
03:24:35,401 --> 03:24:37,590
but your thing is what happens to us as 
a species.

4583
03:24:37,810 --> 03:24:39,730
You're a.
you're a thinker and a seeker as well as

4584
03:24:39,731 --> 03:24:40,531
like about you,
man.

4585
03:24:40,531 --> 03:24:43,380
You're not content to just be like,
I think I know everything.

4586
03:24:43,381 --> 03:24:43,980
There is pretty

4587
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:44,813
much to know that I'm interested in.
The rest of them are really not 

4588
03:24:45,961 --> 03:24:48,900
interested in you.
You refill all the time.

4589
03:24:48,901 --> 03:24:51,840
I met a priest once.
We were sweet kid and uh,

4590
03:24:51,900 --> 03:24:54,840
he said not when I was a kid,
but I was like a grown ass man.

4591
03:24:54,841 --> 03:24:56,610
I was 20 somethings before I wrote 
dogma.

4592
03:24:56,810 --> 03:24:57,643
So when I went out to film school and 92
in Vancouver and I was in Washington 

4593
03:25:02,671 --> 03:25:03,504
state,
my uncle lived in federal way and so I 

4594
03:25:04,871 --> 03:25:05,521
was like,
you know what,

4595
03:25:05,521 --> 03:25:07,860
I'm going to go to my uncles and then go
up from there.

4596
03:25:07,861 --> 03:25:10,020
You can drive me up,
drop my shit off and stuff.

4597
03:25:10,380 --> 03:25:12,660
Um,
and I'd never really left my side of the

4598
03:25:13,020 --> 03:25:15,480
world,
let alone fucking New Jersey and,

4599
03:25:15,570 --> 03:25:17,490
and stuff.
So,

4600
03:25:18,280 --> 03:25:20,100
uh,
at one point I was still struggling.

4601
03:25:20,101 --> 03:25:20,934
I was,
is the end of my Catholicism as I knew 

4602
03:25:23,191 --> 03:25:26,100
it in childhood that I just believe 
everything they tell me and stuff.

4603
03:25:26,610 --> 03:25:28,920
So I was having some troubles with it 
and I went into,

4604
03:25:29,140 --> 03:25:32,040
was walking around and I wouldn't call 
myself an emo kid,

4605
03:25:32,041 --> 03:25:32,874
but like I still was raised in it.
When you believe something from the 

4606
03:25:36,151 --> 03:25:37,590
moment you're born,
like,

4607
03:25:37,591 --> 03:25:40,350
you know,
all the tenants of the Catholic faith,

4608
03:25:40,930 --> 03:25:41,763
uh,
I was an altar boy even for heaven's 

4609
03:25:42,591 --> 03:25:43,890
sakes,
you know,

4610
03:25:44,190 --> 03:25:45,023
when that moment comes,
it's almost like the adult version of 

4611
03:25:48,450 --> 03:25:49,920
when you know,
your parents are like,

4612
03:25:49,921 --> 03:25:51,530
there is no Santa Claus,
you know,

4613
03:25:51,570 --> 03:25:53,460
surprise where suddenly you're like,
what,

4614
03:25:53,920 --> 03:25:56,100
you fuck it up ended my entire 
existence.

4615
03:25:56,250 --> 03:25:59,190
So I was going through that and I'm age 
22 at this point,

4616
03:25:59,280 --> 03:26:00,390
should have gone through it in high 
school.

4617
03:26:00,391 --> 03:26:05,390
But I held onto my own lot longer.
So I walked into this church and uh,

4618
03:26:05,460 --> 03:26:08,970
I sat down and a priest came by.
Eventually,

4619
03:26:08,971 --> 03:26:10,230
younger priests,
I can help you.

4620
03:26:10,230 --> 03:26:11,340
And I was like,
Oh,

4621
03:26:11,341 --> 03:26:12,174
I'm just having a crisis of faith and 
just sitting here and praying and 

4622
03:26:15,421 --> 03:26:17,190
meditating on it and stuff.
And he goes,

4623
03:26:17,191 --> 03:26:18,240
come,
come to the office,

4624
03:26:18,241 --> 03:26:19,770
we'll talk.
I went into his office and he was like,

4625
03:26:19,771 --> 03:26:20,604
what's the issue?
And it was like I believed in this shit 

4626
03:26:22,440 --> 03:26:27,440
so much when I was a kid.
It wasn't even a matter of belief.

4627
03:26:27,451 --> 03:26:29,790
This was the truth.
I said,

4628
03:26:29,791 --> 03:26:32,850
but now I'm of this mind that like,
you know what?

4629
03:26:32,880 --> 03:26:35,640
We follow this Bible and supposed to be 
the word of God,

4630
03:26:35,641 --> 03:26:36,474
but like thousands of years ago,
the bunch of people that followed a 

4631
03:26:40,291 --> 03:26:43,710
bunch of other books that said there 
were multiple gods and now we read those

4632
03:26:43,711 --> 03:26:45,300
books and go,
isn't that fucking quaint?

4633
03:26:45,570 --> 03:26:47,340
These fuckers thought there were 12 
gods,

4634
03:26:47,341 --> 03:26:49,380
one for each thing that ever happened in
the day.

4635
03:26:49,990 --> 03:26:50,823
I said,
I'm afraid one day that like they're 

4636
03:26:52,171 --> 03:26:54,300
going to turn around and say,
same thing about our book is this.

4637
03:26:54,760 --> 03:26:56,220
Like,
I just don't believe.

4638
03:26:56,221 --> 03:27:00,080
Like I believed when I was a kid and the
priest said something really smart.

4639
03:27:00,130 --> 03:27:01,350
I stuck it in.
The movie was so smart.

4640
03:27:01,680 --> 03:27:02,513
He said,
well,

4641
03:27:03,540 --> 03:27:04,950
he's going.
When you're a little kid,

4642
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,980
I think of yourself as a small glass.
You're very easy to fill up.

4643
03:27:08,300 --> 03:27:10,980
It's going,
you put liquid in and you're done.

4644
03:27:11,040 --> 03:27:13,140
It's easy to top off a small glass.
He's gone.

4645
03:27:13,141 --> 03:27:15,120
The older you get the glass,
he gets bigger.

4646
03:27:15,780 --> 03:27:16,613
You can't expect the same amount of 
liquid that filled that small glass to 

4647
03:27:19,501 --> 03:27:20,334
fill the big glass.
And I was like do means like 

4648
03:27:21,420 --> 03:27:25,200
periodically you gotta refill the glass.
Now he was talking about faith and shit,

4649
03:27:25,440 --> 03:27:26,273
but that goes for anything even goes for
intellectual intellectual pursuits or 

4650
03:27:32,221 --> 03:27:36,120
just the person who's the seeker who is 
not content to just be like,

4651
03:27:36,300 --> 03:27:38,880
I see it all as it is and I think I 
understand it now.

4652
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:41,280
You always understand there's more to 
understand.

4653
03:27:41,440 --> 03:27:43,960
You go looking for the not just like,
hey,

4654
03:27:43,961 --> 03:27:44,794
that's kind of fucked up an interesting,
but what's really ultimately important 

4655
03:27:48,250 --> 03:27:49,083
if you scrape away all the stuff that we
kind of concern ourselves with the shit 

4656
03:27:52,121 --> 03:27:53,500
you think about.
Like you know,

4657
03:27:53,501 --> 03:27:54,334
and again this is just from fucking 
listen to some podcasts and mostly 

4658
03:27:56,471 --> 03:28:00,100
looking at your instagram feed is shit 
that's like useful.

4659
03:28:00,370 --> 03:28:04,240
If it all went away and it's not just 
like,

4660
03:28:04,241 --> 03:28:05,720
you know,
I know how to live off the land is so if

4661
03:28:05,920 --> 03:28:09,400
you're thinking big,
think about where the mind goes.

4662
03:28:09,420 --> 03:28:10,253
You know,
like most people look like you strong 

4663
03:28:12,671 --> 03:28:13,504
and shit like that.
Don't fucking think nearly as much as 

4664
03:28:15,791 --> 03:28:17,320
you think.
I know that's a stereotype,

4665
03:28:17,321 --> 03:28:20,230
but it's true.
You can't develop one set of muscles and

4666
03:28:20,231 --> 03:28:22,150
concentrated on another.
Generally speaking,

4667
03:28:22,480 --> 03:28:24,130
you were there.
Concentrate on building your brand,

4668
03:28:24,131 --> 03:28:24,964
building your body.
You've found a perfect way to build 

4669
03:28:26,261 --> 03:28:26,790
both.

4670
03:28:26,790 --> 03:28:28,290
I think you'd be surprised.
What do you mean?

4671
03:28:28,291 --> 03:28:29,580
No?
Especially when you're smart,

4672
03:28:29,581 --> 03:28:31,680
you're smart,
but especially Jujitsu guys.

4673
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:33,960
I know a lot of really,
really smart Jujitsu guys.

4674
03:28:33,961 --> 03:28:35,530
Of course,
just this week

4675
03:28:35,950 --> 03:28:38,710
stereotype to be like,
all muscle heads must be done.

4676
03:28:38,711 --> 03:28:39,544
That's the only thing I got it.

4677
03:28:39,550 --> 03:28:41,680
Do you know Josh Waitzkin do nothing.
He's the guy from.

4678
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:45,050
He was the inspiration for the movie.
Searching for Bobby Fischer,

4679
03:28:45,670 --> 03:28:49,520
American chess champion.
He became obsessed with Jujitsu now,

4680
03:28:49,750 --> 03:28:52,310
Brazilian Jujitsu,
black belt under Marcello Garcia.

4681
03:28:52,330 --> 03:28:57,330
Like one of the most respected Brazilian
Jujitsu practitioners have two things.

4682
03:28:57,581 --> 03:28:59,320
Chess and Jujitsu.
That's unfair,

4683
03:28:59,350 --> 03:29:00,183
bad motherfucker Scott,
and he's a chess master and he's just a 

4684
03:29:02,980 --> 03:29:05,560
brilliant,
brilliant guy and I mean,

4685
03:29:05,970 --> 03:29:08,230
but a killer,
like if you've got a hold of you,

4686
03:29:08,231 --> 03:29:11,400
he will choke you to death for sure,
but only if I did something to.

4687
03:29:11,450 --> 03:29:12,910
Yeah,
but I'm saying if you had to,

4688
03:29:12,911 --> 03:29:14,170
if you want it to.
I mean he's.

4689
03:29:14,200 --> 03:29:15,033
He's not just as genius.
He's a genius and a smart and he's 

4690
03:29:19,270 --> 03:29:20,680
probably never described himself that 
way.

4691
03:29:20,681 --> 03:29:23,170
He's a martial artist,
but his ability,

4692
03:29:23,171 --> 03:29:26,110
what he can do,
his specialty is strangling people.

4693
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:27,840
I mean,
that's what you mean.

4694
03:29:27,860 --> 03:29:30,760
This comes from Marcella Garcia.
Marcella Garcia,

4695
03:29:30,820 --> 03:29:35,820
as you would know this,
but Marcello is famous for his chokes.

4696
03:29:36,100 --> 03:29:38,980
He's like a famous strangulation artists
like he said,

4697
03:29:38,981 --> 03:29:39,814
some of the most spectacular highlights 
in the history of competitive Brazilian 

4698
03:29:42,971 --> 03:29:45,130
Jujitsu.
Just choking guys unconscious.

4699
03:29:45,340 --> 03:29:46,810
It's an animal.
Never killing them.

4700
03:29:46,811 --> 03:29:49,240
Just taking them to the matches to black
belts.

4701
03:29:49,241 --> 03:29:50,410
Go at it.
You never.

4702
03:29:50,470 --> 03:29:51,303
You've ever seen.
Remember we had this little Garcia vs 

4703
03:29:54,221 --> 03:29:55,054
Shaolin.
He barely ever seen and so quickly at 

4704
03:29:58,261 --> 03:29:59,094
UFC match and you don't have to see a 
UFC match because this is probably 

4705
03:30:01,300 --> 03:30:02,133
something more interesting for you to 
watch because no one got hurt even 

4706
03:30:04,181 --> 03:30:05,014
though it looks like the guy was dead.
He actually just check the blood stops 

4707
03:30:08,951 --> 03:30:12,970
the brain and then he lets it go and the
guy's instantaneously back like it's not

4708
03:30:12,971 --> 03:30:15,280
like a knockout,
suffering brain damage.

4709
03:30:15,620 --> 03:30:16,453
The scramble.
Marcella takes his back and he holds 

4710
03:30:18,701 --> 03:30:21,490
onto the choke and Shalon tries to 
squirm out of it,

4711
03:30:21,610 --> 03:30:22,443
but he lacks in the choke and now 
challenge trying to fight gallantly 

4712
03:30:25,751 --> 03:30:28,990
buddy goes asleep,
he's out cold here and the referee stops

4713
03:30:28,991 --> 03:30:29,380
it.

4714
03:30:29,380 --> 03:30:31,450
As soon as they realize now he's out 
cold,

4715
03:30:31,720 --> 03:30:32,553
so marcel gets off of him and walks away
and Shaolin wakes up like just a second 

4716
03:30:36,821 --> 03:30:40,190
later.
So he's 100 percent fine.

4717
03:30:40,340 --> 03:30:41,061
He just like,
well,

4718
03:30:41,061 --> 03:30:42,230
what happened?
He starts talking.

4719
03:30:42,320 --> 03:30:45,140
He's not like he got knocked out.
It's not like you got brain damage.

4720
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:48,890
He just got choked unconscious like 
he'll be instantaneously fine,

4721
03:30:49,310 --> 03:30:52,970
but Marcello was just choked up,
never totally out,

4722
03:30:53,110 --> 03:30:55,520
but have gotten super close.
I've gotten to like,

4723
03:30:55,521 --> 03:30:56,354
the elevator door is like closing in 
that literally way it feels entirely 

4724
03:31:00,981 --> 03:31:01,814
like the walls are closing in,
like the darkness is coming and you're 

4725
03:31:04,390 --> 03:31:07,250
like barely can get out of it.
I've gotten to the door.

4726
03:31:07,430 --> 03:31:11,870
I never went totally asleep.
As you go into the door,

4727
03:31:11,890 --> 03:31:13,910
you're also smart enough to be like,
I'm not dying.

4728
03:31:13,911 --> 03:31:14,870
I tap.
Yeah,

4729
03:31:14,900 --> 03:31:16,970
you tap,
you gotta know when to tap pants.

4730
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:18,490
Like is there a moment of panic where 
like.

4731
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:19,791
Yes,
for sure.

4732
03:31:19,791 --> 03:31:20,211
Yeah.
Yeah,

4733
03:31:20,211 --> 03:31:22,430
you definitely,
we saw like that dude was like,

4734
03:31:23,020 --> 03:31:25,190
he was like fucking go picked up by the 
Eagle.

4735
03:31:25,191 --> 03:31:29,180
He was like before it was over.
But then he gets out Jujitsu.

4736
03:31:29,181 --> 03:31:31,790
Those,
those moments happen a lot.

4737
03:31:32,090 --> 03:31:32,923
So like if you go to a Jujitsu class,
it's very likely you might get choked 

4738
03:31:35,241 --> 03:31:37,520
out three,
four times by one person.

4739
03:31:37,970 --> 03:31:38,803
Like if you roll with some guys,
a Brazilian jujitsu black belt and 

4740
03:31:41,031 --> 03:31:41,864
you're like a blue belt,
pretty likely he's going to get you at 

4741
03:31:44,870 --> 03:31:45,890
least a couple of times while you roll 
with them.

4742
03:31:45,891 --> 03:31:48,680
Unless you're like really agile and 
really good at defending yourself.

4743
03:31:48,790 --> 03:31:52,110
What are the chances of losing off your 
windpipe carotid artery,

4744
03:31:52,111 --> 03:31:52,944
your carotids?
They literally like closing the blood 

4745
03:31:55,791 --> 03:31:56,624
supply.
How dangerous that not not only if you 

4746
03:31:59,271 --> 03:32:04,271
keep it on but clamped on like how long 
a minute probably kill somebody.

4747
03:32:05,410 --> 03:32:07,310
That's I'm saying so like they have to 
be.

4748
03:32:07,340 --> 03:32:09,980
You have to be a surgeon to be like,
I got them for 30.

4749
03:32:09,981 --> 03:32:10,814
I'm like,
well,

4750
03:32:11,510 --> 03:32:14,860
I'd like to find out like how long would
you have to hold someone would.

4751
03:32:14,930 --> 03:32:17,990
It depends on the person,
how a healthy they were,

4752
03:32:18,020 --> 03:32:20,660
how young they were.
I'm sure would have a factor as well,

4753
03:32:20,870 --> 03:32:25,280
but find out how long would it take if 
you choke someone out before they died,

4754
03:32:25,430 --> 03:32:26,263
someone must've.
Someone wants to Google request that's 

4755
03:32:29,751 --> 03:32:31,370
going to bring the FBI.
They're going to come,

4756
03:32:31,880 --> 03:32:36,880
but what if you could do that with a 
body part [inaudible] I mean,

4757
03:32:36,901 --> 03:32:41,050
and you got to get a certain amount of 
leverage on somebody's carotid artists.

4758
03:32:41,051 --> 03:32:41,884
Science reflex death is sometimes 
considered a mechanism of death and 

4759
03:32:44,031 --> 03:32:46,040
cases.
Granulation remains highly disputed.

4760
03:32:46,400 --> 03:32:47,233
The port of time from application to 
unconsciousness varies from seven to 14 

4761
03:32:50,031 --> 03:32:50,510
seconds.

4762
03:32:50,510 --> 03:32:51,343
That's wrong.
If effectively applied to one minute in 

4763
03:32:54,141 --> 03:32:57,740
other cases with death occurring minutes
after unconsciousness.

4764
03:32:57,890 --> 03:33:01,380
So if you held on for a couple minutes 
to the next show on,

4765
03:33:01,420 --> 03:33:04,760
would you have to choke ticket?
Yeah,

4766
03:33:04,761 --> 03:33:07,090
that's.
Is that from a forum MMA forum?

4767
03:33:07,430 --> 03:33:11,600
They might not necessarily know,
but it's on the Internet.

4768
03:33:11,601 --> 03:33:13,160
It must be true.
Let's read it and believe it.

4769
03:33:13,460 --> 03:33:14,360
Yeah.
Forums,

4770
03:33:14,390 --> 03:33:15,770
bodybuilding.com.
Ars,

4771
03:33:15,771 --> 03:33:17,700
Technica.
That one is um,

4772
03:33:17,790 --> 03:33:18,870
you know,
maybe they'll believe.

4773
03:33:19,020 --> 03:33:22,130
Think about it is super wrong right 
there.

4774
03:33:22,280 --> 03:33:24,530
When it says varies from seven to 14 
seconds,

4775
03:33:24,890 --> 03:33:25,723
it doesn't even take a second.
What do you mean you could put someone 

4776
03:33:28,731 --> 03:33:31,010
to sleep in a second if you hit the 
right,

4777
03:33:31,070 --> 03:33:33,440
if you have just hit it right.
If you just hold onto it right.

4778
03:33:33,560 --> 03:33:37,920
Especially if they're not resisting.
Like if they're hurt already and they're

4779
03:33:37,921 --> 03:33:38,550
relaxed,

4780
03:33:38,550 --> 03:33:40,760
you could just put them to sleep.
It's like if you,

4781
03:33:40,761 --> 03:33:43,770
if someone gets hit first and then they 
get choked and they don't,

4782
03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:44,753
they don't defend it quickly enough.
Like if they're out of it and then they 

4783
03:33:46,951 --> 03:33:48,180
get choked,
they just go to sleep.

4784
03:33:48,570 --> 03:33:52,230
Like real quick says anybody.
Nobody's ever been choked to death.

4785
03:33:52,910 --> 03:33:53,743
No,
I'm sure people have been choked to 

4786
03:33:55,650 --> 03:33:57,450
death.
Just not in the UFC.

4787
03:33:57,570 --> 03:34:00,480
What I mean in the real world,
like that was the Eric Garner thing.

4788
03:34:00,510 --> 03:34:02,430
Well,
he had a breathing issue.

4789
03:34:02,640 --> 03:34:05,310
That was the guy who the police killed 
in New York.

4790
03:34:05,311 --> 03:34:07,140
They took,
he was selling loose cigarettes in front

4791
03:34:07,141 --> 03:34:09,990
of them and they get mad at them.
I thought we were still talking.

4792
03:34:10,190 --> 03:34:11,023
You were.
They killed them with the choke 

4793
03:34:11,870 --> 03:34:13,590
Brazilian Jujitsu.
But you're taking real life.

4794
03:34:13,591 --> 03:34:14,160
Yes.
Yeah,

4795
03:34:14,160 --> 03:34:15,720
but I'm saying you can choke someone to 
death,

4796
03:34:15,721 --> 03:34:16,440
but I don't think.

4797
03:34:16,440 --> 03:34:18,360
I think he,
he died Maura's,

4798
03:34:18,520 --> 03:34:19,220
Ellie,
his.

4799
03:34:19,220 --> 03:34:22,410
He wasn't physically very well.
About three minutes is about the most.

4800
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:24,720
Your brain can last without air.
Three minutes without air.

4801
03:34:24,740 --> 03:34:27,480
Yeah.
Oh man,

4802
03:34:28,140 --> 03:34:28,973
that's crazy.
So that would never it how like 

4803
03:34:32,461 --> 03:34:34,320
basically he get out of you for three 
seconds,

4804
03:34:34,321 --> 03:34:36,040
you'd be passed out and then they let 
you go.

4805
03:34:36,280 --> 03:34:37,180
Yeah,
yeah,

4806
03:34:38,130 --> 03:34:39,090
yeah.
They would just let you go.

4807
03:34:39,091 --> 03:34:39,924
And in class sometimes people forget to 
tap in class so they don't tap quick 

4808
03:34:42,931 --> 03:34:44,490
enough when they go to sleep.
See,

4809
03:34:44,491 --> 03:34:45,324
I like the things you do,
but I have zero interest in doing the 

4810
03:34:47,201 --> 03:34:49,570
myself.
Like they don't understand me.

4811
03:34:49,650 --> 03:34:51,060
Like every time I look at those 
pictures,

4812
03:34:51,061 --> 03:34:51,721
I'm like,
fuck man,

4813
03:34:51,721 --> 03:34:52,980
he's living a cool life.
I'm like,

4814
03:34:53,310 --> 03:34:55,930
I couldn't do that.
Any one of these things.

4815
03:34:55,970 --> 03:35:00,420
We could certainly be an interesting 
thing to admire an envy.

4816
03:35:00,420 --> 03:35:04,680
Someone's like freedom in life and still
not want to do it yourself.

4817
03:35:04,681 --> 03:35:06,190
Generally speaking,
when you look at somebody and be like,

4818
03:35:06,191 --> 03:35:07,024
I wish I was like that.
You want to do the things they do or be 

4819
03:35:09,481 --> 03:35:10,314
the person they are,
but instead I can look at you and 

4820
03:35:11,461 --> 03:35:14,280
appreciate what you do and who you are 
and never wants to be like,

4821
03:35:14,340 --> 03:35:15,680
yeah,
that's a.

4822
03:35:15,840 --> 03:35:18,030
that's what I'm going to do.
I couldn't like.

4823
03:35:18,031 --> 03:35:21,300
You're into.
You're far too much of a man.

4824
03:35:21,930 --> 03:35:24,960
You're such a dude and not a dude like 
you're a bro,

4825
03:35:25,350 --> 03:35:27,030
but you are like.
You're like,

4826
03:35:27,031 --> 03:35:28,860
it makes sense.
You're somebody's dad.

4827
03:35:28,920 --> 03:35:30,600
You know what I'm saying?
Like you are.

4828
03:35:30,990 --> 03:35:32,970
When I think of a man,
that's what I think of,

4829
03:35:32,971 --> 03:35:34,760
and I don't mean this to sound like 
compliments.

4830
03:35:35,020 --> 03:35:38,490
I'm going to have a big head when I 
leave your problems in life now,

4831
03:35:38,610 --> 03:35:39,443
my dad,
but I think you would be a cool dead 

4832
03:35:40,791 --> 03:35:41,550
like your kids.

4833
03:35:41,550 --> 03:35:43,040
That's very nice.
Your kids have a.

4834
03:35:43,260 --> 03:35:44,093
have a wonderful lifetime ahead of them.
Have had great experience thus far it 

4835
03:35:47,701 --> 03:35:48,534
seems like.
But for the rest of their lives they're 

4836
03:35:49,621 --> 03:35:52,530
being raised by a thinking masculine 
man,

4837
03:35:52,531 --> 03:35:53,364
man.
Like my kid will never have that in her 

4838
03:35:56,461 --> 03:35:57,470
life.
Do you?

4839
03:35:57,480 --> 03:35:59,250
Would you want to be different than you 
are though?

4840
03:35:59,251 --> 03:36:01,240
You seem super content with her.
You are.

4841
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:02,693
The way I look at it,
it's just like everyone's dealt the 

4842
03:36:04,651 --> 03:36:05,484
cards,
right?

4843
03:36:05,520 --> 03:36:06,110
Like,
you know,

4844
03:36:06,110 --> 03:36:07,770
and you could improve some things in 
life,

4845
03:36:07,771 --> 03:36:08,604
but like you know,
like when we were young and they'd be 

4846
03:36:10,771 --> 03:36:12,150
like,
that's your cross to bear.

4847
03:36:12,151 --> 03:36:13,600
When I was kid,
you know,

4848
03:36:13,650 --> 03:36:15,120
I was always having.
My mom would be like,

4849
03:36:15,121 --> 03:36:16,680
well that's your cross to bear.
You know,

4850
03:36:16,681 --> 03:36:17,514
as if like,
that's just something you're as if it 

4851
03:36:18,271 --> 03:36:19,104
was genetic.
Because if she wasn't like she could 

4852
03:36:20,181 --> 03:36:21,180
have said,
hey,

4853
03:36:21,181 --> 03:36:23,760
let's get you working out.
Maybe feed you less or whatever.

4854
03:36:23,761 --> 03:36:25,440
She's like,
that's just your cross to bear,

4855
03:36:25,441 --> 03:36:26,274
but you know,
the rest of your life is blessed and 

4856
03:36:27,751 --> 03:36:29,190
stuff like that.
She probably just didn't.

4857
03:36:29,280 --> 03:36:30,113
I mean,
a lot of people say things like that 

4858
03:36:31,021 --> 03:36:31,854
because that's what someone told them 
and they never stopped to think about 

4859
03:36:33,781 --> 03:36:33,960
it.
Oh,

4860
03:36:33,960 --> 03:36:36,100
her mother definitely told her that

4861
03:36:36,100 --> 03:36:39,090
your cross to bear is something that was
just kind of passed sanction.

4862
03:36:39,310 --> 03:36:40,990
My mom was a wonderful woman.
I just spent.

4863
03:36:41,330 --> 03:36:41,921
Oh,
you know,

4864
03:36:41,921 --> 03:36:43,900
she's getting old and stuff and I,
I,

4865
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:49,090
I took her to see Dolly Parton and Tampa
and a Dolly Parton have seen three times

4866
03:36:49,091 --> 03:36:49,901
in two months.
Man,

4867
03:36:49,901 --> 03:36:54,901
she smells like she smells like cotton 
candy and baby powder and dude,

4868
03:36:55,730 --> 03:36:57,720
she's high note here.
Let me try to hit you.

4869
03:36:57,730 --> 03:37:01,720
Always hit me to cool shit.
Dolly Parton is seven years old.

4870
03:37:01,810 --> 03:37:04,570
She just three hour fucking show.
She didn't sit in one place.

4871
03:37:04,571 --> 03:37:06,610
You moved all over the stage.
He played piano,

4872
03:37:06,700 --> 03:37:08,200
Guitar,
Banjo,

4873
03:37:08,201 --> 03:37:10,780
flute,
and at one point she blew a saxophone,

4874
03:37:10,830 --> 03:37:13,530
which now she didn't just blow 
saxophone.

4875
03:37:13,540 --> 03:37:15,940
Like I had a few notes.
She played yackety sac,

4876
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:18,310
which is like I can grant an,
an,

4877
03:37:18,320 --> 03:37:18,551
an,
an,

4878
03:37:18,551 --> 03:37:18,751
an,
an,

4879
03:37:18,751 --> 03:37:21,340
an in it that requires some fucking lung
power.

4880
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:22,353
She's 70 years old.
I took my 70 year old mother to see her 

4881
03:37:25,631 --> 03:37:30,000
and like mom's got a cane and we had to 
get a people mover and stuff like that.

4882
03:37:30,010 --> 03:37:32,260
Like she's,
it's crazy man.

4883
03:37:32,261 --> 03:37:36,430
So like I took mom to go see Dolly 
Parton and my mother,

4884
03:37:36,431 --> 03:37:37,151
you know,
God love her.

4885
03:37:37,151 --> 03:37:39,370
She's amazing.
One of my favorite people in the world,

4886
03:37:39,371 --> 03:37:40,870
but you know,
she's like tiger.

4887
03:37:41,110 --> 03:37:43,660
You finally made it and I was like,
why?

4888
03:37:43,870 --> 03:37:44,703
And she's like,
because like we got to meet Dolly 

4889
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:46,350
Parton,
I was like,

4890
03:37:46,350 --> 03:37:47,183
mom met Dolly Parton and any old title 
and that's not a sign of prosperity or 

4891
03:37:52,361 --> 03:37:53,194
success or something like that.
Like that happened back on clerks or 

4892
03:37:55,571 --> 03:37:56,404
something.
But those days when Dolly Parton was on 

4893
03:37:57,911 --> 03:37:59,770
TV,
there was only like three channels.

4894
03:37:59,810 --> 03:38:01,120
Yeah.
She pulled,

4895
03:38:01,160 --> 03:38:03,850
she fills arenas like it's crazy.
It's massive.

4896
03:38:03,851 --> 03:38:07,510
And just watching somebody like,
you know,

4897
03:38:07,511 --> 03:38:09,970
I saw her,
I saw her when I went up to Vancouver to

4898
03:38:09,971 --> 03:38:10,960
shoot an episode of the flash.

4899
03:38:11,020 --> 03:38:12,400
I went and I was like,
Holy Shit.

4900
03:38:12,401 --> 03:38:14,050
Then there's a part of me,
of course,

4901
03:38:14,051 --> 03:38:18,040
I'm not a big country guy,
but my old man loved country and Western

4902
03:38:18,041 --> 03:38:18,874
even though we came from New Jersey and 
we weren't even from like Southern 

4903
03:38:20,950 --> 03:38:21,820
Jersey,
Central Jersey.

4904
03:38:22,030 --> 03:38:24,150
He loved country,
west country mustard.

4905
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:27,010
I hated it growing up.
And he's now dead for like 12,

4906
03:38:27,011 --> 03:38:28,960
13 years.
And naturally the older one gets,

4907
03:38:29,200 --> 03:38:30,033
you hear that music,
it takes you not to the president but 

4908
03:38:31,841 --> 03:38:34,180
right back to your childhood.
So lately,

4909
03:38:34,181 --> 03:38:35,560
even though I've never been a country 
person,

4910
03:38:35,561 --> 03:38:36,394
I find more country leaking into my life
and it has everything to do with my 

4911
03:38:39,221 --> 03:38:40,054
father or something like that.
So I went to see the show and it was 

4912
03:38:42,281 --> 03:38:44,410
like I might as well taking my dad with 
me.

4913
03:38:44,411 --> 03:38:48,430
He's been dead so long.
But like that was his dream show.

4914
03:38:48,460 --> 03:38:49,870
Like he loved Ali parties.

4915
03:38:49,870 --> 03:38:51,880
Big Country Music Fan generally love 
Dolly Parton.

4916
03:38:52,330 --> 03:38:54,190
So I went to see the show the first time
because I was like,

4917
03:38:54,191 --> 03:38:55,180
I got nothing to do,
let's go.

4918
03:38:55,181 --> 03:38:58,240
And then I was blown away by her 
showmanship as storyteller as well.

4919
03:38:58,420 --> 03:39:00,480
She doesn't just sit there and play the 
music between songs.

4920
03:39:00,481 --> 03:39:03,330
She'll sit there and tell you a story 
about growing up in the rocky mountains.

4921
03:39:03,331 --> 03:39:04,164
She's fucking funny dude.
I know she's got like pattern she's 

4922
03:39:05,951 --> 03:39:07,660
probably been doing for years,
but she talks about,

4923
03:39:08,170 --> 03:39:09,003
she's like,
when I was a little girl we went into 

4924
03:39:10,481 --> 03:39:14,290
town and they grew up poor and she's one
of 13 children or something like that.

4925
03:39:14,830 --> 03:39:16,720
And she's like,
I saw this woman,

4926
03:39:16,900 --> 03:39:17,733
beautiful woman,
and she's painted like an angel and she 

4927
03:39:20,651 --> 03:39:25,651
had pretty clothes and real big pretty 
heritage burn heels and makeup.

4928
03:39:26,050 --> 03:39:26,771
And I said,
Mama,

4929
03:39:26,771 --> 03:39:28,900
who's that?
And her mom is like,

4930
03:39:28,901 --> 03:39:30,030
that's the town trial.

4931
03:39:30,030 --> 03:39:32,500
That girl is nothing but trash.
And she goes,

4932
03:39:32,501 --> 03:39:34,610
I said,
that's what I want to be when I grow up.

4933
03:39:34,910 --> 03:39:37,270
So that's why.
That's why she's got the look.

4934
03:39:37,280 --> 03:39:38,113
She's got it.
She's like,

4935
03:39:38,330 --> 03:39:39,980
it cost a lot of money to look this 
cheap.

4936
03:39:40,360 --> 03:39:43,350
So she's hilarious.
She's like,

4937
03:39:43,470 --> 03:39:47,510
it's a true like even if you're not like
a Dolly Parton Fan,

4938
03:39:47,540 --> 03:39:51,300
like what a true night of entertainment 
like and you just won't get appreciate.

4939
03:39:51,650 --> 03:39:52,483
I saw her like last weekend I took my 
mom to see her in Tampa and time I saw 

4940
03:39:56,291 --> 03:39:59,120
her at the Hollywood bowl and then like 
a month ago,

4941
03:39:59,121 --> 03:40:02,210
and then I took mom to see her in Tampa 
and that was more like,

4942
03:40:02,450 --> 03:40:04,890
Hey dad would love this,
you know,

4943
03:40:04,891 --> 03:40:08,130
but she had this weird moment where she 
met Dolly in like,

4944
03:40:08,480 --> 03:40:09,860
you're talking about two,
seven year old woman.

4945
03:40:10,370 --> 03:40:13,640
And my mom went in for a fucking kiss.

4946
03:40:13,670 --> 03:40:14,503
Not like I want a friendship,
but just like the way you would kiss a 

4947
03:40:16,131 --> 03:40:16,930
friend.
But,

4948
03:40:16,930 --> 03:40:21,470
and then you could see Dolly who's had 
to politically maneuver strangers for 50

4949
03:40:21,471 --> 03:40:23,360
years or so.
Figure out,

4950
03:40:23,540 --> 03:40:25,190
do I say,
Hey,

4951
03:40:25,191 --> 03:40:28,620
I don't kiss strangers or do I just have
her lips were going for the lip on the,

4952
03:40:28,640 --> 03:40:30,140
what she was going for.
It was awkward too.

4953
03:40:30,150 --> 03:40:34,670
There was a moment where they were the 
exparel and then finally they hugged and

4954
03:40:34,671 --> 03:40:35,180
uh,
you know,

4955
03:40:35,180 --> 03:40:36,920
she was like,
my husband loved your music and shit.

4956
03:40:37,220 --> 03:40:40,250
It's really fucking beautiful the see.
But mom,

4957
03:40:40,310 --> 03:40:44,180
I love mom to death,
but mom is like such A.

4958
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:45,620
Everybody's mother is very singular 
individual.

4959
03:40:45,621 --> 03:40:47,600
But mom like had this thing.
I was trying to figure out.

4960
03:40:47,601 --> 03:40:49,100
It was like,
when did this person die?

4961
03:40:49,380 --> 03:40:50,710
I think we were talking about Barbara.
I was like,

4962
03:40:50,711 --> 03:40:52,610
when did aunt Barbara di?
And my mom's like,

4963
03:40:52,640 --> 03:40:53,473
oh,
hold on.

4964
03:40:53,810 --> 03:40:55,820
And she had this thing when we were 
kids,

4965
03:40:55,821 --> 03:40:56,654
like she'd get a calendar from church 
and she wouldn't write on it your 

4966
03:40:59,091 --> 03:41:03,050
birthday or a relative's birthday.
She'd write the day that they died.

4967
03:41:03,051 --> 03:41:06,350
So like this day was the day uncle Andy 
die this day and Connie died.

4968
03:41:06,590 --> 03:41:09,830
So my mom keeps all that information.
So she goes,

4969
03:41:09,831 --> 03:41:13,010
hold on.
She comes out with a box of like funeral

4970
03:41:13,011 --> 03:41:14,780
mass cards.
Like when somebody dies,

4971
03:41:14,781 --> 03:41:16,920
you go to a funeral,
there's a little trading card that has a

4972
03:41:16,921 --> 03:41:19,040
picture of a saint and on the back has a
person's name.

4973
03:41:19,041 --> 03:41:20,600
And when they were born,
when they were dead,

4974
03:41:21,330 --> 03:41:22,163
my mom has like a collection,
the way you collect baseball cards and 

4975
03:41:24,051 --> 03:41:24,884
shit.
And we spread them all out on the table 

4976
03:41:26,571 --> 03:41:29,930
is 12 significant deaths in our family.
She had lots more,

4977
03:41:29,931 --> 03:41:30,764
but the ones that would matter to both 
me and her in our immediate family and 

4978
03:41:35,540 --> 03:41:40,490
between 12 deaths I was able to quiz my 
mother who died in 1980.

4979
03:41:40,910 --> 03:41:41,481
And she was like,
oh,

4980
03:41:41,481 --> 03:41:45,020
that was grandpa Smith.
Like she is my mom's obsessed with death

4981
03:41:45,021 --> 03:41:48,650
but not in a like death metal.
When she was a child in Catholic school,

4982
03:41:48,980 --> 03:41:51,670
they tried to explain hell tour,
you know,

4983
03:41:51,980 --> 03:41:55,250
as you do in Catholic school.
And she was fucking far too young to get

4984
03:41:55,251 --> 03:41:56,084
the idea.
So death has been her obsession her 

4985
03:41:57,921 --> 03:41:59,330
whole life.
Staving it off,

4986
03:41:59,600 --> 03:42:03,020
stopping it from like taking not just 
her but her family,

4987
03:42:03,021 --> 03:42:04,160
you know,
she lost her husband to it.

4988
03:42:04,161 --> 03:42:04,994
We all.
Death is just a natural part of the 

4989
03:42:06,171 --> 03:42:10,700
process.
My mom finds it like she's terrified,

4990
03:42:10,701 --> 03:42:13,130
but now I as a,
as a creative person.

4991
03:42:13,190 --> 03:42:16,160
And I wonder if you feel the same way.
And I fancy myself a creative person.

4992
03:42:16,161 --> 03:42:17,660
Some people like you're not very 
creative,

4993
03:42:17,661 --> 03:42:20,510
but I fancy myself a creative person.
No caveats.

4994
03:42:20,600 --> 03:42:25,600
Death to me is not scary as much as like
a repugnant idea where you're like,

4995
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:27,793
what?

4996
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:31,440
Stop all this.
Like I'm just getting the of it.

4997
03:42:31,441 --> 03:42:34,920
I'm just learning like I got so many 
more jokes to tell and Shit like that.

4998
03:42:35,550 --> 03:42:36,383
Like death to people who make stuff like
us and that's why you might be the 

4999
03:42:39,510 --> 03:42:42,840
exception because you deal with death on
a regular basis.

5000
03:42:42,870 --> 03:42:43,703
Like with hunting and shit like that.
Like it's just something that probably 

5001
03:42:46,500 --> 03:42:50,910
enters your purview farm with the month,
but it is like one of those things,

5002
03:42:50,911 --> 03:42:52,500
man,
were you like wow,

5003
03:42:52,501 --> 03:42:54,780
I hadn't really thought about that too 
often.

5004
03:42:54,870 --> 03:42:55,703
But she's thinks about.
Often when I think of death I'm 

5005
03:42:58,291 --> 03:43:00,150
irritated by it because I'm like,
it's unfair.

5006
03:43:00,210 --> 03:43:01,043
Like why?
But I imagine if I was like my 

5007
03:43:03,541 --> 03:43:06,300
grandmother,
my grandmother lost her sight 12,

5008
03:43:06,301 --> 03:43:09,000
14 years before she died and I loved 
hanging out with her.

5009
03:43:09,001 --> 03:43:10,440
I used to play cards with her and shit 
like that.

5010
03:43:10,440 --> 03:43:12,270
And then when she lost her site,
like she did,

5011
03:43:12,300 --> 03:43:15,690
she was no longer just didn't living,
so she would sit around and be like,

5012
03:43:15,691 --> 03:43:17,040
how are you Graham?
You go visit her.

5013
03:43:17,041 --> 03:43:19,050
She'd be sitting in the dark and shit,
listen to the radio,

5014
03:43:19,051 --> 03:43:21,690
maybe no longer Christian like she used 
to.

5015
03:43:21,691 --> 03:43:23,310
We used to play cards,
can do any of that shit.

5016
03:43:23,311 --> 03:43:25,680
So she just sat there and he'd be like,
how are you?

5017
03:43:25,681 --> 03:43:28,620
And she'd be like,
well I asked him to take me.

5018
03:43:28,621 --> 03:43:30,990
And he said he didn't answer,
still not today.

5019
03:43:30,991 --> 03:43:31,561
And I was like,
Ooh,

5020
03:43:31,561 --> 03:43:34,410
Graham.
She's like Jesus everyday I pray that he

5021
03:43:34,411 --> 03:43:38,250
finally take me and I'm still here.
And she grew slowly,

5022
03:43:38,251 --> 03:43:40,590
grew to be bitter about life and shit.
Now,

5023
03:43:40,591 --> 03:43:42,930
from where I sit right now,
I'm the guy that's like,

5024
03:43:43,080 --> 03:43:45,210
I never want this party to an oh shit.

5025
03:43:45,780 --> 03:43:48,240
But I guess there could be a time in my 
life where,

5026
03:43:48,510 --> 03:43:49,380
you know,
everyone,

5027
03:43:49,381 --> 03:43:53,010
you know and love is past and you just 
get to a place where you're like,

5028
03:43:53,400 --> 03:43:54,233
you know what?
I'm okay.

5029
03:43:54,270 --> 03:43:55,103
I'm okay.
Like,

5030
03:43:55,140 --> 03:43:56,000
who was it?
Uh,

5031
03:43:56,720 --> 03:44:01,720
the singer that that just passed a law 
was the guy that sang Hallelujah.

5032
03:44:04,260 --> 03:44:05,093
Leonard Cohen has been to have Louis and
Leonard Cohen didn't interview like 

5033
03:44:07,500 --> 03:44:09,750
before he passed like five months,
five weeks,

5034
03:44:09,760 --> 03:44:12,270
maybe 40 past where he was like,
yeah,

5035
03:44:12,271 --> 03:44:14,820
I'm ready for death.
He's gone up pretty much done everything

5036
03:44:14,821 --> 03:44:17,160
I wanted to do and I'm,
I'm ready for it.

5037
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:19,770
And he went fairly short there shortly 
thereafter.

5038
03:44:19,980 --> 03:44:23,490
Grandma didn't Ms.
Young on for awhile but wanted to die.

5039
03:44:23,880 --> 03:44:26,250
I hope I'm never that person.
But you know,

5040
03:44:26,390 --> 03:44:27,223
what,
if something happens to me and I can't 

5041
03:44:29,341 --> 03:44:31,980
move or something like that movie,
Johnny got his gun and Shit.

5042
03:44:32,100 --> 03:44:32,933
You hit that point.
It'd been really taking care of your 

5043
03:44:34,471 --> 03:44:35,840
health.
Yeah.

5044
03:44:35,910 --> 03:44:38,010
You a little bit late in life just 
because I was like,

5045
03:44:38,011 --> 03:44:39,120
oh shit,
I should.

5046
03:44:39,330 --> 03:44:41,760
I come from diabetic people,
Dad,

5047
03:44:41,761 --> 03:44:42,594
all his brothers and sisters,
very diabetic and I've played for my 

5048
03:44:45,871 --> 03:44:49,230
whole life as if that wasn't a factor.
I never eat vegetables and shit.

5049
03:44:49,430 --> 03:44:50,263
Say packaged food.
So I saw that movie fed up and that 

5050
03:44:53,430 --> 03:44:54,263
turned it around for me.
I lost like a bunch of weight because I 

5051
03:44:56,191 --> 03:44:59,400
stopped eating sugar.
This documentary was fascinating.

5052
03:44:59,401 --> 03:45:02,340
It was abused cartoons.
Maybe that's why it worked on me,

5053
03:45:02,910 --> 03:45:04,200
but it broke down like,
oh,

5054
03:45:04,201 --> 03:45:07,020
this is what you do every time he put 
sugar into your body.

5055
03:45:07,021 --> 03:45:09,390
And I was one of those documentary fed 
up,

5056
03:45:09,391 --> 03:45:11,410
I believe it was.
Um,

5057
03:45:12,060 --> 03:45:13,170
I was one of those people.
It's like,

5058
03:45:13,171 --> 03:45:14,010
well,
sugar's natural.

5059
03:45:14,011 --> 03:45:15,060
Comes out of the ground.
So,

5060
03:45:15,150 --> 03:45:15,983
you know,
just like wheat and fucking flower and 

5061
03:45:17,761 --> 03:45:20,090
vegetables,
I guess it's okay for us,

5062
03:45:20,091 --> 03:45:20,924
you know,
it's one of those things where it's 

5063
03:45:21,781 --> 03:45:25,020
taken me a long time to accept the fact 
that sugars much as I love it,

5064
03:45:25,080 --> 03:45:25,950
for me,
it's,

5065
03:45:26,040 --> 03:45:27,750
it's a poison.
It's like,

5066
03:45:27,910 --> 03:45:30,070
or it's like booze for an alcoholic,

5067
03:45:30,100 --> 03:45:32,770
like I can't stop.
I dropped sugar on my life,

5068
03:45:32,771 --> 03:45:37,771
lost 70 fucking pounds.
Then I let sugar creep back in slowly 20

5069
03:45:38,530 --> 03:45:40,780
came back.
So now I've gotten rid of 10 of it.

5070
03:45:40,781 --> 03:45:43,210
I've got another 10 to get back to where
I fucking was.

5071
03:45:43,330 --> 03:45:46,000
And I remember being free of sugar and 
being like,

5072
03:45:46,390 --> 03:45:48,880
what a fucking asshole.
How'd you get back into it?

5073
03:45:49,570 --> 03:45:51,220
It's a slow,
it's a slippery slope.

5074
03:45:51,230 --> 03:45:52,063
Candy Bar,
10 piece of chocolate starts with a 

5075
03:45:53,441 --> 03:45:55,450
piece of chocolate where you like milk 
chocolate,

5076
03:45:55,451 --> 03:45:56,680
man,
I love milk chocolate.

5077
03:45:56,681 --> 03:45:59,650
I can handle this.
And then when I was working on the shows

5078
03:45:59,651 --> 03:46:00,484
in Canada donuts,
because they got Tim Horton's 

5079
03:46:03,071 --> 03:46:05,020
everywhere.
Throw a rock and there's a Tim Horton's.

5080
03:46:05,021 --> 03:46:07,270
I got those Tim bits which are like 
Dunkin donuts.

5081
03:46:07,271 --> 03:46:09,250
Munchkins a little donut holes.
I liked those.

5082
03:46:09,251 --> 03:46:11,440
Boston cream jammies.
Dude.

5083
03:46:11,441 --> 03:46:15,550
I love when they checked on the top and 
the cream and jelly in that shit.

5084
03:46:15,910 --> 03:46:19,570
That's my religion.
I like a jelly donut to powdered sugar.

5085
03:46:20,400 --> 03:46:21,790
Oh my God.
Don't do this.

5086
03:46:22,080 --> 03:46:23,960
Just so soft.
I learned that I had.

5087
03:46:24,490 --> 03:46:25,323
I had to cut it out.
I had to put sugar way entirely so I 

5088
03:46:27,581 --> 03:46:30,520
stopped eating processed or anything.
Processed or added sugar?

5089
03:46:30,880 --> 03:46:32,440
No sugar whatsoever.
Natural Sheer.

5090
03:46:32,441 --> 03:46:36,040
Like the closest sugar I'd get out of 
drinking were beats.

5091
03:46:36,041 --> 03:46:38,520
I know I started drinking vegetable 
drink though something.

5092
03:46:38,521 --> 03:46:42,280
I never did vegetable juice,
so I'm a big fan of cold press juices.

5093
03:46:42,281 --> 03:46:45,380
That's what I've been doing.
Stores too.

5094
03:46:45,400 --> 03:46:47,810
You can go and stop in and get them 
done.

5095
03:46:47,980 --> 03:46:48,813
You could find out online like if 
there's a store near you and then once 

5096
03:46:51,431 --> 03:46:52,920
you know,
like for me I've got a bunch of them and

5097
03:46:52,930 --> 03:46:53,763
I stopped at.
I like to go and get something to drink 

5098
03:46:55,751 --> 03:46:59,050
that's like really nutritious and 
fucking powers you didn't like before I.

5099
03:46:59,050 --> 03:47:01,090
and this is,
I mean it's no secret or anything,

5100
03:47:01,091 --> 03:47:03,610
but here's a tip before I got to do 
anything,

5101
03:47:03,611 --> 03:47:06,070
requires a lot of energy or something.
Like if I was going to go on the talking

5102
03:47:06,071 --> 03:47:06,904
dead or I'm going to fucking go to the 
movie set or make some do show I get me 

5103
03:47:11,561 --> 03:47:12,394
a fucking a big vegetable drink.
Basically I get one whole beat eight 

5104
03:47:16,301 --> 03:47:19,300
fistfuls of spinach,
half a carat,

5105
03:47:19,301 --> 03:47:20,420
half,
half.

5106
03:47:21,590 --> 03:47:23,740
I stopped doing so much.
Abbott was a lot of sugar in it.

5107
03:47:23,980 --> 03:47:24,813
So about quarter apple,
big knob of Ginger Shit just burned to 

5108
03:47:28,041 --> 03:47:28,874
my insides out kids in 1920.
We're playing on scaffolding and we're 

5109
03:47:31,871 --> 03:47:36,871
scared of sugar from an apple were such 
pussies who become such until now.

5110
03:47:37,651 --> 03:47:38,620
Now I'm like,
I can't.

5111
03:47:38,621 --> 03:47:40,870
I can't have the extra sugar,
so I make that dude,

5112
03:47:40,871 --> 03:47:44,080
I drink that and that gives me like,
like,

5113
03:47:44,300 --> 03:47:46,000
like beats fucking natural.

5114
03:47:47,830 --> 03:47:49,870
Amazing.
It's like I've never done coke,

5115
03:47:49,871 --> 03:47:51,710
but I imagine it's like we're doing a 
line of coke.

5116
03:47:51,720 --> 03:47:52,553
I really don't think it's anything like 
that is like doing dope beats make me 

5117
03:47:57,761 --> 03:48:00,070
feel like a,
not just beats but like,

5118
03:48:00,130 --> 03:48:02,500
oh,
a good robust vegetable juice.

5119
03:48:02,830 --> 03:48:04,160
You feel that God,
Ooh,

5120
03:48:04,480 --> 03:48:05,960
I could get a little,
you know,

5121
03:48:06,030 --> 03:48:07,950
that was one of the things I like about 
your instagram feed you,

5122
03:48:07,960 --> 03:48:11,050
you put a lot of food in there and you 
talk about like what it does for you and

5123
03:48:11,051 --> 03:48:12,190
you're like,
look at his shit.

5124
03:48:12,850 --> 03:48:14,620
Fucking natural and I'm getting all this
out.

5125
03:48:14,630 --> 03:48:18,430
It's food porn because it gets 
repetitive.

5126
03:48:18,460 --> 03:48:20,890
I get it.
What do you mean it gets repetitive?

5127
03:48:20,891 --> 03:48:21,701
Oh,
would you cook it?

5128
03:48:21,701 --> 03:48:23,190
Oka Gun.
Fucking fuck it.

5129
03:48:23,570 --> 03:48:25,030
You know,
that's what you get.

5130
03:48:25,590 --> 03:48:27,980
Do you then stop and be like,
did you realize your hurdling

5131
03:48:27,980 --> 03:48:30,090
through space on a fucking rock?
Anything could happen.

5132
03:48:30,100 --> 03:48:32,270
I just think that.
I think it don't bother saying it,

5133
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:33,920
but yeah,
I get it.

5134
03:48:34,530 --> 03:48:37,670
But people always looking for things but
also criticizing.

5135
03:48:37,690 --> 03:48:40,610
Yeah,
but it's fun if you're eating out again,

5136
03:48:41,030 --> 03:48:41,863
it's not like it's not a one time 
experience where like I've eaten out 

5137
03:48:44,480 --> 03:48:47,870
when I was 14 and of course when a man 
eats can never again,

5138
03:48:48,280 --> 03:48:51,080
so got to expect you might redo a meal 
if I give you some.

5139
03:48:51,081 --> 03:48:53,410
When you cook it.
What kind of meat is it?

5140
03:48:53,530 --> 03:48:54,680
Elk.
Yeah.

5141
03:48:54,681 --> 03:48:56,060
How do you cook it?
I'll teach you.

5142
03:48:56,270 --> 03:48:58,700
I'll show you how to put it on.
I'll give you some real simple.

5143
03:48:58,701 --> 03:48:59,960
I'll give you.
You kill this thing.

5144
03:49:00,020 --> 03:49:01,580
Yeah.
I'll give you an elk burger.

5145
03:49:01,581 --> 03:49:04,040
That's the simplest.
Got Him out of it.

5146
03:49:04,220 --> 03:49:06,830
You just got it.
Tastes like it tastes really good.

5147
03:49:07,010 --> 03:49:10,250
It's super healthy for you because I 
mean no hormones,

5148
03:49:10,251 --> 03:49:11,390
no antibiotics,
no nothing.

5149
03:49:11,391 --> 03:49:12,224
It's just wild.
Elk Meat was very lean and if you cook 

5150
03:49:16,041 --> 03:49:19,010
it like as a cheeseburger,
you have to kind of cook it pretty quick

5151
03:49:19,250 --> 03:49:21,610
because it doesn't have much fat in it 
at all really.

5152
03:49:21,680 --> 03:49:23,200
It's really lean protein.
Yeah.

5153
03:49:23,300 --> 03:49:28,100
Very high protein content.
So meaning like it's going to burn fat,

5154
03:49:28,660 --> 03:49:29,690
don't,
don't cook it.

5155
03:49:29,691 --> 03:49:32,570
Maybe as long as you would like a real 
fatty beef burger,

5156
03:49:33,090 --> 03:49:35,260
just cook it a little less time.
What's A.

5157
03:49:35,260 --> 03:49:36,980
I think the last time we talked we 
talked about that.

5158
03:49:36,981 --> 03:49:40,340
Like the idea of you'll go out hunting 
but you eat what you,

5159
03:49:40,670 --> 03:49:42,920
what you bring back or whatever.
I eat everything.

5160
03:49:43,520 --> 03:49:46,420
It's Mark Zuckerberg.
That one year was like,

5161
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:49,150
I'm only going to that kill.
Yeah.

5162
03:49:49,180 --> 03:49:51,170
I mean from the minute we were all like 
that savage,

5163
03:49:51,171 --> 03:49:52,610
and then afterwards we were like,
oh,

5164
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:53,923
I see.

5165
03:49:53,960 --> 03:49:55,460
I'm not doing anything.
We're all doing.

5166
03:49:55,461 --> 03:49:57,050
If we we eat beet.
That's my point.

5167
03:49:57,130 --> 03:49:57,963
So like if you're,
if you're buying food from a store or 

5168
03:50:02,720 --> 03:50:03,560
restaurant,
you're,

5169
03:50:03,660 --> 03:50:05,600
you're killing it.
You're just killing it with a card,

5170
03:50:05,601 --> 03:50:08,360
a credit card or a check book.
Or if you're eating meat,

5171
03:50:08,361 --> 03:50:09,194
you're killing things.
Yeah.

5172
03:50:09,510 --> 03:50:10,940
You know,
you might not be doing it yourself,

5173
03:50:10,970 --> 03:50:15,720
but my whole take is that if an animal 
is wild that's in the,

5174
03:50:15,721 --> 03:50:17,660
in that wild animal,
you kill it.

5175
03:50:17,661 --> 03:50:20,270
Like that thing was wild.
I mean it's,

5176
03:50:20,271 --> 03:50:22,910
it's,
it's whether you ever existed or not.

5177
03:50:22,911 --> 03:50:23,744
That thing did exactly what it did.
That's the pure life for one of those 

5178
03:50:26,541 --> 03:50:27,710
animals and you're saying,
well,

5179
03:50:27,711 --> 03:50:29,410
why would you want a hunter doing 
killer?

5180
03:50:29,700 --> 03:50:31,730
Something's going to like,
this is what you don't understand.

5181
03:50:31,731 --> 03:50:33,350
These things are not.
They're not going to live forever.

5182
03:50:33,560 --> 03:50:35,240
They have a very short and brutal life.

5183
03:50:35,270 --> 03:50:38,150
They usually get taken down by coyotes 
or mountain lions or.

5184
03:50:38,420 --> 03:50:39,253
I mean when.
When a person comes in and shoots a 

5185
03:50:41,750 --> 03:50:42,583
deer,
that is the best death it's ever going 

5186
03:50:44,051 --> 03:50:45,980
to die.
If a person doesn't do it,

5187
03:50:45,990 --> 03:50:46,823
that just died in my bed at age 80.
Now they free surrounded by my loved 

5188
03:50:50,721 --> 03:50:52,400
ones.
They freeze to death.

5189
03:50:52,401 --> 03:50:54,890
They get hit by cars.
I want to.

5190
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:57,510
Can I make this board clear?
They fucking freeze to death.

5191
03:50:57,570 --> 03:50:59,810
They don't live.
They don't live very long.

5192
03:50:59,811 --> 03:51:03,680
If a deer lifts to be like seven,
that is an old fucking deer.

5193
03:51:03,710 --> 03:51:05,060
Really?
Oh yeah.

5194
03:51:05,810 --> 03:51:09,470
So if people are upset with you eating 
any kind of animals at all,

5195
03:51:09,471 --> 03:51:11,390
they're not going to understand why you 
would be upset at hunting.

5196
03:51:11,391 --> 03:51:14,600
But my,
my kid is total vegan.

5197
03:51:14,930 --> 03:51:18,560
Great kid about though she's not judging
me as I sit there and eat meat and shit,

5198
03:51:18,561 --> 03:51:19,580
but she's,
you know,

5199
03:51:19,581 --> 03:51:20,414
her thing is like she fucking loves 
animals and what does she do to 

5200
03:51:23,691 --> 03:51:26,180
supplement?
Like our essential fatty invited me a

5201
03:51:26,760 --> 03:51:29,670
question because the Diet I've seen for 
a Vegan now,

5202
03:51:29,671 --> 03:51:32,580
I've been around it quite a bit is 
insanely limited.

5203
03:51:32,690 --> 03:51:33,523
Like yeah,
like when I pull sugar out of my diet 

5204
03:51:36,600 --> 03:51:37,433
suddenly you're down to fucking 20 
things because everything's gotten milk 

5205
03:51:41,121 --> 03:51:41,954
and sugar added to it.
When you go vegan and not just 

5206
03:51:43,861 --> 03:51:45,460
vegetarian,
I mean fucking leg,

5207
03:51:45,461 --> 03:51:47,880
straight up Vegan.
There's like,

5208
03:51:48,060 --> 03:51:48,893
you know,
everything green and maybe three other 

5209
03:51:51,361 --> 03:51:52,194
things in the world.
Like you can't even eat a Bagel without 

5210
03:51:54,031 --> 03:51:54,864
being like,
did you use this or this or this or 

5211
03:51:57,480 --> 03:51:59,040
something like that.
Kenneth eggs,

5212
03:51:59,470 --> 03:52:00,303
which is a really unfortunate because 
eggs are never going to be a living 

5213
03:52:02,341 --> 03:52:03,220
thing.
He,

5214
03:52:03,370 --> 03:52:04,203
that's what people don't understand.
I could understand if you're against 

5215
03:52:05,671 --> 03:52:08,220
factory farming,
but I think that's a different story.

5216
03:52:08,490 --> 03:52:11,490
Like I.
my chickens are pretty free range there.

5217
03:52:11,491 --> 03:52:12,324
They live in a big cute coop and I know 
a lot of people don't have room for 

5218
03:52:14,251 --> 03:52:14,550
coop.

5219
03:52:14,550 --> 03:52:15,383
I'm not saying you need to do it,
but all I'm saying is you can have 

5220
03:52:17,941 --> 03:52:21,150
chickens that exists in some sort of a 
natural environment.

5221
03:52:21,151 --> 03:52:23,940
It's not entirely difficult and they 
give you eggs.

5222
03:52:24,120 --> 03:52:27,870
They don't have to worry at all about 
anything bad happening.

5223
03:52:27,871 --> 03:52:29,790
This is just a natural product of being 
a chicken.

5224
03:52:29,791 --> 03:52:30,624
They lay one on their own.
It's not fertilized and no one's going 

5225
03:52:32,851 --> 03:52:34,710
to eat it,
but not every egg becomes a chicken.

5226
03:52:34,711 --> 03:52:35,321
Not.
No,

5227
03:52:35,321 --> 03:52:35,701
no,
no,

5228
03:52:35,701 --> 03:52:36,900
no.
They have to get fucked.

5229
03:52:37,110 --> 03:52:39,480
The rooster has to come along and sling 
that Dick.

5230
03:52:39,481 --> 03:52:42,120
That's what makes a chance.
So if there's no rooster then.

5231
03:52:42,320 --> 03:52:43,670
So essentially,
dude,

5232
03:52:43,680 --> 03:52:46,170
I didn't know that until I was like 
fucking 39 years old,

5233
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:47,010
man.
Me Too.

5234
03:52:47,010 --> 03:52:47,843
I didn't.
I think you told me last time it might 

5235
03:52:49,591 --> 03:52:50,420
have this,
but the.

5236
03:52:50,420 --> 03:52:52,800
I'm a repetitive motherfucker.
I will to do it.

5237
03:52:52,800 --> 03:52:55,200
I liked reading that you eat elk more 
than once.

5238
03:52:55,290 --> 03:52:59,250
Oh wait,
so it's Kinda like a chicken's period.

5239
03:53:00,150 --> 03:53:01,680
Yes.
And matter of fact,

5240
03:53:01,700 --> 03:53:06,700
Peta developed a whole campaign to try 
to get people to stop eating chicken,

5241
03:53:06,931 --> 03:53:07,764
egg,
calling it the menstrual cycle and also 

5242
03:53:10,081 --> 03:53:10,914
showing a fucking frying pan with a 
bloody maxi pad sitting in the frying 

5243
03:53:15,601 --> 03:53:18,930
pan.
I don't know if that's very effective,

5244
03:53:18,960 --> 03:53:19,970
dude.
I mean,

5245
03:53:19,980 --> 03:53:21,240
that would gross me out,
turn me off.

5246
03:53:21,241 --> 03:53:22,200
But I,
I'll like pull it up.

5247
03:53:22,201 --> 03:53:23,330
So I never want to.
I'm kidding.

5248
03:53:23,340 --> 03:53:25,470
I never want to eat a tampon again.
Foul,

5249
03:53:25,920 --> 03:53:26,753
foul that they chose to do this.
My kid doesn't get like shitty or 

5250
03:53:29,760 --> 03:53:31,410
political about it or like,
you know,

5251
03:53:31,411 --> 03:53:33,480
in your face or you got to live my way 
and stuff.

5252
03:53:33,481 --> 03:53:36,120
But every once in awhile it slips out.
I'm a big milk drinker.

5253
03:53:36,810 --> 03:53:37,860
And so,
you know,

5254
03:53:38,250 --> 03:53:41,190
she's uh,
her whole thing is not your mom,

5255
03:53:41,191 --> 03:53:42,060
not your milk.

5256
03:53:42,630 --> 03:53:43,620
And I was like,
what do you mean?

5257
03:53:43,650 --> 03:53:44,251
She's like,
well,

5258
03:53:44,251 --> 03:53:46,020
that's not your mother.
You if you want milk,

5259
03:53:46,021 --> 03:53:47,930
you should get it from your mother.
That's,

5260
03:53:48,090 --> 03:53:49,980
you took some of the baby cows.
And I'm like,

5261
03:53:50,010 --> 03:53:50,580
oh,
come on,

5262
03:53:50,580 --> 03:53:52,050
don't do this to be good.
I was like,

5263
03:53:52,051 --> 03:53:54,720
they raised us to believe in milk.
I watched a lot of commercials.

5264
03:53:54,721 --> 03:53:57,420
Milk does a body good.
They taught me that on television.

5265
03:53:57,870 --> 03:54:00,600
Don't tell me that I'm taking milk from 
baby cow.

5266
03:54:00,660 --> 03:54:02,310
She's kind of right though,
right?

5267
03:54:02,370 --> 03:54:04,040
Yeah.
Were you down on milk [inaudible]?

5268
03:54:04,050 --> 03:54:06,060
I saw your.
Every time I talk about milk,

5269
03:54:06,360 --> 03:54:07,193
people put up the little picture.
You talk on stage and they put a bit of 

5270
03:54:10,081 --> 03:54:11,790
your routine we talked about right 
before the show.

5271
03:54:11,970 --> 03:54:12,870
Oh,
that Vegan?

5272
03:54:12,871 --> 03:54:14,520
Yeah.
Were they say Vegan?

5273
03:54:14,530 --> 03:54:16,510
Say No,
we're the only species.

5274
03:54:16,511 --> 03:54:17,344
Gut do it.
We're the only species that drinks the 

5275
03:54:19,561 --> 03:54:22,020
milk of other animals.
I'm like,

5276
03:54:22,021 --> 03:54:23,920
you know what else?
Only humans do

5277
03:54:24,130 --> 03:54:26,800
fly planes.
Make movies.

5278
03:54:27,010 --> 03:54:32,010
Call each other and tell each other how 
eggs come from chicken ministration.

5279
03:54:33,731 --> 03:54:34,360
Look at that.
Oh,

5280
03:54:34,360 --> 03:54:36,400
it was a bloody underwear.
I'm sorry.

5281
03:54:36,401 --> 03:54:39,130
I thought it was a maxi pad,
but that's a real p to add.

5282
03:54:39,280 --> 03:54:41,710
They put a bloody pair of women's 
underwear.

5283
03:54:41,880 --> 03:54:42,713
Oh my God.
The tagline is donated eggs period and 

5284
03:54:45,191 --> 03:54:47,290
period is in red.
Wow.

5285
03:54:47,350 --> 03:54:48,790
This psych.
Come on.

5286
03:54:49,260 --> 03:54:53,110
What's gross is factory farming.
That's what's gross,

5287
03:54:53,320 --> 03:54:54,153
but it's gross is having all these 
chickens packed and stacked into these 

5288
03:54:57,910 --> 03:55:01,660
horrific cages and warehouses.
That's what's gross.

5289
03:55:02,070 --> 03:55:02,903
What's not gross?
Is it chicken living in a chicken house 

5290
03:55:05,770 --> 03:55:06,603
that occasionally lays an egg and when 
they lay an egg then they just wander 

5291
03:55:09,551 --> 03:55:10,384
off and they just wander around the yard
and packet grass and do chicken stuff 

5292
03:55:13,960 --> 03:55:14,793
because that's.
If a chicken is living in a healthy 

5293
03:55:16,241 --> 03:55:18,340
environment,
they're not even scared of you.

5294
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:20,970
Like I go near my chickens all the time.
I can pick some of them up.

5295
03:55:21,040 --> 03:55:22,720
Some of them don't,
don't fuck with it.

5296
03:55:22,721 --> 03:55:24,550
They won't let you pick them up,
but if you do,

5297
03:55:24,551 --> 03:55:26,470
if you try to pick it up,
you have to chase them.

5298
03:55:26,710 --> 03:55:28,960
They don't try to go after you but they 
don't want to be picked up,

5299
03:55:28,961 --> 03:55:31,340
but some of them will just stay there 
and you pick them up and pet them in.

5300
03:55:31,341 --> 03:55:34,840
My girls will hold onto them that they 
all have their own little personalities.

5301
03:55:34,990 --> 03:55:37,270
Are they dirty now?
Surprisingly,

5302
03:55:37,271 --> 03:55:38,860
they don't feel dirty.
You know?

5303
03:55:38,861 --> 03:55:43,861
They take dust baths though,
but their feathers I think can brush off

5304
03:55:44,081 --> 03:55:44,914
a lot of things.
I think they keep themselves fairly 

5305
03:55:47,021 --> 03:55:50,120
clean just by whatever the composition 
of their feathers are there.

5306
03:55:50,150 --> 03:55:51,910
Interesting little animals.
You eat the eggs.

5307
03:55:51,911 --> 03:55:53,050
Do you eat the chickens as well?

5308
03:55:53,080 --> 03:55:54,640
No,
I don't eat the chickens now.

5309
03:55:55,240 --> 03:55:57,280
It just feels fucked up.
I agree,

5310
03:55:57,340 --> 03:55:58,173
but I mean,
but so do you chicken engine to those 

5311
03:56:02,051 --> 03:56:04,090
chickens?
I just don't like animal farm.

5312
03:56:04,091 --> 03:56:05,960
Some chairs are more equal than others.
Yeah.

5313
03:56:05,980 --> 03:56:10,790
These chickens get a pass.
They're there within my control to every

5314
03:56:11,020 --> 03:56:12,670
chicken in front of them.
Not in a shitty way,

5315
03:56:12,671 --> 03:56:13,940
but hey,
it's chicken tonight.

5316
03:56:14,070 --> 03:56:15,700
Did we kill the chickens in front of 
them?

5317
03:56:15,701 --> 03:56:16,534
We put them on a fire in front of them.
We set the fire up in front of the 

5318
03:56:18,731 --> 03:56:20,520
children,
which be fucking kidding.

5319
03:56:20,580 --> 03:56:21,550
Oh,
Holy Shit.

5320
03:56:21,551 --> 03:56:22,810
I was like,
oh my God.

5321
03:56:22,840 --> 03:56:26,140
Imagine if I like the shit.
That was with Vlad.

5322
03:56:26,141 --> 03:56:30,190
The impaler used to do vlad the impaler 
that Mary Shelley based.

5323
03:56:30,220 --> 03:56:32,200
Not Shelley.
Marisa was bram stoker.

5324
03:56:32,260 --> 03:56:34,930
Bram Stoker's Dracula on that.
Vlad,

5325
03:56:34,931 --> 03:56:38,350
the impaler guy would eat people in 
front of other people.

5326
03:56:39,100 --> 03:56:40,420
He would.
Why?

5327
03:56:40,421 --> 03:56:42,550
Just a crazy killer late.
Maybe look up earlier.

5328
03:56:42,551 --> 03:56:45,010
That's what once she.
She made one of her victims eat,

5329
03:56:45,100 --> 03:56:46,150
cook,
and eat themselves.

5330
03:56:46,930 --> 03:56:50,720
Elizabeth herself.
A little girl said,

5331
03:56:50,980 --> 03:56:52,510
oh my God,
she was a monster.

5332
03:56:53,370 --> 03:56:55,600
How do you.
How do you cook and eat yourself to make

5333
03:56:55,630 --> 03:56:57,480
someone cut a piece off of their body?
Oh,

5334
03:56:57,760 --> 03:57:00,430
that was what Vlad.
Vlad did that as well.

5335
03:57:00,730 --> 03:57:01,563
He also put people on stakes in front of
his house and he would eat lunch while 

5336
03:57:05,261 --> 03:57:06,094
he's watching them slowly rather than w 
when someone has a stake through their 

5337
03:57:09,581 --> 03:57:13,570
body doesn't kill them like right away.
They can puncture with the stake and the

5338
03:57:13,571 --> 03:57:15,700
stake as long as they put it through the
right spot.

5339
03:57:15,880 --> 03:57:18,340
Although you have like massive internal 
bleeding,

5340
03:57:18,580 --> 03:57:20,970
the state kind of keeps it all in their 
launches.

5341
03:57:21,200 --> 03:57:22,033
Yeah,
it's all stretched out and in your body 

5342
03:57:24,201 --> 03:57:27,020
is kind of like if they stick it into 
the right way,

5343
03:57:27,021 --> 03:57:28,340
it takes a while to die.

5344
03:57:28,340 --> 03:57:29,173
Like you could take hours.
So they're sticking this literally 

5345
03:57:31,791 --> 03:57:34,340
through your asshole and out through 
your back.

5346
03:57:35,210 --> 03:57:36,043
That's it in through your center.
I mean they could do it a bunch of 

5347
03:57:39,411 --> 03:57:41,990
different way and they never show you 
that in any of those dracula movies.

5348
03:57:41,991 --> 03:57:45,860
Like put that asshole put the stake 
right through his asshole.

5349
03:57:45,950 --> 03:57:48,770
Now Standard up.
I mean maybe they go through a long,

5350
03:57:48,830 --> 03:57:51,170
maybe they go through one side and go 
through a lung,

5351
03:57:51,200 --> 03:57:52,033
but either way there's ways they can do 
it where they would put you through 

5352
03:57:54,351 --> 03:57:56,360
stakes where it take a long time for you
to die.

5353
03:57:56,630 --> 03:57:57,463
So these people would all be moaning on 
steak steaks are probably going in dry 

5354
03:58:00,411 --> 03:58:00,950
too,
right?

5355
03:58:00,950 --> 03:58:02,510
Oh yeah.
They don't lose that shit up at all.

5356
03:58:04,340 --> 03:58:05,173
These people were moving.
You're going to die to stake going 

5357
03:58:07,131 --> 03:58:08,840
through your asshole first then up 
through your body.

5358
03:58:08,840 --> 03:58:09,673
But the good news,
we have some light cane is pretty 

5359
03:58:12,021 --> 03:58:12,854
slippery.
We're going to spray the outside for a 

5360
03:58:14,170 --> 03:58:16,550
stabbing.
This fucking gigantic steak.

5361
03:58:16,700 --> 03:58:19,370
Oh,
that's tough to.

5362
03:58:19,750 --> 03:58:20,840
Well this.
There's a real human.

5363
03:58:20,900 --> 03:58:22,850
I mean that was a real human that really
did live.

5364
03:58:22,880 --> 03:58:23,421
Yeah.
Look at this.

5365
03:58:23,421 --> 03:58:28,421
This is the ancient pictures that were,
these are from a long fucking time ago.

5366
03:58:28,491 --> 03:58:31,040
These images,
some woodcuts yeah.

5367
03:58:31,220 --> 03:58:32,160
Yeah.
He's just like right on.

5368
03:58:32,200 --> 03:58:33,033
And he's sitting there eating while 
these people were on stakes in front of 

5369
03:58:35,451 --> 03:58:36,284
them.
And of course,

5370
03:58:36,580 --> 03:58:37,413
you know,
you have to sort of process like how 

5371
03:58:39,171 --> 03:58:41,900
much of that was myth?
How much of that was folklore,

5372
03:58:41,930 --> 03:58:45,050
how much of it was real,
what was the point at him there too?

5373
03:58:46,190 --> 03:58:47,300
What was the choices?
Well,

5374
03:58:47,301 --> 03:58:48,134
he was just a,
he just wanted to make sure that 

5375
03:58:49,431 --> 03:58:52,220
everybody knew was a bad motherfucker 
and if you uh,

5376
03:58:52,310 --> 03:58:57,310
it wasn't like trying to live forever 
while he became so hard.

5377
03:58:57,380 --> 03:58:58,213
Whenever you're talking about people and
you like definitively describe like who 

5378
03:59:01,221 --> 03:59:02,420
they were and what they were and you 
know,

5379
03:59:02,421 --> 03:59:05,420
how it's history just gets so twisted 
and distorted.

5380
03:59:05,421 --> 03:59:07,610
Especially back when there was no video 
tapes and no,

5381
03:59:08,030 --> 03:59:10,610
you know,
writing a drawings going like,

5382
03:59:10,611 --> 03:59:11,450
wow,
yeah,

5383
03:59:11,480 --> 03:59:12,313
I mean,
how many of those people were even 

5384
03:59:12,591 --> 03:59:15,020
writing things down?
How many of those people could even read

5385
03:59:15,021 --> 03:59:15,854
back then?
How many of those people actually saw 

5386
03:59:16,701 --> 03:59:18,410
that was probably passed down like I was
in this village.

5387
03:59:18,790 --> 03:59:20,540
People on sticks and like,
I'm going to draw that.

5388
03:59:20,740 --> 03:59:22,880
Like what year was that,
Vlad?

5389
03:59:22,881 --> 03:59:26,860
The impaler 14.
Forty eight to 14.

5390
03:59:26,910 --> 03:59:28,460
Seventy six.
Somewhere in there.

5391
03:59:28,490 --> 03:59:30,820
Good luck.
1,400.

5392
03:59:30,830 --> 03:59:31,663
Good luck.
Good luck saying exactly what that guy 

5393
03:59:33,411 --> 03:59:35,450
said.
Exactly what that guy did.

5394
03:59:35,480 --> 03:59:36,313
Good luck.
We can't even decide how many illegal 

5395
03:59:37,731 --> 03:59:41,850
voters are.
Darling Donald Trump to calculate.

5396
03:59:42,710 --> 03:59:43,240
Yeah.

5397
03:59:43,240 --> 03:59:45,800
I think my biggest takeaway from the day
of the little people.

5398
03:59:46,040 --> 03:59:46,731
Yeah,
it was weird,

5399
03:59:46,731 --> 03:59:47,451
right?
That's.

5400
03:59:47,451 --> 03:59:48,410
I had no idea.
I mean,

5401
03:59:48,411 --> 03:59:50,450
I know there've been like,
like,

5402
03:59:50,451 --> 03:59:51,284
uh,
well I thought there were pygmies and 

5403
03:59:52,341 --> 03:59:53,570
stuff like that,
but that's like,

5404
03:59:53,960 --> 03:59:56,690
that's,
that's a totally different species of.

5405
03:59:56,720 --> 03:59:58,370
Yeah.
Smaller brands,

5406
03:59:58,580 --> 04:00:02,260
smaller chimps size brands.
So it's not a homeless.

5407
04:00:02,590 --> 04:00:05,780
Florian Florian,
I think it's called the some better.

5408
04:00:05,850 --> 04:00:06,683
A few better images of them where they 
recreated what they think it looked 

5409
04:00:09,310 --> 04:00:10,143
like.
Some of these pictures literally looks 

5410
04:00:11,781 --> 04:00:16,220
like an innocent version of what they 
would show you as a troll in storybooks.

5411
04:00:16,221 --> 04:00:18,980
And look at that one right there.
The one that you just passed,

5412
04:00:18,990 --> 04:00:20,250
Jamie,
with the top

5413
04:00:20,250 --> 04:00:22,350
row with a spear and the animal and the 
shoulder.

5414
04:00:22,550 --> 04:00:23,510
Look at that.
Have you?

5415
04:00:23,520 --> 04:00:26,010
I think if you go full image as a full 
image to see over there,

5416
04:00:26,310 --> 04:00:27,750
you can see what it looked like.
Yeah.

5417
04:00:27,900 --> 04:00:29,750
See that's what they believe.
These things look like.

5418
04:00:30,000 --> 04:00:34,440
Like sort of semi chimp,
like humans that were three feet tall,

5419
04:00:34,620 --> 04:00:37,180
but they had tools.
What do you think the discussion was and

5420
04:00:37,181 --> 04:00:38,250
like,
do we give him a dick?

5421
04:00:38,520 --> 04:00:39,560
Like yeah,
everything's got.

5422
04:00:39,950 --> 04:00:42,390
Not Everything but some things.
I didn't put a dick on it.

5423
04:00:42,391 --> 04:00:43,224
He's like,
come on.

5424
04:00:43,330 --> 04:00:44,940
No.
Was dragged from everything else.

5425
04:00:44,970 --> 04:00:48,360
Is Dixon the shadow?
They're like sort of Dick on,

5426
04:00:48,390 --> 04:00:51,240
but don't make it look too big.
His Dick is wrapped up in a riddle.

5427
04:00:53,590 --> 04:00:56,850
Is a mystery wrapped up in an riddle 
inside into the Nigga.

5428
04:00:57,420 --> 04:00:58,860
Dude,
I got to end this.

5429
04:00:59,280 --> 04:01:00,260
I gotta go.
I got here.

5430
04:01:00,270 --> 04:01:03,700
Yeah.
I think we did things with you like a,

5431
04:01:03,701 --> 04:01:06,330
a like a springsteen concert.
Let's see who drops.

5432
04:01:06,331 --> 04:01:09,710
First thing I think today I have too 
many things.

5433
04:01:09,711 --> 04:01:11,490
I have three sets tonight.
What do you mean?

5434
04:01:11,491 --> 04:01:13,260
What are you doing with resets at the 
comedy store?

5435
04:01:13,800 --> 04:01:14,611
Oh really?
Shit.

5436
04:01:14,611 --> 04:01:15,000
I got.
Yeah,

5437
04:01:15,000 --> 04:01:17,670
there's a belly room show,
a main room show and an our show.

5438
04:01:18,990 --> 04:01:21,000
Your best one starts in an hour.
Go.

5439
04:01:21,001 --> 04:01:22,770
I got shit.
I got to do my friend.

5440
04:01:22,850 --> 04:01:24,420
This was really fun.
This is awesome.

5441
04:01:24,980 --> 04:01:26,610
Again,
sooner rather than waiting.

5442
04:01:26,680 --> 04:01:30,270
Fucking short brother.
Always a pleasure,

5443
04:01:30,271 --> 04:01:31,300
man.
You mind?

5444
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:32,513
We have these fun conversations,
but I think we spend so much time 

5445
04:01:34,861 --> 04:01:38,220
complimenting each other because we like
it because we just need to wait.

5446
04:01:39,870 --> 04:01:41,580
We can go deep on other things,
not each other.

5447
04:01:41,610 --> 04:01:43,230
Yeah,
because if we compliment each other like

5448
04:01:43,290 --> 04:01:46,410
every time people would be like,
these guys are super gay for each other.

5449
04:01:46,470 --> 04:01:47,303
Yeah.
It's like every four years it's not 

5450
04:01:49,891 --> 04:01:52,530
close enough for people to make the 
assumption that is our third.

5451
04:01:52,710 --> 04:01:54,240
I think so.
I think I did one with you.

5452
04:01:54,241 --> 04:01:57,690
I did one with at our house and I think 
one of them our house first.

5453
04:01:57,691 --> 04:01:59,520
Then with you and then this is the 
third.

5454
04:02:00,360 --> 04:02:01,290
No,
this is the fourth.

5455
04:02:01,320 --> 04:02:02,153
Then was the other thing,
I feel like I've done your house twice 

5456
04:02:04,530 --> 04:02:05,071
then.
Okay.

5457
04:02:05,071 --> 04:02:06,930
Then you did the first time you did with
me and the wife.

5458
04:02:06,990 --> 04:02:10,340
Then maybe you can did one solo with me 
and then we did one solo.

5459
04:02:10,380 --> 04:02:11,213
The last time we did one,
you showed me that cool treadmill type 

5460
04:02:13,741 --> 04:02:16,920
desk thing you had to standing standing 
desk and I was like,

5461
04:02:16,950 --> 04:02:18,120
oh,
that's genius.

5462
04:02:18,120 --> 04:02:20,940
You have to walk and type at the same 
class and they're working.

5463
04:02:21,120 --> 04:02:22,760
That's a fucking,
that's a sweet movie.

5464
04:02:23,230 --> 04:02:25,530
Like a year and a half.
I think I used that.

5465
04:02:25,640 --> 04:02:30,640
Eventually the treads started slipping,
so I'd be walking and uh,

5466
04:02:31,280 --> 04:02:32,113
one time I hit my chin up desk and the 
desk was down here so I had to go like 

5467
04:02:35,970 --> 04:02:37,140
this far and I was like,
you know what,

5468
04:02:37,250 --> 04:02:38,083
sue those pitches.
Maybe we were meant to stand at a desk 

5469
04:02:40,230 --> 04:02:42,480
or walk,
but never at the same time.

5470
04:02:42,720 --> 04:02:43,860
Don't quit.
Now.

5471
04:02:44,510 --> 04:02:46,530
Back on that motherfucker.
I say wrap it up,

5472
04:02:46,800 --> 04:02:49,320
put it on an angle.
So you have to hike,

5473
04:02:49,330 --> 04:02:52,950
like you're hiking through the extreme.
I'm lucky to walk up school.

5474
04:02:52,960 --> 04:02:57,420
The English running shoes on shoes 
running and heels and shit,

5475
04:02:57,780 --> 04:02:59,550
man.
All I need is a hat with a buckle on.

5476
04:02:59,590 --> 04:03:02,400
It looked like a fucking pilgrim.
Thank you,

5477
04:03:02,401 --> 04:03:04,310
sir.
Thanks for having me.

5478
04:03:04,380 --> 04:03:05,470
Really,
really appreciate it.

5479
04:03:05,850 --> 04:03:08,430
So much fun.
We keep saying this,

5480
04:03:08,431 --> 04:03:10,840
but let's try to do these regularly.
I try to do these right there.

5481
04:03:10,890 --> 04:03:11,850
So much fun.
I agree.

5482
04:03:12,720 --> 04:03:13,670
Kevin Smith.
Leave.
