00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,360
When do we get a lot of shit happened
on that fuck on that last wild boys trip

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:07,571
man,

4
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:08,590
there was a that we always,

5
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,240
we had this practice of like,

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,673
um,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,940
for the sensors,

8
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:13,141
you know,

9
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,040
like it's called standards and practices.

10
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,850
There'll be like,

11
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,151
you know,

12
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,040
they'll give back notes,

13
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,860
like you can't,

14
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,280
you know,

15
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,180
show this.

16
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,460
And so we would film what
we call red herrings.

17
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,950
Like we just blatantly ridiculous
shit is never liked it.

18
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,210
Never going to be allowed on TV.

19
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,171
But then we'll be like,

20
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:26,561
okay,

21
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:30,280
well we'll cut this out and so then
we'll be able to keep some other shit.

22
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,490
So we would always go out of my way
to fill in this fucked up stuff.

23
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:33,741
And,

24
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:34,600
and Russia,

25
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,561
we,

26
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,394
um,

27
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,320
me and one of the guys from the,

28
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,010
from the crew would put like
put on these animal suits.

29
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,400
The,

30
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,820
um,

31
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,780
what was it at the time,

32
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:48,460
it wasn't panda bears with polar bears
with a big fucking like mascot head.

33
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
We fucking hired two hookers and had
full on fucking hookers came in like full

34
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,580
porno.

35
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,580
We felt full fucking porn and we included
to be included that in the episode,

36
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,440
you know,

37
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,710
I had the notes came back
from standards and practices.

38
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:06,850
I can really please,

39
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,250
I got that you have to take out the,

40
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:09,641
you know,

41
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,260
the Cock cocksucker yeah.

42
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:16,261
The polar bear getting his dick
sucked the whole thing and yeah.

43
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,090
And,

44
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,881
and there was,

45
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,440
there was a little bit of fucking
hooker action in that one,

46
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:20,861
you know,

47
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,110
and I'm not necessarily
that stoked about it,

48
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:23,381
but,

49
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:23,980
um,

50
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,671
there was a,

51
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,211
we went to,

52
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,340
we went to like a,

53
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,390
a whorehouse brought this,

54
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:28,820
um,

55
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,430
hook her back to the hotel.

56
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,010
Right.

57
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,990
He's there like a whole thing.

58
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,951
And then in,

59
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:33,281
in,

60
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:33,840
in the,

61
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,850
and I don't think I ever could,

62
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,240
you didn't have sex with a,

63
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,270
with a hooker without like snuggling
after I want to like Snot a snuggle and

64
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,420
shutting it down.

65
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,680
I got in and to stay with me,

66
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:45,251
I want to like,

67
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:45,580
you know,

68
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,510
cuddle and stuff.

69
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,920
And in the morning,

70
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:48,250
this,

71
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,001
this hooker,

72
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:49,834
um,

73
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,180
she just tells me like,

74
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,670
how much,

75
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,630
how much I owe her,

76
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,441
and I'm like,

77
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,730
that's fucking outrageous.

78
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:55,690
There's no fucking way.

79
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:55,931
I was,

80
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:56,141
I had,

81
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:56,561
so I was like,

82
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,280
basically,

83
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,930
I don't care if you're a fucking pimp,

84
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,210
wants to kick my ass and fucking kill me.

85
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:04,340
I'm not paying that fucking much much.

86
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,140
I for,

87
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,670
I forget it was so long ago,

88
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,923
but uh,

89
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,071
but yeah,

90
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:09,940
I was outraged.

91
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,410
I was,

92
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,940
was how she did it just,

93
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
it just wasn't in that case.

94
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,110
I exactly.

95
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,480
I remember clearly I was like,

96
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:16,710
you,

97
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,890
you want that mentioned I said,

98
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,430
I said,

99
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,610
I'll give you this much and
that's how much he get period.

100
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,690
And we,

101
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:22,930
we,

102
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,261
we,

103
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:23,981
we came out,

104
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:24,250
right?

105
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,083
They got,

106
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,300
you know,

107
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,100
I got to go film and a
walking through the lobby,

108
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,110
Knoxville is down there having breakfast.

109
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,290
This hooker comes walking
by Knoxville and she says,

110
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,690
that's not steevo that's achievable

111
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,450
when

112
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,990
you're faced with a bunch of different
alternative theories that are coming in

113
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,480
and it's not,

114
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,220
it's like take,

115
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,911
take physics.

116
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:49,151
I mean,

117
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:51,310
every physicist like you
just had Lawrence Krauss,

118
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,860
he gets these letters
daily of people saying,

119
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,390
I think I figured out why Einstein was
wrong and he can't address them all.

120
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,160
And they're smart people.

121
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,060
They're thoughtful people.

122
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,020
They really believe it.

123
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,460
What do you do with that?

124
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,463
That's my point.

125
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,730
I feel that's not my problem.

126
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,100
And if there are alternative,

127
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,520
the other alternative theories,

128
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,660
that's not my problem either.

129
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,970
It's the problem for the mainstream
to sort it out and figure which to pay

130
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:13,804
attention to and which,

131
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,693
right.

132
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,071
Well,

133
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm suspicious of this,

134
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,410
the whole idea of the mainstream,

135
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,710
because even looking in the mainstream,

136
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,030
you find so many divergent
points of view that I,

137
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,470
you know,

138
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,130
I think that's basically a fiction
that there is this mainstream that has

139
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:32,110
arrived at this consensus and that there
are no alternative ulterior motives

140
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,530
there.

141
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,363
Um,

142
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,490
and that there are no dogmas
that are being perpetuated there.

143
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,701
You know,

144
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,001
I mean,

145
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,730
I look at the lot of the
geological stuff and,

146
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:46,970
and realize that there are many different
points of view when we talk about the,

147
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,300
these floods at the end
of the last ice age.

148
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,010
There are many divergent points of view.

149
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,370
There is what could be considered the
mainstream yet even that has multiple

150
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,420
interpretations.

151
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,850
And the same with this,

152
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,150
the comment idea.

153
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,990
Um,

154
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,231
you know,

155
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:02,501
I mean,

156
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,830
I don't know what constitutes
the mainstream Nair because
there had been a group

157
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,480
that has opposed it at every turn,

158
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,470
but at the same time,

159
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,310
the group that accepts the comment
hypothesis has continued to grow.

160
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:12,641
In fact,

161
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,560
there's even a number of,

162
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,130
of individuals involved that
set out specifically to,

163
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,060
to disprove it or discredit it,

164
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,680
who are now basically on board.

165
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:25,420
And it has grown from being a small
handful of scientists that are now 63

166
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:30,421
scientists from 55 different institutions
that are on board with the idea that

167
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:34,090
something remarkable happened
at the end of the last ice age.

168
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,720
It was probably exogenic
meaning something from outside,

169
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,853
um,

170
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,060
something from space.

171
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,290
There's no consensus as
to exactly what that was,

172
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,070
which would be normal because the,

173
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,790
these discoveries are in
their infancy at this point.

174
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,140
But there has been an attempt to discredit
the idea simply because that as the

175
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,540
evidence has come in over the last decade,

176
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,010
it has evolved in,

177
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:58,870
in new mysteries had been opened up.

178
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,441
Uh,

179
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,380
as the evidence comes in
and the claim is being made,

180
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:02,591
well,

181
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,580
there's no consistent,

182
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,140
um,

183
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,830
interpretation of this evidence
and therefore we've debunked it.

184
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,371
Yeah,

185
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:12,520
that's a really important
lesson for parenthood.

186
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,860
Like you can't just tell kids what to do,

187
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,451
you know,

188
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:16,151
like you just do it.

189
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:16,931
Cause I told you to do it.

190
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:17,171
They're like,

191
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:17,621
fuck you,

192
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,454
I'm going to be a hooker.

193
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,490
That's in that,

194
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,340
and that applies not only
to kids and you're 100%,

195
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,280
it applies to kids,

196
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,540
but it applies to adults as well.

197
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,690
And that is people need to understand
why they're doing what they're doing.

198
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,391
And you know,

199
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:32,720
if I want you to go take down some
building and capture some bad guy,

200
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,411
I don't go,

201
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:33,740
hey,

202
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,370
hey Joe,

203
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,590
I want you to go take down this
building once you pack captures bad guy,

204
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:37,880
these are the guys I want
you to take with you.

205
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,170
Here's the route I want you to take in.

206
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,970
Here's the methodology I want
you to use for the clearance.

207
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,040
Because then when I send
you to go do that mission,

208
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,300
it's not your mission.

209
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,290
It's my mission.

210
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,910
I came up with a plan you didn't.

211
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,923
So you might be,

212
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,300
you might have thought there was a
better way to do it or you might had a

213
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,680
different idea of how to get it done.

214
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,590
And now when you go out there and
you meet some kind of resistance,

215
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,440
whether it's an obstacle you didn't
expect or whether it's some scenario you

216
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,310
didn't foresee,

217
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,020
instead of you're trying to overcome it,

218
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,690
you just blame me.

219
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,290
You just looked mad jack who came up
with this stupid plan and here we are.

220
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,040
It's failing.

221
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,551
Forget it.

222
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,151
We're going back.

223
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,230
We're not going to carry out the mission.

224
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,610
Whereas if I said,

225
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,480
hey Joe,

226
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,010
here's what I want you to do,

227
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,780
go figure out the best way to do it.

228
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,620
And now you come up with a plan and now
you make up all the methodologies of how

229
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:17,660
you're going to get it done and you
decide who you're going to take with you.

230
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,190
Now what's your plan?

231
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,010
You own that plant and when you go
out in the field and you meet a little

232
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,730
resistance,

233
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,420
guess what you do?

234
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,690
You say,

235
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,590
I'm going to find a way around it.

236
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,490
I'm going to overcome this.

237
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,540
I'm gonna overcome that obstacle.

238
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,374
I'm gonna make it happen.

239
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,120
And that's another piece of leadership.

240
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,590
And it's the exact same thing with kids.

241
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,760
If you tell your kid,

242
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,330
you know,

243
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,040
you will get good grades in school,

244
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,780
that means nothing to them.

245
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,400
But if you explain to them,

246
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,910
Hey,

247
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,790
I would love for you to get good
grades and here's why it's gonna open

248
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,080
opportunities for you in the future.

249
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,290
It's going to allow you to be able to
outsmart people cause you're gonna have

250
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,280
more knowledge than them.

251
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,560
And then you're gonna be able
to end up making more money,

252
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,390
which is actually gonna give you
more freedom in the long run.

253
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,130
Instead of doing a job
that you don't want to do.

254
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,200
If you explain all those things to a kid,

255
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,000
it's going to be a lot
more successful than just,

256
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,510
dude,

257
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,550
I told you get good
grades because I said so.

258
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,240
Now when you do these conferences
where when you speak it at,

259
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:02,540
uh,

260
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,490
businesses and they bring you in
to sort of have these leadership,

261
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,110
uh,

262
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,610
media,

263
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,443
what would you call them?

264
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:09,650
Yeah,

265
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,850
their leadership seminars.

266
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,481
Seminars.

267
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:11,870
Yeah.

268
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,460
Now when you have these seminars or these,

269
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:13,790
uh,

270
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,700
some of the principles that you
discuss when you talk about absolutely.

271
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,060
Yeah,

272
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,640
absolutely.

273
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,530
Because that's another,

274
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:23,120
another big piece of this is that all
this ideas about interacting with human

275
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,451
beings,

276
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,590
they just don't change.

277
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,150
Like there's a little variance,

278
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,700
but whether you're dealing with kids or
whether you're dealing with adults and

279
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:29,870
whether you're dealing
with business people,

280
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,730
whether you're dealing with
soldiers on the battlefield,

281
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,680
the leadership principles,

282
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,910
they don't change.

283
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,710
And therefore you can,

284
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,860
whether you're trying to get people to
go out and capture and kill a bad guy,

285
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:44,540
or whether you're trying to get them
to build some product and sell it,

286
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,520
the principal's leadership don't change.

287
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,570
Do,

288
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,390
you're still trying to get a bunch
of totally independent people.

289
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:50,750
Right.

290
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,420
And that's one of the myths we have to
overcome a lot because everyone thinks,

291
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:53,530
oh,

292
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,040
in the military wounds just like a robot.

293
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,120
And that's just not true.

294
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,220
Everybody in the military is free.

295
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,060
There are people,

296
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,571
they're people,

297
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:00,530
they're free thinking people,

298
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:01,670
and they're gonna come
up with their own ideas.

299
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:02,720
They're going to have
with their own agendas,

300
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,870
and they're going to think of ways to do
things that they think are better than

301
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:06,290
yours.

302
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,150
So you can have all these
independent free thinkers,

303
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:12,230
and you've got to get them on board
with the same plan to you to go out and

304
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,010
execute.

305
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,080
And so it doesn't matter if you're
on the battlefield or in business.

306
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:15,800
That's what,

307
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,820
that's what you're trying to get done.

308
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,230
And the leadership
principles don't change.

309
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,100
Okay.
